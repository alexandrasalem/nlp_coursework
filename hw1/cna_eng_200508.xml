    <TEXT>New York Times:
Iraqis Promising a Constitution by the Deadline

Under intense American pressure, Iraqi
leaders agreed Sunday to finish writing Iraqi
country's constitution by the middle of August,
raising the possibility that they will leave
unresolved some of the fiercest disagreements
over the future of the Iraqi state. Among the
most divisive issues are the rights of women,
the role of Islam and the scope and reach of
Kurdish self-rule. Keeping the political process
on track is central to the Bush administration's
desire to begin drawing down the number of
American troops here by early spring. If the
political process continues apace, a new
government would be elected to a full term,
under the new constitution, in December.

Wall Street Journal: Rupert Murdoch's Third
Wife Seeks Stake for New Kids, Upsetting Adult

The marriage between News Corp. Chairman
Rupert Murdoch and his third wife, Wendi
Deng, in 1999, has opened a rift between
Murdoch and his older children, one that throws
into doubt who will control the company after
the media titan's death. One of the key debates:
Who should inherit the family's US$6 billion
fortune and Murdoch's control of News Corp.
Should it be just the media titan's adult
children, as is now the arrangement, or also his
two youngest children by Deng?</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>'PAN-BLUE ALLIANCE' TO PUSH FOR NCC LEGISLATION IN SEPTEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 1 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of the nation's two
major opposition parties said Monday that they will push for a vote
on a bill about the establishment of the National Communications
Commission (NCC) when the Legislative Yuan begins a new session on
September 13.</P>
      <P>Caucus officials of the Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party
(PFP) called on the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to show
some goodwill and not filibuster the bill again.</P>
      <P>The two parties reached the consensus when KMT Central Policy
Committee Executive Director Tseng Yung-chuan called on the PFP
caucus.</P>
      <P>The DPP caucus, however, called on the "pan-blue alliance" of the
KMT and the PFP not to insist on their "unreasonable" demand that the
NCC be made up in proportion with the political party seats in the
legislature. That would simply hurt the independence of the NCC, said
caucus Secretary-General William C.T. Lai.</P>
      <P>The KMT, the largest opposition party, has also attached a caveat
to the passage of the NCC organic bill in an attempt to preserve the
party's assets at Broadcasting Corp. of China (BCC) , according to
Lai.</P>
      <P>Most of BCC's 60-odd radio channels are no longer in use, but the
KMT wants to keep them for itself, instead of releasing them for the
government to redistribute for better public service, he said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , a minority party in the same
"pan-green" camp as the DPP, also wants to see the NCC bill become a
law as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>But according to TSU caucus convener Ho Min-hao, the party was
also concerned that the KMT's proportional representation demand
would create an "unobjective" National Communications Commission.</P>
      <P>The DPP's Lai said if the KMT remains adamant in its unreasonable
demand, people can expect a fierce battle on the legislature floor
when the NCC bill gets a vote showdown in September.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the NCC has long been a campaign promise of
President Chen Shui-bian, who wants the country to have a vibrant and
independent media industry, Lai said.</P>
      <P>The latest push for the NCC bill was triggered by the Government
Information Office's (GIO) decision Sunday to not renew business
licenses for seven TV channels, including an all-news channel owned
by Eastern Multimedia Group.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Lee Yung-ping said she, like the majority of the
people, was upset about the media's unprofessional and unethical
reportage, but it should not be the GIO, which is controlled by the
ruling party, that has the mandate to regulate media operations.</P>
      <P>"If political force is to intervene again in how the media should
work, we'll be returning to the days of 'white terror, '" said Lee,
referring to the KMT's authoritarian rule before losing power in
2000.</P>
      <P>She said the current ruling party, the DPP, is being hypocritical
when it claims it wants to reform the media but at the same time
boycotts the legislation of the NCC bill.</P>
      <P>Now the DPP has gone even further by scaring the media with the
renewal of licenses as many of them have voluntarily invited
government officials to talk about policies free of charge, or even
carry the so-called "placement ads" in delicate cooperation with the
government, she said.</P>
      <P>The birth of the NCC would strip the GIO of many of its current
powers over the media. So PFP's caucus deputy convener Sun Ta-chien
asked the people to watch who will be stopping the bill from being
passed in the legislature when his party cooperates with the KMT in
pushing for a vote.</P>
      <P>The TSU's Ho called on the ruling and opposition parties to
"negotiate in good faith" and not continue struggling so the NCC can
be set up in the best possible shape.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian received Indiana
Governor Mitch Daniels Monday at the Presidential Office, saying that
he hopes trade and economic ties between the two sides can be
strengthened.</P>
      <P>Thanking Daniels for making his first visit to Taiwan since his
assumption of office as the governor of Indiana late last year and
the state's long-term support for Taiwan, Chen said that it is a
clear indication that Daniels attaches a high degree of importance to
Taiwan and added that he felt deeply honored.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Indiana forged sisterhood ties 26 years ago and it was
the first U. S. state to do so and the first to open a representative
office in Taiwan, Chen said, pointing out that its imports to Taiwan
totaled about US$100 million last year, making Taiwan the
19th-largest export market of the southern U. S. state.</P>
      <P>The president expressed his hope that two-way trade and business
would be further stepped up following Daniels' visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For his part, Daniels praised Taiwan's democratic, trade and
hi-tech development and called President Chen's achievements a
prominent hallmark not only to Taiwan but also to the rest of the
world.</P>
      <P>Daniels, the first Indiana governor to visit Taiwan, extended his
invitation to Taiwan businessmen to visit his state and promised to
further solidify bilateral friendships and relations.</P>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan Taipei Office Director Douglas Paal,
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael Ying-mau Kao and Vice
Secretary-General to the President James Huang were also present
during the meeting, along with a group of Indian lawmakers that
accompanied Daniels on the current visit to Taiwan -- one of the
stops of its Asian tour.</P>
      <P>The Indiana state legislature approved resolutions in April this
year supporting Taiwan in its efforts to join the United Nations and

    <HEADLINE>KMT TO ACCEPT EXTRA LEGISLATIVE SESSION CONDITIONALLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
legislative caucus said Monday that the party will reluctantly accept
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) proposal to convene a
special legislative session as long as it only reviews a special
statute on an eight-year, NT$80 billion (US$2.539 billion)
flood-control project.</P>
      <P>In response, Premier Frank Hsieh said it is up to the Legislative
Yuan to decide which bills to review in the extra session, although
he said other bills such as the arms procurement package proposal are
also important.</P>
      <P>If the legislature can pass certain key bills earlier rather than
later, the people's burden will be lessened, the premier added.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, a KMT legislator and director of the KMT's
Policy Committee, said that convening a special session is a serious
matter at the constitutional level, but the DPP has convened five
special sessions in its five years of rule.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to make holding a special session a common practice,
Tseng said.</P>
      <P>As flood control concerns the public, the party is willing to
accept the proposal to hold a special session, albeit reluctantly.
The next regular session will be opened earlier than scheduled, and
other issues can be discussed at that time, he said.</P>
      <P>He criticized the Executive Yuan's version of the flood-control
proposal for being rashly prepared and looking suspiciously like a
pork-barrel policy, and he questioned whether it will effectively
control flooding as claimed by the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The KMT has invited experts and scholars to discuss the matter
and will come up with its own version of a flood-control bill, he
said, although it has yet to decide whether to finance the project in
special or annual budgets.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus said it welcomed the KMT to come up
with its own version of a flood-control bill.</P>
      <P>But William Lai, a DPP whip in the legislature, said that the
KMT's criticism that it is roughly prepared and could be a
pork-barrel policy only shows that the party doesn't know much about
the DPP's flood-control project.</P>
      <P>The DPP appreciates the KMT's response even though it is only
narrowly focused on the flood-control project, Lai said, adding that
five other major bills urgently need to be passed, and there is no
reason to review only one bill in the extra session, he added.</P>
      <P>In addition to the flood-control project, the five other
prioritized bills the DPP proposed are the confirmation of Control
Yuan members, a NT$480 billion arms procurement package from the
United States, proposed amendments to the Executive Yuan Organic Law,
proposed amendments to the tobacco and liquor tax law, and a draft
bill concerning the establishment of a labor pension fund monitoring
committee.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Sun Ta-chien of the People First Party
(PFP) , an ally of the KMT, said that the PFP legislative caucus is
adamant in its opposition to holding a special session.</P>
      <P>Sun said that the DPP has proposed lumping together six bills in
the extra session, and the PFP caucus couldn't possibly accept this.
However, even if the extra session only reviews the flood-control
project, the PFP is against holding the session.</P>
      <P>He also said that Tseng told the PFP legislative caucus that the
KMT will propose its own flood-control bill, and it will be reviewed
along with the Cabinet's bill in the next legislative session. The
KMT will also communicate with the PFP caucus on the content of the
KMT- sponsored bill, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGES MEDIA TO PRACTICE SELF-DISCIPLINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP's) legislative caucus accused the media Monday of committing
"nine great sins" including violating human rights and fabricating
news, and urged media workers to reflect on themselves and to
practice self-discipline.</P>
      <P>William C.T. Lai, secretary-general of the DPP caucus, defended a
Government Information Office (GIO) decision to revoke the business
licenses of seven TV channels, including an all-news channel owned by
the Eastern Multimedia Group.</P>
      <P>He said TV channels are public assets and that if they are not
run in the interests of the people but in such a way that they
contradict the original purposes of their establishment, the GIO has
a duty to correct them.</P>
      <P>The "great sins" that he claimed the media, particularly the
electronic media, have committed include too much sex and violence,
too many "mock shows, " low-quality live broadcasts, interviewing
abused or other unfortunate children, and abusing "scoop news."</P>
      <P>He also accused the media of making news reports as if they are
producing variety shows and of packaging advertisements in their news
stories.</P>
      <P>One after another legislator from across the political spectrum
has demanded that the government do something to stop the media from
producing such poor quality news programs, Lai pointed out.</P>
      <P>Now that the GIO has finally made a bold move by revoking the
seven licenses, it should be praised, he said. However, he went on,
some opposition lawmakers have done the opposite by denouncing the
GIO.</P>
      <P>He said his caucus would be more gratified if the GIO had
withdrawn even more licenses for all-news channels.</P>
      <P>As to the justification for stopping the Eastern Multimedia
Group's S Channel from continuing to operate, Lai said it was a
decision by a group of experts that of course can be commented on.</P>
      <P>If the TV channel does not think it was a fair decision, it can
appeal through the proper channels but should not send reporters to
protest at the GIO, Lai said.</P>
      <P>Many people have reacted angrily to the terribly poor quality of
the TV news, the tawdry sensationalism and the often factually
incorrect reporting, and "quite a number" of news programs are
watched by less than 1 percent of the viewing public, he said, adding
that in the face of solid evidence, the media should not shirk its
responsibilities.</P>

over the inauguration ceremony for National Penghu University -- the
first university located on an outlying island.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his hope that the university will merge with local
districts, expanding into a big university town dedicated to the
development of local culture and the economy.</P>
      <P>Noting that the creation of the university was a promise he made
during his visit to the outlying island off the southwestern coast of
Taiwan in February last year, Chen said he is glad to see his wish
fulfilled and he believes everyone feels happy with the facility.</P>
      <P>The president said Penghu suffers from population drain due to
its lack of good employment opportunities because of limited natural
conditions.</P>
      <P>Every family on Penghu has to pay at least NT$100,000 (US$3,100)
a year on average for one person to receive an advanced education on
the mainland island of Taiwan. With the opening of the new
university, not only can residents save money, people will be needed
on the island to work at the university, and could even attract
people to work in Penghu, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president also said that with an aquacultural industrial
technological development and research center, he hopes the
university can help Penghu develop the aquacultural industry and
other relevant businesses such as recreational fishing and
biotechnology.</P>
      <P>Chen was accompanied by Premier Frank Hsieh to make the visit to

    <TEXT>
      <P>The goal of the second phase of
constitutional reforms will be to have the reforms passed by the
Legislative Yuan and by national referendum prior to 2008, the head
of the Constitutional Re-engineering Office said Monday.</P>
      <P> Lee Chun-yi made the remarks after the formal inauguration of
his office earlier in the day. </P>
      <P>A mission-oriented National Assembly passed a constitutional
reform package June 7, paving the way for the next phase of
constitutional reforms.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the most important part of President Chen
Shui-bian's announcement to promote the second phase of
constitutional reforms will be to expand people's participation.</P>
      <P>He noted that seven previous rounds of constitutional reform have
focused on political issues. Politicians and parties were involved in
the reforms but the general public had little say in them.</P>
      <P>The task ahead will be to expand the participation and to ask the
Taiwan people what kind of constitution they would like.</P>
      <P>It will also be necessary to promote the constitutional education
from the grassroots level, Lee said, adding that the government
should use easily understood language to give people easier access to
constitutional reform issues. He added that the office will train
seed teachers to publicize the issues islandwide.</P>
      <P>The president feels that constitutional reform should not be
top-down and that the people have to learn that such reform is

    <HEADLINE>DPP WILL NOT BLOCK FRUIT EXPORTS TO CHINA: DPP LEGISLATIVE WHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.  1 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will not prevent Taiwan farmers from taking advantage of the
tariff-free treatment granted by Beijing by selling their fruit to
China, DPP Legislative Yuan caucus Secretary-General William C.T. Lai
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Answering questions at a press conference, Lai said the
government has an obligation to provide farmers with adequate
information so that they can make their own judgment on what is
beneficial to them.</P>
      <P>However, he warned the farmers not to look at only the short-term
benefits, claiming that they could suffer "great losses" in the
future.</P>
      <P>At a separate press conference, Tseng Yung-chuan, a legislator of
the opposition Kuomintang and executive director of the party's
Central Committee, urged the government to put aside political
considerations and begin making all necessary preparations to help
fruit farmers develop the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>He denied news reports that the KMT is planning to set up a
Cross-Taiwan Strait Agricultural Cooperation and Development Fund to
handle Taiwan's fruit exports to China, describing the reports as
untrue and saying the KMT "deeply deplores" the reports.</P>
      <P>China's tariff-free treatment, which became effective Monday, was
offered to Lien Chan, chairman of the opposition Kuomintang, as a
sweetener during his visit to China in late April and early May. The
new measure covers 15 fruit categories: bell fruit, betel nuts,
coconuts, custard apples, dates, guavas, loquats, mangoes, papayas,
peaches, persimmons, pineapples, plums, pomelos and star fruit.</P>
      <P>While the government insists that Taiwan's foreign trade arm, the
Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), handle all
matters relating to fruit exports to China, the Chinese customs
authorities unilaterally announced a list of the first group of
Taiwan civic organizations whose certificates of origin for exported
fruit it will recognize.</P>
      <P>The government fears that Beijing is using the tariff-free
treatment for Taiwan-grown fruit as a "united front tactic" to make
the government of Taiwan look like a local government of China.
Beijing, however, has remained uninterested in acknowledging Taipei's
authorization of TAITRA to handle the issue.</P>
      <P>Figures released by the Council of Agriculture show that in 2004,
Taiwan exported US$3.55 billion-worth of farm produce, including
US$33 million-worth of fruit. Japan was Taiwan's largest market,
accounting for 42 percent of Taiwan fruit exports, followed by the
United States with 22 percent. China accounted for only 1 percent of
Taiwan's export market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA SAID USING FRUIT EXPORT ISSUE AS GAMBIT TO SWAY TAIWAN VOTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China has been seeking to use the fruit
export issue to launch a media war in Taiwan and win sympathy for the
pro-unification "pan blue alliance" in December's local elections,
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) sources claimed Monday.</P>
      <P>While trying to use the issue to divide Taiwan and lure away DPP
supporters in southern Taiwan, China is also attempting to cripple
the government and downgrade Taiwan's status by shunning the
government appointed Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) in bilateral farm talks, the sources said, predicting that
China will use similar gambits in future if it succeeds in
influencing the elections.</P>
      <P>Issues centering on Taiwan's duty-free fruit exports to China --
one of the overtures offered by China during visits by main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party
(PFP) Chairman James Soong in late April and early May -- have become
a hot topic for debate in recent months, they said.</P>
      <P>As agricultural produce from Taiwan is much more expensive in
China than local goods, President Chen Shui-bian is well aware that
China's zero-tariff treatment is "by no means an economic matter but
rather a politically charged issue, " presidential aides said.</P>
      <P>Chen has outlined what he called his "one principle, three
arrangements" to underscore the government's stance regarding the
issue, the aides said, expressing worry that the government will fail
to convince Taiwan farmers as they are much more mindful of their own
interests than the cross-Taiwan Strait political strife.</P>
      <P>Many city mayors and county magistrates affiliated to the DPP in
southern Taiwan have said that they fear that the issue, if further
fanned by the opposition, will slash the DPP's chances in the
year-end city mayor and county chief elections, they said.</P>
      <P>The "one principle" refers to Taiwan's positioning of China as
only one segment of the global market for Taiwan farm exports, while
the "three arrangements" refers to TAITRA's designation as the sole
commissioned body responsible for farm exports to China; a team of
Mainland Affairs Council and the Council of Agriculture officials set
up to open two-way talks; and "round-trip, non-stop" cargo services
by airlines based on the two sides, according to the aides.</P>
      <P>After Beijing passed the Anti-Secession Law against Taiwan in
mid-March, the farm export issue has become a lever for China to sway
Taiwan voters in favor of the "pan blue alliance" as the local
election approaches, a high-ranking DPP cadre said.</P>
      <P>China will be very likely to adopt the same approach if it gets
what it wants in the December's elections by playing the fruit export
card, DPP officials claimed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, China's announcement of its duty-free treatment for 15
items of Taiwan fruit took effect the same day without prior
negotiations with Taiwan authorities.</P>
      <P>Although some DPP legislators are concerned that the development
will cast a shadow over the party's performance in the upcoming
elections, some others are not so pessimistic.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Huang Wei-jeh contended that it will have a
limited impact on the party in the year-end elections or the 2008
presidential race unless the fruit overproduction problem gets worse
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Lin Tai-hua said that it remains to be seen whether
Taiwan farmers will profit from the Chinese market because sales
remain unknown and transportation costs are still expensive owing to
a lack of direct links across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Citing government statistics, she said that the Japanese market
absorbs around 40 percent of Taiwan agricultural exports, while the
Chinese market only accounts for just 1 percent.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Monday that if all
goes well, the outlying island county of Penghu may be opened for
direct point-to-point shipping services across the Taiwan Strait on
an experimental basis, starting in September at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks after attending the inaugural ceremony for
National Penghu University -- the county's first university.</P>
      <P>As the government has opened the two frontline islands of Kinmen
and Matsu for direct point-to-point shipping service with the
southeastern Chinese province of Fujian, some Penghu political
figures have been urging the government to open Penghu for similar
direct services with a selected Chinese port.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, if the Penghu county government comes up with
an application for such services, the application is very likely to
be approved.</P>
      <P>Taiwan still bans direct cross-strait transport links for
national security concerns, but Hsieh said the government can give a
green light to Penghu's application on an experimental basis, in line
with the formula adopted for opening direct Kinmen-Xiamen and
Matsu-Mawei shipping services.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said it would take one or two months for the government to
complete screening of such an application, so if all goes well, the
services could kick off in September at the earliest.</P>
      <P>After a period of experimental operations, Hsieh said, the
arrangements could be formalized as long as no flaws become apparent.</P>
      <P>Responding to Hsieh's remarks, Mainland Affairs Council Vice
Chairman Liu Teh-hsun said the government once allowed a group of
Penghua pilgrims to make a direct voyage to Xiamen to visit several
Chinese temples in 2002.</P>
      <P>Starting in September, Liu said the government may allow
Penghu residents with business interests in China to make
direct voyages to Xiamen from Penghu.</P>
      <P>As to some Penghu people's call for allowing the county to
serve as a cross-strait cargo transshipment entrepot, Liu said the
proposal is infeasible under the current regulations. In the future,
he said, the government may revise relevant regulations to allow
Penghu to be a transshipment point.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's duty-free privileges for 15
varieties of Taiwan fruit will have "limited" economic value, the
nation's top China policy charter claimed Monday.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), made
the remarks as China proclaimed Monday that 15 varieties of Taiwan
fruit, including pineapples, guavas and mangoes, can enter China
duty-free from that day. China also recognized place of origin
certification issued by the chambers of commerce of 11 cities and
counties, including Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Wu claimed that China's new measure will have little impact on

before the duty-free offer was in place, exported only
US$340,000-worth of fruit to China last year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of lawmakers of different political
stripes urged China Monday to release Wang Bingzhang, an imprisoned
pro-democracy activist who is reportedly in poor health, for
humanitarian reasons.</P>
      <P>The legislators made the appeal a day after Wang's son Wang
Daishi said his father's mental and physical health is very bad and
that he is worried about the possibility of his father committing
suicide.</P>
      <P>Wang was arrested in China in February 2002 and sentenced to life
imprisonment.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Cho-shui of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party said Wang's condition has caused widespread concern in the
Chinese community around the world. Even major international human
rights organizations have listed Wang's case as a major concern, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>From a humanitarian perspective, Lin said, China should release
Wang so that he can receive medical treatment. For China's own
international reputation and political development, Lin said, China
should not continue to imprison Wang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TV STATION LICENCE REVIEW PROCESS OPEN AND FAIR: GIO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Government Information Office (GIO)
claimed Monday that a TV station licence review carried out by a
group of well-respected experts was done in an open and fair manner.</P>
      <P>GIO chief Pasuya Yao, responding to accusations that the review
committee "worked behind the scenes," demanded that the accusers come
forward with evidence for their claims.</P>
      <P>The review committee decided late Sunday not to renew business
licenses for seven TV channels, including an all-news channel from
the Eastern Multimedia Group, triggering strong protests by the
channel's reporters.</P>
      <P>In a statement, Eastern Multimedia questioned the criteria based
on which the committee members concluded that the channel was not
worthy of a renewed six-year licence to operate.</P>
      <P>The media group also accused the GIO of violating the
administrative law by having not acted in accordance with due
procedure in handing down the "punishment" that totally disregards
the well-being of the channel's 1,000-odd employees.</P>
      <P>In response, Yao said the committee members took into account the
media group's long-term investment. Otherwise, they would have chosen
another of the group's all-news channels, which ranked No. 1 in terms
of disciplinary actions over the past six years, for withdrawal of
its business licence, he added.</P>
      <P>The committee said it hoped that Eastern Multimedia will put its
resources into the remaining news channel to improve its operations,
according to Yao.</P>
      <P>He also made public the name list of the review committee,
including Professor Kuan Chung-hsiang of Shih Hsin University,
Professor Lee Chung-hsi of Tung Hua University and Wu Chia-hui,
deputy director-general of the Directorate General of
Telecommunications under the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications. Only two members wanted their names withheld.</P>
      <P>Yao also said the whole review process was videotaped for the
record, which can be made public.</P>
      <P>In Penghu, Premier Frank Hsieh said the GIO carried out the
review according to law. When a review is done, "we cannot guarantee
that all TV stations will have their licenses renewed for another
six-year term," he pointed out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, GUATEMALA INK FREE TRADE AGREEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and Guatemala signed a free trade
agreement (FTA) in Guatemala city on Sunday, a pact that is expected
to take effect after being ratified by legislatures of both
countries, according to a statement issued Monday by the Bureau of
Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The statement said that the FTA was signed by Vice Ministry of
Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long and his Guatemalan counterpart
Enrique Lacs after four rounds of negotiations.</P>
      <P>The talks ran aground not long after the two countries began the
negotiations because of Guatemala's request that Taiwan open its
market to agricultural and industrial products from Guatemala wider
than Guatemala's opening to imports from Taiwan because of
Guatemala's less-developed economy, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Thanks to intensive negotiations, the differences were eventually
sorted out and both sides found common ground, according to the
statement.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, Taiwan will offer duty-free privileges to
644 Guatemalan agricultural items immediately after the FTA goes into
force, in return for similar privileges from Guatemala on 447 Taiwan
agricultural products.</P>
      <P>In terms of industrial products, Guatemala promised to open its
market to 3,509 items that consist of 60 percent of Taiwan's current
exports to the Central American state.</P>
      <P>Most important of all, the statement said, Guatemala, as a
signatory to the Central America Free Trade Agreement and the
proposed Free Trade Agreement of America, will provide Taiwan
businessmen with valuable access to the American market.</P>
      <P>Under a chapter for investment in the Taiwan-Guatemala FTA,
Taiwan businessmen can get a beachhead into the American market by
investing in Guatemala, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Guatemala also promised to continue their negotiations
on opening their sky and sea to each other's carriers, the statement
went on.</P>
      <P>Once the open sky agreement is concluded, the statement said, air
carriers of each country may fly on to third destinations via
each other's airports.</P>
      <P>Noting that Guatemala is the third-largest economy in Central
America, with a gross domestic product accounting for 36 percent of
the whole of Central America, the statement hailed the FTA as a
milestone that will contribute significantly to Taiwan's foreign
trade growth and to ties between the two sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN TO INVITE OPPOSITION HEADS TO ATTEND ROC-CENTRAL AMERICA SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2 (CNA)
(By P.c. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has decided to
invite opposition leaders to join him in attending a summit with
Central American heads of state to show the nation's unity in the
fight against China's attempts to marginalize the ROC, a ranking
official of the Presidential Office said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The official also said that the president's invitation also aims
to show that the ruling and opposition parties both support the
government's determination to expand the ROC's diplomatic relations
with other countries.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the Presidential Office will
officially extend the invitations to the chairmen of the Kuomintang
(KMT) , the People First Party (PFP) , the New Party and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union as soon as Nicaragua, the host country of the fifth
ROC-Central America summit, sets a date for the meeting.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to leave Taipei in late August or early
September to attend the meeting slated to be held next month.</P>
      <P>The biennial summit gives Taiwan an opportunity to reinforce its
strategic alliances with its diplomatic allies in the region and to
show its willingness to serve as a capable and responsible member in
the international community.</P>
      <P>Considering China's ongoing attempts to smother Taiwan in the
international community -- despite KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP
Chairman James Soong's visits to the mainland earlier this year --
the president thinks that if the four main opposition party leaders
can accept his invitation and go with him, it would demonstrate the
nation's unity, the official further said.</P>
      <P>The president also believes that national and diplomatic
interests are certainly above the interests of political parties and
that the diplomatic issue is one that has nothing to do with
political ideologies, adding that no matter who is in power,
Beijing's diplomatic hegemony towards Taiwan remains unchanged.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China has launched a new diplomatic
offensive against Taiwan by using its growing economic clout to sway
the ROC's diplomatic allies, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
spokesman Michel Lu said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular foreign ministry news conference, Lu said
China has stepped up improving trade and economic exchanges with
Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central and South America in recent
years with a view to sabotaging those countries' longstanding
relationships with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu said the foreign ministry has noticed China's new strategy and
has alerted the nation's diplomatic allies to the possible pitfalls
behind China's new economic-oriented diplomatic offensive.</P>
      <P>In the face of China's intensified efforts to "befriend" Taiwan's
diplomatic allies, Lu said the foreign ministry has been striving to
expand cooperation with Latin American diplomatic allies in various
fields, including boosting bilateral trade and economic cooperation,
increasing exchanges of visits by high-ranking government officials
and assisting them in manpower training.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lu said diplomatic staff stationed in those countries
have been working hard to inform the political leaders, journalists
and business executives that China's ultimate purpose is to sabotage
their countries' longstanding friendships with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We have also reminded them that if China's cheap products flood
their markets, their economic benefits could be at stake," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Latin America and the Caribbean have been Taiwan's diplomatic
stronghold, with nearly a half of its diplomatic allies located in
the region.</P>

For the first time in years, travelling on

the evening peak hours was a breeze.

The new two-hour toll, which came into
effect between 6pm and 8pm yesterday, helped
push average speeds on the CTE pass the 60kmh

Expressway exit.

The Lianhe Zaobao: Smooth on CTE last

Evening Electronic Road Pricing (ERP)

and this led to some congestion along
alternative routes heading north.

But traffic along the northbound CTE was

Arroyo, poll fraud, 'jueteng' 

THE FIRST eyewitness account of a meeting between

she reportedly appealed for help to win last year's
balloting and money from an illegal gambling lord was
handed out after she had left.

President Arroyo can recover from the political

President Sends Bolton to U.N.; Bypasses Senate

U.S. President Bush bypassed the Senate and
installed John R. Bolton as his ambassador to
the United Nations on Monday over strong
Democratic objections that he was abusing power
and undermining the credibility of the United
States. Bush said he had been forced to act
becaus e the United States had gone for more
than six months without an ambassador to the
United Nations. It was the first time since the
United Nations' founding in 1945 that the
United States has filled that post using a
recess appointment.

As corporate ambitions bore deeper into

    <HEADLINE>MEDIA OPERATING WITHIN THE LAW HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR: PREMIER HSIEH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government was exercising self-restraint
when it decided to pull the plug on the licenses of seven TV
stations, Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday, adding that no media
outlets will be affected as long as they operate within the law.</P>
      <P>He made the comments in the wake of controversy over the
Government Information Office's (GIO) decision Sunday to cancel the
operating licenses, including one for an all-news channel owned by
the Eastern Multimedia Group.</P>
      <P>If the GIO only considered public opinion, it would have
withdrawn more licenses, Hsieh said after attending a ceremony in
which some government offices were cited for outstanding performance
in protecting intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>"The existing media review system may have some glitches, but it
does give the GIO a mandate to review media practices. If the GIO
does not do its job, it will be charged with misprision," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The government will certainly protect those who abide by the law,
but government officials must carry out their duties when they feel
it is necessary to do the right thing, he said.</P>
      <P>In this case, if public opinion had prevailed, quite a few more
media outlets would have had their operating licenses revoked, which
had been the original intention of a number of members of the GIO
review committee, he continued.</P>
      <P>He noted that about 80 percent of the people have urged the
government to "do something about" Taiwan's electronic media, many of
which have been disciplined for unethical practices. Hsieh said that
it was important for people to appreciate the difficult position the
government is in with regard to deciding whether or not to renew a
media company's license.</P>
      <P>Asked if the government was trying to push for media mergers or
restructuring, Hsieh said as long as organizations do not violate the
law, the government will not intervene in the formation of media
policy or media operations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA WELCOMES JAPAN LOWER HOUSE'S APPROVAL OF VISA-FREE STATUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is happy that the lower house of the
Japanese Diet passed a bill Tuesday that would grant permanent
visa-free treatment for Taiwan tourists, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) said.</P>
      <P>"We appreciate the Japanese lower house's friendly move.
Hopefully, the bill can clear the upper house as soon as possible to
allow for its early enactment to further boost bilateral exchanges,"
a MOFA official said.</P>
      <P>The House of Representatives or lower house of the Japanese Diet
passed the bill at a plenary session Tuesday afternoon. The bill will
now be referred to the upper house of the Diet for approval. If it
clears the upper house, Taiwan tourists will permanently be allowed
to enter Japan without first obtaining a visa.</P>
      <P>The granting of permanent visa-free status for Taiwan passport
holders will mark a significant breakthrough in substantive
Taiwan-Japan relations, the MOFA official said.</P>
      <P>The bill was initiated by the head of the lower house's legal
affairs committee and passed with the support of the Liberal
Democratic Party and its ruling coalition partner, Komeito, and the
opposition Democratic Party of Japan.</P>
      <P>As Japan does not maintain formal diplomatic relations with
Taiwan, the bill is necessary if Japan wants to offer a permanent
visa waiver for Taiwan citizens. Japan's existing exit and entry
regulations only authorize visa waivers for citizens from countries
that maintain diplomatic ties with Japan.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, the Japanese parliament passed a similar
special bill to grant 90-day, visa-free entry to prospective Taiwan
visitors from March 25 through Sept. 25 in connection with the
eco-friendly World Expo in Aichi prefecture in central Japan.</P>
      <P>As the temporary visa waiver period will expire soon, Japanese
parliamentarians decided to pass a new bill to allow for permanent
visa-free status to Taiwan citizens.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been Japan's second-largest tourist source after South
Korea. Japanese parliamentarians said they hope that the permanent
visa waiver will attract even more Taiwan tourists to Japan after the
Aichi World Expo and further boost bilateral cultural and commercial
exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC SHOULD PRESERVE ITS "SECRET WEAPON" WHILE FACING CHINA'S THREAT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  1 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should continue to treat the
United States as its "secret weapon" as it faces military threats
from China, a retired U.S. general who was once stationed in Beijing
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Eric A. McVadon, a former military attache of the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing, made the remarks while addressing a seminar held by the
"U.S.-China Policy Foundation (USCPF) " on the recent development of
U.S.-China relations.</P>
      <P>McVadon said that as described by a report released recently by
the Pentagon on China's military power, the goals of the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) are to prevent Taiwan from moving forward
toward independence and to deter Washington from intervening in a
potential cross-Taiwan Strait conflict.</P>
      <P>The PLA has attached great importance to the build-up of its
deterrence forces against U.S. military interference in the Strait,
he also said, adding that the United States must study how to face
China as its military strength is improving by leaps and bounds.</P>
      <P>According to the former general, it is really difficult for
Taiwan to face China's increasing military strength since the island
can hardly defend an attack from the mainland by itself.</P>
      <P>However, he said that Taiwan has a "secret weapon" -- an
effective and appropriate intervention of the United States at a time
when the island encounters an attack from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Taiwan must do whatever it can to retain such a
"secret weapon" by handling its relationship with the United States
well, McVadon said that U.S. President George W. Bush will be faced
with a difficult decision on whether Washington should intervene in a
conflict between Taiwan and China if the island is the one who
provokes the conflict. "China is working on deterring the United
States from intervening in a cross-strait conflict and Taiwan should
not help it, " he added.</P>
      <P>Also, the retired general also urged Taiwan to improve its
relations with China.</P>
      <P>Two former U.S. ambassadors to China, J. Stapleton Roy and James
Sasser, and Chas W. Freeman, a former ranking U.S. official stationed
in China, also attended the seminar.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that it is pointless for both sides of the Strait
and the United States to go to war, Freeman said that it must make
those parties that might be involved in such a war understand the
seriousness of the situation and then avoid a war.</P>
      <P>The USCPF is an organization that promotes a greater
understanding between American and Chinese policymakers, researchers
and government officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SINCERE IN INVITING OPPOSITION LEADERS TO COME ON TRIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's invitation to
opposition leaders to join him in attending a summit with Central
American heads of state in Nicaragua is sincere, an official of the
Presidential Office stressed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-tsung, director-general of the Department of Public
Affairs, made the remarks amid a lukewarm response from the two main
opposition parties - the Kuomintang (KMT) and its ally the People
First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>The president is scheduled to leave Taipei in late August or
early September to attend the meeting slated to be held next month.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-tsung said that as soon as Nicaragua, the host country
of the fifth ROC-Central America summit, sets a date for the meeting,
the Presidential Office will formally extend the invitations to the
parties.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that China will not let up on Taiwan regardless of
which party is in power, and the president hopes to have opposition
leaders join him to show that the nation is united in opposing
Chinese' relentless efforts to marginalize Taiwan in the
international community.</P>
      <P>Asked about the difference between the latest offer and President
Chen's desire to hold an inter-party summit meeting, Chen Wen-tsung
said that the president's invitation is for the betterment of
diplomacy, while the summit meeting will focus on domestic politics
and economic issues.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman-elect Ma Ying-jeou said he has no plan to join the
president on his trip abroad.</P>
      <P>Ma, who will take over the helm of the KMT Aug. 19, said he
thanks the president for the kind invitation, but "we are preoccupied
with work at home, and can't make it."</P>
      <P>Wu Yu-sheng, a KMT legislator and a key Ma aide, said the urgent
task now is major national issues such as flood control and
cross-strait issues, and not spending money in inviting opposition
leaders to travel abroad. It is best for President Chen, who
represents the nation, to attend the summit meeting, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Cho Po-yuan, a KMT whip in the legislative caucus, said that it
is odd for the president to invite opposition party leaders to visit
Central America, saying that this might be his attempt to divert
public attention from the government's poor handling of fruit exports
to China as well as the renewal of licenses for cable TV stations.</P>
      <P>Huang Yi-chiao, a PFP whip at the legislative caucus, said the
caucus feels that it is "not necessary" to join President Chen for
the trip, and will suggest to party Chairman James Soong that he
decline the invitation.</P>
      <P>Huang said that no leaders of democratic countries would have
taken opposition leaders with them when visiting diplomatic allies,
saying that there is no such thing "in theory" or "in practice."</P>
      <P>But the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally,
the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , are upbeat about the president's
invitation, saying that their chairmen will be delighted to go with
the president.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang said that all parties,
irrespective of their politics, should work toward raising the
nation's international profile and DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang will
go with the president.</P>
      <P>Cheng Cheng-lung, Lee's counterpart in the TSU, said that
President Chen's visit will help the international community learn
that Taiwan is a sovereign, independent country.</P>
      <P>As all people should work for better diplomacy, TSU Chairman Su
Ching-chiang will surely join the president, Cheng said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan speaker Wang
Jin-pyng said Monday that he has no intention of serving as the
senior vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) under the
party's newly elected chairman, Ma Ying-jeou, who is currently Taipei
mayor.</P>
      <P>Wang, who tendered his resignation as a vice chairman of the
party to outgoing KMT Chairman Lien Chan last week after losing the
party chairmanship election on July 16, is in San Francisco for a
10-day private trip with his family.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from the media, Wang said that he would not
serve as Ma's deputy even if Lien tried to persuade him to accept
Ma's offer.</P>
      <P>"I believe Mr. Lien understands my position, " he said. He
pledged that he would always remain a faithful member of the KMT.</P>
      <P>On his future plans, Wang said he will try to do a good job in
the legislature and keep clear of party affairs so that Ma can have a
free hand. He added that the way to show the greatest respect for Ma
is to give him enough space for maneuvering without any restraints.</P>
      <P>Wang acknowledged that he had been criticized for not accepting
Ma's offer to serve as the KMT's senior vice chairman. However, he
said, people should not use this to judge him to be a man of small
caliber, because these two things are incomparable.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the best strategy for the KMT is for himself
and Ma to each do their best in their own posts to help the KMT win
the 2008 presidential election and become the ruling party again.</P>
      <P>Wang and Ma fought a hard election campaign in which both camps
blamed the other side for mud-slinging. A victorious Ma, who captured
70 percent of the vote in the party election, later apologized to
Wang and tried to mend fences. He has obtained Lien's promise to help
him make peace with Wang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT EXPOUNDS NEW THEORY OF 'FOUR STAGES OF ROC'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian gave a detailed
explanation Tuesday of what he described as "the four stages of the
Republic of China (ROC)" in an attempt to give the public a clear and
definitive idea about his ideas regarding Taiwan's sovereignty and
national identity.</P>
      <P>Talking to a group of young people participating in the
Ambassador Program of the Formosa Foundation of the USA, he noted
that the ROC was established in China in 1912.</P>
      <P>In 1949, the ROC "moved" to Taiwan. In the third stage, during
the time when Lee Teng-hui was president (1988-2000) , "the ROC on
Taiwan" was the catch-phrase used to describe the nation, according
to Chen.</P>
      <P>In the fourth stage after 2000, with the first peaceful transfer
of power in the ROC's history, the new phrase should be "the ROC is
Taiwan," he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that prior to 1949, the ROC had nothing to do with
Taiwan because the island was under Japanese rule from 1895 until
1945.</P>
      <P>With that historical background in mind, he said that as the
leader of Taiwan, he would like to use the title of "Chinese Taipei"
to attend the informal leaders' meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) in South Korea.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan has been "in a difficult situation" for a
long time and lamented that Taiwan cannot use the title it would
like.</P>
      <P>He repeated his syllogism on Taiwan's future: The ROC is an
independent and sovereign country; its sovereignty belongs to the 23
million people of Taiwan; therefore, only the people have the right
to make any change to Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>"This is the best possible interpretation of the fact that the
sovereignty of Taiwan lies in the hands of its people," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that sovereignty is something that is inalienable,
so Taiwan's sovereignty is something that cannot be shared by anybody
other than the 23 million people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is aware that even though he is willing to use the
title "Chinese Taipei" to attend the APEC summit in Korea -- a title
that he claimed does not provoke or challenge anyone -- it will still
be "extremely difficult" for him to attend the meeting in November.</P>
      <P>The title of Chinese Taipei was accepted by Taiwan when it, Hong
Kong and China joined APEC in 1991, he recalled. He added that
although he and the government very much hope to use the title of
Taiwan or the ROC in APEC meetings, "it's very, very difficult."</P>
      <P>In the international community, whenever Taiwan tries to use the
title "Taiwan, " China tries to suppress or sabotage Taiwan's
efforts, he said.</P>
      <P>Only when Taiwan's national status, national identity, national
sovereignty and the question of who has the right to change its
future are all made clear can Taiwan educate its youth, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S DUTY-FREE TREATMENT FOR TAIWAN FRUIT CONCERNS SOUTH KOREA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's duty-free treatment for 15 items of
Taiwan fruit is likely to have a flow-on impact on South Korea, which
is now concerned that its apple exports to Taiwan may be affected,
according to a South Korean farm trade source.</P>
      <P>According to an official with a South Korean
government-affiliated agro-trade organization in Taipei who requested
anonymity, South Korea believes Taiwan might import apples from China
following China's offer of duty-free privileges.</P>
      <P>If true, it would deal a very heavy blow to South Korean apple
growers, because almost all their produce is sold to Taiwan, the
source said, pointing out that only between 3 percent and 5 percent
of South Korean fruit, mainly apples, pears, oranges and persimmons,
is exported each year.</P>
      <P>Although the Taiwan government contends that fruit exports to
China are not necessarily profitable and that Japan is a better
market, farmers in southern Tainan County, which is Taiwan's leading
mango growing area, do not agree with this viewpoint.</P>
      <P>Huang Cheng-ching, chief delegate of the Yuching Township Farmers
Association, claimed that China is the best market for Taiwan farm
exports, mainly due to its proximity and the variety of different
fruit qualities it is prepared to accept.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the government claims Taiwan should focus
on rich countries such as Japan instead of what it describes as the
high-risk Chinese market, Huang dismissed this concept, pointing out
that only 20 percent of locally produced mangoes are qualified for
export to the stringent Japanese market, while the Chinese market is
much more open to a variety of qualities of fruit.</P>
      <P>Tu Chao-yen, an economic professor at Japan-based Kokugakin
University, said that it is not contradictory to approach the
Japanese and Chinese markets at the same time.</P>
      <P>While Japanese consumers are highly quality conscious, the
Chinese market is larger and is rife with opportunity, Tu said,
suggesting that Taiwan should sell products of various qualities to
satisfy different market demands.</P>
      <P>In addition, Tu said, Taiwan tea is also a good foreign exchange
earner as long as the domestic industry devotes itself to innovation
in quality and flavor over the long term.</P>
      <P>China's duty-free treatment for 15 kinds of Taiwan fruit,
including pineapples, pomelos, persimmons, mangoes, bell fruit and
star fruit took effect Aug. 1, a move that has gained positive
response among farmers in southern Taiwan who are traditionally
strong backers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsi-huang, a former chairman of the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA) , said that China's zero-tariff offer is aimed at
converting "market merchandise" into "political advantages " and
claimed that Taiwan farmers' desire to further explore the Chinese
market underscores the low-income problem in the domestic
agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>Citing COA statistics, he said that non-agricultural annual
household incomes averaged NT$1.13 million (US$35,320) in 2003, well
above the NT$873,901 average registered by agricultural families --
only 15.7 percent of which, or NT$178,111, was earned by farming.</P>
      <P>Low income and product price fluctuations have long been a major
headache for Taiwan farmers, Chen said, urging the government to
resolve the issue.</P>
      <P>COA statistics show that Taiwan farm production totaled US$3.55
billion in value last year, with exports worth US$33 million -- some
42 percent to Japan, 22 percent to the United States and just 1
percent to China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION UNIMPRESSED BY PRESIDENT'S 'FOUR STAGES OF ROC' THEORY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition parties were unimpressed
Tuesday by President Chen Shui-bian's new theory about what he
described as the "four stages of the Republic of China" that equates
Taiwan with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Chen's expounding about national title and ideology is
"meaningless, " according to the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Chen told a group of Formosa Foundation of the USA visitors that
in 1912, the ROC was set up in China; in 1949, it moved to Taiwan;
when Lee Teng-hui was the president, it was "the ROC on Taiwan;"
since 2000, he said, when he himself became president, "the ROC is
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>To further make clear the sovereignty of Taiwan or the ROC, he
repeated his syllogism: The ROC is a sovereign country; it's
sovereignty belongs to Taiwan's 23 million people; only they have the
right to change its future.</P>
      <P>Pan Wei-kang, deputy secretary-general of the KMT legislative
caucus, said theorizing about ideology does not help improve people's
livelihoods and Chen should pay more attention to the economy, not
this "meaningless" topic.</P>
      <P>Wu Yang-chih, another caucus deputy secretary-general, agreed
that taking good care of the people is more important than giving a
long essay about national title and sovereignty.</P>
      <P>"It is very clear fact that the ROC does not equal the PRC
(People's Republic of China) and that the ROC has long enjoyed its
own sovereignty. Therefore, President Chen's theorizing does not have
any substantive meaning," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Sun Ta-chien, deputy convener of the second-largest opposition
People First Party (PFP), said any expounding on the nation's status
must be based on the Constitution. "A politician should not make his
personal interpretations in violation of the Constitution, " he
added.</P>
      <P>Sun said that if Chen were expressing his personal views, he and
caucus members would respect them, but as a national leader, the
president must be careful to say and do things in accordance with his
oath to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) looked at the issue
from a different perspective, claiming that Chen's "factual
description" can help alleviate ethnic tension in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>William C.T. Lai, secretary-general of the DPP legislative
caucus, claimed that the president's "four stages" theory can satisfy
people of all ages and ethnic groups and therefore will serve as a
common ground to unite and integrate the nation's people.</P>
      <P>A big problem for Taiwan is that different ethnic groups and
historical backgrounds have led to different senses of identity,
affecting domestic unity and national development, Lai said.</P>
      <P>Ho Min-hao, convener of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union's
legislative caucus, said the president's time would have been better
used seeking a national consensus to write a new Constitution and
change the country's national title.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH'S HOPE OF EARLY LIFTING OF DISEASE ALERT EVAPORATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With new cases of melioidosis reported
Tuesday, the Department of Health's (DOH's) expectation of lifting an
alert over the disease will have to be put off, according to health
officials.</P>
      <P>The remarks came in the wake of DOH reports of six new cases in
Tainan City and Kaohsiung County. Among them, one victim came down
July 28, and the alert will only be lifted Aug. 7 -- 10 days after
the last reported case -- at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Five of the six new cases are over 50, and one is 27, the
youngest of all the victims reported so far.</P>
      <P>Between July 11 and Aug. 2, 26 cases of melioidosis have been
reported, seven of which have been fatal. Twenty-three out of the 26
cases live near the Er-jen creek that runs through Tainan and
Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Health officials suspect that the victims might have contracted
the disease after recent flooding and ensuing pollution as a result
of typhoon Haitang that hit Taiwan in mid-July.</P>
      <P>They said that people with open wounds and weak immune systems
are susceptible to the bacterium after touching flood debris, sewage
and contaminated soil. They usually die of sepsis.</P>
      <P>Health officials in Tainan said that with new cases reported, DOH
Vice Minister Chen Tsai-chin promised to send experts there to help
investigate the cause of he disease.</P>
      <P>Although melioidosis is not a notifiable disease, people living
near the Er-jen creek have become worried as to whether the bacteria
is being transmitted through polluted water.</P>
      <P>Melioidosis, also called Whitmore's disease, is an infectious
disease caused by the burkholderia pseudomallei bacterium. It is
predominately a disease of tropical climates, especially Southeast
Asia, where it is endemic. The bacteria that causes melioidosis are
found in contaminated water and soil and are spread to humans and
animals through direct contact with the contaminated source.</P>
      <P>As a new typhoon might strike Taiwan over the next few days, DOH
officials have advised people to refrain from coming too close to
polluted water or soil if they have open wounds.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CAUCUS CONCERNED ABOUT  CONTROL YUAN PLIGHT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) legislators paid a visit to the Control Yuan Tuesday to
express their concern about the supreme watchdog body's plight
resulting mainly from political bickering.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan has not been functional since Feb. 1 because the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan has refused to endorse
President Chen Shui-bian's nominees for Control Yuan seats.</P>
      <P>Control Yuan Secretary-General Tu Shan-liang told visiting DPP
legislators that more than 10,000 petitions and political
contribution cases have accumulated at the watchdog body since the
previous ombudsmen finished their terms Jan. 31 this year.</P>
      <P>Tu said those cases need to be addressed for the sake of
protecting the rights of the public and he described the memberless
Control Yuan as an "unprecedented strange phenomenon in the nation's
constitutional history."</P>
      <P>In response, DPP legislative whip Chao Yung-ching said the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First
Party has long boasted of its claim that it defends the five-branch
government system enshrined in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>"The Control Yuan is an integral part of the five-branch central
government to supervise the executive branch operations. It's hard to
understand why the `pan-blue alliance' has boycotted the confirmation
of the ombudsmen nominations. If opposition lawmakers see no need for
the Control Yuan to exist, they should come up with a constitutional
amendment bill for a rational debate instead of blocking discussion
of the nomination list in the legislature," Chao said.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, William Lai, also a DPP
legislative whip, said it is hoped that a planned Aug. 12 informal
legislative meeting can reach a consensus on how to address the
Control Yuan nomination issue.</P>
      <P>If no consensus is reached at that meeting, Lai said he is afraid
that the nomination list will remain permanently mired in
uncertainty.</P>
      <P>Chen first submitted the names of his nominees last November for
the previous legislature's approval, but the opposition legislators
refused to even screen the list, maintaining that most of the
nominees were not up to the expectations of the public.</P>
      <P>After the new legislature was inaugurated in February, the two
"pan-blue alliance" parties, which continue to jointly control a slim
majority in the legislature, asked Chen to submit a new list of
nominees on the grounds that his original list was invalid in the new
legislature. However, Chen resubmitted the same list, which the new
opposition legislators also refused to screen.</P>
      <P>Chen has refused to change his nominations, insisting that while
opposition lawmakers can reject any of his nominees that they deem
unsuitable, they should not completely refuse to screen the list.</P>
      <P>Demanding that the president change his nominations encroaches on
his right to nominate enshrined in the Constitution, a Presidential
Office official said earlier this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kukeng township in Yunlin County is
trying to recruit 30 obese volunteers to undergo tests to see whether
green oranges grown in the township can help them shed some weight.</P>
      <P>The township government announced Tuesday that the volunteers --
15 men and 15 women -- will be given a recipe for making beverages
using green oranges as the main ingredient. Examinations will be
conducted after one month to see if the green oranges are effective
in helping the volunteers lose weight.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the township government pointed out that green
oranges are abundant during the harvest season from July to
September. He claimed that freshly squeezed juice from green oranges,
when mixed with yogurt, makes a delicious drink ideal for weight
watchers.</P>
      <P>Although the Department of Health has expressed doubts over the
claims, the township still hopes to use the tests to prove the
effects of the fruit in helping obese people to lose weight. Positive
results from the tests could not only put an end to the dispute, but
also help the township with fruit sales, the spokesman claimed.</P>
      <P>He said that obese people who are interested in taking part in
the tests can contact the township government or the Sanchi Organic
Farm before Aug. 10.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
expressed categorical disagreement Tuesday with a government plan to
allow direct shipping links between the island country of Penghu
and China, citing concerns over national security.</P>
      <P>TSU legislative whip Ho Min-hao told a news conference that the
party is strongly opposed to the plan on the grounds that the current
direct shipping and trade links between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu
islands and China -- popularly known as the "mini links" -- have
turned out to be the prime channels for smuggling from China.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the TSU will never agree to the government's plan
until it has wiped out smuggling and criminal activities via the
"mini links" and has held negotiations with China, Ho argued that
Penghu's location will be more likely to invite infiltration from
China should similar links be set up between the outlying island and
China.</P>
      <P>Penghu's location within the mid-line of the Taiwan Strait makes
it easier than the remote islands of Kinmen and Matsu to be used by
criminal elements or Chinese agents, Ho claimed, predicting that the
government project will cause serious concerns to national security.</P>
      <P>What the Penghu Island needs is greater investment to fully
develop its economy and tourist industry, not simply make it a
transit point in the Taiwan Strait for passing cargo ships, he
claimed.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said a day earlier during a visit to Penghu
that the government is considering whether to permit the island to
operate direct links with China on a trial basis, probably from
September.</P>

      <P>An opposition Kuomintang (KMT) spokesman
criticized Tuesday President Chen Shui-bian's new theory of "four
stages of the Republic of China" as a factor that will endanger
cross-Taiwan Strait stability.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung claimed that Chen's new theory is a
pro-independence one disguised with the Republic of China title.</P>
      <P>Chen presented that day his theory, which separates the ROC into
four stages, with the first in 1912, when the ROC was set up; the
second in 1949, when the ROC moved to Taiwan; the third during former
President Lee Teng-hui's term in which the country was called "ROC on
Taiwan;" and the fourth stage since 2000, when Chen himself took
power as president.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to strengthen the public's ideas regarding the
country's sovereignty and national identity, Chen announced his new
theory and stressed that "ROC is Taiwan" has been the case since he
assumed his post in 2000.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, Chen's remarks were aimed at placating
pro-independence groups that were extremely disappointed by Chen's
recent remarks that it will be impossible to gain Taiwan independence
during his tenure.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC represents Taiwan proper and the outlying
islands of Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, Chang claimed that it should not
serve as a cover for the Taiwan independence movement.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks will result in more efforts of the United States

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN, TAIWAN AGREE IN ASSESSMENT OF CHINA'S MILITARY STRENGTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan's prediction that China will begin to
prevail against Taiwan militarily from 2006 unless Taiwan engages in
an aggressive military build-up is in full agreement with a forecast
by the Ministry of National Defense (MND) , a ministry official said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Japan's prediction, carried in its 2005 National Defense White
Paper, was published earlier that day in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The defense official, who asked to remain anonymous, said the MND
has predicted that the military balance across the Taiwan Strait will
begin to tilt in favor of China from 2006.</P>
      <P>Citing an analysis conducted by the ministry, the official said
the military imbalance between China and Taiwan will worsen to 1.46
to 1 in terms of combat power by 2012 even if the navy acquires
much-needed Kidd-class destroyers.</P>
      <P>Unless Taiwan builds up its military strength, this trend will
continue until the gap between the two sides widens to 2.8 to 1,
which will be really dangerous because it is widely believed that the
offensive force is sure to win in an engagement when it commands a
superior force ratio of 3 to 1 against the defense force.</P>
      <P>In order to slow down the declining trend, the official said, the
MND is trying to acquire NT$480 billion-worth of arms from the United
States that will keep the power ratio between China and Taiwan at
1.67 to 1 between 2020 and 2035.</P>
      <P>By keeping that ratio, China would not dare to embark on a
military adventure against Taiwan because according to this theory,
the offense will not succeed in an attack-to-seize operation with a
force ratio below 2 to 1 and might suffer heavy losses.</P>
      <P>The official said that is why Defense Minister Lee Jye claimed in
the legislature that the proposed arms purchase will secure 30 years
of peace for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said his ministry is not surprised by Japan's prediction, but
added that Taiwan is not the only country threatened by China's
military buildup. All of China's neighbors should worry about China's
exploding military spending, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN LIFTS BAN ON AIRCRAFT FLYING OVER CHINA'S AIRSPACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has decided to lift the ban
on Taiwan commercial aircraft flying over China's airspace, Premier
Frank Hsieh said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan carriers will now be allowed to fly over China's airspace
to save fuel costs and reduce travel times, the premier said at a
weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, China can approve our air carriers' applications for
flyovers as soon as possible," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>If China approves Taiwan carriers' applications, Hsieh said it
will be a boon to both passengers and airline operators because the
flying times from Taiwan to South Asia, the Middle East and Europe
will be greatly reduced.</P>
      <P>"The decision to remove the decades-old flyover ban was made out
of consideration of helping carriers cut costs amid the current
upward spiral in international crude oil prices," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh said the government has agreed to simultaneous
negotiations for the opening of passenger, cargo and special-purpose
charter flights across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>As August is traditionally an export boom season, Hsieh said he
has directed the Mainland Affairs Council and the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) to speed up contacts and
negotiations with China on the opening of cross-strait cargo charter
flights.</P>
      <P>China has insisted that issues regarding the opening of
cross-strait passenger charter flights should be discussed
simultaneously. After a careful review, Hsieh said, the government
has agreed to China's proposal.</P>
      <P>As China refuses for political reasons to engage in direct
contact with Taiwan's government, the latter has commissioned the
Taipei Airline Association to mediate charter flight negotiations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEA WARNING ISSUED FOR TYPHOON MATSA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a
sea warning for Typhoon Matsa at 8:30 a.m. Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CWB meteorologists said a land warning could be issued later in
the day.</P>
      <P>As of 11 a.m. Wednesday, Typhoon Matsa was located 560 km
south-southeast of Oluanpi, the southern tip of Taiwan, moving in a
northwest direction at a speed at 15 km per hour, with maximum wind
speeds of 126 km per hour, they reported.</P>
      <P>They said that Typhoon Matsa could shift to a northern direction,
although there is still a chance that Taiwan proper could be affected
by the typhoon.</P>
      <P>Vessels operating in waters off northern, northeastern and
southeastern Taiwan and in the Bashi Channel should be on guard
against the typhoon, the meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, despite the issuing of the sea warning, a total of
nearly 1,000 tourists headed by ferry to Green Island or Orchid
Island Wednesday morning. Many said they were traveling to the
islands to experience the excitement of being near the eye of the
storm.</P>
      <P>In the past, Fukang Harbor in Taitung, eastern Taiwan, closed
when a sea warning was issued. However, last month, many tourists
were stranded on the two islands after a sea warning was issued for
Typhoon Haitang despite the fact that waves weren't very large.</P>
      <P>Ferry companies have since coordinated with Hualien Harbor
Bureau, and the companies have been given leeway to decide whether to
continue operating when a sea warning is issued.</P>
      <P>The ferry companies said they will suspend services if and when a
land warning is issued.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Mount Ali forest train in Chiayi, southern Taiwan
continued operations as usual Wednesday. A decision on whether to
suspend services will be made Thursday based on the weather
conditions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS POSITIVE ABOUT ALLOWING TAIWAN AIRCRAFT TO FLY OVER CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators across the party spectrum were
positive Tuesday about Premier Frank Hsieh's announcement of the
lifting of a ban on Taiwan commercial aircraft flying over China's
airspace, with one opposition party saying that this should have been
done earlier.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Taiwan carriers will now be allowed to fly over
China's airspace to save fuel costs and reduce travel times, hoping
at the same time that China will approve Taiwan air carriers'
applications for overflights.</P>
      <P>The premier also said the government has agreed to simultaneous
negotiations for the opening of passenger, cargo and special-purpose
charter flights across the Taiwan Strait, hoping for early
consultations with China.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun, a caucus whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive party at the Legislative Yuan, said that instead of being
passive, the premier has taken the initiative to agree to the lifting
of the ban, which he said is a "very good thing, " expressing the
hope that China will also embark on cross-strait
government-to-government talks on passenger, cargo and
special-purpose charter flights.</P>
      <P>He noted that China has always been more interested in passenger
than cargo charter flights, but in fact, there is also strong demand
for cross-strait cargo charter flights.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
said the party is happy to see the announcement that will benefit the
public.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Pan Wei-kang, a whip of the KMT legislative
caucus, expressed hope that the government will deliver on its
promise.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian should also explain whether he supports
the policy, she added.</P>
      <P>The People First Party (PFP) legislative caucus said the ban on
Taiwan aircraft flying over China's airspace should have been lifted
a long time ago.</P>
      <P>Huang Yi-chiao, a PFP whip in the legislature, said that lifting
the ban is a step in the right direction, although he said he did not
know if this policy also represents Chen's stance, claiming that DPP
policy "only counts" with the endorsement of the president.</P>
      <P>Ho Min-hao, a caucus whip of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU),
an ally of the DPP, said his party is in favor of early cross-strait
consultation with China if the talks are based on the principles of
equality, mutual benefit, dignity, insistence on the stance of Taiwan
sovereignty, and the premise that cross-strait charter flights are
considered international flights.</P>

      <P>The move is expected to help bring at least 1.3 million tourists
from Taiwan to Japan in 2004, a 30-percent growth over the 2004
level, officials of the Japan National Tourist Organization (JNTO)
said, noting that 583,773 Taiwan people visited Japan in the first
half of this year, up by 12.5 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan people made the second-largest number of visits to Japan
last year behind only visitors from South Korea, but they were
Japan's No. 1 source of tourist arrivals, JNTO official said.</P>
      <P>According to a JNTO investigation, Taiwan tourists are attracted
by Japan's beautiful and clean cities as well as the country's
historic and cultural relics. Some 94 percent of Taiwan visitors said
they would be willing to visit Japan again, although a large ratio
also complained of Japan's high prices.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan aviation companies were also upbeat about the
news, saying that they are capable of transporting more Taiwan
tourists to Japan now that a restriction on charter flight numbers
from Taiwan to Japan has been lifted with the renewal of an aviation
agreement between the two countries last year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-based carriers now operate regular charter flights to
Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Fukuoka and Sapporo.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Bi-khim, a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, claimed that Japan is more willing to engage with Taiwan in
the face of a rising China.</P>
      <P>Overall relations between Taiwan and Japan are quite benign
for the time being despite recent fishery disputes, she pointed out.</P>

China's Cnooc Ltd. abandoned its effort to acquire U.S. oil

as they try to expand in the global marketplace. In reaching for
Unocal, Cnooc -- considered one of China's most modern and
Western-minded companies -- showed its relative inexperience in the
world of Wall Street and Washington, with some strategic and
political stumbles. But Cnooc also got caught up in anti-Chinese

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The son of outgoing opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Lien Chan said Tuesday that his father is "a tragic
hero" whose differences from other political party leaders "can only
be known when he is leaving."</P>
      <P>Lien Sheng-wen, a newly elected delegate to the upcoming KMT
convention that will see his father hand over the leadership to
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, made the remarks while running for a seat
on the main opposition party's Central Committee.</P>
      <P>Commenting on his father, who will step down Aug. 19, Lien
claimed that his father was the KMT chairman during its "most
difficult time" of frustration and failure, and yet "fought to the
last moment."</P>
      <P>Lien said he believes the KMT will continue to dig into "the
truth" behind the March 19, 2004 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian
and Vice President Annette Lu and "seek justice."</P>
      <P>Lien Chan was defeated for the second time by Chen Shui-bian in
the 2004 presidential election, a campaign that the opposition claims
it lost partly because of the shooting.</P>
      <P>During a media interview earlier in the week, Lien Chan said he
was quite proud of two major legacies he will leave behind: building
what he described as a "cross-Taiwan Strait bridge for peace and
security;" and endorsing the first-ever direct election of party
chairman.</P>
      <P>Lien advised his successor to "be broad-minded, make as many
friends as possible, steadily reform the party and do whatever should
be done."</P>
      <P>As a result of his historic visit to China last April, Lien
claimed, he has "built a bridge and a road toward cross-strait peace"
and whether or not to step on it is completely up to Chen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC WANTS CROSS-STRAIT CARGO CHARTER FLIGHTS TO TAKE OFF FIRST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
Wednesday it looks forward to an early start to direct cargo charter
flights across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"While we agree to simultaneous negotiations for opening direct
cross-strait passenger, cargo and special-purpose charter flights, we
want cargo charter flights to be opened first, " said an MAC official
who preferred anonymity.</P>
      <P>The official made the remarks after Premier Frank Hsieh announced
earlier in the day that the government has decided to lift the ban on
Taiwan commercial aircraft flying over China's airspace and agreed to
simultaneous negotiations for cross-strait cargo and passenger
charter flights.</P>
      <P>According to the council, the two major policy initiatives were
adopted after extensive discussions with the National Security
Council.</P>
      <P>In addition to benefiting people on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait, the official said, the two measures are also expected to
convey a goodwill message to China and help improve cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>The decision to remove the decades-old flyover ban was made out
of consideration of helping carriers cut costs amid the current
upward spiral in international crude oil prices, the official said,
adding that the flying times to South Asia, the Middle East and
Europe will also be greatly reduced.</P>
      <P>"If China approves our carriers' flyover applications, it will be
a boon to both passengers and airline operators because the travel
times and fuel costs will all be cut," the official said.</P>
      <P>Industry sources said local carriers can each save an estimated
NT$100 million in fuel costs annually if they are allowed to fly over
China's airspace.</P>
      <P>As to the opening of cross-strait charter flights, Taiwan has
expressed an interest in negotiating cargo charter flights, but China
is only willing to negotiate the passenger charter flights issue. As
a result, no progress has been made in this regard following the
smooth conclusion of special Chinese New Year charter flights for
Taiwan businessmen operating in China in late January and early
February this year.</P>
      <P>With a view to pushing for an early realization of cross-strait
cargo charter flights to benefit the business community, the official
said the government is now advocating simultaneous negotiations for
cargo and passenger charter flights.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, the official said, China will agree to this proposal
so that intermediary bodies on both sides can enter into negotiations
soon.</P>
      <P>As China refuses for political reasons to engage in direct
contact with the government on Taiwan, the MAC has commissioned the
Taipei Airline Association to mediate charter flight negotiations.</P>
      <P>The official explained that the change in the government's
attitude was prompted partly by a recent step forward in talks
regarding allowing Chinese citizens to visit Taiwan for sightseeing
purposes.</P>
      <P>"Once the two sides finally come to term to allow Chinese
citizens to make sightseeing trips to Taiwan, there should be a
market demand for cross-strait passenger charter flights," he noted.</P>

figure marks an impressive annual growth rate of 7.9 percent.</P>
      <P>Japan was the top importer of Taiwan's agricultural goods in the

    <HEADLINE>RISING OIL PRICES DRAGGING DOWN TAIWAN'S ECONOMY: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The continued rise of international crude
oil prices is poised to negatively impact Taiwan's economy, as 99
percent of the island's oil supplies are imported, a Council of
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hung Juei-pin, director of the CEPD's Economic Research
Department, made the remarks in a report on the country's economic
situation in the first half.</P>
      <P>According to an estimate by U.S. Global Insight, Inc. in July,
the global economy will see a 3.2 percent growth in the second half
of this year due to the strong economic momentum in North America and
Asia ( except Japan) , with the United States expected to register
growth of 3.6 percent and Asian countries an average of 6.4 percent.</P>
      <P>The CEPD predicted in May that Taiwan's economy may grow by 3.07
percent and more than 4 percent in the first and second half of this
year with the growth for the whole year expected to register 3.63
percent.</P>
      <P>The report also showed that Taiwan's foreign trade grew at a
slower pace in the first half, with exports and imports increasing by
6.8 percent and 11.5 percent, respectively, over the same period of
last year.</P>
      <P>In June, exports and imports grew only by 3.1 percent and 2.5
percent, respectively, over the same month of last year.</P>
      <P>Cumulatively, Taiwan's trade surplus was US$420 million in the
first half of this year, a decrease of 89.1 percent over the same
period of 2004.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to six ASEAN countries increased the most at
14.8 percent in the first half of this year, while its exports to
Europe posted a negative growth for the same period.</P>
      <P>China, including Hong Kong, and Japan were the main source of
Taiwan's imports, with the island's imports from the two countries
registering an annual growth of 21.2 percent and 14.4 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Considering the soaring oil prices and Taiwan's heavy dependence
on oil imports, the CEPD official urged related agencies to draw up
strategies to ensure that the country has a stable oil supply in the
long run and strengthen the implementation of its energy-saving
policies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROMOTION OF CROSS-STRAIT LINKS IS GOVERNMENT'S JOB: DPP CAUCUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Wednesday that the
establishment of direct cross-Taiwan Strait trade, postal and
transportation links should be coordinated by the government and that
the opposition parties should not interfere.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun, a DPP legislative caucus whip, was responding to
the opposition People First Party (PFP) after it said it will push
for legislation on direct cross-strait links in the next legislative
session.</P>
      <P>Chen said President Chen Shui-bian is not opposed to cross-strait
links but that he wants cross-strait consultation to be based on
equality, dignity and security in line with international practice.</P>
      <P>Chen also said cross-strait links should be in the national
interests and that the routes should not be downgraded to the level
of a domestic route. He also said that the executive and
legislative arms of the government should have their respective
duties and that the opposition parties should not use their
slight majority in the legislature to try to dominate executive
power.</P>
      <P>Huang Yi-chiao, a PFP legislative whip, said in a press
conference that the caucus will make promotion of direct cross-strait
links, targeting government corruption and incompetence, as well as
revitalizing financial discipline priorities in the next legislative
session.</P>
      <P>Huang said that several multi-national enterprises are preparing
to move their research and development centers from Taiwan to China,
which he claimed shows the coming trend. Taiwan has seen itself
marginalized and its competitive's edge weakened since the DPP came
to power five years ago, he claimed.</P>
      <P>He said direct cross-strait links are under the authority of the
Executive Yuan, but added that if the government does not set them up
and Taiwan businessmen's' operating costs increase as a result, then
the PFP caucus will not rule out the possibility of trying to revise
the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of Taiwan Area
and the Mainland Area, and return the relevant authority to the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Huang said the PFP caucus would then coordinate with the
opposition Kuomintang and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union to
implement the cross-strait direct links.</P>
      <P>Huang also said that if the president does not change his list of
members of the Control Yuan, the nation's top watchdog agency, and if
the government insists on financing an arms procurement package with
a special budget, then his caucus will continue to oppose to the two
controversial proposals.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the list is unacceptable and that if the
president does not change it, the party will not confirm the members.</P>
      <P>On the procurement of eight diesel-electric submarines, six
Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft, Huang said that he and PFP Chairman James
Soong met with U.S. figures during visits to the United States who
did not request that Taiwan finance the procurement through a special
budget or say that Taiwan should take responsibility if the deal
does not go through.</P>
      <P>He said that if what he claimed is a "great majority" of people
was not opposed to special budget to finance the arms procurement,
the PFP would never oppose it.</P>
      <P>Chen replied that the opposition parties should at least put the
arms procurement proposal to committee review.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance " of the KMT and the PFP, which has a
slight majority in the Legislative Yuan, has blocked the special
budget proposal for the arms procurement since the Executive Yuan
first submitted it in June 2004. The opposition parties believe the
price tag is too high and that it should be included in the annual
budget rather than a special budget.</P>
      <P>On the refusal to confirm the Control Yuan members, Chen also
said the legislators should confirm or veto the proposed members
under the Constitution and should not simply ignore the list
completely and demand that the president change it, thereby stripping
the president of his right of nomination.</P>

legislature opens its next session in September.</P>
      <P>Late last Sunday, the Government Information Office (GIO),
following the recommendations of a review committee, gave a 48-hour
notice to seven cable TV channels to shut down permanently. The other
channels whose licenses were renewed can continue operations for the
next six years.</P>
      <P>Among the channels that failed to have their licenses renewed
were a news channel of the Eastern Multimedia Group and a movie
channel.</P>
      <P>The GIO decision triggered strong protests from the owners of the
seven TV channels, as well as criticisms from the opposition parties
and Taiwan's news media, blaming similar actions against the media by
the Democratic Progressive Party-led government for the significant
drop of Taiwan's global ranking in terms of press freedom in recent
years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EDUCATION MINISTER DEPLORES SHORTAGE OF FOREIGN NEWS IN TAIWAN MEDIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng said
Tuesday that judging from the striking shortage of international news
in local media, Taiwan seems to be locking itself out of the world.</P>
      <P>Politically, Taiwan is already shut out by the United Nations and
the media seems to be trying to lock the people inside the island, he
said, warning that this poses a great danger to the development of
the nation.</P>
      <P>Tu was speaking at a ministry meeting in which he awarded
Professor Tsai Mao-feng of Soochow University for his contributions
in promoting Japanese language teaching in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tu said if you read the newspapers or watch TV in Taiwan, "there
is so little international news" that the people seem to be shutting
their eyes to the outside world.</P>
      <P>The minister happened to be echoing an observation by Singapore
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who said after visiting Taiwan last
year that Taiwan's political and media elite were focusing too much
attention on domestic issues while ignoring what was happening
outside of their country.</P>
      <P>Tu said internationalization is critical to Taiwan's development,
and to achieve that, foreign language education is an important step.</P>
      <P>He said his ministry will choose several schools for a special
program to improve foreign language education in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPOWER'S DEFICIT TO RISE DUE TO HIKE IN OIL AND GAS PRICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) will suffer a
deficit of NT$4.7 billion (US$147 million) this year after a rise in
the price of oil and natural gas announced by the Chinese Petroleum
Corp. (CPC) Tuesday, a Taipower official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The state-run CPC announced an increase of 7.64 percent and 2.99
percent for the prices of its fuel oil and natural gas Tuesday to
reflect soaring international crude oil prices. The move was several
hours after a price hike made by the privately-owned Formosa
Petrochemical Corp. earlier that day.</P>
      <P>Taipower officials noted that the price hikes for fuel oil and
natural gas will increase the cost of electricity generation by
NT$1.6 billion for the company from August to December.</P>
      <P>Taipower originally estimated that it may suffer a deficit of
NT$3.1 billion this year.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taipower's deficit will be inevitable this year due
to the promise made by Premier Frank Hsieh that electricity prices
will not be increased before autumn, the official urged domestic
energy suppliers to take the interest of the general public into
consideration before raising fuel price.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGES 'PAN-BLUE ALLIANCE'  NOT TO TRY TO DEBASE GOVERNMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislative whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) urged the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
Wednesday not to try to debase the government.</P>
      <P>Legislator William Lai made the call after the legislative caucus
of the opposition People First Party (PFP) said earlier in the day
that it will push for amendments to the existing statute governing
relations across the Taiwan Strait to allow for the Legislative Yuan
to map out how direct cross-strait trade, postal and transport links
can be accomplished.</P>
      <P>The PFP said it will also push for a freeze on the Government
Information Office budget related to communications affairs before
the establishment of the long-planned National Communications
Commission.</P>
      <P>The PFP and its "pan-blue alliance" ally of the Kuomintang (KMT)
jointly control a slim majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Lai said he has been worried that the "pan-blue alliance" could
use their clout in the legislature to debase the DPP administration
since KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong made
separate visits to China between late April and early May. Both Lien
and Soong met with Chinese President Hu Jintao, who concurrently
heads the Communist Party of China, and reached consensus on
strengthening cooperation among their parties.</P>
      <P>Lai said the DPP administration is not opposed to the opening of
direct cross-strait "three links" but it wants cross-strait
engagements to be based on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>Stressing that cross-strait links should be in the national
interest, Lai said cross-strait shipping and air routes should not be
downgraded to the level of domestic ones.</P>
      <P>Lai also urged the "pan-blue alliance" to respect the five-branch
government system enshrined in the Constitution and refrain from
abusing their clout in the legislature to try to usurp executive
power.</P>
      <P>"The executive and legislative arms of the government have their
respective duties. The opposition legislators should not try to
encroach on the executive power. Otherwise, it could cause a
constitutional crisis and national interests could be at stake, " he
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN GROWING WARY OF ILLEGAL CHINESE ELEMENTS, CROSS-STRAIT CRIME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is increasingly growing wary of more
and more illegal elements from China, promoting law enforcement
agencies to consider imposing stricter punishments on human
traffickers across the Taiwan Strait in the hope of clamping down on
crimes in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Justice Tang Chin-chuan told a news conference
late last month that his ministry is mulling revising the Statute
Governing the Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area, focusing on severer legal punishments on cross-strait
human cargo brokers.</P>
      <P>But Tang did not elaborate on concrete details as to how rules
will be revised and to what extent.</P>
      <P>According to the 79th provision of the statute, those convicted
of brokering Chinese to enter Taiwan or vice versa will be sentenced
from one year to seven in jail and fined up to NT$1 million
(US$31,250).</P>
      <P>Due to the lack of a set of judiciary cooperative mechanisms
between the two sides, more and more criminals in China, Taiwan, Hong
Kong and Macau have ganged up and committed crimes such as human
smuggling, drug trafficking, fraud, money laundering and kidnapping,
police said.</P>
      <P>Cooperation between local criminals and accomplices offshore has
become more and more common in recent years as a result of frequent
cross-strait exchanges, posing serious risks to personal safety and
social order on both sides, police said.</P>
      <P>Two-way cooperation is critical to fighting cross-strait crimes,
but political strife has hindered joint efforts, police said,
pointing out that this has been the root cause behind the rampant
illegal activities.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ministry of Justice officials said, Chinese hackers
also have intensified attacks against Taiwan-based Web sites in all
sectors, making organized Internet crime a major concern to Taiwan
authorities.</P>
      <P>Although the Chinese public security authorities have set up a
Internet-monitoring task force in Hubei province, ministry officials
said that results remain to be seen.</P>
      <P>Since early this year, Chinese hackers have systematically
intruded into Taiwan's and Japan's Web sites because of various
different issues, they pointed out, describing them as the leading
troublemakers in cyberspace.</P>
      <P>In contrast to China's reluctance to cooperate in wiping out
Internet crime, Taiwan has been very active in assisting in such
cases, the officials said, adding that in 2003, the Ministry of
Justice received 32 requests for assistance filed by foreign
countries and helped in 25.</P>
      <P>In a meeting held last year in Taipei, U.S. officials from the
Internet crime fighting unit under the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum (APEC) praised Taiwan's outstanding contribution in
this regard and called for concerted moves by APEC member states to
prevent computer crime as soon as possible, they said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials of the ministry's Department of
Prosecutorial Affairs are very likely to be invited to jointly take
part in writing the APEC-sponsored "Digital Evidence Model Law" along
with officials from member states such as Canada and South Korea,
they added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LATE SEF CHAIRMAN'S FAMILY FIGHT ALLEGATIONS KOO PAID OFF A MISTRESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The children of Koo Cheng-fu, the late
chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and a business
tycoon, appealed to the court Wednesday to provisionally impound the
apartment of a woman who claims to be Koo's former mistress as a step
proceeding legal action against the woman.</P>
      <P>A lawyer for Koo's three daughters and one son led court clerks
to post stickers on the door of the apartment of the woman, Teng
Hsiang-mei, 65, in Neihu, Taipei City, to indicate that it was being
designated as potential collateral to a damage claim to be filed by
the Koos in court against her on the ground that she defamed their
father by claiming that her adult daughter, Chang Yi-hua, was
fathered by him 40 years ago.</P>
      <P>In order to dispute Tang's claim, Koo's youngest daughter, Koo
Huai-ju, went to the forensic laboratory of the Criminal
Investigation Bureau Wednesday to provide a DNA sample and challenged
Teng and her daughter to do the same to verify their claim.</P>
      <P>Teng and her daughter refused the request, claiming at a news
conference Wednesday that the Koos have to agree in writing first
that Chang will be given her share of Koo Chen-fu's property as an
heir once the DNA test confirms she is Koo Chen-fu's daughter out of
wedlock.</P>
      <P>Teng claimed that her brief affair with Koo Chen-fu took place 40
years ago and ended because of Koo's concerns over his wife's
feelings.</P>
      <P>However, Teng claimed that Koo Chen-fu began to pay money to her
and her daughter every month beginning in 1994 and bought them the
Neihu apartment when they were in financial difficulty and asked Koo
for help.</P>
      <P>The alleged affair came to light after Koo Chen-fu died on Jan. 3
this year at the age of 88 and his family stopped the payments to
Teng.</P>
      <P>Koo's children claim the money was paid by their late elder
brother, Koo Chi-yeng, who bought the apartment for Teng without the
knowledge of Koo Chen-fu; therefore, the purchase was not an implicit
admission of Koo Chen-fu to Teng's claims. On the contrary, they
said, Koo Chen-fu denied the alleged affair during his life.</P>
      <P>Koo's children said their elder brother paid Teng the money
simply to silence her from airing her stories when Koo Cheng-fu was
serving as the country's chief negotiator with China in his capacity
as SEF chairman.</P>
      <P>Branding Teng as a cunning blackmailer, they vowed to clear their
father's reputation through court action and demanded the return of
about NT$100 million allegedly paid by their brother to Teng.</P>

    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ranking official of the German
delegation to the United Nations said Wednesday that he does not
think that Taiwan can make any major breakthrough in its bid to join
the world's leading international organization this year.</P>
      <P>Michael von Ungern-Sternberg, chief of the political division of
the delegation, made the comments while responding to a question
raised by a Central News Agency reporter at a press briefing.</P>
      <P>Under arrangements by the U.S. State Department, a group of 30
journalists from about 20 countries, including two from Taiwan's
Central News Agency and Liberty Times, were invited to participate in
an activity called "U.N. 101" to better their understanding of the
international political situation and the issues related to reform of
the U.N. Security Council.</P>
      <P>In response to a CNA question regarding whether the international
community can "save the situation" on the exclusion of democratic
Taiwan from the United Nations, the German official said that because
of the major influence of large countries in the organization, he
doesn't foresee any changes in the situation regarding Taiwan's U.N.
bid in the near future.</P>
      <P>Many U.N. members have opposed Taiwan's bid to join the
organization, although some U.N. members have expressed their support
for the bid in the past few years, the official also noted.</P>
      <P>The U.N. is scheduled to hold its annual assembly in September,
and the main topic to be discussed at the gathering will be the
reform of the Security Council.</P>
      <P>According to von Ungern-Sternberg, four countries, including
Brazil, Germany, India and Japan, who all want to become permanent
members of the Security Council, have already raised a motion to
express their position in support of increasing the number of
permanent members of the council.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA TO WORK TOWARD PRESIDENT'S ATTENDANCE AT APEC SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will
make every effort to seek President Chen Shui-bian's attendance at
the annual informal leadership meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, a MOFA spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Michel Lu said that although it is a daunting task, the ministry
will continue to speak up for President Chen's right to attend the
meeting.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said last month that he is willing to
attend the 2005 APEC summit -- to be held in South Korea's second
largest city of Busan in November -- under the designation of the
leader of "Chinese Taipei." South Korean media reported later that
the chances of Chen attending the meeting are slim, if not nil.</P>
      <P>Lu said that Taiwan is already the 17th largest economy in the
world, playing a major role in promoting economic development in the
Asia and Pacific region, and that there is no reason for the
international community to shut Taiwan out.</P>
      <P>He said that the major hurdle remains China's relentless
obstruction of Taiwan. The South Korean government has yet to
formally refuse President Chen's attendance at the APEC meeting, he
added.</P>
      <P>Liao Tung-chou, vice director general of MOFA's Department of
International Organizations, said that it is a reasonable request for
President Chen to attend the APEC meeting, adding that the ministry
will work toward that goal.</P>
      <P>APEC is one of the few international organizations that admits
both Taipei and Beijing. Because of Beijing's opposition, the
Republic of China's head of state has been unable to attend previous
APEC annual informal leadership meetings and has instead had to name
a proxy to attend on his behalf.</P>

The explosion that killed 14 marines in Haditha yesterday was

    <HEADLINE>WANG-SOONG MEETING A GOOD THING: NEW KMT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday that
he thinks that a possible meeting between Wang Jin-pyng, the speaker
of the Legislative Yuan, and James Soong, chairman of the opposition
People First Party (PFP), in the United States is a good thing.</P>
      <P>Ma, who was elected July 16 as the opposition Kuomintang's new
chairman, made the comments in response to a media report that Wang
will meet with Soong before he returns to Taiwan. Both Wang and Soong
are currently in the United States on vacation.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that he has not yet had a chance to meet with Soong
since the KMT chairmanship election, Ma said that he feels it is good
if Wang, who is also a KMT vice chairman, can meet with Soong.</P>
      <P>In the KMT chairmanship election, Ma defeated Wang by garnering
72.4 percent of the vote.</P>
      <P>Ma, who will take over his new post as KMT chairman Aug. 18, also
said that he fully supports an exchange of views between a KMT vice
chairman and the PFP head, stressing that he will also try to meet
with Soong in the future.</P>
      <P>Promising that the KMT will work closely together with the PFP
and the New Party, Ma said that cooperation is the only way for the
"pan-blue alliance" to push through its policies in the legislature
where it holds a slight majority.</P>
      <P>"The pan-blue alliance cannot split, or even engage in
confrontation with one another," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Ma also urged the PFP to cooperate with the KMT and the New
Party, saying that "we should cooperate and work on monitoring the
ruling party effectively."</P>
      <P>According to a recent media report, PFP legislative caucus
convener Daniel Hwang has said that the PFP will take a "tough
position" in dealing with matters with other political parties. Some
PFP legislators have also said that they will not make compromises
with the KMT simply for the sake of the unity of the "pan-blue
alliance."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Eight thousand people have been invited
to take part in the 16th "Hunger 30" activity in Kaohsiung on Aug. 13
as a humanitarian gesture to the less fortunate of the world.</P>
      <P>Acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai Thursday thanked World Vision
Taiwan for building a platform through which Taiwan has been able to
show its love of the world.</P>
      <P>Chen said through its medical assistance to the needy and
financial aid to students, World Vision Taiwan has helped more than
750,000 people in 78 countries.</P>
      <P>The upcoming "Hunger 30" activity will be held at the soccer
field of National Sun Yat-sen University in the city. Chen called on
the people to go and experience for themselves how it feels to be
without food for 30 consecutive hours.</P>
      <P>"When we realize what it is like to go hungry for longer than a
day, when we realize the preciousness of life, then we may be more
willing to contribute what we can to the world's humanitarian
efforts, " he said.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with the charity activity, World Vision Taiwan
opened a photo exhibit at the Kaohsiung Cultural Center Thursday
graphically showing relief efforts and children suffering from hunger
in India, Ethiopia and other poor countries.</P>
      <P>The acting mayor urged his fellow citizens to join the hunger
experiencing activity to "show the port city's love and to help

    <HEADLINE>DPP: POLITICAL STRUCTURE OF NCC TO HURT PRESS FREEDOM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If the National Communications Commission
(NCC) members are chosen according to the proportional representation
principle, that would lead to political interference in its
operations and thus hurt press freedom in the nation, the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) legislative caucus said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Reiterating the ruling party's opposition to appointing NCC
members based on political parties' number of seats in the
legislature, caucus Secretary-General William C.T. Lai said the NCC
is supposed to be a watchdog for media consumers whose interests must
be protected by a good system.</P>
      <P>Lai was responding to Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan's
criticism that the KMT and other opposition parties had made a
mistake by not passing the bill to establish the NCC during the last
legislative session, thereby allowing the DPP-controlled Government
Information Office (GIO) to revoke media business licenses, "leaving
a big stain in the history of Taiwan's democracy and freedom."</P>
      <P>Lien has confused audience rights with press freedom, Lai
claimed, adding that it is ridiculous to seek press freedom with an
NCC staffed with political appointees.</P>
      <P>Seven media outlets have had their business licenses withdrawn as
a result of a GIO committee review early this week, including an
all-news channel owned by the Eastern Multimedia Group, triggering
debate and calls for an early establishment of the NCC.</P>
      <P>The KMT and its "pan-blue alliance" partners, the People First
Party and the New Party, who hold a majority of seats in the
Legislative Yuan, have vowed to work together to pass the NCC organic
bill during the next session in September.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC WELCOMES TALKS ON CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) on
Thursday welcomed China's willingness to open talks on cross-Taiwan
Strait charter cargo and passenger flights and services and called
for an early start to negotiations.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level MAC said in a news release that it and the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications will start necessary
arrangements and preparations for the planned negotiations and urged
the outside world to refrain from speculating over the issue to help
secure a smooth process.</P>
      <P>The MAC, however, pointed out that it may require extra
negotiations on charter passenger flights because it is an issue much
more complex than the cargo service.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh announced during a weekly Cabinet meeting
Wednesday that the government is willing to hold bilateral talks
simultaneously on charter cross-strait cargo and passenger flights
with China.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman You Ying-lung told a news conference later the
same day that the government prefers to have cargo charter flights
take place before passenger flights. "We maintain high expectations
and can be flexible," he noted.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's announcement marks a compromise by Taiwan over the
cross-strait direct transport issue, over which Beijing was only
willing to talk about charter passenger flights initially despite
Taiwan's desire to first talk about cargo links to serve Taiwan
businessmen operating in China.</P>
      <P>The government's about-turn was made in part out of a
consideration to meet potential strong demand for passenger services
due to a planned opening to tourists from China, government officials
said, adding that it does not want to see differences over the
charter passenger services stand in the way of opening talks on cargo
transport.</P>

Wednesday that the United States is willing to help Taiwan attend

      <P>Ho Sheng-mao, minister of the Department of Health (DOH) , made

D.C.</P>
      <P>He said that public health and medical care are borderless, and
it is not fair if Taiwan is shut out of the WHO, adding that if there
is a loophole in the world disease control network, the results could

    <TEXT>
      <P>Since a tiny leopard cat was found by a man
in central Taiwan in the wake of Typhoon Haitang on July 18, the
protected animal has been well taken care of by the government's
special animals protection and preservation center.</P>
      <P>Chan Fang-tze, a veterinarian with the center in Chichi, Nantou
County, said when the man accidentally discovered the cat-like
animal, he contacted the center.</P>
      <P>The baby cat was only about 10 centimeters and about two weeks
old. Workers at the center suspect that it might have gotten
separated from its mother during the typhoon.</P>
      <P>After checking the white spots behind its ears, a white line on
its front, and other spots on its body, the center concluded that it
was a leopard cat, also called an ocelot or tiger cat (felis
pardalis).</P>
      <P>The center's staff have been feeding the leopard cat with milk.
It has since doubled in size and is very lively but has yet to cut
its first tooth. When confronted by strangers, it crouches as if to
attack.</P>
      <P>Chan said leopard cats mature at around 12 months of age. The
center will keep feeding it until it is seven or eight months old,
when it will be trained to catch wildlife before being released into
the mountains, he added.</P>
      <P>A grown leopard cat is 107 to 120 centimeters long including the
tail, which is about 38 centimeters, and stands 41 to 46 centimeters

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will develop renewable energy
and carbon dioxide reduction technology as efforts to decrease the
negative impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, a
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The official noted that as Taiwan's carbon dioxide emission
accounts for 1 percent of the world's total, an intraministerial ad
hoc group responsible for energy policy has made the decision to
develop renewable energy such as hydro, wind, solar, geothermal and
biomass power, hydrogen energy and other carbon dioxide reduction
technologies to do less harm to the environment.</P>
      <P>Noting that climate change was the main theme at this year's
Group of Eight meeting, the official said the issue has become a
global political and economic one, especially after the Kyoto
Protocol took effect in February, which aims to limit the global
emission of greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh stressed in February that the country will
see to environmental protection, economic development and social
justice as three sides of a triangle for the country's future
development, according to the official.</P>
      <P>Citing a G-8 report, the CEPD official said climate change will
pose the greatest threat to people, as can be evidenced by the fact
that the world's 10 hottest years in recent memory occurred after
1991.</P>
      <P>Bad as it will be, climate change could also represent potential
trade opportunities, the official said, citing the G-8 report that

equipment could reach US$16 trillion over the next 25 years.</P>

Thursday.</P>
      <P>A total of 5,139 criminal cases were reported to Macau police in

      <P>Police have been asked to step up surveillance at immigration
check points as part of the territory's efforts to prevent Chinese
people from committing crimes in Macau, in particular
gambling-related crime and organized burglary, Cheong said, noting
that the number of illegal property possession cases surged by 23.1
percent in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>According to Cheong, some 2.53 million Chinese backpackers
entered Macau in the first six months of the year, almost double the
previous year's level of 1.44 million. During the same period, some

    <HEADLINE>CHUNGHWA TELECOM TAKES ONE MORE STEP TOWARD PRIVATIZATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>State-run Chunghwa Telecom is taking another
step toward privatization by making 290 million shares available for
private and corporate investors in Taiwan from Aug. 9.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Chunghwa Telecom announced Thursday that
altogether 290 million, or 3 percent, of its shares will be released
this time, and that only citizens of Taiwan are qualified to buy
these shares. This is in addition to the 37 percent of the total
shares released up to the present.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that individual investors will be allowed to
buy the shares first. Those who have an account at any stock
brokerage can apply to buy 3,000 shares each, with the leftover open
to corporate investors, who are allowed to purchase no more than 29
million shares each.</P>
      <P>The price will be determined by the average market price over the
10 days before Aug. 9, and then marked down with a discount of at
least 6 percent. Those who become Chunghwa Telecom's new shareholders
before Aug. 12 will be able to get a NT$4.7 dividend per share.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that Chunghwa Telecom will release an
additional 13 percent of its shares near the end of this year to
overseas investors, so that the company will have fulfilled its goal
of becoming a private enterprise.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom's revenues in the first half of this year
totaled NT$89.7 billion. It is Taiwan's largest telecommunications
company, offering a variety of services.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Chunghwa Telecom's latest move, Premier Frank Hsieh
said that privatization is the trend for every state enterprise, and
that in releasing these shares to let individual investors share its
profits, Chunghwa Telecom can now disperse the fear that after
privatization, the company would be controlled by financial groups.</P>
      <P>Hsieh added that if the individual investors' demand for the
shares is too big, the government may consider releasing more shares.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a spokesman for the opposition People First Party
(PFP) blamed the premier for showing contempt to the Legislative Yuan
because he ignored a resolution of the legislature requiring Chunghwa
Telecom to cease all operations regarding the release of its shares.</P>
      <P>Hwang Yi-jiao, a whip at the PFP's legislative caucus, pointed
out that the previous legislature had passed a resolution introduced
by the PFP, censuring Chunghwa Telecom for having sold the previous
batch of its shares too cheaply to certain financial groups. The
resolution has banned the company from releasing any more shares
until a further decision is made by the new legislature.</P>
      <P>Hwang acknowledged that with the new legislature still in recess,
there is nothing the opposition parties can do, but he said when the
next legislative session opens in September, the PFP caucus will
consider a move to cut the budget of the Ministry of Transportation

    <HEADLINE>NO PEACE TREATY, NO FLY-OVER RIGHT FOR CHINESE PLANES: PREMIER HSIEH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will not allow Chinese commercial
aircraft to fly over its airspace until a peace treaty has been
signed by the two sides, Premier Frank Hsieh said Thursday.</P>
      <P>China has repeatedly threatened to attack Taiwan militarily and
it is targeting missiles at Taiwan, the premier said, adding that "if
Chinese airplanes can fly over us, would they need the missiles?"</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks in an exclusive interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>His decision Wednesday to allow Taiwan's commercial aircraft to
fly over Chinese airspace spurred Taiwan's stock market, but some
people were concerned that China may ask for a reciprocal measure
from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response to these concerns, Hsieh said his answer was a clear
no, because Taiwan is not preparing to "recover the mainland" with
military force whereas China has claimed it is ready to invade Taiwan
and is backing this up with hundreds of missiles targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The premier said Taiwan will not become an obstacle to China's
plan for what Beijing calls its "peaceful rise" only on one condition
-- China must renounce its military threats against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>That's why it is important for China and Taiwan to sign a peace
treaty, he said. He noted that only when such a treaty has been
signed -- when China has given up its threats against Taiwan -- will
the government consider allowing Chinese aircraft to fly over Taiwan.
"Right now we are not even considering it," he said.</P>
      <P>He said the government decided to let Taiwan's aircraft use
Chinese airspace mainly for economic reasons -- to save flight times
and fuel, thereby alleviating the pressure on Taiwan air carriers to
raise ticket prices for their international services.</P>
      <P>In dealing with cross-strait exchanges, "we have to take into
account our needs and our interests, " he said. Sometimes, such
exchanges may not go smoothly because "we also have to consider the
other side's needs and interests," he added.</P>
      <P>He attributed the surge in air carriers' stock prices to an
"atmosphere" in which investors think that the government's policy
will not change abruptly and that the government has actually been
doing things to make them feel reassured.</P>
      <P>"I believe China also needs stability, particularly when its
economy is increasingly internationalized, " Hsieh said. The two
sides of the Strait "have a common interest" in making it easy for
people to forecast future development instead of worrying about
political risks, he said.</P>
      <P>As to the knotty issues between the two sides and how things will
evolve around them, Hsieh said that "time will offer its solutions."
What needs to be done by both governments for now is "to work for the
wellbeing of the people on both sides of the Strait."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SHAOLIN MARTIAL ARTS MONKS ALLOWED TO COME AFTER SCHEDULE CHANGE: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
Thursday Shaolin martial arts monks will be allowed to come to Taiwan
after they have changed their original schedule according to the law.</P>
      <P>The MAC made the about-face after it originally vetoed the trip
by the monks to take part in a martial art demonstration and
short-term kung fu class program.</P>
      <P>A local security firm and several martial art associations had
originally planned to sponsor the program that would have begun last
month. The mainland monks were invited to perform islandwide for 42
days. The monks would then be scattered in 23 places around the
island to provide short-term martial arts classes. More than 4,000
had registered to take part in the classes, with each of them paying
NT$1,200 (US$38.09) for the privilege.</P>
      <P>But the MAC nixed the idea, believing that the Shaolin monks had
not applied to related agencies for approval to come, and the
sponsors had openly advertised the martial art classes.</P>
      <P>MAC officials also said that cross-strait professional exchanges
must follow the group-in, group-out pattern, and the sponsors
intended to send monks all over island to accept students of all
levels and they also wanted to bring the monks over to make money --
all of these are gross violations of the law, they said.</P>
      <P>The sponsors have now agreed to follow the views proposed by the
National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, rearranging the
schedule to adopt a group-in, group-out pattern. MAC Vice Chairman
You Ying-lung said that after the revision, the activity has returned
to the category of cross-strait professional exchanges, with no
commercial activities of charging fees and no certificates given
after the short-term classes, but purely cross-strait martial arts
exchanges.</P>
      <P>You said that the first group of 45 Shaolin martial arts monks
will arrive in Taiwan Aug. 11, and the time of arrival of the second
group of 15 monks has yet to be decided.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN NOT TO LIFT U.S. BEEF IMPORT BAN IN A RUSH: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will not agree to lift a ban on
U.S. beef imports in a rush, Department of Health (DOH) Minister Hou
Sheng-mou said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hou made the remarks in Washington following reports that tests
on a third suspected case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) ,
or mad cow disease, in the United States have proved negative.</P>
      <P>During an informal meeting with a group of Taiwanese reporters
stationed in the United States, Hou said he was happy about the news,
although he was not completely informed about the reports.</P>
      <P>Responding to queries from the U.S. about whether American beef
can be exported to Taiwan again, Hou said his visit did not include
the U.S. Department of Agriculture and that he has not received any
pressure or information from the U.S. on the issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) changed
regulations in May that stipulate that all boneless beef, including
that from countries affected by BSE, should not be subject to
restrictions on trade in beef.</P>
      <P>Despite the rule-change, Hou said the U.S. should respect the
hygiene inspections set by each beef importing country, adding that
the DOH will form an expert committee to screen future U.S. beef
imports, taking into consideration the opinions and data from
academic institutions such as the National Health Research Institute.</P>
      <P>Hou said his agency will make public health its top concern.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned imports of U.S. beef, live cattle and all related
products in December 2003 after the discovery in Washington State of
a single BSE case.</P>
      <P>The island lifted the ban on U.S. boneless beef from animals
under 30 months in April this year, which drew tremendous criticism
from opposition lawmakers after a second mad cow disease was
confirmed in U.S. in June. The DOH then again suspended U.S. beef
imports.</P>

      <P>Tseng Chun-chao, president of the Association of Chinese

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER RULES OUT WATER PRICE HIKE FOR THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Thursday that
domestic water prices will definitely not be raised this year and
that power rates might also not be adjusted upward this year.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks in an exclusive interview with the Central
News Agency.</P>
      <P>Following a more-than 7-percent hike in gasoline and diesel
prices by Taiwan's two major oil products suppliers, many people are
concerned about the possibility of the government raising water and
power rates.</P>
      <P>"For the public's general interests, the government has decided
not to raise water prices this year. As for electricity rates, the
government is studying the best possible options," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Because of ever-growing fossil fuel costs, state-owned Taiwan
Power Co. (Taipower) has been facing strong pressure to raise power
rates and Hsieh said Taipower originally planned to raise power rates
early this year.</P>
      <P>For the sake of maintaining economic stability and keeping
inflation at bay, Hsieh said, Taipower might not raise power rates
before the end of this year. He further said the government is
studying various options that would allow Taipower to reflect its
rising power generation costs while avoiding affecting local
industries' competitive edges and ordinary citizens' interests.</P>
      <P>Touching on the crude oil price upward spiral, Hsieh noted that
the issue is a global one.</P>
      <P>"Oil price hikes will definitely have an impact on economic
growth and consumer prices. As oil price hikes are worldwide, all
countries have been affected as the global economy slows down," Hsieh
said.</P>
      <P>In this era of high energy prices, Hsieh said, the public should
support all energy conservation measures and reusable energy
resource development projects.</P>
      <P>On the domestic economic development, Hsieh went on, the
government will not only prioritize the pursuit of economic growth
but will give equal emphasis to wealth distribution.</P>
      <P>"While sustainable economic growth is important, equitable
distribution of wealth is equally important. The government should
see to it that the fruits of economic growth are enjoyed by everyone.
It would be meaningless if the nation registered a 4 percent or 6
percent economic growth while wages and bank deposit interest remain
unchanged, " Hsieh said, adding that the government will step up
reforms of tax and health insurance systems to make them fairer and
more reasonable.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER: DPP CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE ELECTION IN TAIPEI COUNTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Thursday that the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) cannot afford to lose the election
for Taipei county magistrate at the end of this year because the
battle in the county will be "pivotal" to the ruling party's election
campaign.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, the premier said that overall, the
DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union -- the "pan-green camp" -- are
running neck and neck with the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang,
the People First Party and the New Party in the campaign for the
year-end elections.</P>
      <P>He added that although the DPP candidate for Taipei county, Luo
Wen-jia, is ahead of the other candidates in opinion polls, the DPP
still needs to be very careful in managing the election campaign.</P>
      <P>"We are the ruling party. We cannot afford to lose in Taipei
County," he said.</P>
      <P>The premier calculated that the DPP will not win an overwhelming
victory. "We are unlikely to win in Kinmen and Matsu (two outlying
islands), and might even have problems in one or two of the eight
southern Taiwan counties and cities being contested," he said.</P>
      <P>However, he added, it is also likely that the DPP might win in
one or two of the other counties and cities.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, there are good opportunities for the DPP in
Taichung City, Taichung County, Yunlin County and Miaoli County.</P>
      <P>The premier seemed to draw satisfaction from the fact that his
team at the Executive Yuan, with its popularity rating currently at
over 50 percent, is at least not a burden to the DPP candidates.</P>
      <P>He said the ruling party must try to be very modest and heed the
voice of the people in order to win the elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET NEEDS TO BOOST COMMUNICATION ABILITY: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Franks Hsieh said Thursday that
"tacit understanding" among his Cabinet members has improved but as a
whole, the Cabinet needs to improve its communication ability so the
public can better understand the government's policy initiatives.</P>
      <P>During an exclusive interview with the CNA, the premier also
talked about his relations with President Chen Shui-bian, claiming
that "only outsiders" will say Chen has "hidden dissatisfaction" with
him.</P>
      <P>Over six months into his term as premier, Hsieh said there is
room for improvement for his Cabinet, but "for now there is no plan
for a reshuffle."</P>
      <P>Only when there are cases of incompetency or vacancies will he
consider changes to the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet needs to improve is its communication ability, he
said, adding that many policy initiatives the Cabinet considers
"good" are opposed by many people.</P>
      <P>He said the Ministry of Education is among the government
departments with poor communication ability, citing the
much-criticized tuition policy as an example.</P>
      <P>When a university student pays NT$50,000 (US$1,570) for a
semester, the government actually has to invest between NT$200,000
and NT$250,000 to support him, Hsieh claimed. If he does not even pay
NT$50,000, the country certainly will be adopting a low tuition
policy, he said, noting that it is the public's taxes that are used
to fund college and university education.</P>
      <P>Some critics have claimed that tuition is too high and people
agree with that claim, said the premier.</P>
      <P>Hsieh claimed that poor students are not left behind, "because we
have scholarships and other academic funds totalling NT$17.4 billion
a year" as incentives to those with good academic records and for
loans to needy students.</P>
      <P>Things like that "we are beginning to make clear to people this
year," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Another policy initiative that the government has not
communicated well to the public, according to Hsieh, is health care
insurance premiums.</P>
      <P>If a patient goes to the hospital too often, accumulating big
medical bills but paying very little, it is the public that foots the
bills, he said.</P>
      <P>"The money does not go into the government's pocket and yet
people demand that the government pay for the patient. It isn't right
for the government to pay, because the government's money comes out
of the people's pockets," he said.</P>
      <P>Turning to the interaction between Chen and the Cabinet, the
premier said he regularly meets the president, who tells him how he
feels about each Cabinet member and about Hsieh himself.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SUGGESTS NO PAY HIKES FOR CIVIL SERVANTS IN 2006</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
after a comprehensive review, it is not suitable for the government
to raise salaries for civil servants, military personnel and public
school teachers next year.</P>
      <P>Chen made the suggestion after listening to a Cabinet report on
the 2006 central government budget plan.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh, Minister of Finance Lin Chuan and Hsu
Chang-yao, director-general of the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), jointly presented the draft budget
plan to Chen during a meeting at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu, Presidential Office Secretary-General
Yu Shyi-kun and National Security Council Secretary-General Chiou
I-jen were also present at the meeting.</P>
      <P>After listening to the briefing, Chen gave several suggestions,
including no pay hikes for government employees, military personnel
and public school teachers, but increases in research and development
funding and defense and diplomatic spending.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Cabinet should try its best to realize the goal of
raising the annual R&amp;D spending to 3 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) in 2006 to speed up Taiwan's scientific and
technological development.</P>
      <P>With a view to beefing up Taiwan's self-defense capabilities,
Chen said military spending should be increased to 3 percent of the
GDP in three years.</P>
      <P>In the face of China's relentless diplomatic suppression of
Taiwan and the fact that the nation's foreign aid still falls below
United Nations-set standards, Chen said the diplomatic budget should
be raised at an appropriate rate.</P>
      <P>He further said the law enforcement-related budget should be
raised to accentuate the government's determination to crack down on
crime and maintain law and order.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years, Chen said, government investment in
expanding domestic demand and infrastructure construction have
consistently registered negative growth. In order to boost economic
development and increase job opportunities, he said, the Cabinet
should study the feasibility of increasing spending in those fields.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS-drafted budget plan, the government
revenues are projected at NT$1.4 trillion and the expenditures are
forecast at NT$1.59 trillion, leaving a budget deficit of NT$190
billion. Moreover, the government will have to repay NT$65 billion in
outstanding debts next year. In addition to using a budget surplus of
NT$21.7 billion from the previous year, the government plans to float
NT$239 billion-worth of state bonds to make ends meet.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling and opposition party bickering over
the make-up of the proposed National Communications Commission (NCC)
continued Thursday after Premier Frank Hsieh repeated his opposition
to selecting members in accordance with the number of legislative
seats held by each party.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said political parties should not be involved in such an
important institution so that experts and scholars will have a free
hand to regulate the country's media.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party legislative caucus
Secretary-General William C.T. Lai noted that the opposition parties'
proposal to choose NCC members according to the "proportional
representation" principle will hurt press freedom.</P>
      <P>But the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP)
insisted that there are precedents in other democracies to appoint
NCC members in proportion with political parties' parliamentary
strength.</P>
      <P>According to Huang Yi-chiao, PFP legislative caucus convener, the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) of the United States
"normally" is staffed according to the proportional representation
principle.</P>
      <P>If the Cabinet gets the right to choose the NCC members, it would
be the same as the current Government Information Office, which
controls the experts committee that reviews and decides media
licenses, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT's Central Policy
Committee, claimed that a proportional representation structure of
the NCC best accords with public opinion and would be the "fairest"
NCC structure.</P>
      <P>He said his party was proposing the same thing as Premier Frank
Hsieh -- that the NCC should be composed of scholars and experts
recommended by political parties so that it will not be controlled by
the government and will be a truly independent organization.</P>
      <P>Hung Hsiu-chu, a KMT legislator, noted that all scholars and
experts recommended by political parties will have to be examined by
the general public, and each party will be held accountable for the
integrity and professional competency of the persons it has
recommended.</P>
      <P>In order to make the NCC fair and objective, Ho Min-hao, convener
of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union's legislative caucus,
suggested that nominees to the NCC be elected by professional media

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER: POLITICAL PARTIES SHOULD WITHDRAW FROM MASS MEDIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Thursday that he
supports the establishment of a National Communications Commission
(NCC) to regulate media affairs, but thinks that the new body should
be free from the influence of any political parties.</P>
      <P>Hsieh told the CNA in an interview that he is opposed to the
proposal that the NCC should consist of members appointed by
different political parties in proportion to the number of
legislative seats held by each party.</P>
      <P>Noting that there is strong public sentiment that feels political
forces should not be allowed to meddle in media affairs, Hsieh said
he supports the idea that a media supervisory organization such as
the NCC should be formed, borrowing experience from advanced nations.</P>
      <P>However, he added, political parties should withdraw from media
affairs and let scholars serve on the commission.</P>
      <P>The premier defended the Government Information Office's (GIO's)
decision not to renew the licenses of seven cable TV channels, saying
that under the current system, the GIO is the authority in charge of
such matters and that the GIO would be failing its duty if it did not
enforce the law.</P>
      <P>He denied that the government has used the TV licensing process
as a way to retaliate against TV channels that frequently criticize
the government. "If that had been true, at least seven or eight other
channels would have had their licenses revoked," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also denied media speculation that the TV licensing dispute
involves a power struggle between himself and Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Chairman Su Tseng-chang.</P>
      <P>"Such speculation is groundless and irresponsible, " he said,
adding that it is also an "insult" not only to the review committee
that made the recommendations for the GIO decision, but also to those
TV channels that had their licenses renewed, because it insinuates
that they obtained their licenses not because they could present good
TV programs.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he meets with President Chen Shui-bian at least once a
week and attends the meeting of the DPP Central Standing Committee
regularly to keep party officials informed of the work the Executive
Yuan is doing.</P>
      <P>He added that the DPP is still committed to reforms after five

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh called Thursday for the
passage through the legislature of a special budget for arms
purchases from the United States.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with CNA, Hsieh noted that Taiwan's
difficult political situation needs the assistance of the United
States but said the nation will not drag America into a war with
China.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he added, Taiwan should demonstrate its determination
to provide its own defenses.</P>
      <P>Taiwan plans to purchase eight diesel-electric submarines, six
Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft from the U.S. for a price tag of NT$480
billion but the budget has been blocked by the opposition, which
claims that the price is too high and insists that the arms package
be included in the annual military budget rather than in a special
budget.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that if the purchase is included in the annual military
budget, it will squeeze the budget for some 200 other military
articles that the government plans to purchase annually.</P>
      <P>In addition, the annual military budget plus the special arms
budget will only account for 2.8 percent of the country's gross
domestic product, less than the 3 percent proposed by President
Chen Shui-bian, Hsieh added.</P>
      <P>Hsieh urged the Legislative Yuan to convene a special session to
discuss urgent bills such as the arms purchase and a flood-control
bill.</P>
      <P>The legislature went into recess at the end of May and will begin
its next session in mid-September.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has many problems to resolve and the tenure of
the legislators is so short, Hsieh urged the lawmakers not to waste
time and to think of the welfare of the people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT WARNS FARMERS NOT TO WALK INTO CHINA'S `TRAP'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged Taiwanese
farmers not to walk into what he claimed is "the trap" set by China
when it offered tariff-free treatment for Taiwan fruit imports.</P>
      <P>In an interview with Japanese Shincho Weekly, Chen said Taiwan
businessmen should understand that their investment in China is
risky, evidenced by Chi Mei Group Chairman Hsu Wen-lung, whose
investment was blocked at one point by the Chinese authorities due to
his pro-Taiwan independence stance.</P>
      <P>Chen said China, which has deployed 706 missiles targeting
Taiwan, is hostile toward Taiwan and he urged Taiwanese businessmen
with operations in China to either bring their money back to Taiwan
or put it into other countries.</P>
      <P>Noting that although Taiwan will be the first victim of China's
"military rise, " Chen said the island will not enter an arms race
with China but will secure a sufficient defense capability.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he expressed gratitude to the United States and Japan
for their opposition to China's enactment of its "Anti-Secession Law,
" which authorizes Beijing to use military force against Taiwan
should the nation move toward formal independence, as well as for
their objection to some European countries' proposal to lift an
embargo by the European Union on military sales to China.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the U.S. and Japan, which maintain no diplomatic ties
with Taiwan, to conduct military exchanges or cooperation with Taiwan
to ensure peace and stability in East Asia.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>City and county governments in northern
Taiwan announced late Thursday that all government offices and
schools will be closed Friday in anticipation of typhoon Matsa.</P>
      <P>A Taipei city government official quoted Central Weather Bureau
(CWB) reports as saying that Matsa will lash northern Taiwan with
strong wind and heavy rain Friday, qualifying for the closure of
government offices and schools in the city.</P>
      <P>As a result, all central government offices as well as financial
markets, including stock and currency exchanges, will be closed
Friday. Meanwhile, the governments of Taipei County, Keelung City,
Ilan County, Taoyuan County and Hsinchu County made similar
announcements. Government offices in Hsinchu City will operate
normally but all schools in the city will be closed.</P>
      <P>At 10 p.m., the typhoon was centered in the Pacific Ocean about
220 km east of Ilan, CWB meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Matsa, named after a Laotian fish, was moving
north-northwest at a speed of 14 kph, packing sustained winds of 144
kph, the meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>The CWB issued a land warning early Thursday, saying the storm is
likely to bring heavy rain to the island's northern and northeastern
parts.</P>
      <P>According to CWB officials, the fringe of the typhoon could bring
heavy rain to northern Taiwan late Thursday through Friday morning.
They warned that mountainous regions should be prepared for
torrential downpours and landslides, with a danger of flooding in
low-lying areas in the north and northeast, the bureau said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Paris,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Y.S. Lo and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An influential organization fighting for
press freedom around the world on Thursday called the Taiwan
authorities' decision not to renew the operating licenses of seven
cable TV stations a violation of press freedom and urged Premier
Frank Hsieh to rescind the decision.</P>
      <P>The government's Satellite Broadcasting Business Review Committee
(SBBRC) decided July 31 not to renew the licenses of ETTV-S cable
news station and six others and gave them two days to stop
broadcasting.</P>
      <P>"This decision clearly constitutes a serious press freedom
violation and a disturbing signal to cable TV operators and TV
executives, who will now have to work with a threat hanging over
them," the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders said in a statement.</P>
      <P>The organization demanded that the premier ensure that the
licenses of the seven cable stations will be renewed.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that it is unacceptable that the broadcast licence
system should be subordinated to political interests, Reporters
Without Borders said that "the Taiwanese government should put an end
to such an arbitrary system and create a fully independent entity to
issue licenses."</P>
      <P>It also noted that the closure of ETTV-S, which is owned by
Eastern Multimedia Group and which has never had any trouble getting
its license renewed in the past, has put more than 300 employees out
of work.</P>
      <P>In response to the outcry against the decision, the premier said
one day after the announcement that the SBBRC's refusal to renew the
licenses was justified based on considerations of the stations'
financial problems and their programming which he said included "the
presence of pornographic content" and "journalistic irresponsibility"
in news coverage. The premier also insisted that "everything was done
according to the rules."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA WELCOMES JAPAN GRANTING PERMANENT VISA WAIVER FOR TAIWAN TOURISTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said Friday it welcomes passage by the Japanese House of Councilors,
or upper house of the Japanese Diet, earlier in the day a revised
bill that grants permanent visa-free treatment for Taiwan tourists.</P>
      <P>The House of the Representatives, or lower house of the Japanese
Diet, passed the bill Tuesday.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said that the Japanese Cabinet is
expected to soon announce the permanent waiver of the visa
requirement for Taiwan tourists, which will be put into practice
Sept. 26, or the day after the closing of Expo 2005 Aichi in central
Japan.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, the Japanese parliament passed a special bill
to grant 90-day, visa-free entry to Taiwan visitors from March 25
through Sept. 25 in connection with the Aichi expo.</P>
      <P>With the temporary visa waiver period soon to expire, Japanese
parliamentarians decided to pass a new bill to allow for permanent
visa-free status for Taiwan citizens. Japan's existing exit and entry
regulations only authorize visa waivers for citizens from countries
that maintain formal diplomatic relations with Japan.</P>
      <P>Lu urged Taiwan tourists to cherish the "hard-earned preferential
treatment" for Taiwan and to abide by the law during their travels in
Japan.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said that China had tried to obstruct every step
of the way during the reviews of the bill and had asked that Chinese
tourists be given the same visa waiver treatment. However, based on
the record of Chinese tourists violating the law, Japanese lawmakers
refused to budge on granting preferential treatment to mainland
citizens out of concerns for law and order.</P>
      <P>The officials said the bill's passage demonstrates that Japan
attaches great importance to its relations with Taiwan. They added
that the move will boost Taiwan tourist arrivals in Japan from the
current figure of just over 1 million per year to between 1.3 million
and 1.4 million per year. Taiwan is Japan's second-largest source of
foreign tourists after South Korea.</P>

      <P>Former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung called on the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
chairman-elect, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, at Taipei City Hall
Friday.</P>
      <P>During their meeting, Ma, who defeated Legislative Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng in a bitter KMT chairmanship election last month, told Lin
that a proposed party law ought to stipulate that the Election and
Recall Law should also apply to party elections.</P>
      <P>He noted that graft is still common in Taiwan elections, even at
the level of party elections. Saying that party chairmanship
elections are no less important than those for township and village
chiefs, he added that the law should also apply to party elections if
it is applied to township and village chief elections.</P>
      <P>Lin expressed full support for Ma's views, saying that ridding
party elections of graft is as important as rooting it out in
elections for public officials.</P>
      <P>Ma also reported to Lin on the city government's efforts to
preserve local culture and heal the wounds of the 228 Incident.</P>
      <P>He said the city is preparing to issue video discs documenting
the life of Chiang Wei-shui (1891-1931) , a peaceful anti-Japanese
activist, and to help establish a Lin Mao-sheng memorial in Taipei.
Lin, former dean of the College of Liberal Arts of National Taiwan
University, died in the 228 Incident, which broadly refers to events
of late February 1947 that culminated in the systematic killing of
thousands of members of the local elite.</P>
      <P>During their meeting, Lin also presented Ma with two books he has
written on mercy, hope and love, and said he was paying the visit to
Ma mainly to congratulate him on his victory in the KMT chairmanship
election and to express the hope that Ma can contribute to the nation
in his KMT chairman position.</P>
      <P>Lin also denied that he carried any message on behalf of
President Chen Shui-bian to the Taipei mayor.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman-elect
Ma Ying-jeou suggested Friday the enactment of a political party law
to govern party affairs, including party assets, instead of just
making a "political party assets law" that he claimed will be used to
target the KMT's assets.</P>
      <P>In response to Premier Frank Hsieh's offer to draft a statute to
govern political parties' assets, Ma said it would not befit a
democratic country to legislate a law that governs only political
parties' assets.</P>
      <P>He noted that once such a law has been enacted, efforts will
likely be made to purge the KMT of its properties and other assets.
Ma has pledged to handle the question of KMT assets when he takes
over the party helm Aug. 19.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the Executive Yuan expand the draft statute to
cover all political party-related affairs, including the election of
party representatives, claiming that the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), like all of Taiwan's political parties, has
been troubled by problems of fake memberships and vote-buying during

      <P>Koh Se-kai made the remarks after the Japanese House of
Councilors, or the upper house of the Japanese Diet, passed a bill
earlier in the day that grants permanent visa-free treatment for
Taiwan tourists.</P>
      <P>The bill had already cleared the even more powerful House of
Representatives, or the lower house of the Japanese Diet, Tuesday.
The Japanese government is expected to soon announce the permanent
waiver of visa requirements for Taiwan tourists, which will be
enforced from Sept. 26, one day after the close of the
eco-friendly World Exposition in the central Japanese prefecture of
Aichi.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, the Japanese parliament passed a special bill
to grant 90-day, visa-free entry to Taiwan visitors from March 25
through Sept. 25 in connection with the Aichi expo. With the
temporary visa waiver period soon to expire, Japanese
parliamentarians decided to pass a new bill to allow for permanent
visa-free status for Taiwan passport holders.</P>
      <P>According to Koh, China has tried hard to block Japan from
enacting the permanent visa waiver bill under the excuse of its "one
China" principle. However, China failed to reach its goal because the
bill will contribute to Japan's drive to double its tourist arrivals
from 5.73 million in 2003 to 10 million in 2010, Koh said.</P>
      <P>Since Japan began permitting visa-free entry for Taiwan tourists
in March, Koh said, the tourists have lived up to Japan's
expectations, with the number rising, no criminal cases involving
Taiwan tourists reported and strong purchase power demonstrated.
Each Taiwan tourist spends an average of US$170 during their stays in
Japan, comparable to Japanese people's consumption level.</P>
      <P>Noting that the enactment of permanent visa-free treatment is
expected to attract even more Taiwan tourists to Japan, Koh said he
looks forward to the day that substantive relations between the two
countries can become closer through increased civilian exchanges and
mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>Since assuming his current post in July 2004, Koh said he has
proposed to the Japanese authorities many measures to further boost
bilateral relations, including the permanent visa waiver.</P>
      <P>Koh said that in the future, he will focus on lobbying Japan to
improve the bilateral engagement mechanism. Stressing that the
mechanism -- formulated in 1972 following Japan's switching of
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing -- has become obsolete,
Koh said Japan should make an overall review and forge a more
effective mechanism to facilitate bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>Under the 1972 mechanism, both Taipei and Tokyo set up
intermediary bodies -- the Taipei-based Association of East Asian
Relations and the Tokyo-based Interchange Association -- to handle
bilateral exchanges in the absence of direct official contacts.</P>
      <P>Now that Japan has explicitly singled out Taiwan Strait peace as
a common strategic objective of the U.S.-Japan defense cooperation
treaty, Koh said Japan should not continue resisting improvements to
communication channels with Taiwan simply for fear of offending
China.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Crop losses around Taiwan caused by typhoon
Matsa had hit NT$4.48 million (US$140,970) as of 11 a.m. Friday, the
Council of Agriculture (COA) reported.</P>
      <P>Around 114 hectares of cropland was devastated by the second
typhoon to hit Taiwan this year. COA officials said the council has
informed farmers' groups to release frozen stocks to help maintain
market supply.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei Agricultural Products Marketing Co.,
vegetable prices were recorded at N$36.8 per kilogram on average
Friday, a drop of NT$0.95 from the level of the previous day, while a
total of 1,005 tons of leafy vegetables were shipped to the wholesale
market in Taipei, posting a 30-ton increase over the level of a day
earlier.</P>
      <P>COA officials said the supply is stable because the major
vegetable production areas of the country, located in the central and
southern parts of the island, were spared by the typhoon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as of 11 a.m. Friday, 14,000 households around the
island were still lacking power after supplies to 50,000 households
islandwide were cut due to the typhoon, according to Taiwan Power
Company.</P>
      <P>As of 2 p.m., the typhoon was located about 240 km northeast of
Taipei, moving north northwest at a speed of 14 kph, meteorologists
of the Central Weather Bureau said, noting that the fringe of the
storm was expected to pass Taiwan later that night.</P>
      <P>While the typhoon brought rain to the island's northern and
northeastern parts, mountainous regions south of Hsinchu should be
prepared for torrential downpours and landslides, with a danger of
flooding in low-lying areas in the north and northeast, the
meteorologists warned.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TYPHOON HAS PASSED BUT DANGER REMAINS: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The residents of Taiwan must not let down
their guard even though the brunt of Typhoon Matsa has passed the
island, said Premier Frank Hsieh Friday, adding that torrential rains
in central and southern Taiwan are still likely.</P>
      <P>The premier made the comments while touring the Central Disaster
Prevention and Relief Center. He said the all agencies must
coordinate to effectively take care of citizens who need help in the
aftermath of the typhoon, adding that consumer prices must remain
stable in the near term.</P>
      <P>The premier said past experience has shown that after a typhoon
leaves Taiwan, the public becomes lax and unexpected accidents occur.</P>
      <P>He said that the possibility of more heavy rains in the central
and southern parts of the island is high and people ought to be aware
of this, along with storm surges in coastal areas and mudslides in
mountainous regions.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also warned people to avoid drinking water that could be
polluted from the typhoon so as not to become infected with
meliodiosis, an infectious disease caused by the burkholderia
pseudomallei bacterium. The bacteria are found in contaminated water
and soil and are spread to humans and animals through direct contact
with the contaminated source.</P>
      <P>Seven people died and more than 20 people were hospitalized after
being infected with meliodiosis in the wake of the previous typhoon,
Haitang, which hit Taiwan in mid-July.</P>
      <P>Regarding the soaring prices of vegetables after each typhoon,
Hsieh said the farmers' associations have released 1,200 tons of
vegetables, which he said should be sufficient for the public.</P>
      <P>On the mudslides in the wake of the typhoon, which have
contaminated water sources in Hsinchu and Taoyuan in northern Taiwan,
Hsieh said that agencies should review and address the problem.</P>

Wall Street Journal: To Soothe Anger over Subsidies, U.S. Cotton
Tries Wooing Africa

The deputy undersecretary at the U.S. Department of Agriculture
met with local cotton farmers in Mali and promised American help to
boost productivity.

The trip was part of an extraordinary effort to lend a hand to
African cotton farmers. But the prime motivation wasn't altruistic.

West African nations, newly assertive in global trade
negotiations, are agitating for the abolition of subsidies essential
to the prosperity of many American farmers.

The U.S. is fending off an uprising by have-nots such as Mali and
Benin, and emerging farm powers Brazil and India, which are turning
the rules of the World Trade Organization to their advantage.

In February 2003, Brazil challenged a host of U.S. cotton
subsidies in the WTO on the grounds that they distort trade.

Earlier this year, the WTO ruled in Brazil's favor against a U.S.
subsidy that aids cotton exports, the first time an American farm
subsidy has been struck down.
U.S. Congress is mulling changes to the program to conform with the
decision.</TEXT>

(By Chen-yi Liao and S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first batch of duty free Taiwan fruits
were put on display at Beijing's Juntai Department Store Friday
accompanied by a frenzied media circus.</P>
      <P>Reporters from Beijing's print and electronic media swarmed to
the store's special area to take a look at Taiwan's star fruits, wax
apples and others. At one point, reporters outnumbered customers.</P>
      <P>Store employees were on hand to explain to curious Beijingers how
to enjoy custard apples and wax apples. People were delighted by the
sales people's promotional efforts as well as the fruits themselves.</P>
      <P>Lu Zhengyu, manager of Chunlin Import Company, said recent
typhoons and the start of the "Ghost Month" Friday in Taiwan have
driven up prices at the source, shrinking his profit margin.</P>
      <P>During the lunar month of July, demand for fruit usually goes up
in Taiwan as it is a custom to offer fruits and other foods to "ghost
brothers" in the hope that they will not disturb humans.</P>
      <P>Juntai Department Store began promoting the fruits from Taiwan
two days ago and will continue for a couple more days, Lu said.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, sales of Taiwan fruits in Beijing have been
"better than expected." Juntai's first day sales exceeded 15,000 yuan
(NT$60,000 or US$1,888), and over 50,000 yuan-worth is expected to be
sold over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Chunlin Import Company said zero-tariff treatment for Taiwan
fruits has not changed the fact that they remain quite expensive in
Beijing. For instance, star fruits and guavas sell for 16 yuan per
jin or 32 yuan (NT$125) per kilogram.</P>
      <P>The importer added that Taiwan papayas sell for 20 yuan (NT$78) a
kilo and pineapples, 19 yuan (NT$74) a kilo. When pineapple is on
sale, the price will not go below 10 yuan (NT$40) a kilo.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARMS PROCUREMENT BUDGET PLANNING TO BE ADJUSTED: CABINET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has agreed to adjust its
budget appropriations for a long-stalled arms procurement package in
order to facilitate its passage through the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan, Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said Friday.</P>
      <P>Cho made the remarks a day after President Chen Shui-bian said
certain items in the arms procurement package can be financed with
funds to be appropriated from the military's regular annual budget.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks were seen a government concession aimed at winning
support from the opposition "pan-blue alliance" for the arms
procurement package.</P>
      <P>The opposition-controlled legislative Procedure Committee has
stonewalled the inclusion of two arms procurement-related bills from
being put on the legislative agenda in the past two sessions,
depriving other lawmakers of the opportunity to debate the critical
military procurement.</P>
      <P>The two bills in question will pave the way for procuring eight
diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the
United States. One bill will authorize the administration to prepare
a special budget for the NT$480 billion arms procurement package over
a period of 15 years, the other bill is regarding budget
appropriations for the package.</P>
      <P>Cho said the government's 2006 budget plan will be re-arranged in
line with President Chen's directive. As to details regarding the
items and amount, Cho said the Ministry of National Defense (MND)
will figure this out later.</P>
      <P>"The MND is studying which item or items can be included in its
annual budget plan, how much money is needed and how many years the
budget plan should span," Cho said.</P>
      <P>If all three of the items are covered in the MND's regular annual
budget, Cho said, it may hinder other defense development projects.</P>
      <P>Quoting Premier Frank Hsieh, Cho said the government's total
expenditure for 2006 will not exceed NT$1.6 trillion.</P>
      <P>After listening to a briefing on the government's 2006 budget
plan Thursday, President Chen said military spending should be
increased to 3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in three
years with a view to beefing up Taiwan's self-defense capabilities in
the face of China's growing military threat.</P>
      <P>Cho said the Cabinet will make an overall review of its budget
plan before determining how much the defense budget can be increased
next year.</P>
      <P>Commenting on reports about the government's plan to re-arrange
the budget plan for the long-stalled arms procurement package,
William Lai, a legislative whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , said the Cabinet should refrain from taking the
initiative to re-arrange its budget plan until after a consensus has
been reached through cross-party consultations.</P>
      <P>"Without a prior cross-party consensus, the government could risk
'falling into an abyss' if it makes any unilateral concession, " Lai
cautioned. To the best of his understanding, Lai said some "pan-blue
alliance" lawmakers in the Legislative Defense Committee and the
Legislative Procedural Committee had suggested that submarines and
anti-submarine aircraft be covered under a special budget plan while
the Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries be financed by the MND's
regular annual budget.</P>
      <P>"Moreover, it would be easier for the opposition parties to
accept if the special budget be cut to NT$300 billion or NT$350
billion," Lai said.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Wen-chung, also a co-convener of the
Legislative Defense Committee, echoed Lai's view, saying that unless
reaching a cross-party consensus in advance, the Cabinet should refer
its original NT$480 billion special budget bill to the legislature
and let the opposition parties to trim the amount to their desired
level.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the Taiwan Solidarity Union -- a DPP
ally -- said it would be happy to see some items of the procurement
package be covered by the regular military budget. It suggested that
as the United States has 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft in stock for
delivery to Taiwan, they should be covered the MND's regular budget
while the submarines and the Patriot anti-missile batteries can be
financed by a special budget.</P>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said it welcomes the DPP
administration's consent to its longtime advocacy that part of the
arms procurement package be covered by regular budget and part of it
financed by a special budget.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, a KMT legislative whip, claimed the DPP's
about-face was a victory for the opposition "pan-blue alliance."</P>
      <P>The KMT's "pan-blue alliance" ally, the People First Party (PFP),
said the DPP has finally moved in the right direction as far as the
arms procurement project is concerned.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, PFP legislative whip Huang Yi-chiao said even if
the DPP administration re-arranges its budget plan, the PFP may not
necessarily endorse the two arms procurement bills.</P>
      <P>"We'll screen the bills based on a combination of factors,
including the nation's overall financial situation and practical
defense needs," Huang said.

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) posted a
growth of 2.37 percent in July over the same period of last year, the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said
Friday, ascribing the surge to the skyrocketing prices of vegetables
and fruits due to floods caused by Typhoon Haitang in mid-July.</P>
      <P>With Typhoon Matsa sweeping through Taiwan on Friday, the second
typhoon passing the island this year, it's possible that food prices
could stay high in August, impacting the CPI for that month, DGBAS
officials said.</P>
      <P>Besides typhoons, the fact that the state-run Chinese Petroleum
Corp. hiked its prices for fuel oil and natural gas by 7 percent and
3 percent Tuesday could push commodity prices further up in the
upcoming months, they said.</P>
      <P>However, under an established formula, if oil prices are raised
10 percent for a time of one year, the CPI is expected to climb 0.39
percentage points, so the recent oil price hikes are not likely to
push the CPI to grow more than 0.2 percentage points this year, the
officials added.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS estimates that the CPI will rise 1.7 percent this year
over the previous year. A review of this estimate will be made at
some time in mid-August, the officials said.</P>

      <P>The legislative caucus of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) reiterated Friday that if an extra
legislative session is held during the summer recess, it should only
screen the bill regarding flood control.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng is scheduled to return
from a trip to the United States Aug. 10. He already asked
legislative staff to arrange for cross-party consultations Aug. 11 to
discuss the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative
caucus' request to hold a special legislative session to address
several long-stalled bills.</P>
      <P>According to Wang's promise prior to his departure for the U.S.,
an informal legislative gathering will be held Aug. 12 to discuss
issues regarding the proposed special legislative session.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative whip Tseng Yung-chuan said Friday the KMT would
not budge from its stance that the proposed special legislative
session only address the Cabinet-drafted eight-year, NT$80 billion
flood-control bill.</P>
      <P>"If the DPP insists on including other bills onto the agenda, the
KMT will call for a vote during the Aug. 12 informal meeting on the
agenda issue," Tseng said.</P>
      <P>The KMT and its "pan-blue alliance" ally, the People First Party
(PFP) , jointly control a slim majority in the legislature and have
boycotted the DPP's policy initiatives at every turn in the past five
years.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative whip Huang Yi-chiao said his party is opposed to
holding a special legislative session during the current summer
recess.</P>
      <P>"We have on many occasions articulated our opposition to the
holding of an extra legislative session. Our stance remains
unchanged, " Huang said, adding that he plans to attend the Aug. 11
consultations among legislative whips of parties of different
political stripes to express the party's stance.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative whip William Lai said he will pay courtesy calls
on opposition legislative caucuses before the Aug. 12 informal
legislative meeting to solicit their support for the party's proposal
that an extra legislative session be held to address six urgent
bills, including the flood-control bill, the arms procurement package
and confirmation of the Control Yuan nominations.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the opposition parties can put the overall national
interest above their partisan feelings and agree to hold an extra
session to address all those long-stalled and very critical bills, "
Lai said.</P>
      <P>The DPP's ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), said it looks
forward to an early passage of the flood-control bill.</P>
      <P>"While we would be pleased to see all the six DPP-sponsored bills
clear the legislative floor as early as possible, our top goal is to
have the flood-control bill passed as soon as possible for the common

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The water supply to 635,000 households in
Taoyuan County will be cut to every other day because Typhoon Matsa
has muddied the water in the Shihmen Reservoir, which provides water
to the water purification plant in Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>Officials from the water plant said the water provided by the
reservoir was too muddy to be treated and the plant has to
alternate its supply to customers ever other day beginning from
Saturday because of the heavy rain brought by Matsa, which swept
through Taiwan Friday.</P>
      <P>It was the second time in two consecutive years that the
operation of the plant has ground to a halt in the wake of a typhoon
that brought large amounts of rainfall to the catchment of the
reservoir and increased the turbidity of the water by bringing down
lots of mud and stirred up the sediment on the bottom of the
reservoir.</P>
      <P>The root cause of this problem is the change of stratum in the
reservoir's catchment prompted by the earthquake of Sept. 21, 1999,
according to the officials.</P>
      <P>As a result, the earth of the catchment is more vulnerable to
erosion and mudslides happen more often during rainfall, not to
mention that the sediment which has deposit on the bottom of the
40-year-old reservoir and has almost silted up the body of water
completely.</P>
      <P>The officials said they tried to get around the problems by
building a tunnel at the bottom of the reservoir to help release the
sediment and raise the water intake to near the surface but neither
projects are finished.</P>
      <P>That means the shortage of water in Taoyuan might occur again
should another typhoon hit the island this year, the officials said.</P>

the three-and-a-half years, 8,330 voyages were made using the

    <HEADLINE>NEW KMT CHAIRMAN URGED TO PUSH FOR QUICK PASSAGE OF ARMS PACKAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By C.C. Lin and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Caucus in the U.S. House of
Representatives recently sent a letter to opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman-elect Ma Ying-jeou, urging him to work for quick passage of
a special arms procurement package in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The letter, which was jointly signed by three co-chairs of the
caucus, including Reps. Robert Wexler (D-Fla.), Steve Chabot (R-Ohio)
and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), was sent to Ma Aug. 1.</P>
      <P>Besides congratulating Ma on his July 16 election as the new
chairman of the KMT, the representatives said in the letter that they
want to reassure the new KMT head that the United States is fully
committed to the security, prosperity and future of the people of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"All of us in the Congressional Taiwan Caucus are long-time
friends and supporters of Taiwan and have closely followed Taiwan's
remarkable path towards a flourishing multi-party democracy that
respects human rights and the rule of law," they said in the letter.</P>
      <P>They also said that they now look to Ma, in the tradition of past
KMT chairman, to join them in enhancing the long-standing partnership
and economic, cultural and security cooperation between Taiwan and
the United States.</P>
      <P>"In particular, we urge you, as the new chairman of the
Kuomintang, to lead efforts in Taipei to ensure that the Legislative
Yuan quickly passes a special arms procurement package or increases
its annual defense spending, " the representatives further said,
adding that "we believe as you do that cooperation between Taipei and
Washington is paramount to Taiwan's security and is in the mutual
interest of both nations."</P>
      <P>The co-chairs also said that they would like to invite Ma to
visit Washington, D.C. in September to address members of the caucus
and engage in a dialogue relating to Taiwan-U.S. relations.</P>
      <P>"Given the myriad of complex and difficult issues facing the two
countries in the coming years, we believe your visit will be a
positive step towards enhancing this historic partnership, " they
continued.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, a similar letter signed jointly by 33 members
of the caucus was sent to KMT Chairman Lien Chan, who will step down
Aug. 18, calling for him to help stop the oppositions' boycott
against the passage of the arms procurement package in the
legislature as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The arms procurement package put forward by the Ministry of
National Defense has been stalled for months in the Legislative Yuan
due to opposition by lawmakers of the KMT and its ally, the People
First Party.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry, the items on the procurement list
include eight diesel-powered submarines, six Patriot PAC-III
anti-missile batteries and 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'MINI THREE LINKS' VISIT TO CHINA 'GOOD IDEA': MA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Chairman-elect Ma
Ying-jeou said Saturday that he currently has no plans to visit China
but that he believes a visit to the mainland via the "mini three
links" route would be a good idea.</P>
      <P>Ma also reiterated his promise to enlarge the "mini three links"
-- referring to the direct trade, mail, and shipping links between
Taiwan's two outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu and mainland
China's Xiamen and Fuzhou ports in Fujian Province -- which were
implemented in January 2001.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is now Taipei City mayor, made the remarks during his
visit to Kinmen -- part of his around-Taiwan visit aimed at
soliciting the opinions of KMT members for the future reform of the
party.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that there were a total of 20,000 visits via the
"mini three links" in the first year after the opening and that the
figure is expected to exceed 500,000 this year, Ma said this reflects
the strong desire of the Taiwan people to visit the mainland. He
added that the role of China as the "world's factory" cannot be
ignored.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that he has been promoting the "mini three links " for a
long time, saying that the links can save a lot of time for Taiwan
people traveling to the mainland, who in the past had to shuttle
between the two sides of Taiwan Strait via Hong Kong or Macau.</P>
      <P>Concerning the initiatives proposed by Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng, who was defeated by Ma in the KMT chairmanship
election July 16, to further promote cross-strait exchanges, Ma said

    <HEADLINE>MND YET TO DECIDE ON WHICH ARMS TO BE LISTED UNDER ANNUAL BUDGET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) said
Saturday that it has yet to decide on which items of an arms
procurement package to place in its regular annual budget as it has
yet to receive directives from the Presidential Office and the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>MND officials were responding to media reports that in order to
facilitate passage of the arms procurement package by the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan, the MND will not insist on
all three items of the NT$480 billion (US$15.24 billion) package
being financed by a special budget.</P>
      <P>The three items in the arms procurement from the United States to
be financed over a 15-year period are six Patriot PAC-III
anti-missile batteries, eight diesel-fueled submarines, and a
squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.</P>
      <P>According to the media reports, the MND hopes to have the
submarines and aircraft financed by a special budget, with the
Patriot batteries to be included in the (ministry's) regular annual
budget.</P>
      <P>One day after President Chen Shui-bian said that certain items of
the arms procurement package could be financed with funds to be
appropriated for the military's regular annual budget, a spokesman of
the Executive Yuan said Friday that the Cabinet will make necessary
adjustments in its annual budget for next year but that the MND will
study which items, the amount, and the financing period of the
package to be listed in the regular annual budget.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and
the People First Party (PFP) have blocked the arms procurement
package from being put on the legislative agenda in the past two
sessions, mainly because of the high price tag and the manner of
financing it with a special budget.</P>
      <P>However, a ray of hope seems to have appeared for the arms
procurement package as outgoing KMT Chairman Lien Chan has said his
party could accept a special budget if a proper amount of the funds
for the package are included in the military's regular annual budget.</P>
      <P>If the administration "doesn't create further trouble, " the
Legislative Yuan could pass the arms procurement package in the next
session, he further said.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman-elect Ma Ying-jeou said that he will not oppose the
arms procurement package simply because it is listed under a special
budget.</P>
      <P>Ma, who recently received a letter from the Taiwan Caucus -- a
pro-Taiwan group in the U.S. House of Representatives -- urging him
to work for early passage of the arms procurement package, said that
the KMT could agree to some items in the package being financed with
a special budget.</P>
      <P>Ma said he gives his "conditional support" for the arms
procurement package, adding that a due amount of spending on national
defense is necessary and that his party should review the issue in a
rational way.</P>
      <P>However, Sun Ta-chien, a whip of the PFP caucus in the
Legislative Yuan, said that special budgets should not become common
practice, especially at a time when the government's financial
situation is worsening. Sun also said that lawmakers have to consider
the "urgency, necessity and price tag" of each item of the arms
procurement separately.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, PFP Legislator Lin Yu-fang said that whether to
finance the arms procurement package with a special budget or in the
regular annual budget is beside the point, stressing that what
matters is that the KMT and the PFP make a prior assessment of
defense needs, costs, and industrial cooperation deals as well as
possible cross-strait tension triggered by the arms procurement.</P>
      <P>Lin said he will soon call on KMT Chairman-elect Ma to discuss
the arms procurement issues with him.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After a year-long crackdown on commercial
piracy, Taiwan has successfully had its name removed from the IFPI's
watch list of 10 countries with high piracy rates, the Intellectual
Property Office (IPO) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The IPO quoted the 2005 IFPI business piracy report as saying
that Taiwan was no longer among the 31 countries that the IFPI found
to have larger domestic sales of pirated music CDs than of genuine
copies last year.</P>
      <P>The IFPI represents the recording industry worldwide with over
1,450 members in 75 countries and affiliated industry associations in
48 countries.</P>
      <P>One-third of the music CDs sold in markets around the world last
year were pirated copies, representing 1.2 billion copies at a total
value of US$4.6 billion -- a figure which does not include illegal
downloading from the Internet, according to the IFPI report.</P>
      <P>Besides Taiwan, Canada and South Korea were also taken off the
list due to their improved piracy situation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in the latest assessment by the International
Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) , a coalition of associations
representing U.S. copyright-based industries, Taiwan saw losses of
some US$320.4 million in the recording business due to piracy over
the past year, for a drop of 31 percent from the previous year's
figure.</P>
      <P>The IIPA also assessed that Taiwan's movie piracy rate decreased
from the 44 percent registered in 2003 to 40 percent in 2004, while
the music piracy rate dropped from 42 percent to 36 percent,
according to the IPO.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the improved records, the IPO is further expanding
its intellectual property protection efforts to the software industry
in the hopes of seeing Taiwan cut its software piracy rate to less
than 40 percent, IPO officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO MAJOR INTRAPARTY PERSONNEL CHANGE BEFORE YEAR-END ELECTIONS: MA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman-elect
Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday that there will be no major intraparty
personnel reshuffle before the Dec. 3 "three-in-one" elections.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is incumbent mayor of Taipei and is set to assume the KMT
chairmanship Aug. 19, made the remarks while meeting KMT
rank-and-file members on the outlying island of Kinmen, which lies
closer to China than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, many party members urged Ma to push for
sweeping intraparty reforms after taking over the party's helm,
including direct elections of local chapter heads by rank-and-file
members.</P>
      <P>Noting that his determination to launch wide-ranging party
reforms is beyond question, Ma said timing is very important to the
fate of a reform program.</P>
      <P>For instance, Ma said, the KMT's decision-making Central Standing
Committee already passed a resolution in March this year requiring
direct elections for local chapter heads. </P>
      <P>"But less than four months are left before the Dec. 3
simultaneous elections for city mayors/county magistrates,
city/county councilors and township chiefs. If I push for a major
intraparty reshuffle immediately after assuming the chairmanship, it
could run against the conventional wisdom of 'refraining from
changing the guard before a battle, '" Ma said.</P>
      <P>As 72 percent of KMT members have voiced support for sweeping
intraparty reforms, Ma said he has always kept in mind this
resounding call for a revamp of the party.</P>
      <P>In the short term, Ma said, the party will only undergo minor
personnel changes to avoid affecting the party's chances of winning
in the year-end "three-in-one" elections. In the long run, Ma said,
he will see to it that complementary measures are mapped out to
ensure that directly-elected local chapter heads live up to party and
public expectations.</P>
      <P>Noting that his ultimate goal in participating in the KMT
chairmanship election was to help the party regain the presidency in
2008, Ma said he will make every possible effort to realize that goal
after he assumes office.</P>
      <P>He also revealed certain key points to be addressed in his
inaugural speech, including reaffirming the KMT's opposition to
pursuing Taiwan independence and China's "one country, two systems"
unification formula as well as the party's desire for improving
cross-Taiwan Strait relations under the principle of "one China,
separate definitions."</P>
      <P>In his inaugural speech, Ma said, he will call for the
establishment of a military confidence-building mechanism and a
platform for boosting cross-strait trade and economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>Ma further said outgoing KMT Chairman Lien Chan's major policy
initiatives will be incorporated into his blueprint for the KMT's
future policy lines and work agenda.</P>
      <P>He will also propose at the party's upcoming national congress
that Lien's five "visions" for cross-strait peace be enshrined as the
party congress' resolution.</P>
      <P>With a view to promoting intraparty harmony and unity, Ma said he
will continue persuading Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng to
serve as the KMT's first vice chairman.</P>
      <P>Both Ma and Wang are incumbent KMT vice chairmen. After suffering
an embarrassing defeat in the KMT chairmanship election, Wang said he
will no longer concurrently serve as KMT vice chairman and will focus
on his job as legislative speaker. However, Wang also promised to
serve as a lifelong volunteer for the KMT.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAICHUNG LOOKS FORWARD TO HOUSING PANDAS: MAYOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said Saturday that
if the pair of pandas promised by China as a gift to Taiwan are sent
to the central Taiwan city, they will be housed in the scenic spot of
Takeng in northern Taichung.</P>
      <P>Hu said that this is because Takeng, known as the "Yangmingshan
of Taichung," has more bamboo, the main food of pandas.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks one day after outgoing Kuomintang Chairman
Lien Chan said at a farewell party in Taichung that if the pair of
pandas come to Taiwan, they will first be housed in Taichung.</P>
      <P>Hu said Taichung has for three-and-a-half years actively sought
to house pandas from China. Noting that although Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou has also actively sought to have Taipei Zoo house the
pandas, Hu said that Ma has never shown any sign that he is against
Taichung having the honor.</P>
      <P>If the pandas are housed in Taichung, Hu said he will not rule
out the possibility of having them shown in southern Taiwan in order
to avoid the inconvenience for people in that region of traveling to
Taichung to see the pandas.</P>
      <P>China offered to send a pair of pandas to the Taiwan people as a
goodwill gift at the conclusion of opposition Kuomintang Chairman
Lien Chan's visit to China in early May. However, the pandas have yet
to be delivered as the Taiwan government says it is handling the
matter cautiously.</P>
      <P>A senior official of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
said recently that the pandas can be sent to Taiwan on four
conditions -- namely that appropriate application procedures are
followed, that a suitable living environment for the pandas is found,
the all relevant regulations on delivery are abided by, and that
approval is obtained by major international conservation groups.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RESEARCHER SUGGESTS FOCUSING ON SHOPPING TO ATTRACT CHINESE TOURISTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After Taiwan opens up to tourists from
China, Taiwan tourism promoters should focus on catering to Chinese
tourists' shopping habits in trying to attract more tourists from
that country, a researcher from the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research (TIER) suggested Saturday.</P>
      <P>Sun Ming-teh made the remarks in his report on the consumption
pattern of Chinese tourists, following the promise made by Premier
Frank Hsieh in late July to start negotiations with Beijing on
opening Taiwan up to tourists from the mainland.</P>
      <P>Citing a survey conducted by the marketing information company AC
Nielsen and the Tax Free World Association on 1,500 Chinese tourists
from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou who visited Asian or European
countries in the last six months, Sun said the consumption patterns
of Chinese tourists are quite different from those of tourists from
other countries.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, Chinese tourists rank second in the
world in terms of amount of spending during a single foreign visit,
trailing only Japanese tourists. However, in spending on shopping,
Chinese tourists top the list at an average of US$987 per person.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a survey conducted by Taiwan's Tourism Bureau in 2004
showed that 47.5 percent of spending by foreign tourists in Taiwan
was on hotel accommodations, followed by spending on shopping at 21.3
percent. However, among Chinese tourists, including those from Hong
Kong and Macau, spending on hotel accommodations stood at only 40.6
percent, while spending on shopping accounted for a whopping 27.2
percent of total spending per visit.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the results, Sun said that European and American
tourists generally focus on "leisure and culture" on their vacations,
demanding hotels with good facilities such as swimming pools and
showing more interest in cultural performances and unique local
handicrafts and art work.</P>
      <P>Chinese tourists, on the other hand, are not as concerned about
the quality of hotel accommodations and are more eager to visit
popular tourist spots to take photos, and tend to focus on shopping
for items such as brand-name clothes, cosmetics, jewelry and
electric home appliances, Sun pointed out.</P>
      <P>Most of the Chinese tourists are people from wealthy costal
areas, government officials, or employees of state enterprises, who
generally tend to have higher incomes or enjoy government subsidies
for air tickets, hotel accommodations and food, Sun continued.</P>
      <P>Noting that although Taiwan's shopping environment is not
superior to that of Hong Kong or Macau, and although there is still
no direct transport between the two sides of Taiwan Strait, Sun said
the spending of Chinese tourists in Taiwan is still high.</P>
      <P>He suggested that domestic tourist agents focus on shopping to
cater to the special tastes of Chinese tourists in order to attract
greater numbers of visitors from that potentially lucrative market.</P>

    <DATELINE>Los Angeles, Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By L.S. Chu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Pro-Taiwan independence unveiled a set
of four commemorative stamps in Los Angeles Friday as part of a "call
Taiwan, Taiwan" campaign to rectify the island's official
designation.</P>
      <P>Shen Pei-chih, secretary-general of the "Please Support Taiwan to
Join the United Nations," one of the four sponsors of the activities,
said that they hope to have the four kinds of commemorative postage
stamps, with no monetary value, posted on mail sent around the world
to raise Taiwan's international profile.</P>
      <P>Shen said the printing of the postage stamps, including one to
commemorate the 228 Incident, was inspired by the government's
earlier decision to add the word "Taiwan" to Republic of China
passports to avoid confusion with mainland Chinese passports.</P>
      <P>He said that the postage stamps were printed in Taiwan and were
originally meant to be unveiled in Taipei and Los Angeles
simultaneously. However, the unveiling in Taipei was postponed until
mid-August because of the onslaught of Typhoon Matsa. The sponsors
will now rent a pavilion at the 18th Asian International Stamp
Exhibition in Taipei Aug.19-24 to promote the stamps.</P>
      <P>In addition, the sponsors also designed a license plate sticker
with the image of Taiwan on it, he said, urging car owners to use the
stickers to show their support for the "call Taiwan, Taiwan"
campaign.</P>

      <P>A whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) caucus in the Legislative Yuan urged again on Saturday
that six prioritized bills be discussed in a proposed special session
of the legislature.</P>
      <P>William Lai made the appeal after the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) insisted that it will only agree to a special session if the
session is only for reviewing the Executive Yuan's eight-year, NT$80
billion (US$2.54 billion) flood-prevention project.</P>
      <P>Lai stressed that a special session should not only discuss the
flood-prevention proposal, saying that the NT$480 billion arms
procurement package, the confirmation of Control Yuan members,
proposed amendments to the Executive Yuan Organic Law, proposed
amendments to the tobacco and liquor tax law, and a draft bill
concerning the establishment of a labor pension fund monitoring
committee are also urgent matters that need to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>All six bills should be reviewed in the special session and
should not be left to the next regular session, Lai said.</P>
      <P>He said that the DPP caucus will communicate with the Taiwan

its ally, the People First Party (PFP) , Monday to seek support for
reviewing the six bills in a special session.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN VOWS TO PROTECT TAIWAN'S SOVEREIGNTY IN ENGAGEMENTS WITH CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reiterated Saturday
that ensuring Taiwan's survival and sovereign status is his
administration's paramount principle for engagements across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen made the reaffirmation while attending a ceremony marking
the fourth anniversary of the founding of the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) which is an ally of Chen's ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) in the legislature.</P>
      <P>As relations between the two parties hit some snags recently over
cross-strait policy and local government election affairs, Chen took
the opportunity to assure TSU politicians that his administration
will not waver on its insistence on Taiwan's separate identity from
that of China and its pledge to protect Taiwan's sovereignty and
eventually make Taiwan a "normal, complete, advanced and great"
country.</P>
      <P>Chen outlined the "one principle, " "three insistences" and "five
oppositions" for his administration's engagements with China.</P>
      <P>The "one principle" refers to protecting Taiwan's sovereign
status, Chen said, adding that his administration looks forward to
hold dialogue and consultations with China under the principle of
"democracy, parity and peace."</P>
      <P>With a view to achieving domestic political stability and
pursuing a breakthrough in deadlocked cross-strait relations, Chen
said his administration is seeking reconciliation with opposition
parties and cross-strait detente.</P>
      <P>But Chen stressed that the detente will be based on "three
insistences" -- continued democratic reform, Taiwan's separate
identity from that of China's, and developing Taiwan into a "normal,
complete, advanced and great" country.</P>
      <P>In the process, Chen said his administration will adhere to its
"five oppositions" -- opposing Beijing's "one China" principle and
its "one country, two systems" unification terms as well as the
so-called "1992 consensus" which embodies the "one China" principle,
any proposal that upholds unification as the only option for Taiwan's
future and China's anti-secession law that codifies the use of
"non-peaceful means" against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In his congratulatory speech, Chen also said both the DPP and the
TSU agree that China is currently the biggest threat to Taiwan's
national security.</P>
      <P>While the two parties are "ideological allies" and "action
partners, " Chen said the two parties' missions and roles probably
differ slightly at the moment.</P>
      <P>As the ruling party, Chen said, the DPP cannot completely deny
the history of the Republic of China's evolution.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks were seen a veiled effort to remind the TSU that
the DPP cannot support its campaign to change Taiwan's present
official designation -- the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Chen told TSU politicians that he recently came up with a theory
of "four stages of the Republic of China (ROC)" in an attempt
to give the public a clear and definitive idea about his ideas
regarding Taiwan's sovereignty and national identity.</P>
      <P>In the first stage, the ROC was established in China in 1912. In
1949, the ROC "moved" to Taiwan. In the third stage, during the time
when Lee Teng-hui was president (1988-2000), "the ROC on Taiwan" was
the catch-phrase used to describe the nation, according to Chen. Lee
concurrently headed the then-ruing party Kuomintang, but he was
ousted from the party in 2001 because of his pro-independence
advocacy. Lee is now the TSU's spiritual leader.</P>
      <P>In the fourth stage after 2000, with the first peaceful transfer
of power between different political parties in the ROC's history,
the new phrase should be "the ROC is Taiwan," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He noted that prior to 1949, the ROC had nothing to do with
Taiwan because the island was under Japanese rule from 1895 until
1945.</P>

should beware of in the three stages of his life. In youth, when the
constitution of his body is not yet formed, he should beware of lust.
In manhood, when his physical powers are in full vigor, he should
beware of strife. In old age, when the physical powers are in decay,
he should beware of greed."</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China Steel Corp. -- one of Taiwan's 12
state-run enterprises -- has successfully developed a new generation
of steel for Taiwan's automotive industry to produce cars with
reduced weight without compromising performance.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for China Steel said Sunday that the high-strength,
hot-dip galvanized steel with dual phase not only can reduce the
weight of the vehicle, but also can make the frame of the car
stronger and safer.</P>
      <P>The spokesman pointed out that against the backdrop of rising
international oil prices, more and more new car buyers are setting
their eyes on cars that are more fuel efficient, and that one way to
produce such cars is to reduce the weight of the car.</P>
      <P>He said that China Steel's new product is an answer to the
market's changing needs, and that a number of auto companies have
given favorable evaluations to the product and decided to use it for
their new cars.</P>
      <P>The high-strength steel, designed to resist corrosion by being
zinc coated, is easier to form and weld. It allows designers to use
less material in critical components without compromising
performance. Lighter cars can reduce fuel consumption by up to 10
percent, the China Steel spokesman claimed.</P>
      <P>He said China Steel will continue to try and develop better
high-strength steel sheets to help Taiwan's automotive and related
industries improve their competitiveness.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian met members of the
benevolent organization called "Education 100" Sunday to thank them
for their work over the past year.</P>
      <P>Chen said that members and supporters of "Education 100" -- which
groups philanthropists from all walks of life in Taiwan -- have
"cultivated" and "irrigated" the land of Taiwan with love and hope
since the group's inception in July of last year.</P>
      <P>"Education 100" includes lawyers, fruit sculptors, masters of
traditional handicrafts on the verge of extinction, a man who runs
backward, a blind marathoner and a number of rags-to-riches
entrepreneurs. Chen said he hopes that "Education 100" will go on to
spread the seeds of love to other peoples in the five continents
around the world to help them find happiness.</P>
      <P>Likening "Education 100" to Taiwan's national agricultural aid
missions that have been helping others around the world for the past
40 years, Chen said that members of "Education 100" have been on
grassroots missions far and wide throughout the country over the past
year to help the people.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's utility rates are the lowest among
the four " Asian Tigers, " a legislative party whip of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) claimed Sunday.</P>
      <P>William Lai said that despite spiralling international oil prices
-- Taiwan is almost wholly dependant on imported oil -- the DPP
administration has tried its best to keep utility rates down.</P>
      <P>Defending the administration amid accusations that it has failed
to oversee the rise of inflation and unemployment, leading the
country's "misery index" to shoot up to a record high, Lai said that
the rise in inflation is temporary and is due to the last two
typhoons that hit the island over the past month with many areas in
southern Taiwan being flooded.</P>
      <P>Lai called for concerted efforts from both the ruling and
opposition parties to jointly solve the current problems.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, Taiwan not only has the lowest oil costs and
electricity and water rates of the four "Asian Tigers " -- Taiwan,
Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea -- its tap water is even cheaper

    <HEADLINE>MINORITY PARTIES OFFER IMPROVEMENTS TO FLOOD CONTROL BUDGET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two opposition parties Sunday said that the
government-proposed NT$80 billion flood-control project must be
applied to whatever areas are identified by the Water Resources
Agency as in need of improvement.</P>
      <P>The TSU and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) , another
minority party in the legislature, offered their views as Legislative
Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng has called a "talking session" Aug. 12
to decide whether or not to open a special summer session to discuss
the government's proposal for passing the special budget to fight
floods.</P>
      <P>The NPSU, which supports the budget proposal conditionally, said
conservation of land and water in upstream areas should also take a
share of the special budget in order for the nation's flood-control
efforts to succeed.</P>
      <P>Lin Ping-kun, the secretary-general of the NPSU's legislative
caucus, said even if the government needs to increase the special
eight-year budget to NT$120 billion, his caucus will try to gain the
support of other caucuses so that "the job can be done thoroughly."</P>
      <P>Lin's TSU counterpart, Ho Min-hao, also said the government's
budget proposal needs to be improved before his party will support
it. Ho advised the government not to use the budget to play politics
prior to the year-end county and city elections.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taoyuan County, led by opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Magistrate Chu Li-lun, has been suffering from water shortage as the
Shihmen Dam has serious sedimentation problems.</P>
      <P>Ho said he agrees that Chu's request to include Shihmen Dam as
one of the targets of the program is "based on fact, " and therefore
should be considered by the Water Resources Agency of the Ministry of
Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>He also cited the Mayuantou River estuary in Taichung City as a
place that could be addressed by the flood control program.
Taichung's mayor, Jason Hu, is also a KMT member.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chu Feng-chih from Taoyuan County said she
suspects that the Ministry of Economic Affairs does not have a
long-range plan to fight floods, causing people in Taoyuan to suffer
again from typhoon-induced water shortages. Water is still being
rationed there in the wake of Typhoon Matsa last week.</P>
      <P>Torrential rains caused by last September's Typhoon Aere wreaked
havoc with the water supply system in Taoyuan, leading to a 19-day
water shortage.</P>
      <P>Chu said dredging the Shihmen Dam and upgrading the area's water
cleaning capability are huge projects beyond a county government's
financial ability and they "certainly need the assistance of the
central government."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) on Sunday
called on the government to "do something" to ease people's
discomfort caused by rising living expenses, as shouting slogans will
not help.</P>
      <P>Ho Min-hao, convener of the party's legislative caucus, pointed
out that gasoline prices, tuition, air fares and so forth have been
rising, and it's "an undeniable fact" that people are feeling the
pinch because of it.</P>
      <P>Water and electricity rates have not yet been adjusted, but
health insurance premiums, transportation costs, university tuition
and other daily necessities' prices have all "quietly gone up" while
most people's salaries and wages have not risen, Ho added.</P>
      <P>Price hikes, plus rising employment and other factors such as
political fighting have increased the so-called "pain index, " but
Premier Frank Hsieh has claimed that the prices of major items have
been rising "by the narrowest margin in recent years" as he called on
the public not to panic over oil price hikes.</P>
      <P>Ho said people's sense of pain is a matter of "feeling" that will
not be comforted by icy statistics and beautiful slogans. He urged
the government to "respect people's feelings" because their pain will
not go away simply because the government has made some claims.</P>
      <P>He cheered the government for beginning to reform the nation's
health care and taxation systems, but urged the government to take
actions to realize social justice and fairness rather than merely
increasing public relations efforts.</P>
      <P>"The government should actively convince people and try to pass
reform bills at the legislature so people can finally rest assured
they've seen a shred of light at the end of the tunnel," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEE TENG-HUI OPPOSED TO 'MINI THREE LINKS' BETWEEN PENGHU, CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui expressed his
strong opposition Sunday against the Cabinet's plan to push for
direct trade, post and shipping -- referred to as the "mini three
links"-- between Penghu and China.</P>
      <P>Addressing a cadres training camp session of the Friends of Lee
Teng-hui Association, Lee warned that if the Cabinet insists on
pushing for the plan, he and his supporters will stage a
demonstration on the streets to protest.</P>
      <P>He criticized the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) -led
government for using the "mini three links" proposal to curry favor
from the people after having apparently lost face for failing to stop
Taiwan fruit farmers from selling to the Chinese market by taking
advantage of the tariff-free treatment offered by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has formulated an "active opening,
effective management" policy on the exchanges between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait, especially with regard to the transfer of high
technology, Lee said the more he talks about this, the angrier he
gets with the DPP government.</P>
      <P>"Where is the management? You can't just do it with your mouth!"
he said.</P>
      <P>On Beijing's tariff-free treatment for Taiwan-grown fruits, Lee
said the DPP government's reaction is "dumb." "Why not unite with
other countries, such as Japan, and demand that China grant
tariff-free treatment to all of them?"</P>
      <P>He said that in extending the favor to Taiwan's fruit farmers,
Beijing meant to let the world know that Taiwan's central government
is in Beijing.</P>
      <P>The former president, who ruled Taiwan for 12 years until 2000
while the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) was the ruling party, also said
that there is no need for the people of Taiwan to fear a Chinese
military invasion because to do so would take at least 10 divisions
of the Chinese army -- a job he described as "impossible."</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Lee said, the United States has eight
nuclear-powered submarines patrolling the waters of the Pacific Ocean
and some 2,000 nuclear warheads pointed at China -- enough to tie the
hands of Beijing.</P>
      <P>On the opposition parties' refusal to pass a budget in the
legislature for procuring advanced weaponry from the United States,
Lee said Taiwan should not "take a free ride" on its relationship
with the United States. In his view, the U.S. government will drive
this point home when Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou visits Washington in
his capacity as the KMT's new chairman.</P>
      <P>The former president, who has become a strong advocate of Taiwan
independence after being ousted from the KMT chairmanship when the
party lost the 2000 presidential election, reiterated his position
that Taiwan must enter the United Nations, change its country name to
Taiwan and adopt a new constitution.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ONLINE 'SUPPORT TAIWAN'S BID TO UN' PETITION KICKS OFF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Lu-sheng Chu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An online petition -- supporting
Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations -- has been started by a
group of pro-Taiwan overseas Chinese and Taiwanese residing in the
greater Los Angeles area.</P>
      <P>The online petition encourages all overseas Chinese and Taiwanese
around the world to sign the petition, which urges the UN to
reconsider the issue of Taiwan and its 23 million people's
representation in the UN.</P>
      <P>According to a written news release from the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in L.A., the 60th U.N. General Assembly is scheduled
to open Sept. 13, with issues regarding UN reforms and the
strengthening and overhauling of UN organizations topping the agenda.</P>
      <P>In light of the unfair truth that Taiwan has been excluded from
the UN for decades, the group of people from the overseas Chinese and
Taiwanese communities in California organized the online petition for
Taiwan's cause, the news release said.</P>
      <P>The organizers said that Taiwan is a democratic nation that
respects human rights, freedom and peace. Taiwan meets all the
requirements of UN membership. Taiwan stands ready to take its
rightful place among the member states of the United Nations.
Including Taiwan in the United Nations would make the world body more
representative, comprehensive and effective, according to the news
release.</P>
      <P>It makes little sense that Taiwan is ignored when considering the
fact that Taiwan serves as a model for freedom and democracy in the
Asia-Pacific and a beacon of hope for those living under communist
rule, especially in light of U.S. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld's
recent remarks regarding China's military rise and threat it poses to
the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region, the organizers
said.</P>
      <P>They added that Taiwan and its 23 million people are capable of
making significant contributions to many UN efforts around the globe.
Taiwan is also eager to do its part to combat such international
problems as regional conflict, terrorism, drug trafficking, organized
crime, and environmental degradation. However, without UN membership,
Taiwan is denied an important means of collaborating with
international partners. This unnecessarily complicates the task at
hand and hampers efforts to deal with such critical issues.</P>
      <P>Besides, they said, the passage of the Anti-Secession Law on
March 14 by the National People's Congress of the People's Republic
of China has been widely viewed as the legal excuse for the use of
force against Taiwan, and endangers peace and stability in the East
Asia region. To safeguard peace, the UN has to facilitate
the necessary dialogue between Taiwan and the PRC.</P>
      <P>The UN's exclusion of Taiwan violates the principles and spirit
of the UN Charter, in particular the fundamental principle of
universality, and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the
organizers claimed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINGCHUANKANG AIRPORT UNSUITABLE FOR INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS: CAA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chingchuankang Airport in central Taichung
county is unsuitable for international flights for the time being due
to its inadequate facilities, officials of the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Citing a CAA assessment, the officials pointed out that it is
very hard to make the airport in central Taiwan a point to serve
international flights, including the Taiwan-Macau and the Taiwan-Hong
Kong routes, despite the upcoming renewal of an aviation agreement
between the two sides later this year.</P>
      <P>The CAA officials made the comments a day after Chiu Tai-san, a
former vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and now a
hopeful of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for Taichung
magistrate in December's county and city chief elections, made the
request to Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Vice
Chairman Chang Jing-sen and CAA Director-General Chang Kuo-cheng who
made an inspection tour of the airport.</P>
      <P>Chang Jing-sen said that the CEPD will approve the total funding
of NT$1.55 billion for the expansion project Monday in the hope of
meeting rising local demand for international charter flights and the
Taiwan-Hong Kong and Taiwan-Macau routes.</P>
      <P>Chang Kuo-cheng promised to start the expansion project for the
airport as soon as possible as long as the funding has been secured.</P>
      <P>Currently, Chingchuankang Airport is only available for domestic
routes and various charter flights to Japan, Bali and Phuket since
its operations early last year.</P>
      <P>Residents in the Taichung area have been eager to have the
airport to serve regular international flights and have repeatedly
called on the government to make it able to service the Macau route
after the renewal of the Taiwan-Macau aviation agreement late this
year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Macau forged the pact in Nov. 2000 and renewed it in
Feb. 2003.</P>
      <P>Making Chingchuankang Airport adequate to link to Hong Kong and
Macau was always high on Chiu's agenda when he served as MAC vice
chairman.</P>
      <P>As the first-phase expansion for the airport is slated for
completion in 2008, Chiu also asked the CAA to raise extra funds of
about NT$12.9 million to help it improve its existing facilities and
equipment for current international charter flight service.</P>
      <P>An upgrading of Chingchuankang Airport, Chiu opined, will further
help boost exports of opto-optical and precision machinery products
from central Taiwan and will also make it easier for Taiwan
businessmen operating in China to come home.</P>
      <P>In 2004, Taiwan people paid a total of 7.78 million visits
overseas, 18. 7 percent of which, or 1.45 million visits, were made
by residents in central Taiwan, tallies compiled by the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications showed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CENTRAL BANK UNDER GROWING PRESSURE TO RAISE INTEREST RATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Pushed by continuously rising oil prices and
an expected new hike in interest rates by the U. S. Federal Reserve
next week, Taiwan's central bank has come under stronger pressure to
raise interest rates in September, economists said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Shih Yen, director-general of the Economic Research Department at
the Central Bank of China (CBC) , said, however, that the CBC will
closely watch the impact of the soaring oil prices on domestic
consumer product prices before making a judgment.</P>
      <P>Although fuel increases account for much of the consumer prices
index (CPI) rises and usually leads to immediate consumer product
price changes, Shih said that it remains to be seen whether
electricity and public utility rates will be adjusted upward in the
near term and whether a string of flow-on effects will follow.</P>
      <P>According to the latest tallies published by the Cabinet-level
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the CPI
moved up by an average of 1.92 percent for the first seven months of
this year, still lower than 2 percent.</P>
      <P>In addition, the U. S. Fed's continued interest rate hikes have
also put the CBC under greater pressure to follow suit in the second
half of this year, a bond expert said, adding that it is very
possible that key U. S. interest rates will be lifted to around 4
percent by the end of this year, exceeding the market's previous
evaluation of a range between 3.5 percent and 3.75 percent.</P>
      <P>He contended that the U. S. rate hikes will impact the CBC's
monetary policy and claimed that the CBC will do so very probably in
September now that domestic fuel oil prices were adjusted last week.</P>
      <P>National Chengchi University Professor Chu Hao-min said that the
historically high oil prices should be a short-term phenomenon. But
even so, businesses might have passed on the costs to consumers.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Taiwan's economic performance has been
lackluster this year, evidenced in its slowed economic growth rate
and shrinking trade surplus which squeeze the space for the CBC to
make rate increases, Chu said that the central bank might opt to do
so by a half quarter point in the coming months.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian made it clear
Sunday that he would not designate anyone as his successor in the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in preparation for the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Addressing a DPP leadership training camp, Chen said that he had
noticed the heated discussion on the DPP leadership succession issue
recently, adding that it could be genuine worry among DPP party
members or news media's sensationalism.</P>
      <P>He said his attitude on the issue has always been very clear: a

the new KMT chairman, there will be more room for rational
interaction between the DPP and the KMT for the benefit of the
people.</P>
      <P>The president said he would put aside all unnecessary political
calculations and reopen dialogue with all opposition parties
sincerely and work for reconciliation with them.</P>
      <P>Chen acknowledged that the DPP government has gone through a
series of difficulties recently, including China's passage of the
Anti-Secession Law and Beijing's attempt to alienate Taiwan by
granting tariff-free treatment to the island's fruit farmers.</P>
      <P>However, he said, the government has coped with these
difficulties "rationally, cautiously and pragmatically," knowing that
the international community has been watching how the DPP government
exercises self-restraint and wisdom in handling these complicated
issues.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the people in Taiwan have also been watching
how the DPP government, in pushing for normalization of relations
with China and maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,
could safeguard Taiwan's democracy and security, while striking a new
balance of power between Taiwan and China, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen explained that the basic principle he relied on in dealing
with cross-strait affairs during this period was "reconciliation
without flinching; be firm without being confrontational."</P>
      <P>"It's the same reason as when someone crouches down at the right
moment to watch for possible changes and gather his strength, so that
he could jump higher or farther away, " he said, adding this shows
his flexibility and wits.</P>
      <P>Chen encouraged all DPP members and government officials to win
the hearts of the people by doing their best in their posts. He said
there is no other way to get the people's recognition, except by
giving them a excellent score card.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT  REFORMS ARE NON-PARTISAN: PREMIER HSIEH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Any government reform, in order to be
successful, has to be carried out disregarding partisan interests,
Premier Frank Hsieh said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a training camp organized by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party for leaders of civic groups, the premier said a
political party should brush aside its own interests while pushing
for reform, or it is doomed to complicate and ruin the reform.</P>
      <P>He said his administration is making reforms at the cost of its
own power. Citing the second-phase financial reform as an example,
Hsieh claimed this reform, which features the consolidation of the 12
state-run banks into six, will cut the number of chairmen his
administration can named for these news banks from 12 to six.</P>
      <P>Similar examples are the privatalization of the state-run Chinese
Television System and the Taiwan Television Enterprise, Ltd., not to
mention the dismantling of several ministries and agencies under the
Executive Yuan according to the plan to restructure the Executive
Yuan, which all limit the leverage his administration can exercise,
Hsieh claimed.</P>
      <P>The administration insists on pushing forward these reforms
because they will benefit the country as a whole. However, these
plans have encountered opposition at the opposition-controlled
legislature because they will jeopardize the interests of the
establishment.</P>
      <P>The recent renewal of cable TV licenses is another example Hsieh
said, adding that several operators of TV channels protested the
government's withdrawal of their licenses and the opposition jumped
at the chance to sell their version of a bill for a national
communications commission which they claimed will stop the
administration from abusing its power.</P>
      <P>The premier said his administration is in favor of the idea of
relegating a commission to regulate the cable industry, but
couldn't go along with the opposition's proposal to have the
commission be made up of members named by various political parties
in proportion to their legislative seats.</P>
      <P>Instead, Hsieh said, the commission should be free from political
influence by being made up of non-partisan experts and academics.</P>
      <P>The opposition's intention of giving themselves a voice in the
proposed commission is not in the interest of the nation, Hsieh said,
urging them to subordinate their partisan interests to the interests
of all the people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOUNDATION WANTS TAIWAN TO BE FREE FROM CORPORAL PUNISHMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than half, or 1.84 million, of the
pupils in Taiwan's primary and junior high schools, received some
kind of physical punishment in academic year 2004 which ended in
July, the Humanistic Education Foundation said Sunday.</P>
      <P>In a news release, the foundation urged all schools and families
to stop corporal punishment for the young generation, so that Taiwan
could become "a nation where no children will be beaten by the
elders."</P>
      <P>The foundation, established in 1987, has been calling for
educational reform by banning all forms of corporal punishment for
children not only in schools and families, but also in reformatories
and other penal institutions of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Figures released by the foundation in mid-June showed that from
September last year to June this year, a total of 65.1 percent of
primary and junior high school students had been punished physically
by their teachers.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, Hsiao Yi-min, secretary-general of
the foundation, said the foundation will continue to campaign for
Taiwan to become a country free from corporal punishment.</P>
      <P>He said the foundation will call for legislation to ban physical
punishment of children, beginning with Taiwan's schools and then
amending the law to extend enforcement of the law to other
institutions and all families.</P>
      <P>He said the best example for Taiwan in this area is Sweden, which
abolished all forms of physical punishment through legislation in
1979.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said that representatives from the foundation will pay a
visit to Premier Frank Hsieh Tuesday to seek his support for the
foundation's campaign to make Taiwan a country where no children will
ever be punished physically.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPOWER EXAMINING NUCLEAR WASTE IN LANYU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taitung,  eastern Taiwan, Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>State-run Taiwan Power Co.
(Taipower) is examining its over 97,000 barrels of low-level
radioactive waste from Lanyu, also known as Orchid Island, which lies
off the southeastern Taiwan coast, as the lease on its storage site
has expired, Taipower sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>After two decades on Lanyu, Taipower began to build inspection
and handling facilities on the small island two years ago, and will
start removing the material once a "low-level radioactive waste
storage terminal bill" clears the floor of the Legislative Yuan,
Taipower officials said.</P>
      <P>The 97,672 barrels of nuclear waste, produced from Taipower's
three nuclear power plants over 20 years, are scheduled to be
inspected and repacked by the end of 2010.
.</P>
      <P>Taipower has contacted authorities from home and abroad for the
treatment and disposal of its nuclear waste over the past
several years, including Russia, North Korea and Taiwan's offshore
islet of Wuchiu.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to a nuclear waste assessment report from
the Atomic Energy Council (AEC) , exposure rates in Lanyu have not
exceeded 0.001 mSv in any one hour in a year, far lower than the
AEC-allowed level of 0.25 mSv in any hour in a year.</P>
      <P>Although a proposal of renewing the now-expired lease with
Taipower on the land of the waste storage site has not yet approved
by the Lanyu Rural Township office, some of the local residents are
having second thoughts about kicking out the site.</P>
      <P>A sixty-seven-year-old Lanyu resident surnamed Hsieh said that
the Taipower station has provided adequate services to locals and he
preferred that Lanyu continue to hold Taipower's nuclear waste and
the lease be extended.</P>
      <P>Another resident surnamed Chen, 78, said that so long as Taipower
pays the residents compensation in cash, he does not insist that the
waste must go.</P>
      <P>Some elected representatives in Lanyu have said that as long as
Taipower once again reassured the people that its waste storage is
non-toxic to locals, Lanyu will consider renewing the contract. In
that case, they said, the receptacle area can be built into a museum
for academic research and tourism.</P>

      <P>The Singaporean team created an amazing
array of seven courses in the World Culinary Contest at the 2005
Taipei Chinese Food Festival, beating the Southern Taiwan team to win
this year's "Culinary God" title Sunday.</P>
      <P>After three days of keen competitions, the two finalists
triumphed over teams from Malaysia, Japan, the United States,
Northern Taiwan and elbowed out defending champion Beijing, which had
won two consecutive titles.</P>
      <P>To test the competing chefs' impromptu creativity, organizers
asked that each team complete seven dishes within four hours --
appetizer, soup, seafood dish, poultry dish, livestock dish,
vegetable dish and dessert with materials that were given only
moments before the contest began.</P>
      <P>The two teams were given crab, black-boned chicken, eel, baby
pigeon, pork and bitter gourd.</P>
      <P>The Singaporean team, composed of five members, each with between
22 and 26 years of experience, defeated their southern Taiwan
counterparts led by Tony Kuo-jung Chang and including gold medalists
in two previous Malaysian contests.</P>
      <P>Auston Ong, who spoke for the Singaporean team that had slept for
less than two hours the previous night in order to prepare for the
final round, gave his team a 100-point score, claiming he was
particularly proud of his own coffee flavored chicken and appetizer
of cucumber with crispy beans.</P>
      <P>Stanley Yen, an organizer, said a number of judges have been
invited from various countries to enrich the meaning and content of
"Chinese cuisine" in the hope that it will get even more
internationalized.</P>
      <P>An international panel of judges could also offer a new
perspective for Taiwan's top chefs to think about the next stage in
the development of Chinese culinary art, Ye said.</P>
      <P>The Beijing team and the Northern Taiwan team shared the third

    <HEADLINE>WATER COMPANY SCRAMBLES TO RESTORE WATER SUPPLY IN TAOYUAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Water Corporation is working
around-the-clock to restore the water supply to Taoyuan county,
hopefully on Monday as required by Premier Frank Hsieh, Minister of
Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ho whose ministry oversees the operation of the state-run Taiwan
Water Corporation said the water company supplied water about 80
percent or 90 percent of its usual amount in Taoyuan on Sunday and
has to rotate its water supply to households on every other day
simply because of concerns that customers at the end of its pipeline
may not get water.</P>
      <P>She set aside questions about whether water supply in Taoyuan
will be fully restored on Monday, saying that "we are working hard
toward this."</P>
      <P>She said she has contacted Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu Li-lung
who was reportedly criticizing the central government's failure to
address this water shortage problem in Taoyuan yesterday. Ho said Chu
understood the rather company was doing its best to solve the
problem.</P>
      <P>The minister refused to talk about the offer made by the water
company's chairman Lee Wen-liang to quit to take responsibility for
the problem, saying what is important right now is to resume the
water supply rather than ascribe responsibility.</P>
      <P>The water shortage was caused by the heavy rain dumped by typhoon
Matsa when it swept through Taiwan on Friday. It prompted widespread
mudslide in the catchment basin of Shihmen Reservoir which supplies
drinking water to Taoyuan county.</P>
      <P>The raw water taken by water company from the reservoir is to
muddy be treated by the water purification plant which has to stop
operation for five to seven days until the suspended particles in the
water settled down.</P>
      <P>The problem first cropped up last August when typhoon Aere hit
Taiwan. Water supply to households in most Taoyuan was cut off for 19
days.</P>
      <P>Both the chairman and the general manager of the water company
resigned to take the blame at that time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RELEASE OF CHUNGHWA TELECOM SHARES TO PROCEED AS PLANNED: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung, Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>State-run Chunghwa Telecom's release of an
additional 290 million shares will proceed as scheduled from Tuesday
as part of the state-run company's ongoing privatization, Minister of
Transportation and Communications Lin Ling-san said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin said firmly that the sale of the shares -- to be available to
private and corporate investors in Taiwan -- will proceed as
scheduled despite Chunghwa Telecom Union's plan to stage a strike
islandwide the same day to oppose what it calls "the manner in which
the telecom giant is moving toward privatization."</P>
      <P>Lin said that Chunghwa Telecom management will continue to
communicate and negotiate with union members over their differences.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom Union Chairman Chang Hsu-chung has said that the
union is not opposed to Chunghwa Telecom's privatization but that the
process is laced with problems that could compromise Chunghwa
workers' rights and interests.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the strike plan was passed after Chunghwa
management ignored the union's appeals for guarantees that benefits
and work conditions would not be altered and that Chunghwa Telecom
employees would be compensated based on terms for the country's civil
servants after the company is completely privatized.</P>
      <P>The strike will be held also to protest management's decision to
go ahead with the privatization plan without reaching a consensus
with the union in advance, a move, Chang claimed, that runs counter
to a Legislative Yuan resolution that stipulates that Chunghwa
Telecom management must reach a consensus with the union before
implementing the privatization plan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chunghwa Telecom Vice President Chang Feng-hsiung said
that the company on Monday activated "emergency measures" to deal
with any disruptions caused by the planned strike. He said that if a
strike is unavoidable, the company will try its best to maintain the
company's services.</P>
      <P>"I guarantee that Chunghwa Telecom will do whatever it can to
prevent subscribers' rights from being compromised under any
circumstances," he added.</P>
      <P>It has been learned that Chunghwa Telecom will release an
additional 13 percent of its shares near the end of this year to
overseas investors, thus fulfilling its goal of becoming a private
enterprise.</P>
      <P>The revenue of Taiwan's largest telecommunications company
totaled NT$89.7 billion for the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition People First Party (PFP) blamed Premier
Frank Hsieh last week for showing contempt for the Legislative Yuan
by ignoring a resolution passed by the legislature requiring Chunghwa
Telecom to cease all operations regarding the release of its shares.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative party whip Hwang Yi-jiao pointed out that the
previous legislature had passed a resolution, introduced by the PFP,
censuring Chunghwa Telecom for having sold the previous batch of
shares too cheaply to certain financial groups. The resolution banned
the company from releasing any more shares until the new legislature
made a further decision on the matter.</P>
      <P>Hwang acknowledged that with the new legislature still in recess,
there is nothing the opposition parties can do, but he said that when
the next legislative session opens in September, the PFP caucus will

and Communications, which has direct jurisdiction over Chunghwa
Telecom.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER SUPPORTS RATIONAL DEBATE ON ARMS PACKAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles,  Aug. 7 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
said in Los Angeles Sunday that he supports in-depth discussions on a
long-stalled arms procurement package to address Taiwan's defense
needs and China's mounting military threat.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks while meeting with Taiwanese community
leaders in Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>Wang, a vice chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) ,
said the KMT's stance on the arms procurement package has been clear.</P>
      <P>"While we support Taiwan possessing sufficient self-defense
capabilities, we oppose wasteful or unsuitable arms procurements, "
Wang said.</P>
      <P>Now that outgoing KMT Chairman Lien Chan has said the
long-talked-about arms procurement package should be given reasonable
support, Wang said chances for the two relevant bills to be put to
legislative debate should be higher.</P>
      <P>The two bills in question will pave the way for procuring eight
diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the
United States. One bill will authorize the administration to prepare
a special budget for the NT$480 billion arms procurement package over
a period of 15 years, the other bill is regarding budget
appropriations for the package.</P>
      <P>The KMT and its "pan-blue alliance" ally -- the People First
Party (PFP) -- have used their slim majority in the legislature to
block the two bills from being put on the legislative agenda for two
legislative sessions.</P>
      <P>In his view, Wang said, the arms procurement package is very
complicated and require a comprehensive evaluation. Against this
backdrop, Wang said the package should be put forth for a legislative
debate and in-depth discussions.</P>
      <P>Wang, who suffered an embarrassing defeat in the KMT chairmanship
election in mid-July, said he will continue his efforts to maintain
KMT-PFP cooperation in the legislative process.</P>
      <P>As the legislative speaker, Wang said, he will push for closer
KMT-PFP cooperation and use their legislative clout to pass bills
beneficial for national well-being.</P>
      <P>Nearly 300 people, including senior executives of the KMT chapter
in the U.S. West Coast, PFP volunteers in Los Angeles and
representatives of major Taiwanese associations, attended the
seminar.</P>
      <P>Wang will wrap up his U.S. visit and leave Los Angeles for home
Tuesday.

      <P>More than 100 pro-independence activists
calling themselves "citizens of the Taiwan nation" gathered Monday at
a downtown park in Tainan, southern Taiwan, to join in a ceremony to
raise the "national flag" of the Taiwan nation."</P>
      <P>The rally was one of five such activities held simultaneously
around the island. The other rallies took place in Taipei City,
Nantou County, Hsinchu City and Pingtung City.</P>
      <P>The Tainan event organizer indicated that the rally was a warm-up
for a grand flag-raising ceremony at the Presidential Office sqare in

      <P>The flag features three vertical stripes -- blue at the top,

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With speculation already circulating about
who will represent the major opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to run in
next year's Taipei mayoral election, KMT Chairman-elect Ma Ying-jeou
said Monday that all KMT candidates for local elections should be
chosen through party primaries.</P>
      <P>Ma, who won a landslide victory in the KMT chairmanship election
July 16 and is scheduled to be sworn in to his new post Aug. 19, said
that he welcomes all talented people who are determined to serve the
city of Taipei as mayor to enter the race.</P>
      <P>Ma denied a media report that sitting Taipei Deputy Mayor Yeh
Chin-chuan is his "man in pocket" to be the KMT candidate in the next
Taipei mayoral election, saying that as a party chairman, he must
remain impartial. He added that he will see to it that the KMT
candidate for next year's Taipei mayoral election is chosen via a
party primary.</P>
      <P>He added that the KMT has maintained a viable mechanism to
produce KMT candidates for major elections. If no conclusion is
reached via preliminary negotiations, primaries conducted via voting
or public opinion polls should both be feasible and effective ways of
producing KMT candidates, he said.</P>
      <P>On the notion of a merger of the three pan-blue political parties
-- the KMT, the People First Party (PFP) and the New Party -- in

said that it is still too early to talk about how a pan-blue
candidate should be produced for the mayoral election. "The earliest
time should be at the beginning of next year," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAOYUAN COUNTY AGAIN LEFT HIGH AND DRY AS WATER RATIONING CONTINUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is water everywhere in the Shihmen
Reservoir, but not enough to drink for many nearby residents in
Taoyuan County, and relief is slow in coming.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh said Monday that the
turbidity in the reservoir has made purification problematic and that
water supplies will have to continue on a rotational basis for the
approximately 600,000 households in the county.</P>
      <P>Some were optimistic about the situation a day earlier when
Premier Frank Hsieh said that water supply would have to return to
normal by Monday.</P>
      <P>The problem came after Typhoon Matsa, which passed through Taiwan
Friday, brought torrential rains and stirred up sediment and brought
silt and debris into the reservoir.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu Li-lung is scheduled to report to
the premier in the afternoon on the problem and request that Shihmen
Reservoir improvement works be included in the central government's
eight-year, NT$80 billion (US$2.54 billion) flood-control project.</P>
      <P>The state-run Taiwan Water Corporation (TWC), which is under the
economics ministry, said water supply has reached 60 percent of the
normal level as of Monday.</P>
      <P>TWC Chairman Lee Wen-liang has offered to step down from his post
to take responsibility for the water supply problem in Taoyuan, but
Premier Hsieh, who was in a orphanage in Liaokuei, Kaohsiung, Monday
morning, said that he would travel to Taoyuan County later in the
day to learn about the situation before deciding how to respond.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus
in the Legislative Yuan said that the central and local governments
should work together to solve the water supply problem.</P>
      <P>William Lai, a DPP whip in the legislature, said that opposition
parties should not ask Ho to step down every time a problem arises,
saying that the problem stems from abusive development of hilly
terrain in Taoyuan over the past decade.</P>
      <P>Lai made the remarks after the People First Party (PFP)
legislative caucus criticized Ho for being incompetent and asked that
Premier Hsieh replace her before the new legislative session in
September.</P>
      <P>Sun Ta-chien, a PFP whip in the legislature, said that Taoyuan
has faced water shortages since last year, and that this time it
happened after only the first two typhoons of the year, adding that
"negligence is to blame."</P>
      <P>On Ho's views that water supply situation has improved this year,
Sun said he felt sorry for the 1.8 million residents in Taoyuan after
Ho has said that she felt that the water shortage situation was
improving. Sun asked Ho to come forward and explain what exactly she
meant by that statement and to tell residents what it was that she
had actually done to improve the situation over the past year.</P>
      <P>The problem with the water supply first cropped up last August
when Typhoon Aere hit Taiwan. Water supplies to households in most of
Taoyuan were cut off for 19 days.</P>
      <P>Both the chairman and the general manager of the TWC subsequently
resigned over the fiasco.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MECHANISM ADOPTED TO WARN GANGSTERS AGAINST PRO-BASEBALL GAMBLING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's sports and police agencies have
jointly adopted six principles for setting up a mechanism to keep
gangsters from interfering in professional baseball games, officials
said Monday.</P>
      <P>A priority is establishing a long-term monitoring system to keep
the underworld from "illegally intervening in professional baseball
games" as the second "game throwing" and odds-betting scandal in
eight years hit the nation recently.</P>
      <P>Other principles deal with beefing up security for players and
staff, strengthening the management of the league, setting up a
mechanism to call up or send down players from farm teams, finding a
way to more fairly pay players and studying the feasibility of
building a pension system for them.</P>
      <P>Chen Chuan-shou, minister of the National Council on Physical
Fitness and Sports, said the preventive measures are about the same
in all countries; the point is how effectively to implement them.</P>
      <P>Since it is the second time that the Chinese Professional
Baseball League (CPBL) has been hit with such a scandal, Chen said
his council cannot shirk its responsibility and will definitely ask
for assistance from all government agencies that may be able to
provide help.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that efforts must be made at all fronts to strike
at bookies who tried to manipulate the games if the nation wants to
thoroughly get rid of game-meddling underworld elements.</P>
      <P>He also reiterated that any player found to have been involved in
game-throwing and gambling will be banned from even holding a job in
amateur baseball.</P>
      <P>To show the teeth of the government-proposed anti-bookies
measure, the council will ask the Ministry of Justice to increase
sentences for the guilty and to hasten the trial process.</P>
      <P>Tien Chien-tai, of the National Police Administration, said
police will make more strenuous efforts in gathering evidence and
will treat suspected bookies as most-wanted gangsters as a warning
that they will pay dearly for their offenses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION LASHES OUT AT GOV'T OVER CHUNGHWA TELECOM STRIKE PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition parties lashed out at the
administration Monday over state-run Chunghwa Telecom Union's planned
strikes aimed at opposing what the union calls "the manner in which
the telecom giant is moving toward privatization."</P>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and Communications Lin Ling-san said
Monday that the release of an additional 290 million Chunghwa Telecom
shares will proceed as scheduled from Tuesday as part of the
state-run company's ongoing privatization.</P>
      <P>Lin said firmly that the sale of the shares -- to be available to
private and corporate investors in Taiwan -- will proceed as
scheduled from Tuesday despite Chunghwa Telecom Union's plan to stage
a series of strikes islandwide beginning the same day.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Chunghwa Telecom Union's planned strikes --
scheduled to run until Aug. 12 -- Tsai Chin-lung, a legislative party
whip of the opposition Kuomintang, defended the Chunghwa Telecom
Union for its decision to strike.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that it is understandable that the Chunghwa Telecom
Union has called for the strikes out of fears that work opportunities
of the Chunghwa Telecom workers will be compromised should the
management decide to go ahead with the privatization plan without
reaching a consensus with the union in advance.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that Chunghwa Telecom management's decision on the
release of the company's stocks and the issuance of global depository
receipts (GDRs) in overseas markets without the approval of its staff
members are moves that run counter to a Legislative Yuan resolution
that stipulates that Chunghwa Telecom management must reach a
consensus with the union before implementing the privatization plan.</P>
      <P>If the strike is unavoidable, Tsai said, the administration
should bear the responsibility for any repercussion that the strike
may bring.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom -- Taiwan's largest telecommunications company
whose revenues totaled NT$89.7 billion for the first half of this
year -- is under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom Union Chairman Chang Hsu-chung has said that the
union is not opposed to Chunghwa Telecom's privatization but that the
process is laced with problems that could compromise Chunghwa
workers' rights and interests.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the strike plan was passed after Chunghwa
management ignored the union's appeals for guarantees that benefits
and work conditions would not be altered and that Chunghwa Telecom
employees would be compensated based on terms for the country's civil
servants after the company is completely privatized.</P>
      <P>Also defending the Chunghwa Telecom Union's plans to strike, Lin
Hui-kuan, a party whip of the opposition People First Party (PFP) ,
noted that the administration cannot evade its responsibility should
Chunghwa Telecom management's decision to release GDRs in the United
States without the approval by its staff members in advance cause any
tension or confrontation between the Chunghwa Telecom management and
the staff and between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Sun Ta-chian, another PFP party whip at the Legislative Yuan,
blamed the administration for showing contempt for the Legislative
Yuan by ignoring a resolution passed by the legislature requiring
Chunghwa Telecom to cease all operations regarding the release of its
shares.</P>
      <P>Sun pointed out that the previous legislature had passed a
resolution, introduced by the PFP, censuring Chunghwa Telecom for
having sold the previous batch of shares too cheaply to certain
financial groups. The resolution banned the company from releasing
any more shares until the new legislature made a further decision on
the matter.</P>
      <P>Noting that with the new legislature still in recess, there is
nothing the opposition parties can do, Sun said that when the next
legislative session opens in September, the PFP caucus will consider
a move to cut the budget of the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications, which has direct jurisdiction over Chunghwa Telecom,
and will set much higher thresholds when it screens budget plans for
the central government.</P>
      <P>It has been learned that Chunghwa Telecom will release an
additional 13 percent of its shares near the end of this year to
overseas investors, thus fulfilling its goal of becoming a private
enterprise.</P>

      <P>A group of laborers staged a demonstration
in front of the Ministry of the Interior Monday, or Father's Day in
Taiwan, to protest what they called the government's misguided
population policy.</P>
      <P>Scores of members of the Republic of China Grassroots Laborers
and Parents Association chanted slogans and performed skits to
display their dissatisfaction with the government's current
population policy which they said places a heavy burden on them as
fathers.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that many working families in Taiwan face the
problems of unemployment and high costs of educating their children,
the protestors lashed out at the ministry's current population policy
for going the wrong way by encouraging couples to have more children
at a time when many families have run out of resources to do so.</P>
      <P>"The key point is that we must have resources to raise them
before bringing them into this world, " they stressed, demanding that
the government raise the tax deduction limit for bearing children and
offer free medical treatment for children. They also demanded that
the government offer financial support for children of unemployed
parents.</P>
      <P>The protestors urged the government to seek a remedy to the
problems and reverse the current trend under which they said they are
"afraid to have children, refuse to have children, or even regret
having children."</P>
      <P>An unfair distribution of social resources has led to an increase
in the gap between the rich and poor, a situation that has put
further pressure on working families, a spokesman for the association
said.</P>
      <P>According to a survey by a local magazine, as many as 54 percent
of fathers in Taiwan are most worried about not having enough money
to raise their children, while 45 percent are most concerned about

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
demanded Monday that the Development Fund under the Executive Yuan
give a report on its operations in the next legislative session to
clarify what the party called money-losing investments.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative office director Chin Huei-chu told a news
conference at the Legislative Yuan that the Development Fund, set up
by the Executive Yuan in 1973 to help finance local industries,
posted a loss of NT$18.2 billion last year for having made
money-losing investments in 35 private companies with close links to
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , including the Taiwan
High Speed Rail Corporation.</P>
      <P>Twenty-three of the 35 companies were in the red last year, Chin
pointed out, accusing the DPP of subsidizing its political supporters
with public fund. She asked the fund personnel in charge to resign.</P>
      <P>According to Chin, the Ministry of Audit also sent a notice to
the Executive Yuan asking it to improve the fund's performance.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Sun Ta-chian said that he will ask the fund
managers to give a report on its investment targets and policymaking
process in the next legislative session which will open in September.
The PFP will not agree to the fund's continued operations if the
operators refuse to be questioned at the legislature, he said.</P>
      <P>Sun stressed that the fund is by no means a cash card of the DPP
and criticized the DPP for having forsaken its past ideals by giving
way to its links with special interest groups.</P>
      <P>The PFP will scrutinize every special budget allocation that the
Executive Yuan tenders to the Legislative Yuan in the future should
the fund managers fail to show up and elaborate on its operations at

    <HEADLINE>BRAVE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT OVERPOWERS BANK ROBBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Chiayi, southern  Taiwan, Aug.  8 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A brave 13-year-old boy
foiled a bank holdup Monday by overpowering a lone robber who had
tossed a Molotov cocktail into the Talin Branch of Chiayi Fourth
Credit Cooperative and then threatened tellers with a handgun while
demanding money.</P>
      <P>The adolescent, surnamed Li, is a student of Peihsin Junior
Middle School in Chiayi. Local police are so grateful of his bravery
that they are in contact with the school to prepare a citation for
him.</P>
      <P>A police spokesman said, however, that the police do not
encourage such "brave" acts for fear that someone may get harmed. He
added that the best way is for any witness to keep cool and remember
the detail of what is going on and supply the information to the
police later.</P>
      <P>Li recalled that he was passing by Chiayi Fourth Credit
Cooperative on abicycle at around 1 p.m. when he saw a man lighting a
Molotov cocktail while walking into the bank. Immediately after that
a fire broke out.</P>
      <P>He said that without a second thought, he dashed into the bank
and held the robber's neck from behind. A number of tellers rushed to
the youngster's help. They jumped on the robber, overpowered him and
then turned him over to the police.</P>
      <P>According to the police, Liu Kuo-chou, 35, who had been convicted
previously of robberies and possession of illegal weapons, was
arrested on the spot.</P>
      <P>Police investigation showed that before committing the crime, Liu
tried to divert the attention of the police by calling the police
station, claiming that a bomb had been planted at Peihsin Junior High
School. Shortly after the police found this to be a hoax, they

    <HEADLINE>FEW HONEY BRANDS PASS PURITY TEST: CONSUMERS' FOUNDATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It seems that most honey consumed in Taiwan
is not pure, with only two of the 37 honey brands having passed a
recent purity test, an official of Consumers' Foundation revealed
Monday.</P>
      <P>Among the 37 samples chosen randomly from supermarkets,
traditional markets, shopping malls and organic product shops, the
Consumers' Foundation found that only two samples are considered as
first and second grade after passing a series of tests including
amylase and cane sugar tests.</P>
      <P>Of the 37 samples tested, two were from the United States - both
failed -- and one was from France, which passed.</P>
      <P>The official noted that the prices of honey vary widely, as some
bee farmers may add fructose to disguise the mixture as pure honey in
order to reap great profits.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the bee farmers label sources and categories of
the honey so that consumers will not be fooled.</P>
      <P>Chen Pao-chi, a professor of National Taiwan University,
suggested consumers use a toothpick to distinguish the purity of the
honey, with pure honey causing little bubbles after being picked up
by a toothpick.</P>

      <P>Working fathers between the ages of 35 and
44 seem to value their families more than those in other age groups,
Chiu Wen-jen, the marketing chief of the 104 Job Bank said Monday.</P>
      <P>A survey conducted by the 104 Job Bank May 5-9 on working people
around the island showed that 24.4 percent of the male respondents in
the age group between 35 and 44 think a balance between time spent on
work and on family is important, while 16.6 percent of the people in
the 45 to 54 age group think the same way, and 14.7 percent of the
people aged between 25 and 34 have the same thought.</P>
      <P>While the online survey founds 92 percent of female respondents
said they don't want to sacrifice their job for marriage, 33.3
percent of the married female respondents said "they are allowed to
seek for work achievements with the support of their husband."</P>
      <P>Chiu said he believes that while working women act to negotiate

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER APOLOGIZES FOR FAILING TO RESTORE WATER TO TAOYUAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh apologized to Taoyuan
residents in front of Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu Li-lung Monday
for failing to restore water supplies to the northern county.</P>
      <P>The premier had originally said that water would be fully
restored, but two hours of torrential rain Sunday increased the
turbidity of the Shihmen reservoir -- the main water supplier to
northern Taiwan -- so that water treatment plants were unable to cope
with the high silt levels.</P>
      <P>The premier, who traveled to Taoyuan after visiting an orphanage
in Liuokuei, Kaohsiung earlier in the day, first listened to a
briefing from the Water Resources Agency under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he came to Taoyuan "to solve the problem," adding that
water shortage problems that occurred after typhoon Aere in August
2004 disrupted the water supply in Taoyuan county for 19 days, a
problem that occurred again this year. He said many problems have
been left unexamined, including the overdevelopment of the
reservoir's catchment area.</P>
      <P>Chu expressed hope that Hsieh will ask the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, the Water Resources Agency and the Taiwan Water Cooperation
to map out a timetable for water supplies, including a timetable for
rotational water supplies to different areas.</P>
      <P>He also asked the government to be aware that typhoons and
torrential rain "can come at any time" and that Taoyuan should not be
at the mercy of climate changes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, to step up cooperation between the central and local
government on law and order and flood-control, the premier convened a

    <HEADLINE>MINI-BUSINESSES COULD HELP ADDRESS UNEMPLOYMENT: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As rising living expenses and unemployment
have led to a rise in the so-called "pain index" in Taiwan, an
economist said Monday that creating more mini-businesses -- those
employing fewer than five people -- could make a dent in the jobless
rate as well as lower the "pain index."</P>
      <P>Tu Ying-yi, an associate research fellow at the Chung Hua
Institute for Economic Research, said the government should offer
incentives for self-employed people, as mini-businesses have
increasingly become a policy tool to fight unemployment in countries
with advanced economies.</P>
      <P>Writing for the electronic newspaper of the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, Tu said a 2001 survey found that 57.5 percent of Taiwan's
manufacturing industry and 82.2 percent of its service industry were
in fact mini-businesses that employed less than five people, an
indication that this type of business, if expanded, could bring down
unemployment.</P>
      <P>Tu said Taiwan's economy is becoming increasingly
knowledge-based, the share of the service industry in its GDP is
growing, and new business models such as on-line transactions are
getting more and more popular, creating an environment that will be
favorable for the development of mini-businesses.</P>
      <P>Tu suggested that the government throw more money into its
"mini-business development fund" and map out other support measures
to encourage more people, particularly the middle-aged and elderly, to
create their own businesses.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's 2004 unemployment rate stood at 4.44 percent and the
consumer price index rose 1.62 percent year-on-year; the combined
total of 6.06 percent was a new high since the second energy crisis
and most people's income barely moved.</P>
      <P>Tu said the global economic slow-down and Taiwan industries'
exodus to China doubtless have raised Taiwan's jobless record.</P>
      <P>In the West, the governments usually have a social security
system to help the unemployed, but Tu claimed that giving
unemployment benefits is a "negative" way of solving the problem,
because in some countries, such measures have led to lower
willingness to work and even chronic dependence on government checks.</P>
      <P>A more positive and "correct" way of creating jobs would be to
make loans to creative and diligent people who are motivated enough
to launch their mini-businesses, he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Aug.  8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan's political turmoil will not affect
relations between Taiwan and Japan, the Republic of China
representative to Japan said Monday.</P>
      <P>Koh Se-kai made the remarks after Japanese Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi decided to dissolve the lower house of the Diet
earlier in the day to pave the way for snap elections that could
shake the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's grip on power.</P>
      <P>Koizumi made the drastic move after the upper house of the
Japanese Diet voted down legislation to split up and sell Japan's
behemoth postal service.</P>
      <P>Koh said he hopes the LDP will continue its grip on power after
the lower house elections scheduled for Sept. 11 because the Koizumi
Cabinet has been friendly toward Taiwan and is concerned about Taiwan
Strait stability and peace.</P>
      <P>If the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) emerges as a
victor and forms a new ruling coalition, Koh predicted that
Taiwan-Japan relations will not undergo a fundamental change because
Taiwan has also traditionally maintained good interaction with the
DPJ.</P>
      <P>Since assuming his current post in July 2004, Koh said he has
proposed to the Japanese authorities many measures to further boost
bilateral relations, including the recent bill for a permanent visa
waiver for visitors from Taiwan from Sept. 26.</P>
      <P>Koh said that in the future, he will focus on lobbying Japan to
improve the bilateral engagement mechanism. Stressing that the
mechanism -- formulated in 1972 following Japan's switching of
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing -- has become obsolete,
Koh said Japan should make an overall review and forge a more
effective mechanism to facilitate bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>Under the 1972 mechanism, both Taipei and Tokyo set up
intermediary bodies -- the Taipei-based Association of East Asian
Relations and the Tokyo-based Interchange Association, respectively
-- to handle bilateral exchanges in the absence of direct official
contacts.</P>
      <P>Now that Japan has explicitly singled out Taiwan Strait peace as
a common strategic objective of the U.S.-Japan defense cooperation
treaty, Koh said Japan should not continue resisting improvements to
communication channels with Taiwan simply for fear of offending
China.</P>

Peter Jennings, a high school dropout from Canada who transformed

home. He was 67 and lived in Manhattan. Along with the two other
pillars of the so-called Big 3 - Tom Brokaw of NBC and Dan Rather of

television news anchor as lavishly compensated, globe-trotting

December, followed by the retirement from the evening news of Mr.
Rather in March, Jennings's death brings that era to a close.

Wall Street Journal: Security Alert, At America's Malls, Grim
Preparations for the Unthinkable

The recent wave of suicide bombings in London's mass-transit
system has heightened fears in counterterrorist circles of similar
attacks in America. On July 18, Homeland Securit y sent federal
agencies and state officials a collection of Central Intelligence
Agency threat assessments listing malls, banks, prominent companies,
and tall buildings as being soft targets most at risk of bomb
attacks. The possibility of suicide attacks against the nation's
1,200 enclosed shopping centers, bustling icons of U.S. wealth and
consumerism, has transformed the way private security companies, in
training their guards and going about their business. The inspiration
for their preparation for the unthinkable came from Israel, the
country with the most experience keeping human bombs out of its

      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and

governing the overflights of Taiwan commercial aircraft through 
Chinese airspace and submitted it to the Cabinet-level Mainland

      <P>The draft rules were prepared after Premier Frank Hsieh lifted a

airspace in order to help the airlines reduce their fuel costs and

cargo and special-purpose charter flights across the Taiwan Strait. </P>
      <P>An MOTC official said that after the Cabinet gives the nod to the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan posted a trade surplus of US$330
million in July after incurring a deficit of US$120 million in June,
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>According to MOF statistics, Taiwan registered a total foreign
trade surplus of US$750 million in the first seven months of this
year, down a whopping 84.3 percent from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-chung, director of the MOF's Statistics Department, said
that even though foreign trade ended up in the red in January, March
and June, the nation is not expected to post an unfavorable trade
imbalance this year.</P>
      <P>"As the second half of the year is traditionally an export boom
season for Taiwan, we believe our foreign trade will not end up in
the red for the whole year," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he added that the trade surplus is very likely to
fall to a new low in more than 20 years because of a combination of
factors, including an upward spiral of international crude oil prices
and a global economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>According to MOF tallies, Taiwan exported US$15.43 billion-worth
of goods in July, while imports totaled US$15.1 billion. Compared
with the same month of last year, both exports and imports posted
less-than-10-percent growth.</P>
      <P>In July, Hsu said, Taiwan's exports to the six ASEAN member
states plus Hong Kong, Japan and China only posted modest gains and
exports to the United States even dropped 1 percent. In contrast,
imports from Hong Kong, China, Europe and the six ASEAN countries rose
at double-digit rates.</P>

Yuan, following an apology offered earlier that day by Premier Frank
Hsieh for failing to live up to his promise to fully restore water to
the county.</P>
      <P>Residents in the county -- which is served by the Shihmen
reservoir -- have suffered water shortages during the last two years
almost every time there is a strong typhoon, as the water treatment
facilities are inadequate for dealing with the increased turbidity
that occurs in heavy rain.</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) had earlier hoped that supplies would be restored
Monday.</P>
      <P>However, heavy rain Sunday and Monday morning further increased
the turbidity of the water in the Shihmen reservoir.</P>
      <P>Cho claimed that the water shortage is due largely to natural
factors but admitted that long-term negligence in administration is
also to blame.</P>
      <P>Saying that Ho has "worked hard in this regard, " Cho expressed
hope that the public will give her more encouragement. He also said
the government will determine who should be held responsible only
after water supplies have been restored.</P>
      <P>According to Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu Li-lung, a project
costing NT$1 billion (US$31.9 million) just completed by the MOEA's
Water Resources Agency and the Taiwan Water Corporation in May to
catch water in the upper part of the reservoir failed when typhoon
Matsa swept the country last week.</P>
      <P>Chu suggested that the government should set up a new purifying
plant near the reservoir, as well as some other construction projects
related to water catchment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DATABANK NECESSARY TO FIGHT SEX CRIMES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Establishing a crime databank is extremely
important in the government's efforts to combat sex crimes in
conjunction with a modified and stricter law that took effect Friday,
according to law enforcement authorities.</P>
      <P>According to National Police Administration (NPA) statistics, a
total of 2,817 sex crimes were reported to police last year, 2,605 of
which were solved and 2,535 offenders arrested. A total of 2,903
people fell victim to sex offenses, with 1,498 aged between 12 and 17
forming the largest victim group and the 18-23 age group of 426
victims coming second.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that a vast majority of 92 percent of last
year's cases were solved, victims sometimes still live in the shadow
of fear for the rest of their lives, police said, adding that to help
the victims, the newly revised sex crime prevention act allows
broader legal protection for victims in the investigation process.</P>
      <P>The law also provides greater everyday protection for women by
setting up stronger and more consistent mechanisms in various
spectrums from community surveillance, medical treatment and public
registration with the aim of effectively warding off violent sex
crimes and assisting victims to build new lives, the NPA said.</P>
      <P>The law also stipulates that sex offenders released on bail must
periodically report to and register their personal data with police
authorities.</P>
      <P>Despite all these measures, it is also very important to set up a
national crime databank, which the NPA has been promoting, they
pointed out.</P>
      <P>According to NPA officials, U.S. law enforcement agencies already
have such a databank, which comprises criminal statistics,
classifications and artificial intelligence to help police make
composite judgments to break cases.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the 130-year-old El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC)
as an example, the NPA officials said that the EPIC is both a
coordination center and a crime databank that gathers and shares
information on illegal activities related to drug and weapons
trafficking, money laundering and smuggling.</P>
      <P>As the EPIC is a national crime-fighting center composed of
officials from the police, immigration, customs and coastal patrol
authorities from 18 states, it contains more than 100 million
criminal records and provides information around the clock, helping
to nab criminals swiftly even across different states, they
explained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, with the widespread use of computers and the Internet,
there is an urgent need for the government to set up a national unit
responsible for investigating Internet crime and keeping evidence
through digital technology, prosecution authorities said, adding that
the NPA, the Investigation Bureau and forensics should work together
toward that goal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WHO, TAIWAN WORKING ON ESTABLISHING PRACTICAL EXCHANGE MECHANISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Aug.  9 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The participation of two Taiwanese health
experts in the 6th Global Conference on Health Promotion being held
in Bangkok Aug. 7-11 demonstrates that the World Health Organization
(WTO) and Taiwan are working together to establish a practical
exchange mechanism.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that the WHO has invited Taiwan to take
part in an important international health meeting since the
organization signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with China in
May of this year. Taiwan has long encountered difficulties in
participating in WHO activities due to its lack of membership and to
China's interference.</P>
      <P>Although the World Health Assembly, the highest decision-making
body of the WHO, agreed last May to include the "Principle of
Universality" in its revised International Health Regulations (IHR) ,
which Taiwan believes will provide a legal basis for the island to
participate in WHO activities in the future, the revised regulations
do not go into effect until 2007.</P>
      <P>According to the MOU signed by the world health body and China,
the WHO can invite Taiwan health experts to participate in its
technical-level meetings and can send its experts or officials to the
island to deal with disease-investigation and disease-prevention
matters.</P>
      <P>WHO spokesman Iain Simpson has said that the organization has
decided to invite Taiwan's experts to participate in its
international health meetings based on the stipulations contained
within the MOU it signed with China.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Taiwan's stance of refusing to recognize the
memorandum remains unchanged. The island claims that its health
experts' participation in the current meeting in Bangkok has nothing
to do with the memorandum, which it says downgrades Taiwan to the
status of a local government.</P>
      <P>A source from Taiwan's mission in Geneva said that Taiwan's goal
is to participate in WHO activities "under the principles of equality
and dignity" as well as to establish a cooperation and exchange
framework with the organization.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Taiwan's participation in the Bangkok meeting is
the result of the island's own efforts, the source said that Taiwan
is not interested in the WHO spokesman's comments about the MOU
because the island does not recognize it.</P>
      <P>The source did admit that Taiwan and the WHO are still in the
feeling out stage in terms of finding ways to establish a stable and
effective framework for future cooperation and exchanges, adding that
the Bangkok meeting is at the very least a good start in this
respect.</P>

      <P>Singapore Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said

the purpose of China's recent enactment of an anti-secession law is
to maintain the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In the interview carried in the weekly's Aug. 8 issue, Lee

warning to the United States and others not to interfere in matters
related to the Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>Lee also said that one of the goals of China's military

by Taiwan and to dissuade the United States from coming to Taiwan's
defense in such a situation.</P>
      <P>China has no intention of attacking Taiwan, according to the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
said Tuesday that water supplies to Taoyuan County on a rotational
basis will continue, but claimed that supplies to the southern part
of the county can be fully restored by Saturday.
</P>
      <P>Ho also said that supplies to northern Taoyuan will also return
to normal if the turbidity in the catchment area of the Taoyuan river
returns to a normal level.</P>
      <P>Ho said she will take full responsibility if she fails to deliver
on her promise.</P>
      <P>Water supplies, a perennial headache for Taoyuan County, became a
problem again after typhoon Matsa, which swept across Taiwan Friday,
brought torrential rain and stirred up sediment, bringing silt and
debris into the Shihmen reservoir, the county's main supplier.
Approximately 600,000 households in Taoyuan are currently suffering
from water rationing.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Frank Hsieh convened a meeting Tuesday with
officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Water Resources
Agency and the Taiwan Water Corp. (TWC).</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Cho Jung-tai said the focus of the
meeting was how to solve the water shortage problem during the two to
three years until construction of new water purification plants is
complete.</P>
      <P>On who should take responsibility for the latest shortages, Cho
said the premier has said it is not the time to talk about who
should step down and that the more urgent task is to restore water
supplies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, TWC Chairman Lee Wen-liang said that despite days of
torrential rain that have raised the turbidity levels in rivers in
greater Kaohsiung and Taoyuan, greater Kaohsiung should have
sufficient water supplies barring more unexpected rain.</P>
      <P>But he was not optimistic about full restoration of water to
Taoyuan because of the high level of turbidity in the catchment areas
of the Shihmen reservoir.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VOTE-SELLING FATAL TO TAIWAN'S DEMOCRACY, FORMER PRESIDENT WARNS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug. 9 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Decrying the "intolerable" situation in
Taiwan of a "rich" government ruling poor people, former President
Lee Teng-hui said Tuesday that vote-selling not only hurts Taiwan's
democracy but will also deal it a fatal blow.</P>
      <P>Speaking to a group of school teachers and young men and women in
the southern port city, Lee, who led Taiwan from 1988 until 2000,
said when he was the nation's leader, economic growth averaged 6
percent to 7 percent a year, but now the nation's GDP growth has
slipped to a mere 2 percent or 3 percent.</P>
      <P>This, which he claimed is "poor economic performance, " has been
further troubled by a "higher than usual" unemployment rate, Lee
said. "Once the people have trouble leading a decent life, once
they're penniless, it's useless for Taiwan to have democracy only in
name," he said.</P>
      <P>He said he hopes the ruling class, once it has achieved its
political ideal of getting power, will try to reach "the proletariat
goal of sharing, " so that the poor will not be "forced to sell their
votes" and deal a deadly blow to Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>The ruling class should also talk with other political parties
over resource sharing, income distribution and any other worthy
topics, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Unless one of the parties is like the Communist Party, which
holds ideology above all, "there should not be any problem that
cannot be solved, " he said, emphasizing the importance of building
mutual trust and discussing in good faith.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that local Taiwanese should "understand and

    <HEADLINE>MIDDLE SCHOOL HERO AWARDED FOR FOILING BANK ROBBERY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Chiayi, Taiwan, Aug. 9 (CNA)
(By Jeffrey Twu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A courageous junior high school
student, surnamed Li, was awarded NT$20,000 (US$ 625) by the Police
Bureau of Chiayi City Tuesday in recognition of his bravery in
foiling a bank robbery a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Li, aged 13, witnessed the robbery Monday afternoon while passing
by the Talin Branch of Chiayi Fourth Credit Cooperative. Without
hesitation, he grabbed the robber's neck from behind to restrain him.
A number of tellers then rushed to help and overpowered the man
before turning him over to police. The robber had been arm with a
home-made handgun.</P>
      <P>Chiayi City Mayor Chen Li-chen, accompanied by the city's police
commissioner, Chen Kuo-en, held a citation ceremony for Li at Peihsin
Junior High School Tuesday morning, presenting him with the cash
award.</P>
      <P>Li's classmates expressed admiration for his bravery and quick
thinking, calling him a "hero." They said that Li has always been
willing to help others at school.</P>
      <P>Li also won praise from his father, although his concerned mother
suggested that he should not put his own safety at risk again if
faced with a similar situation in the future. Li, however, responded
by saying that he would still do what he had to if a similar
situation ever arose.</P>
      <P>According to the police investigation, the previously-convicted
robber Liu Kuo-chou tried to divert the attention of police ahead of
the robbery by claiming in a phone call that a bomb had been planted
at Peihsin Junior High School. In ironic twist of fate, Liu's robbery
attempt was foiled by a student from the very same school.</P>
      <P>Liu remains in police custody for further questioning ahead of
being formally charged by prosecutors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PRESIDENT'S OPPOSITION TO PENGHU-CHINA LINKS BACKFIRES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui's opposition
to direct links between Penghu and China has backfired on the
outlying island county, with local opinion leaders planning to head
for Taipei next week to ask for legislative support for the links.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Lin Pin-kun, Penghu County Council Speaker Liu Chen
Chao-ling and various other councilors made the announcement Monday
at a news conference in which they said they had decided to come to
Taipei Aug. 17 to demand that the Executive Yuan clarify its position
on the issue and to seek backing from the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Expressing their dissatisfaction with Lee's threat that
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) supporters will take to the
streets against a plan unveiled last week by Premier Frank Hsieh to
allow direct transport and trade links between Penghu and China on a
trial basis from September, they explicitly said "No" to Lee and
called on local residents to unite and rally against the TSU on the
streets.</P>
      <P>They asked President Chen Shui-bian and the premier not to be
distracted by Lee's political ideology and to stand firm on the
planned measure that will help promote Penghu's economy.</P>
      <P>If the TSU mobilizes supporters to block the government's plan,
Penghu residents are fully entitled to voice their opinion, they
argued, pointing out that Lee, when he served as president in 1997,
also favored wider opening for Penghu.</P>
      <P>Councilor Su Kun-hsiung, who is also chairman of the Penghu
Tourism Association, said he strongly believes that the opening will
benefit Penghu in many fields, including making the island county a
transit spot for cargo ships passing through the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Last Sunday, Lee blasted Hsieh's initiative to set up direct
links for Penghu with China, criticizing it as an awkward move
designed by the government to try to turn the tide of falling
popularity after failing to persuade Taiwan farmers not to sell their
produce to China.</P>

      <P>The cargo transportation operation of EVA
Airways has expanded significantly since the Taipei-based carrier
began cooperation with Shanghai Airlines two years ago on a cargo
flight route between Taipei and Shanghai via Macau, EVA officials
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>With abundant cargo sources in Shanghai, EVA's Taipei-U.S. cargo
shipments have risen to account for 60 percent of the company's total
cargo business, EVA officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the company's cargo aircraft takes
over Shanghai Airlines deliveries in Macau, then transports them via
Taipei to six major cities in the United States, including Atlanta,
Dallas, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York.</P>
      <P>Given the increasing shipping demands, EVA leased three MD-11
all-cargo airplanes this year to operate the U.S. cargo services, the
officials said, noting that the company took delivery of its third
leased aircraft in early August after introducing the first and
second planes in March and April, respectively.</P>
      <P>With the new aircraft, EVA now flies 44 all-cargo flights to the
United States per week. From September -- the U.S. traditional busy

per week to 13, the officials added.</P>

      <P>While screening the application, the report said, both the MAC

      <P>In the face of a deluge of Chinese textile

fierce competition, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

      <P>Cho Shih-chao, director-general of the MOFA's Economic and Trade

conclusion was reached in a report by a MOFA mission that recently
visited Lesotho, Malawi and Swaziland to provide professional

countries during an 11-day tour that began July 28.</P>
      <P>The report will be tendered to a Taiwan-Africa task force under

      <P>Wu Tao-chang, a member of the MOFA mission, urged Taiwan
investors in that part of world to get ready for the change with the

      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh issued instructions
Tuesday to relevant agencies to increase the water supply from Taipei
County's Pan-Hsin Water Plant to Taoyuan residents, who have suffered
water shortages during the last few days.</P>
      <P>Residents in Taoyuan County -- which is served by the Shihmen
reservoir -- have suffered water shortages during the last two years
almost every time there is a strong typhoon, as the water treatment
facilities are inadequate for dealing with the increased turbidity
that occurs after heavy rain.</P>
      <P>Tuesday was the fourth day that Taoyuan residents had suffered
water rationing after typhoon Matsa swept the country last Friday.</P>
      <P>At a ministerial conference, Hsieh said the Pan-Hsin Water Plant,
which supplies water to most parts of Taipei County, must increase
its water supply from the current 110,000 tons per day to 200,000
tons, while the relevant government agencies must improve the water
catchment in the upper part of the Shihmen reservoir to prevent the
mud brought by typhoon Matsa and recent rainfall clogging the
treatment facilities.</P>
      <P>In the long term, he added, the central and local governments
should cooperate in the construction of a high-end purification plant
near the reservoir that can handle 800,000 tons of water per day,
within two years.</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said the government will earmark
NT$600 million next year for water management, which will include

water from different levels of the reservoir.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of state-run Chunghwa
Telecom staged protests in northern, central and southern Taiwan
Tuesday as the company made 290 million shares available for private
and corporate investors in Taiwan as part of a move toward
privatization.</P>
      <P>The 290 million shares represent 3 percent of the company's total
shares.</P>
      <P>More than 30 union members sat in front of the Jenai Road service
center of Chunghwa Telecom -- Taiwan's largest telecommunications
company with revenues in the first half of this year totaling NT$89.7
billion (US$2.84 billion) -- holding banner that read "defending
working rights."</P>
      <P>Union Chairman Chang Hsu-chung said the strike will be a
long-term struggle and he urged the company's 28,000 staff, their
families and friends to call via cell phones for five minutes at 11
a.m., 3 p.m. and 4 p.m., "to create profits for Chunghwa Telecom."</P>
      <P>The union also supplied the phone numbers of the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, which has jurisdiction over
Chunghwa Telecom, and the Executive Yuan, urging the same people to
call at 11 a.m. simultaneously to express their protest.</P>
      <P>In Taichung, central Taiwan, around 100 Chunghwa Telecom union
officials staged a sit-in in front of Chunghwa's Taichung branch.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsin-mao, a spokesman for the sit-in, shouted slogans "oppose
conglomerization of Chunghwa," as well as "legal strike."</P>
      <P>Lin said that many union members joined the protest after
receiving notification via text messages.</P>
      <P>The strike was to highlight the "high-handed government, " Lin
said, claiming that the cash-strapped government is eager to sell the
shares to finance its arms procurement. He further claimed that this
violates a resolution of the Legislative Yuan to release the shares
only with full communications with the union to ensure the rights of
the workers.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, the strike seriously affected
telecommunications services, with repair and maintenance work, as
well as other services, coming to a virtual standstill.</P>
      <P>Union members of the Chunghwa Telecom Kaohsiung branch account
for two-thirds of the branch's staff, and union members from Chiayi,
Tainan and Pingtung also joined their Kaohsiung counterparts for the
protest.</P>
      <P>Faced with the strike, the management of the Kaohsiung branch
apologized for undermining the rights of customers, saying that they
would communicate with the union. They said they would also use the
limited available manpower to serve the customers and that the
management will also come out to provide direct service if necessary.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Chinese Federation of Labor Unions strongly
condemned Chunghwa Telecom for releasing shares at home and overseas
with total disregard for the Legislative Yuan's resolution.</P>
      <P>Lin Hui-kuan, president of the federation and an opposition
People First Party Legislator, said the strike is not simply a
labor-management dispute but is about whether the release of shares
of a state-owned enterprise will undermine the public interest.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Legislative Yuan passed the resolution that
Chunghwa Telecom should stop releasing shares May 27, but the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) still planned to
issue the American Depository Receipts (ADRs) in the United States and
will release a total of 17 percent of its shares at home and
overseas.</P>
      <P>This will mean that the MOTC, which owns 65 percent of Chunghwa,
will cut its share holdings to 48 percent, making the firm
technically a private company, Lin said, adding that financial groups
will then be able to easily take over management of Chunghwa, thereby
seriously affecting the public interest.</P>

      <P>Wang, who is in the United States with his family and will return
Wednesday, decided prior to the trip that he will preside over an
informal meeting Friday to discuss whether to convene a special
legislative session.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) requested the
special session to discuss the Executive Yuan's eight-year, NT$80
billion ( US$2.54 billion) flood-prevention project and five other
prioritized bills, although the Kuomintang (KMT), the main opposition
party, insists that it will only agree to a special session if the
only item on the agenda is the flood- control project.</P>
      <P>With the parties deadlocked on the issue, the KMT legislative
caucus said it has handed out questionnaires to KMT legislators to
learn about their views.</P>
      <P>Cho Po-yuan, a KMT caucus whip in the legislature, said there are
different views within the party on whether to convene a special
session, and the party will know more after the questionnaires are
collected on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>DPP officials have said that a special session should not only
discuss the flood-prevention proposal, adding that the NT$480 billion
arms procurement package, the confirmation of Control Yuan members,
proposed amendments to the Executive Yuan Organic Law, proposed
amendments to the tobacco and liquor tax law, and a draft bill
concerning the establishment of a labor pension fund monitoring
committee are also urgent matters that need to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>All six bills should be reviewed in the special session and
should not be left to the next regular session which is scheduled to
open in September, they stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIST WARNS OF SLOWING EXPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An economist warned Tuesday of Taiwan's
slowing exports and called on the government to craft adequate
policies and make effective adjustments to improve what he described
as eroding competitiveness in the face of China's fierce challenges.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, Taiwan Thinktank chairman and a former chairman of
the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development, made
the comments in an interview with the CNA.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that slowing exports, rather than shrinking trade
surplus, is a clear reflection of Taiwan's falling competitive edge
and deteriorating business climate, Chen urged the government to
tackle the problem of Chinese products increasingly replacing
Taiwan-made goods in the world market and the many possible side
effects.</P>
      <P>Taiwan registered a trade surplus of US$750 million in the first
seven months of this year, a plunge from the previous year's US$4.77
billion, according to statistics compiled by the Ministry of Finance
(MOF). Vice Premier Wu Rong-i called it an issue of major concern and
said that relevant authorities will do something to improve the
situation.</P>
      <P>MOF statistics show that Taiwan outbound shipments increased by
only 6.6 percent in the same seven-month period year to year, lagging
behind an annual 11.2 precent expansion rate in inbound shipments.</P>
      <P>Noting that an export increase rate of 7 percent or above can be
viewed as an indication that a country's competitive edge remains
benign, Chen ascribed Taiwan's slowing export growth to the fact that
locally made products are increasingly being edged out by Chinese
merchandise in the world market and he called for government
initiatives to boost exports.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan exports in July hit US$15.43 billion, up by 5.3
percent over the previous year's level and an increase of 3.1 percent
compared with June's level, MOF tallies show.</P>
      <P>Taiwan imports in July expanded by an annual growth of 9.7
percent to US$15.1 billion, up from a 2.5 percent rise in June,
leaving the country with a trade surplus of US$330 million for July.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT CONCERNED ABOUT WATER SHORTAGE IN TAOYUAN COUNTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 9 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu urged the Taoyuan
county government Tuesday to cooperate with the central government in
its efforts to alleviate the water shortage problems that have been
plaguing local residents for years.</P>
      <P>Lu expressed her concerns before attending a weekly meeting of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's central standing committee
in Taipei. She said that both the central and local government should
review existing measures for dealing with water sources in Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>In response to a roasting from Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu
Li-lun of the central government over its reluctance to help Taoyuan,
the vice president, who had served as magistrate of Taoyuan County for
three years, said the administration should be responsible for the
problem.</P>
      <P>During her three-year term as Taoyuan county chief, Taoyuan had
the best record of water and soil conservation in the country and its
Shihmen reservoir was never subject to serious silting, she claimed.</P>
      <P>After typhoon Matsa swept Taiwan Aug. 5, bringing torrential rain
to northern parts of Taiwan, Taoyuan has suffered a serious water
shortage because the water in the Shihmen reservoir is too muddy to
serve for household use.</P>
      <P>Lu said that besides the Shihmen reservoir, many other reservoirs
around Taiwan are also suffering from silting. She said modern
technology could transform this silt into useful construction
material if efforts were taken to develop such technology, she
claimed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA BEGINS SELECTION OF PANDAS THAT COULD BE SENT TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China began a process Tuesday to select
which two pandas could be sent to Taiwan as gifts, assuming that
Taiwan decides to accept them.</P>
      <P>Media reports said that a "panda selection show, " sponsored by
the Taiwan Affairs Office under the State Council and the State
Forestry Bureau, kicked off at the Wolong Nature Reserve in Sichuan
province Tuesday. A score of panda experts and scholars will select a
male and a female from the 17 prospective pandas, all of which were
bred in captivity.</P>
      <P>China offered a pair of pandas to opposition Kuomintang Chairman
Lien Chan in early May as a goodwill gesture to the people of Taiwan,
but it has not been decided if Taiwan will be willing or able to
accept the pandas, despite keen interest expressed by both Taipei and
Taichung to house the rare animals.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile officials from the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
that whether Taiwan can accept the pandas will depend on four
conditions. First is to find a suitable home for the animals since
the wildlife conservation law stipulates that such animals must be
cared for in appropriate places, such as zoos and research
institutions of college and universities.</P>
      <P>The second condition is whether the animals can be correctly
provided for, including sufficient medical care. The third is whether
the delivery of the pandas will conform to relevant domestic
regulations; and lastly, major international conservation groups
would have to have a say on whether Taiwan is able to take care of
the animals.</P>
      <P>MAC officials said that if there is no controversy concerning the
entry of the pandas, and wildlife conservation groups also agree to
their being shipped to Taiwan and the four conditions are also met,
then the animals will likely be allowed to come to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO MAKE TWO CASES FOR U.N. BID THIS YEAR: FOREIGN MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government will make
two cases for its U.N. participation this year and will bring to the
world's attention China's ever-growing threat to Taiwan, Minister of
Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking during an informal meeting with local journalists, Chen
said he thinks that this year is a good time for Taiwan to promote
its bid to join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>"This year marks the U.N.'s 60th anniversary. Since the goal of
the U.N. is to maintain world peace, we plan to come up with a
proposal to make sure that the U.N. pays attention to the situation
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, Taiwan has tried every year to ask the U.N. Steering
Committee through its diplomatic allies to place Taiwan's U.N. bid on
the General Assembly agenda. Taiwan has been unsuccessful every time
beacuse of China's obstruction.</P>
      <P>In addition to pushing the U.N. Steering Committee to discuss
Taiwan's U.N. bid this year, Chen said the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) is considering putting forth another proposal urging
the U.N. to take note of China's threat to Taiwan and take steps to
safeguard peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Foreign ministry officials said earlier this month that the
"safeguarding cross-strait peace" proposal is scheduled to be
referred to the U.N. Secretariat Aug. 12, and the foreign ministry
will hold a news conference at 3 p.m. that day to brief the public on
the proposal.</P>
      <P>During Tuesday's talks with local reporters, Chen said the
government will tell of the Taiwan Strait situation in a rational and
moderate manner to convince the world that Taiwan loves peace and
wants to resolve disputes with China.</P>
      <P>"We'll also explain our way of thinking about China's recently
passed Anti-Secession Law in a calm and collected way," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, Chen said, China has launched an
international publicity campaign aimed at projecting Taiwan in a
negative light.</P>
      <P>Chen said the trend reversed itself following China's passage of
the Anti-Secession Law, which codifies the use of "non-peaceful
means" against Taiwan. Many countries criticized the law, Chen said,
adding that the substantial growth in China's military spending and
the unveiling of U.S. and Japanese reports on China's growing
military power all point to growing international concern about
Taiwan Strait security.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, our 'peace' proposal will arouse U.N. attention to
the Taiwan Strait issue, thereby giving China a chance to understand
that the world is watching the Taiwan Strait situation and thus
reducing the risk of a conflict in the region, " Chen said, adding
that the government will brief U.S. authorities on the key points of
the "peace" proposal.</P>
      <P>The 2005 General Assembly is scheduled to start Sept. 13 at the
U.N. general headquarters in New York.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.  9 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The caucuses of the two major opposition
parties in the legislature Tuesday urged the government to take
effective measures to stabilize vegetable and other food prices,
which have soared to new highs since typhoon Matsa hit Taiwan last
Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung, a whip of the Kuomintang's (KMT) legislative
caucus, together with KMT Legislator Kuo Su-chun and Chin Huei-chu, a
whip of the People First Party caucus, invited members of the news
media to join them for a trip to Taipei City's South Gate Market to
see for themselves whether vegetable prices had not gone up because
of the typhoon, as Premier Frank Hsieh claimed.</P>
      <P>The opposition legislators said the trip was made to show that
Premier Hsieh knew nothing about vegetable prices and that he ought
to feel the anger of housewives at soaring food prices.</P>
      <P>On the day when Typhoon Matsa struck Taiwan last week, the
premier went to a hypermarket along with a media entourage and filled
a basket with eggs, carrots, grapefruits, grapes and two bundles of
mater convolvulus -- a leafy vegetable that grow in water known as
"kung hsin tsai" in Chinese -- with the bill coming to NT$270.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to prove that the premier was merely putting on a
show, the opposition legislators bought two heads of cabbage, two
carrots and two bundles of "kung hsin tsai" at a cost of NT$303.</P>
      <P>They criticized the premier for giving the public "wrong
information" about food prices and said the government should take
real measures to stabilize prices, knowing that price hikes are
unavoidable because of typhoons.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Council of Agriculture said that
vegetable prices are expected to go back to normal gradually this
week as supplies increase.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the agriculture council hopes to keep
vegetable supplies at 1,100 metric tons daily. He said that there are
still 2,700 tons of refrigerated vegetable and 997 tons of frozen
vegetables in warehouses -- enough to help cope with price
fluctuations.</P>

Wall Street Journal: At Gucci, Mr. Polet's New Design Upends
Rules for High Fashion

When the 50-yeaqr-old Robert Polet took the helm of Gucci Group
in July last year, he has been trashing trashing luxury-industry
taboos. Under its previous management, Gucci Group worshiped the cult
of the all-powerful designer, a phenomenon epitomized by Tom Ford,
Gucci's former creative chief. Polet, by contrast, thinks there's no
reason why high-fashion houses shouldn't borrow some of the standard
business practices used in other industries. He's pressing designers
to keep tabs on what consumers want through research, such as focus
groups. Over opposition from Ford holdovers, he's expanding Gucci
into products such as flowered silk scarves and ice buckets. And
while he agrees that creativity and quality are at the core of the
business, he says the 82- year-old Gucci is stronger than any one
designer. His approach has revitalized an age-old debate in the
industry: Should you lead the consumer or follow her?</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, angered by the
recurrence of water shortages in Taoyuan County, said Tuesday any
official found to be responsible for the problem should step down.</P>
      <P>Chen made the statement while receiving a group of leaders of
Lions Clubs International at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The president said he felt very sorry and was ashamed that
Taoyuan County, which suffered water shortages last August after
Typhoon Aere, is now in the same situation after Typhoon Matsa passed
by the island last week.</P>
      <P>Now, four days after the typhoon has gone, water supplies in
Taoyuan County are still not fully restored, and the administration
owes the residents an explanation as to why this problem happened
again and when water supplies will be restored, the president said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government spent NT$1 billion last year trying to
solve the problem, the president said that it appears that all the
work was in vain.</P>
      <P>"There is something wrong here and officials making apologies
isn't going to make it go away, " the president said, referring to an
apology made by Premier Frank Hsieh the previous day after the Taiwan
Water Corporation (TWC) failed to restore water supplies in Taoyuan
County on that day as the premier has said that they would be.</P>
      <P>"The administration must find who is responsible for this and
that person or persons must resign and bow to the public, " the
president said.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County, which depends on the Shihmen Reservoir for its
drinking water, has been on rotational water rationing since last
Friday after Typhoon Matsa made the water in the reservoir too turbid

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The outcome of the referendum on Taiwan's
self defense held at the same time as last year's presidential
election vetoed the idea of Taiwan purchasing anti-missile weaponry,
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) spokesman Chang Jung-kun said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks amid the anger expressed by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) toward the KMT's objection to an
arms procurement package, in which Taiwan wants to purchase eight
diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the
U.S. for NT$480 billion.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the results of the referendum organized by the
DPP government along with the presidential election on March 20 last
year showed that the people were opposed to the government purchasing
anti-missile systems.</P>
      <P>In last year's referendum, the voters were asked whether the
government should acquire more advanced anti-missile weapons and
whether the government should engage in negotiations with mainland
China on the establishment of a peace and stability framework for
cross-strait interactions to build consensus and for the welfare of
the peoples of both sides?"</P>
      <P>Only 45.16 percent of voters cast the ballot on the first
question, rendering the referendum invalid, as 50 percent had been
previously determined as the threshold for the vote to be valid,
although over 90 percent of those who did vote answered "yes" to both
questions.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, President Chen Shui-bian has ignored the
results of the referendum, while criticizing the objections of the
KMT to the arms purchase.</P>
      <P>Concerning the reports that the World Federation of Taiwanese
Associations will organize a mass demonstration on Sept. 25 calling
for support for the arms procurement to strengthen Taiwan's national
defense, Chang said President Chen should face the outcome of last
year's referendum and make an open apology to the public for failing
to respect the decision of the public.</P>

it will organize a march in Taipei Sept. 25 to push the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan to pass a long-stalled arms
procurement package as early as possible to meet the nation's defense
needs.</P>
      <P>The Hand-in-Hand-to-Protect-Taiwan Alliance said the march is

      <P>Ng Chiau-tong, the alliance's convener, said the march is aimed
at urging the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT)
and the People First Party (PFP) to put aside partisan bickering and
pass the two arms procurement package-related bills for the sake of
beefing up Taiwan's defense capabilities in the face of China's
ever-growing threat.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its "pan-green"
ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) -- both of which prioritize

      <P>The two bills in question will pave the way for procuring eight
diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the
United States. One bill will authorize the administration to prepare
a special budget for the NT$480 billion arms procurement package over
a period of 15 years, the other bill is regarding budget
appropriations for the package.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" has used its slim majority in the

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
said Tuesday he has contributed an article to the Harvard
International Review to promote Taiwan's bid to join the United

      <P>Speaking with local journalists during an informal meeting, Chen

awareness of the necessity for Taiwan to have representation in the
United Nations and greater presence in the international community as
a whole.</P>
      <P>"We have not done enough to promote our U.N. bid. We really need
to step up international publicity to solicit more support for our
cause," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The article, titled "Joining the Global Village -- Taiwan's

summer edition of the prestigious magazine.</P>
      <P>Chen said he listed a number of reasons in the four-page article

      <P>The reasons outlined by Chen included that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait need a multilateral framework to ensure cross-strait
peace and forge cooperation; Taiwan should be included in the global
anti-terrorism mechanism because terrorist actions are borderless;
Taiwan, as one of the world's six largest deep-sea fishing countries
and a major maritime transport service provider, should be included
in the global fishery resources and maritime environment protection
mechanism; Taiwan should not be excluded from the global health and
disease prevention networks; and Taiwan is willing and able to offer

    <TEXT>
      <P>The sharp surge of imports in the first
seven months of this year is healthy, a government economist said
Tuesday amid public concerns over the rapid shrinkage of the island's
trade surplus during this period.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ming-feng, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development under the Executive Yuan, said the country' imports
were driven up by 11.2 percent over the corresponding period of last
year because of the country's purchase of aircraft as well as
carriages for the high-speed railway, in addition to the increase in
imported oil costs.</P>
      <P>In a breakdown of the outlays for imports, Yeh said the rise in
international oil prices has inflated the country's payments for fuel
by US$2.57 billion over the same period of last year, not to mention
the US$880 million for the delivery of seven Airbus planes, and
US$480 million for carriages to be used on the high-speed railway.</P>
      <P>However, all of the them are spendings for capital assets and
agricultural and industrial raw materials which will in turn help the
country's exports in the long term and are healthy for economic
development, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan registered imports of US$104.3 billion, exports of
US$105.1 billion and a trade surplus of US$750 million, which is the
lowest in decades.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, CHINA CAN LEARN FROM EUROPEAN INTEGRATION: PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said in an
interview with the mass-circulation Russian daily "Trud" that it is
worthwhile for both sides of the Taiwan Strait to learn from the
European Union's integration process.</P>
      <P>In the exclusive interview carried in the newspaper's Aug. 9
issue, the president said that the successful integration of the E.U.
is based on the principles of democracy, equality, peace and
economics as well as respect for each of the member state's free
will.</P>
      <P>"All E.U. members are equal and cannot resort to the use of force
to solve their problems with one another," he further said.</P>
      <P>The president also pointed out that process of Europe's
integration began with the states discussing economic issues without
touching on political and other ideological issues.</P>
      <P>Saying that he would like to create an environment of peaceful
development and free choice for both sides of the strait to normalize
their relations, Chen stressed that he does not exclude the
possibility of establishing any kind of cross-strait political
relationship in the future if the people want him to do so.</P>
      <P>However, he said that it is regrettable that China has not
adhered to the four principles and spirit of the E.U.'s integration
process to work on promoting cross-strait reconciliation and
dialogue. "On the contrary, Beijing has dealt with matters with
Taiwan by violating these principles and spirit, " he added.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that China has violated the democratic principle and
has not respected the free will and right of the 23 million people of
Taiwan to determine their own future, the president said that Beijing
has also disregarded the principle of equality by viewing itself as
the central government while attempting to marginalize and downgrade
Taiwan to the status of a local government.</P>
      <P>He also criticized what he called China's violation of the
principle of peace in handling matters with Taiwan, pointing out that
Beijing has been actively building up its military and that it has
refused to abandon the option of force against the island to solve
cross-strait problems.</P>
      <P>Accusing China of "not respecting the principle of economics, "
Chen said that Beijing has always politicized economic issues, such
as the issue of Taiwan's farm exports to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Talking about Taiwan's future democratic process, the president
said that the right to referendums is an important foundation for the
island to consolidate its democracy and a concrete manifestation of
the people's right to self-determination. He added that he is very
proud that the Taiwan people have finally obtained this right, which
he called "a basic human right and universal value."</P>
      <P>Chen also promised that in order to make Taiwan "a normal,
progressive, beautiful and great nation, " his government will
continue to push for constitutional reform, expressing the hope that
a new constitution can be promulgated by May 20, 2008.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT, PREMIER TO INSPECT SHIHMEN RESERVOIR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is scheduled to
tour the Shihmen Reservoir Wednesday afternoon in company with
Premier Frank Hsieh to inspect and understand first-hand the heart of
the persistent water shortage problem in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>Angered by the recurrence of water shortages in the northern
county, Chen said a day earlier that any official found to be
responsible for the problem should step down.</P>
      <P>Chen and Hsieh, who will be flanked by Economic Affairs Minister
Ho Mei-yueh, Water Resources Agency Director Chen Shen-hsien and
Taiwan Water Co. Chairman Lee Wen-liang, are expected to inspect,
aboard helicopter, the Shihmen Reservoir, one of the major reservoirs
supplying running water to residents in northern Taiwan, its
immediate catchment area and its filtering systems, according to
Executive Yuan spokesman Cho Jung-tai.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County, which suffered water shortages last August after
Typhoon Aere, is now in the same situation after Typhoon Matsa passed
near the island last week, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds
to the island. Nearly a week later, water supply in Taoyuan County
has still not been fully restored.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government spent NT$1 billion last year trying to
solve the problem, Chen said that it appears that "all the work was
in vain." He said the administration owes the residents an
explanation as to why this problem has occurred again and when normal
water supply will be restored.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Hsieh said Wednesday that he is confident that
his administration will give Taoyuan residents clean water if given
some time.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that the water shortage scourge should be tackled
immediately and at its root, including water and soil conservation
measures in the reservoir's catchment areas, a ban on deforestation,
and an overhaul of the decades-old reservoir, including its water
filtering, pumping and supplying systems. He added that it will take
time to implement all these measures.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County, which depends on the Shihmen Reservoir for its
drinking water supply, has been subjected to rotational water
rationing since last Friday after rains brought by Typhoon Matsa made
the water in the reservoir too muddy for the purification plant to
operate properly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LANDS ON PENGJIA ISLET, ASSERTS CLAIM TO TIAOYUTAIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reiterated
Taiwan's sovereignty claim to the Tiaoyutai islands Wednesday, saying
the government's stance toward the issue has been clear and
steadfast.</P>
      <P>"The Tiaoyutais belong to Taiwan and our stance on the issue has
never wavered or changed, " Chen said while presiding over a new
"Territorial Water Shield" monument-unveiling ceremony on Pengjia, off
the northern Taiwan coast.</P>
      <P>Chen landed on the islet from a helicopter, making him the first
Republic of China head of state ever to set foot on the nation's
northernmost territory.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Chen said Pengjia sits on an important
economic and strategic location, forming a chain with the neighboring
Tiaoyutais to control the entrance to the East China Sea continental
shelf, and that the surrounding area is one of the world's four
largest fishing grounds.</P>
      <P>In addition to boosting the morale of coast guard and military
personnel stationed on the islet, Chen said his unprecedented visit
was also aimed at accentuating the government's resolve to maintain
law and order in its northern territorial waters amid fishing
disputes with Japan and frequent reports of poaching by Chinese
fishing boats in the region.</P>
      <P>With a view to expanding its policing area and providing better
protection for local fishermen, the Cabinet-level Coast Guard
Administration plans to build new bases on Pengjia to facilitate
patrol missions and monitoring of oil exploration disputes among
neighboring countries, including Japan, China and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Noting that the fishing dispute between Taiwan and Japan mainly
results from the two countries' conflicting claim to the Tiaoyutais,
Chen said the government has never compromised on its sovereignty
claim.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais are a group of uninhabited islets in the East
China Sea, located some 120 nautical miles northeast of Taiwan. The
Tiaoyutais have been held by Japan since 1972, but Taiwan has never
forsaken its sovereignty claim because the surrounding waters have
been Taiwan's traditional fishing grounds. Over the years, Japanese
coast guard patrols have often impounded Taiwan fishing boats
entering the region and have fined the ship owners.</P>
      <P>The two countries have held 15 rounds of fishery talks since 1996
but have yet to work out mutually acceptable terms.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan, as a liberal, democratic and peace-loving
country, is obliged to resolve international disputes, including
those resulting from overlapping economic zones and conflicting
territorial claims, through negotiations in line with international
law and precedents, instead of adopting any unilateral
confrontational moves.</P>
      <P>"The ROC government, while never retreating from its claim to the
Tiaoyutais, has consistently delinked the sovereignty issue from its
fishing right dispute with Japan," Chen said, adding that major local
fishermen's associations have also thrown their support behind the
government's "separate handling" stance. Chen further said his
administration will do whatever it can to secure the best possible
benefits for local fishermen in negotiations with Japan.</P>
      <P>During the 15th round of Taiwan-Japan fishery talks in Tokyo July
29, Chen said the two sides agreed to form working groups to
facilitate communications and interaction. "I'm convinced that this
new mechanism will contribute to an eventual solution to the
dispute," he added.</P>
      <P>As part of the Pengjia monument ceremony, Chen autographed copies
of a new book published by the Coast Guard Administration to
introduce Taiwan's territorial waters and 200-mile exclusive economic
zones.</P>
      <P>Pengjia islet, Mienhua islet and Huaping islet are known as
Taiwan's three northernmost outlying islands. Pengjia is the largest
of the three, with an area of 10,014 square kilometers. Located
some 56 km northeast of Keelung Harbor, Pengjia is guarded by
military personnel and coast guard officers. It also boasts a
helipad, a meteorological observation station and a lighthouse. Of the
three islets, it is the only inhabited one.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GARLIC FARMERS PROTEST COA'S SALE OF STOCKPILED PRODUCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 300 garlic farmers from the
south-central county of Yunlin were bussed to Taipei Wednesday to
protest what they claimed is the administration's "suppressing prices
of domestically produced garlic."</P>
      <P>Noting that there is no garlic supply problem in Taiwan and that
current prices for domestically produced garlic are low, the farmers
lashed out at the Council of Agriculture (COA) for putting stockpiled
garlic on local markets, artificially disturbing prices "for no
reason."</P>
      <P>They argued that only when garlic prices surge to NT$50 (US$1.58)
per kilogram or higher as a result of shortages in supply should the
COA put stockpiled garlic on the market.</P>
      <P>Defending the COA move, however, COA Department of Food and
Agriculture Director Huang You-tsai pointed out that the COA released
the garlic only after two typhoons drowned Taiwan with torrential
rain over the last two weeks, causing vegetable prices to skyrocket,
particularly that of green onions.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the COA released the garlic in consideration that
garlic can be used as an alternative to green onions.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Huang argued, the stockpiled garlic, totaling
1.8 metric tons per day, was only equivalent to some 1.5 percent of
the total amount of garlic sold in Taiwan each day.</P>
      <P>According to Yu Yuan-fa, one of the protesting farmers, about
57,000 tons of garlic is expected to be produced in Taiwan this year.
With some 9,000 tons being procured by the government -- ostensibly
to help regulate prices when it is in short supply -- about 48,000
tons are expected to be sold this year on the domestic market, which,
Yu said, consumes only an average of 47,000 tons annually in normal
years.</P>
      <P>In addition to the annual production totaling 57,000 tons this
year, some 4,000 tons has been stockpiled since last year and Taiwan
is scheduled to import 3,500 tons this year under World Trade
Organization (WTO) requirements, Yu said.</P>
      <P>Judging from these figures, Yu said, garlic prices will only be
driven lower, leaving no reason for the COA to release the stockpiled
produce at the time when supply is sufficient and the prices are
reasonably low at between NT$33-NT$40 per kilo.</P>
      <P>Yu, speaking on behalf of the garlic farmers, called for the COA
to help export extra garlic from Taiwan to avoid a collapse in
prices.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PLATFORM-EDGE DOORS TO PREVENT SUICIDES AT TAIPEI MRT STATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>All stations on Taipei's mass rapid transit
railway system (MRT) will eventually be equipped with platform-edge
doors to prevent suicides and accidents, a spokesman for the
Department of Rapid Transit Systems under the Taipei city government
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman pointed out that at present, only the Mucha Line
stations have such doors and that as the number of suicides and
attempted suicides keeps rising along the other lines, the department
has decided to add the safety doors to all remaining stations,
beginning with the Taipei Main Station and the Chunghsiao-Fuhsing
Station -- the two busiest stations on the system.</P>
      <P>He also said that stations along the two new lines under
construction -- the Hsinchuang-Luchou Line and the Neihu Line -- have
already had their designs modified to add the safety doors.</P>
      <P>The operation of the doors is synchronized with the operation of
the train doors. In order for them to open, they have to be correctly
aligned.</P>
      <P>The true value of the doors is in extreme climates, where they
can reduce station energy costs, but some cities, such as London,
where more than 100 people take their own lives by jumping onto the
track each year, equip some of its metro stations with such doors to
prevent suicide attempts.</P>
      <P>Figures compiled by the Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. show that
since MRT began operations in 1996, 24 accidents have occurred
because of passengers jumping or falling onto the track. Seven people
have been killed, mostly on the Tansui Line.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC WARNS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF BEIJING'S UNITED FRONT TACTICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing has strengthened efforts to boost
all kinds of exchanges with Taiwan's local governments as part of its
"united front" tactics aimed at downgrading Taiwan's national status,
according to the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>Citing information that it received recently, the MAC said that
Beijing has tried hard to create the feeling that Taiwan is a
province of China by stepping up efforts to enhance exchanges and
activities with Taiwan's city and county authorities.</P>
      <P>The MAC said it has officially notified all local governments of
what it claims are Beijing's "covert moves" and has always followed
an instruction from President Chen Shui-bian issued more than a year
ago to frequently exchange opinions and viewpoints with local
authorities on China affairs.</P>
      <P>According to MAC officials, Beijing's decision to launch a new
wave of united front tactics seeks to bolster direct and close
contacts with Taiwan's local governments to underscore its "one China
principle" and pacify international concern after it enacted its
Anti-Secession Law against Taiwan in mid-March.</P>
      <P>For instance, the Beijing-based China Internet Information Center
has contacted various local city and county governments asking them
to provide relevant data and information under the excuse of editing
a yearbook, the officials said, adding that the Chinese Ministry of
Culture also has requested several cultural establishments in Taiwan
to offer material to help it edit an art book.</P>
      <P>In documents and letters sent by Beijing to these local
authorities in Taiwan, Beijing has never failed to make the claim
that they were "nationwide" activities which suggest that Taiwan is a
part of China, they noted.</P>
      <P>The developments are indications that Beijing is attempting to
build a climate to make the world believe that Taiwan is a Chinese
province under its sovereignty by luring Taiwan's local governments
to fall into its "one China" trap, they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INVESTMENT SPENDING CONDUCIVE TO FUTURE DEVELOPMENT: GOVERNMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The record low trade surplus for the first
seven months of this year is a result of added imports of capital
goods, an investment that will help yield higher growth and larger
revenues for the country in the coming years, a government spokesman
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's trade surplus stood at US$420 million in the first half
of this year, a decrease of 89.1 percent over the same period of
2004. The surplus in the first seven months is likely to fall to a
new low in more than 20 years because of a combination of factors,
including an upward spiral of international crude oil prices.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Cho Jung-tai attributed the record low
trade surplus to several factors, including spiralling oil prices,
the Taiwan High-Speed Railway Corp.'s imports of carriages, purchases
of Airbus planes by China Airlines and EVA Airways, and factory
expansions by several semiconductor manufacturing companies and LCD
display panel manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Cho said this spending represents "healthy" investments
conducive to future development for those major corporations and
added that their investments will help create higher economic growth
for the country in the long run.</P>
      <P>He also quoted Premier Frank Hsieh as saying during a regular
Executive Yuan meeting that day that the administration is confident
that the unemployment rate will be controlled at 4 percent or lower
for this year, although more efforts are needed to achieve that goal.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Shuttle Glides to Safe
Landing; Problems Ahead

The shuttle Discovery glided back to Earth in a predawn landing
in the Mojave Desert on Tuesday, after a mission of 14 days and 5.8
million miles that successfully returned NASA to human spaceflight
but also added pressure on the agency to move beyond the shuttle
program. The Discovery mission blended success and frustration, hope
and poignancy. The launching was delayed repeatedly, and a problem
with a fuel level sensor forced mission controllers to scrub a
planned July 13 effort just two and a half hours before liftoff. And
though modifications made to the external fuel tank resulted in far
less launching debris than usual, five large pieces of foam - one
weighing nearly a pound - popped off the tank, showing that a
potentially fatal problem had not been corrected. NASA has said that
until the foam myst ery is solved and the problem fixed, shuttles
will not fly again.

Wall Street Journal: FBI Sees Big Threat From Chinese Spies;
Businesses Wonder

In one of their biggest initiatives after the fight against
terrorism, the FBI and Justice Department have sent hundreds of new
counterintelligence agents into the bureau's 56 field offices, many
with a specific focus on China. There is a cloak-and-dagger element
to some of this: A principal FBI team focusing on Chinese economic
espionage, including some undercover operatives, occupies an unmarked
floor in a Silicon Valley office park near a popular Chinese
restaurant. But this is an altoge ther different battle from the one
with the Soviets. Thousands of Chinese nationals regularly come to
the U.S. as students and businessmen, some working for major U.S.
defense contractors. The vast majority of them are innocently working
or studying. Counterespionage experts say the trouble often starts
when they are contacted by Chinese government officials or one of the
more than 3,000 Chinese "front compan ies" the FBI alleges have been
set up in the U.S. specifically to acquire military or industrial
technologies illegally. Sometimes they are wooed with cash, but often
the motivation is nationalism.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>As the World Health Organization (WHO)
continues to issue alerts that avian flu in Southeast Asia could
trigger a global outbreak, the Department of Health (DOH) called on
the Taiwan public Wednesday to avoid contact with birds and fowls and
not to eat raw poultry.</P>
      <P>The DOH advised the public to visit a doctor as soon as possible
if they have a fever and a sore throat after returning from a trip to
affected areas.</P>
      <P>The virulent H5N1 bird flu virus is still plaguing Southeast Asia
and China. It is also found in Siberia. WHO data shows that the
latest outbreak has infected 112 people, killing 57 of them, though
it has not yet been passed among humans.</P>
      <P>The DOH quoted academic journals as claiming that proper public
health measures could drastically bring down the infection rate from
384 per thousand to 0.3 per thousand.</P>
      <P>The DOH's Center for Disease Control said the public health
infrastructures in Southeast Asian countries needs to be strengthened
through international cooperation in the hope that any change in the
flu virus will be detected early.</P>
      <P>In the event of an epidemic, said the center, antibiotics should
be dispensed as quickly as possible in step with other public health
measures to stop the virus from spreading and prompting a global
outbreak.</P>
      <P>With that in mind, the center said Taiwan has donated 600,000
doses of anti-virus medicines to Vietnam, which center officials
claimed should help stop the disease from becoming contagious.</P>
      <P>The WHO has recommended that Asian countries adopt such
strategies as suspending public gatherings, restricting travel and
imposing self-quarantine measures at home.</P>
      <P>The DOH said new flu viruses can be communicated even before
carriers show symptoms of disease. Therefore, it added, if a
worldwide outbreak does occur, the government will enforce its public
authority to control and contain the spread.</P>
      <P>It advised people to form good hygiene habits, eat balanced diets
and exercise to boost their immune systems, in addition to paying

Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that he will unveil the party's personnel
lineup next week amid reports that his top campaign aide will soon
take over as the party's new secretary-general.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks following reports that Chan Chuen-pao,
director of Ma's campaign office, is widely tipped to be named as the
party's new secretary-general.</P>
      <P>Ma said that after the lineup is finalized, he will announce it
before the party congress. which is scheduled to open Aug. 19.</P>
      <P>Outgoing KMT secretary-general Lin Feng-cheng will lead party
officials in an en masse resignation Aug. 18.</P>
      <P>The KMT's Central Standing Committee has approved the themes of
the party's 17th congress as the "re-emergence of blue sky, infinite
happiness -- democracy, legacy, peace and mutual benefit, " to
demonstrate the party's commitment and determination to return to
power in 2008. The KMT is represented by the color blue.</P>
      <P>Lai Su-jui, director of the KMT's Department of Culture and
Information, said the party chairmanship handover ceremony will be
held prior to the convening of the congress. As this will be the
first party chairman changeover in the nearly 110-year history of the
party, there will be no witnesses but all delegates when Lien passes
the party's official seal to Ma.</P>
      <P>During the ceremony, the party will express appreciation for
Lien's contributions to the party during his term.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
said Wednesday that Taiwan, Japan and the United States should
cooperate to cope with China's military expansion.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks when she was interviewed by the Yomiuri
Shimbun, Japan's largest circulation national newspaper, in Taipei.</P>
      <P>She cited a recent U.S. Pentagon report on China's military power
to say that what she claimed is China's "unlimited" military
expansion is not only meant to attack Taiwan, but also meant to
challenge Japan and the United States, and that the three parties
need to cooperate to cope with this.</P>
      <P>She stressed the importance of the United States and Japan
listing peace in the Taiwan Strait as a common strategic objective in
their joint statement after a security committee consultative meeting
in February and said the statement is significant in ensuring
Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>Lu said that President Chen Shui-bian's government will never
develop nuclear weapons and has no intention of engaging in an arms
race with China.</P>
      <P>She also defended President Chen's recent remarks on "four stages"
of the ROC to more clearly explain its national identity after it
was criticized by China.</P>
      <P>The president said the ROC was established in China in 1912. In
1949, the ROC moved to Taiwan. In the third stage, during the time
when Lee Teng-hui was president (1988-2000), "the ROC on Taiwan" was
the catch-phrase used to describe the nation. In the fourth stage
after 2000, with the first peaceful transfer of power in the
country's history, the phrase became "the ROC is Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Lu said that during the 2000 presidential election, Taiwan people
chose the native political party of Taiwan, meaning the Democratic
Progressive Party that was founded in 1986, and claimed that although
the nation is officially called the ROC, a majority of people
identify it as Taiwan.</P>
      <P>China might not like it, but this is an undeniable historial fact,
Lu added.</P>
      <P>On the visits to China in April and May, respectively, by
Taiwan's two main opposition leaders, Lu said that although China is
showing goodwill toward the opposition parties, it still refuses to
talk with Chen, which she said is a move to deny Taiwan's leadership
that shows its lack of sincerity in bettering cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>She also expressed appreciation for the Japanese Diet's recent
passage of a bill to waive visa requirements for Taiwan visitors to
Japan.</P>
      <P>On the disputed Tiaoyutai island group, over which Taiwan, Japan
and China claim sovereignty, she urged Japan to focus on joint
development of the islands and not allow the island group to become a
flashpoint between Taiwan and Japan.</P>

Wednesday. He will also ask him to consult with the opposition People
First Party (PFP) on the matter.</P>
      <P>The KMT has said that it may agree to a special session if it
only deals with an eight-year, NT$80 billion (US$2.539 billion)
flood-control bill, while the PFP has said it is against convening a
special session out of fear that the DPP will try to include other
bills on the agenda, such as the NT$480 billion U.S. arms procurement
package.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PENGHU-CHINA LINKS LEGAL, MEET PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS: PREMIER HSIEH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's plan to open direct
links between the outlying Penghu Island and China is a legal move
that also meets public expectations on the island county, Premier
Frank Hsieh said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks after hearing a report on the "mini three
links, " which opened in January 2001, and the special Chinese new
year holiday charter flights between Taiwan and China by Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) officials during a weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the existing direct trade and transport links
between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands and China's Fujian ports of
Xiamen and Mawei -- commonly known as the "mini three links" -- have
become more popular, Hsieh said that opening the links for Penghu or
making the island a fishery produce distribution center are plans in
line with the law that also will satisfy public demand.</P>
      <P>He asked the MAC to continue to explain the policy to the public
and improve relevant measures to create greater convenience and
long-term benefits for the residents on the outlying islands.</P>
      <P>The premier surprisingly announced his plan to open the
Penghu-China "mini three links" on a trial basis from September last
week during a visit to the island, but the initiative created a
strong backlash from the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU).</P>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui, also the spiritual leader of the
TSU, threatened to mobilize supporters to demonstrate on the streets
against the plan. Lee called the idea an awkward move designed by the
government to seek to restore public confidence in it after failing
to persuade Taiwan farmers not to sell their produce to China.</P>
      <P>The government allowed a religious voyage from Penghu to Fujian's
Quanzhou in July 2001, and it has again approved an application filed
recently by a religious group to make a similar trip. The voyages are
screened on a case-by-case basis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHUNGHWA TELECOM FULFILLS GOAL OF PRIVATIZATION: CABINET SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has fulfilled its goal of
privatizing Chunghwa Telecom Co., reducing its stake in the behemoth
company to below 50 percent following the sales of 17 percent of its
holdings at home and abroad in the past two days, Cabinet spokesman
Cho Jung-tai announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Despite strong protests from Chunghwa's workers union over the
past few days, Cho said the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) managed to sell 3 percent of its stake in
Chunghwa Telecom on the domestic market Tuesday and an additional 14
percent stake was sold through American Depositary Receipts (ADR) in
the United States Wednesday (Taipei time).</P>
      <P>Cho said the MOTC had sold off a total of 52.17 percent of its
stake in Chunghwa Telecom to individual and corporate investors at
home and abroad, meeting the government's goal of reducing its stake
in the company to below 50 percent.</P>
      <P>Before the latest sales, the MOTC held 64.94 percent of Chunghwa
Telecom shares and two other government units -- Chunghwa Post and
the Labor Insurance Bureau -- jointly held a 1.59 percent stake.</P>
      <P>"While the MOTC will remain Chunghwa Telecom's largest single
shareholder, the government's stake has fallen to below 50 percent, "
Cho said, adding that Chunghwa Telecom has passed the threshold of
what is considered to be privatization.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ultimate goal of privatization is to sharpen
Chunghwa Telecom's competitiveness, Cho said the nation's largest
single telecommunications service company is expected to continue
improving its quality.</P>
      <P>According to Cho, the government managed to raise NT$16.3 billion
from local sales of Chunghwa Telecom shares and an additional NT$81.8
billion from ADR sales.</P>
      <P>"Purchase bids for Chunghwa ADRs reached US$15 billion, but only
US$2.6 billion worth of ADRs were available for sale. The brisk bids
indicated that foreign investors were confident in Chunghwa Telecom's
development prospects," Cho said.</P>
      <P>The MOTC launched its Chunghwa Telecom privatization plan in 2000
to a bumpy start. In its initial public offering, only less than 3
percent of shares were sold. It managed to sell 11.5 percent to
overseas investors through the issue of ADRs in July 2003. Over the
past five years, the national coffers received more than NT$280
billion from Chunghwa Telecom stock sales.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After stepping out of the political fray
for over a week, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng will return
to Taiwan from the United States Wednesday night and is expected over
the next few days to discuss his future role in the largest
opposition party with his staff, according to one of his aides.</P>
      <P>Wang has been on a private, 10-day visit to San Francisco with
his family.</P>
      <P>The politically savvy Wang, who was overwhelmingly defeated by
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou in the July 16 election for opposition KMT
chairman, might have some fresh ideas about his future direction
after temporarily leaving the complex political situation behind for
some time, said Chiang Min-chin, who was Wang's spokesman during the
chairmanship campaign.</P>
      <P>Wang said before he left that he would under no circumstances
serve as the senior vice chairman of the KMT under Ma. Chiang said he
didn't know if Wang has changed his mind.</P>
      <P>Although Wang has asked people not to bother to greet him upon
his arrival at CKS International Airport upon his return, several KMT
legislators, including Cho Po-yuan, Tsai Chin-lung and Wu Chih-yang
will do just that.</P>
      <P>Mayor Ma will also be on hand, saying that he adjusted his
schedule to show his sincerity in burying the hatchet after the
bitter chairmanship race, in which staff from both camps traded
accusations of mudslinging despite both candidates having promised to
run clean campaigns.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he will again ask Wang to serve as the party's
senior vice chairman, adding that with the year-end city and county
chiefs elections coming, he must work with Wang to overcome the
daunting challenges ahead.</P>
      <P>Wang is a devout Buddhist with a good heart and is a tolerant man,
Ma stressed, adding, "I'm sure that I can gradually assuage any
misgivings that have arisen because of the election."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN INVESTORS LOOKING NORTH TO CHINA'S YANGTZE DELTA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong Kong, Aug.  10 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan investors have been moving north
from Guangdong province in southern China's Pearl River Delta to the
Yangtze River Delta since early this year, according to an article
carried in the Hong Kong Commercial Daily Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The article, by Li Sau Hung, president of the Hong Kong Economic
and Trade Association, said there are signs that the new trend is
gaining momentum, with Kunshan, Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou and Ningbo
being the preferred cities in the Yangtze River Delta for Taiwanese
enterprises.</P>
      <P>The Yangtze River Delta refers to the triangular-shaped territory
encompassing the city of Shanghai, southern Jiangsu province and
northern Zhejiang province. The area lies at the heart of the region
traditionally called Jiangnan, which means literally "south of the
Yangtze River."</P>
      <P>According to the article, Taiwan investors are not happy that
Chinese authorities have allowed too many foreign investors into the
Pearl River Delta. They have also complained that the quality of
services provided by the authorities to Taiwanese enterprises has
gone down, and that they are faced with increasing problems with
tariffs, taxes, environmental protection hurdles, and labor and
intellectual property rights issues.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan businessmen no longer feel safe in the Pearl
River Delta because a number of them have been murdered or robbed in
recent years.</P>
      <P>The article said that many Taiwan businessmen have moved to the
Yangtze River Delta to set up their bases in preparation for the
unavoidable opening of the direct "three links" in post, trade and
transportation between Taiwan and China. They foresee that the Pearl
River Delta, which relies on Hong Kong and Macau as transit points,
will lose its importance to the Yangtze River Delta.</P>
      <P>The author quoted statistics as saying that there are now 450,000
Taiwanese businessmen in Shanghai, and that 60 percent of them are
either "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with the city. Some 30 percent
have bought houses in Shanghai, with another 40 percent planning to
do so in the next year. But the Pearl River Delta is not so
attractive, with much fewer Taiwan businessmen willing to settle
there.</P>
      <P>Another reason that has placed the Pearl River Delta in an
unfavorable light is that Taiwan businessmen see Jiangsu and Zhejiang
provinces as more advanced in the areas of education, medical
services, culture and amusement, the article said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN DELEGATION WILL  SEEK CLOSE RELATIONS WITH NEW WTO CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's World Trade
Organization (WTO) officials will keep good working relationship with
the incoming WTO director-general Pascal Lamy to help him get a
better understanding of Taiwan's situation, an official of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Frenchman Pascal Lamy will assume office Sept. 1, replacing
Thailand's Supachai Panitchpakdi. The new chief executive's position
on issues concerning China's attitude toward Taiwan is being closely
watched by Taiwan's media.</P>
      <P>In June, Taiwan blamed China for plotting to change the titles of
the ROC's WTO officials in the new edition of the WTO members'
directory, printed the same month.</P>
      <P>In the directory, the titles of all Taiwan officials, except for
the permanent representative and his deputy, were deleted.
Such titles as counselor, first secretary and second secretary no
longer appeared before the names of Taiwan's officials. Only their
names and main lines of business were shown.</P>
      <P>After lodging a protest with the WTO Secretariat for unilaterally
changing the contents of the information presented by the ROC's WTO
mission, Taiwan delivered an amended version of the information
containing the formal title of the mission to delegations of all WTO
state-members and the Secretariat. The official title is: The
Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the WTO Secretariat apologized for the change, Chou
Shih-chao, chief of the foreign ministry's bureau of economic and
trade affairs, said the incumbent WTO director-general said he won't
change the contents of the new directory for now because "he has his
own considerations."</P>
      <P>The ROC mission has already delivered another letter of protest,
the official said.</P>
      <P>Chou said that the ROC's WTO mission voted for Lamy to serve as
the new WTO director-general based on the assumption that a person
from the European Union is more likely to be able to resist China's
political interference in Taiwan's affairs. Signs after the election
show Taiwan has chosen the right person, he noted.</P>
      <P>The ROC mission will also try to work closely with Rufus Yerxa of
the United States, who is one of Lamy's four designated deputies and
the only deputy WTO director-general keeping his title in the new
Secretariat, Chou added, explaining that Yerxa has been deeply
involving in the management of Taiwan's WTO operations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER RESPONSIBLE FOR RESTORING TAOYUAN'S WATER SUPPLY BY AUG. 13</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian personally
apologized to Taoyuan residents Wednesday for the government's
failure to ensure normal water supply and he said that Premier Frank
Hsieh is responsible for ending the water shortage by Aug. 13.</P>
      <P>Chen hinted that he may reshuffle the Cabinet after solving the
water shortage caused by Typhoon Matsa last week.</P>
      <P>"The government should raise the importance of the issue to the
level of war, " he said after inspecting Shihmen Dam and other water
processing facilities in Taoyuan with Hsieh, Taoyuan County
Magistrate Chu Li-lun and other officials.</P>
      <P>As Taoyuan residents are still facing water rationing, Chen said
he and the government "truly are very, very sorry for Taoyuan County
fellow countrymen. We deeply apologize that the government has not
done a good job, thus causing great inconvenience to you all."</P>
      <P>He noted that the water in the dam was muddy because of the rain
that the typhoon brought, but upstream problems are the
responsibility of both the central and local governments, "so we
shouldn't shirk our responsibility."</P>
      <P>As water supply is an urgent matter affecting people's daily
life, Chen said the government must launch a "water rescuing
operation" which will have the highest importance, and Premier Hsieh
will act as the "commander-in-chief."</P>
      <P>He said he believes that only with the premier as the official
with the most responsibility can the country come up with a real
solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>He recalled Hsieh's achievement in making Kaohsiung City's tap
water drinkable when Hsieh was mayor, adding that now is the time for
Hsieh to demonstrate his ability again to thoroughly resolve
Taoyuan's water supply issue.</P>
      <P>"A premier is much needed by many administrative units, but if he
cannot thoroughly resolve the water supply issue, people naturally
will wonder what has he been doing," Chen said.</P>
      <P>As Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh has announced,
Taoyuan residents will have normal water supply on Aug. 13 at the
latest, said Chen.</P>
      <P>"We will achieve that first of all, so that we can face the
people. Then we'll see who should be responsible for this fiasco, "
the president said, adding that this will include adjustments of some
key positions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top economic planner said
Wednesday that the government's second wave of financial reforms are
apparently better than expected, with the Taihsin International Bank
winning the bid for the special shares offered by the Chang Hwa Bank
for a merger.</P>
      <P>Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng said that he was satisfied with the
smooth bidding procedure, which proved that those who did not expect
the reform plan could achieve much were wrong, and that many people
in the banking sector now fear that they may miss the boat.</P>
      <P>The second wave of financial reforms, announced by President Chen
Shui-bian last year, aims to cut the number of state-owned banks and
financial holding companies by half by encouraging them to merge. The
plan requires the joint assets of any three banks to exceed 10
percent of the total value of Taiwan's banking sector. It also plans
to let at least one bank to be run by a foreign financial
institution.</P>
      <P>Hu said the reforms are necessary because Taiwan has too many
small banks, which have a high percentage of bad debts and lack the
ability to compete internationally.</P>
      <P>He said the government will keep one bank to be predominantly
state-owned and allow foreign banks to compete in Taiwan to strike a
balance in the financial market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's top economic planner
defended the Council for Economic Planning and Development's (CEPD) 4
percent economic growth target Wednesday, saying that the forecast is
no exaggeration.</P>
      <P>Speaking in an interview with CNA, CEPD Chairman Hu
Sheng-cheng said that although major private economic think tanks
have expressed doubts about the CEPD's 4 percent growth target, he is
confident that the country can reach that goal.</P>
      <P>"Our forecast that Taiwan will be able to register a 4 percent
growth in its gross domestic product (GDP) this year is calculated in
terms of a pragmatic basis," Hu explained.</P>
      <P>While projecting the growth target, Hu said the CEPD has come up
with a comprehensive package of economic revitalization plans.</P>
      <P>So long as these projects proceed smoothly, Hu said the 4 percent
growth target definitely be attained.</P>
      <P>The CEPD-initiated programs include accelerating public
infrastructure construction projects, the launch of 10 new
construction projects and the eight-year, NT$80 billion
flood-prevention project, expanding BOT projects, developing tourism
and service industries, and a further liberalization of financial
services, Hu said.</P>
      <P>With a view to reinvigorating the domestic manufacturing sector,
Hu said some military equipment will be purchased domestically. For
instance, private manufacturers will be allowed to bid for production
of military vehicles. </P>
      <P>The orders in this regard will reach an estimated NT$20 billion
this year and contribute to an estimated 0.2 percent to the nation's

      <P>A statement released by the foundation said that Ching Cheong
attended its seminars as an expert on Chinese affairs.</P>
      <P>As a think tank registered with the Ministry of Education, the
foundation said it often exchanges views with experts on Chinese and

      <P>This is why Ching was invited to take part in its seminars, the

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>2004 Nobel laureate in economics Edward
Prescott on Wednesday suggested that Asian countries should adopt a
policy of more engagements with other countries.</P>
      <P>Prescott made the remarks in a forum organized by the China Trust
Holding Corp.</P>
      <P>In his speech about the inspiration of world economic
perspectives on Taiwan, Prescott said Taiwan and other Asian
countries should seek global protection via a free trade agreement
mechanism, suggesting that Taiwan does not have to live at the mercy
of other countries.</P>
      <P>If the island makes more contact with other countries, it
receives more protection from the outside world, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Noting that China's blocking Taiwan economically by excluding the
island from regional free trade agreements is expected to pose a
great impact on the country, Prescott said Taiwan's current economic
performance can be considered good despite all these negative
factors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Prescott analyzed that the appreciation of China's
renminbi can help placate the anti-China sentiment in the United
States, Europe and even Mexico, hailing Beijing's policy as wise.</P>
      <P>With the buoyant economic development in China, the country
should one day lift the yuan's exchange rate control, while India,
within 10 years, will become an economic superpower, Prescott
stressed.</P>
      <P>Concerning the rising oil prices, Prescott said there must be a
mechanism to deal with it, saying that many alternative projects,
such as solar energy, will be presented as a substitute, and the
people do not have to be so worried.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Wu Rong-i and Council for Economic Planning and

      <P>Officials and business leaders from India
and Taiwan gathered in Taipei Wednesday for the 2005 Taiwan-India
Business Cooperation Forum to discuss how their software and
information technology industries can work together.</P>
      <P>Huang Kuo-chun, deputy chief executive officer of Taiwan's
Institute for Information Industry (III) , said India has strong
software development capabilities, a large talent pool,
low production costs and a vast market.</P>
      <P>The strengths of Taiwan's IT industry lie in its ability to
integrate and a well-developed R&amp;D and supply chain that is backed up
by strong production capabilities, plus Taiwan's advantage in Chinese
language and culture, Huang said.</P>
      <P>He said if the industries in the two countries can jointly
develop new products, which he believes they can do efficiently, they
will create a high value-added production system through a division
of labor.</P>
      <P>President Kiran Karnik of India's National Association of

    <HEADLINE>TWO LOCAL CHINESE NEWSPAPERS MAY POST JOURNALISTS IN TAIWAN: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will allow two Chinese media outlets
to post reporters on the island, but not the two that were banned
from Taiwan for allegedly filing biased stories, Joseph Wu, chairman
of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The government barred two Chinese media outlets -- the state-run
Xinhua News Agency and the People's Daily newspaper -- from posting
journalists in Taiwan in April this year because the two were only
covering rumors and opinions from the "extreme ends of Taiwan's
political spectrum, " instead giving a reasonable balance to their
coverage, the Government Information Office claimed.</P>
      <P>To increase cross-strait journalistic and information exchanges,
Wu said that the government will allow Guangzhou-based Nanfang City
News and the Shanghai- based Xinmin Evening News to follow set
procedures and apply to the Bureau of Immigration to station
journalists in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The two newspapers would be the first local papers from China to
station reporters on the island, if they agree to the offer, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu said that as far as he knows, the two papers ought to be
interested in taking the MAC up on the offer.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has announced its policy, and now it will see whether
China has enough sincerity to let the well-known local media come to
Taiwan, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu said that since the end of the 20th century, the media
landscape in China has undergone dramatic changes. In addition to
mainstream media such as the Xinhua News Agency and the People's
Daily, many local newspapers have strived to earn a market niche. Not
only has their circulations risen, but they have good reporting that
has won acclaim.</P>
      <P>Wu said he hopes that through the reporting of local Chinese
journalists on Taiwan affairs, the people on China can get a better
picture of what is really happening around the island.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first allowed Chinese media to post reporters in Taiwan in
late 2000. Besides Xinhua and the People's Daily, three other Chinese
media outlets -- China Central Television (CCTV) , China News Agency
and China National Radio -- have also posted journalists in Taiwan.
Each of them is allowed to send two reporters to Taiwan, rotating
them out each month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PLAN FOR SETTING UP 'TAIWAN PARKS' IN INDIA, EAST EUROPE IN THE WORKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government plans to join forces with
private investors in setting up "Taiwan parks" in India and East
Europe to facilitate local companies' globalization drive, the
nation's top economic planner said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) , said in an interview with CNA that the
government's participation can help Taiwan investors receive better
protection in the host countries.</P>
      <P>In addition to offering updated market information, Hu said the
government would be willing to assist prospective "Taiwan parks"
investors in gaining access to bank loans or financing.</P>
      <P>Hu said Taiwan and India can complement each other in
information-technology industry development, as India has a booming
computer software industry while Taiwan is strong in hardware
production.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, the CEPD is working on a comprehensive plan to
encourage private investors to join forces with the government in
building "Taiwan parks" in India to facilitate local companies'
investment in that country, which boasts a vast domestic market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hu said the government is also planning to lead local
entrepreneurs to set up one or more "Taiwan parks" in a selected
East European country or countries. The plan is still in the works
and will be unveiled later this year, he added.</P>
      <P>Touching on a sharp decline in the nation's foreign trade surplus
in the first seven months of this year, Hu said the exodus of
manufacturing companies to China has been seen a major contributing
factor to that downward movement.</P>
      <P>While China has cheap labor, Hu said it has been lax in
intellectual property rights protection. He reminded Taiwan companies
with interests in China to keep alert about the possibility of their
core technology being stolen by Chinese competitors.</P>
      <P>Hu also urged local companies to think globally while launching
investment projects. "Concentrating investments in China is risky, "
he cautioned.</P>
      <P>Hu further said the nation's foreign trade surplus is not
expected to drop further as the second half of the year has
traditionally been an export boom season. The dramatic drop in trade
surplus in the first half mainly resulted from soaring oil prices and
the delivery of new aircraft ordered by two carriers -- China
Airlines and EVA Airways.</P>

      <P>The U.S. government would never link
the issue of which cities Taiwan's president can transit through in
the United States to movement on the island's planned arms
procurement from the United States, a State Department official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>State Department deputy spokesman J. Adam Ereli made the remarks

the issue of where President Chen Shui-bian can make transit stops in
the United States to progress on the island's planned arms purchase,
Ereli told the reporter that "you're mixing apples and oranges" by
linking the two issues.</P>
      <P>The spokesman noted that the U.S. government has consistently
addressed such transit applications in terms of the safety, comfort
and convenience of the traveler.</P>
      <P>"There shouldn't be anything political read into" such
arrangements, he said, adding that "it's a technical criteria that we
follow."</P>

    <TEXT>La Repubblica: Italian soccer federation head
criticizes court's suspension order.

Italian soccer federation chairman Franco Carraro criticized a
Genoa civil court order to suspend the 2005-2006 national
championship calendar Wednesday. He said that the suspension order
violates his organization's autonomy, causes economic damage and
jeopardizes the sporting morale. He affirmed the championship will
start on Aug. 28 as scheduled. The court order was issued on the
relegation of Genoa which is not part of Serie A for the season. The
federation found Genoa guilty earlier this month of bribing to win
its final Serie B match for advancing to the Serie A.</TEXT>

      <P>The United States has never thought of
trading off Taiwan in dealing with the issue of North Korea's nuclear

Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hill made the remarks while fielding questions at a press

were the United States, Japan, South Korea, North Korea, China and

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2005 Taipei Aerospace and Defense
Technology Exhibition (TADTE) opened Thursday at the Taipei World
Trade Center, with 21 domestic companies and 59 from abroad
displaying their advanced products at 400 booths through Sunday.</P>
      <P>Among foreign countries, the United States has the largest number
of companies participating in this year's TADTE, such as Bell
Helicopter, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon. Dassault
from France and the domestic Aerospace Industrial Development Corp.
are also taking part.</P>
      <P>Products on display include aircraft components, ground support
equipment, aero-engine navigation systems and facilities, flight
control and monitoring equipment, defense equipment and technology,
aircraft interiors and sport airplanes as well as weapons of the
Republic of China armed forces, including sparrow missiles, mica
missiles and harpoon missiles.</P>
      <P>Secretary-General Chao Yung-ching of the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) , sponsor of the biennial event, said
that the Ministry of National Defense (MND) will release business
opportunities worth over NT$18 billion (US$562.5 million) covering
2,054 items to the private sector through the exhibition.</P>
      <P>Chao called on local governments to help promote leisure aviation
by providing sites and space, as a variety of air sports aircraft,
like remote-control and ultralight airplanes are being exhibited at
the show -- the eighth of its kind and the largest in TADTE history.</P>
      <P>The MND also has built a mock command center in which visitors
can operate simulated training systems involving the three items of a
major arms procurement plan from the United States -- diesel-electric
submarines, P-3C Orion anti-submarine aircraft and patriot PAC-III
anti-missile batteries -- in two scenarios of Chinese attacks against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MND's mock war scenarios display has been widely viewed as an
effort to help the major military procurement bill clear the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The MND took the initiative to cut the price tag of the major
arms procurement plan to NT$480 billion (about US$15 billion) from
the original amount of NT$610.8 billion in a bid to pacify opposition
lawmakers who have strongly criticized the plan as being wildly
overpriced.</P>

      <P>Disputes over exploration in the Chunxiao
oil and gas field in the East China Sea should be tackled by all the
nations who have an interest in the area through negotiations,
Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Michel Lu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>At issue in the exploration of the Chunxiao field is the problem
of differing sovereignty claims and economic interests, with both
China and Japan wishing to develop the area that has potentially
large reserves of oil and natural gas, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks when he was commenting on the new book,
"Oceans and Seas of Taiwan, " published by the Coast Guard
Administration (CGA) Wednesday, in which CGA authorities warned that
Taiwan should not sit idly by any longer while China is actively
preparing to exploit the area for oil and gas given that the field
belongs to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the book, the Chunxiao oil/gas field, which has been
named and actively developed by China, is an area officially claimed
by the Republic of China government for mineral exploration.
Nevertheless, the book said, Taiwan has done nothing in this area.</P>
      <P>By comparison, the book said, the United States, Japan and China
have all been competing for control over the Chunxiao field, located
to the upper right of the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands, which are
claimed by Taiwan, China and Japan.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan continues to remain just a "bystander, " the book said,
the country will lose its rights for huge ocean resources and related
interests sooner or later.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Water supplies should be fully restored to
the southern part of Taoyuan County early Friday morning, six days
after Typhoon Matsa swept Taiwan, a Taiwan Water Corp. official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Residents in the county -- which is served by the Shihmen
Reservoir -- have suffered water shortages in the last two years
whenever there is a strong typhoon, as water treatment facilities are
inadequate for dealing with the increased turbidity that occurs with
heavy rain.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan residents have been on a rotational water supply during
the last few days, with Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
promising that full water supply would be restored in southern
Taoyuan by Saturday, while the water supply to the northern part of
the county may also be restored should the turbidity in the catchment
of the Taoyuan River drop to a normal level. Ho said she will take
full responsibility if she fails to deliver on her promise.</P>
      <P>After urgent efforts by a number of government agencies, the
turbidity at the treatment plant in southern Taoyuan dropped
significantly Thursday.</P>
      <P>However, as the turbidity in the catchment of northern Taoyuan's

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The magnetism of the fast-growing Chinese
market will put Taiwan at greater risk and the country will face
fiercer competition from South Korea and Singapore, Vice Minister of
Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-lung said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen issued the warning while giving a speech on Taiwan's small
businesses and economic development at a seminar sponsored by ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Lee Chun-yi in southern
Tainan county.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Taiwan's economic development has encountered
huge challenges due to the long-term diplomatic isolation that has
deprived the country of many trade and investment opportunities
overseas. In addition, he pointed out, more competitive Singapore and
South Korea, coupled with Taiwan's growing over-reliance on the
Chinese market, have put Taiwan in an even more difficult situation.</P>
      <P>Looking to the future, an appreciating new Taiwan dollar and
skyrocketing oil prices are major uncertainties affecting the
domestic economy, he said, adding that to achieve sustainable growth,
the government attaches equal importance to hi-tech and traditional
businesses and will continue to improve infrastructure to help
companies keep growing both at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has forged a free trade agreement (FTA) with Panama and
is holding FTA talks with Nicaragua and Guatemala, he said that the
government is also seeking FTAs with the United States, Japan,
Singapore and New Zealand. An FTA with the United States, he went on,
would be of particular importance to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that day, DPP Legislator Wang Tu-fa told the CNA in an
interview that Taiwan businesses should diversify their investments
offshore instead of eyeing only the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Wang said he is worried that Taiwan companies are increasingly
clustering in China, a situation that he claimed will lead to
shrinkage in Taiwan's trade surpluses with China and hinder Taiwan's
competitive edge over the long term.</P>
      <P>Taiwan corporations must seek greater globalization and step up
industrial upgrading to ensure sustainable competitiveness, he said,
adding that promoting service businesses and innovative industries
would be a good way to help slow the pace of Taiwan's reduced trade
surplus.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Penghu official called Thursday for the
government to allow the outlying island county of Penghu to be opened
to visitors from China.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Legislative Yuan, Chang Jui-tung, a senior
adviser to the Penghu county government -- located in the
Taiwan Strait southwest of the southern port city
of Kaohsiung -- said that opening Penghu to direct trade and shipping
links with China's port of Xiamen in the "mini three links" spirit is
not what Penghu residents want most.</P>
      <P>Instead, Chang said, they would like to see their island become a
stopover or relay point between Taiwan and China before the
implementation of direct trade, postal and transportation links
between Taiwan proper and China -- better known as the "three direct
links."</P>
      <P>Taiwan opened direct trade and transport links between Taiwan's
Kinmen and Matsu islands and China's Fujian Province ports of Xiamen
and Mawei in January 2001 -- commonly known as the "mini three
links."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said, Penghu residents would like to see the
Executive Yuan make Penghu a tourist attraction for visitors from
China, given that the county is already a tourist attraction for
holidaymakers from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks at a hearing held at the Legislative Yuan,
where pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) lawmakers
invited officials from the Mainland Affairs Council, the Bureau of
Immigration and the Penghu county government for a discussion on
Premier Frank Hsieh's recent announcement that Penghu-Xiamen "mini
three links" will be opened on a trial basis from September.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's surprising announcement, made during a visit to Penghu
last week, created a backlash from the TSU. Former President Lee
Teng-hui, the TSU's so-called "spiritual leader, " threatened last
Sunday to mobilize supporters to demonstrate on the streets against
the plan, calling it an awkward move designed by the government to
seek to restore public confidence after failing to persuade Taiwan
farmers not to sell their produce to China.</P>
      <P>At Thursday's hearing, TSU party whip Ho Min-hao said the TSU
opposes Hsieh's idea, even on a trial basis.</P>
      <P>Ho said that taking a cue from the implementation of the "mini
three links" for Kinmen and Matsu, where local economies were found
to have not been revved up as expected, the "mini three links"
program would not be good for Penghu either. Besides, he argued,
opening Penghu-China "mini three links" would only make Penghu's
public order deteriorate, which would in turn leave Taiwan's national
security compromised.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan allowed a religious voyage from Penghu to
Fujian in July 2001 and it has again approved an application filed
recently by a religious group to make a similar trip. The voyages are
screened on a case-by-case basis.</P>

      <P>As undemocratic politics and a lack of transparency in
policy-making could lead to armed conflict, Chen said he is convinced
that "democracy and peace" are the best cure for "autocracy and brute
force."</P>
      <P>Among the 39 Asian countries, Chen said, 15 have yet to reach
full democratic standards -- government leaders chosen through direct
popular elections, armed forces free of political influence, full
human rights protection, party politics and rule by law. Four of the
world's five remaining communist regimes are in Asia.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chen said he has come up with a new
diplomatic strategic goal for Taiwan -- establishing a new balance of
power across the Taiwan Strait to buttress Taiwan's young democracy
and maintain cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>"This strategic goal contains three key points -- protecting
Taiwan's young democracy from being threatened or destroyed by
China's "non-peaceful means;" cooperating with members of the global
'democratic community' to assist undemocratic countries, including
China, in developing democratic systems; and seeking normalization of
cross-strait economic relations under a framework of peace and
stability," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chen said, forging a balanced cross-strait
relationship is critical to shaping a "new peaceful Pacific order."</P>
      <P>Chen urged all Pacific Rim countries to work hand-in-hand to
achieve this goal featuring freedom, stability, prosperity, peace,
cooperation, symbiosis and cultural renaissance.</P>
      <P>The president also lauded Lu for her assiduous efforts in giving
birth to the DPU, which will be formally inaugurated in Taipei
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The DPU, a quasi-government-to-government international body
committed to promoting democracy, peace and prosperity, is seen as an
attempt by Taiwan to ease its diplomatic isolation.</P>
      <P>Costa Rican President Abel Pacheco and Guatemalan President Oscar
Berger are scheduled to arrive over the weekend to attend the DPU
inauguration.</P>
      <P>The DPU will have 26 member countries, including Taiwan, Canada,
the United States, Mexico, Chile, Russia, Japan, South Korea,
Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Panama, Peru, the
Philippine, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE TO VOTE ON EXTRA SESSION FRIDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan will hold a vote
Friday to determine whether to hold an extra legislative session
during its current summer recess as requested by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , legislative sources said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The showdown vote became necessary after the legislative caucuses
of the ruling and opposition parties failed to reach a consensus on
the "extra session" issue earlier in the day, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng presided over the
cross-party consultation, with the participation of
legislative whips from the DPP, the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP),
the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) and the Non-Partisan Solidarity
Union (NPSU). </P>
      <P>During the meeting, KMT whip Tseng Yung-chuan said the KMT
opposes the DPP proposal to hold an extraordinary session to screen
what the DPP calls six urgent bills, including those related to a
long-stalled arms procurement package and the eight-year NT$80
billion flood-control projects.</P>
      <P>Instead, Tseng said, the KMT looks forward to an early start of
the next legislative session scheduled to open Sept. 1. According to
the KMT's plan, the legislature can invite Premier Frank Hsieh to
deliver an administrative report Sept. 6 and begin to screen
livelihood-related bills in the following week.</P>
      <P>PFP whip Huang Yi-jiao echoed Tseng's view, saying the PFP is
opposed to holding an extra legislative session. The KMT and the
PFP jointly control a slim majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>DPP whip William Lai said the party caucus will mobilize all of
its members to attend Friday's informal legislative session to
vote on the DPP proposal to hold an extra legislative session.</P>
      <P>"The result of the showdown vote remains unclear. We hope the
'pan-blue alliance' can stop its boycott against the DPP
administration. If the opposition parties continue their antagonistic
approach for partisan interests, they will eventually lose popular
support," Lai said.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years, the "pan-blue alliance" has used its
clout in the legislature to boycott the DPP's policy initiatives
nearly at every turn.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
legislators called at the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) Thursday to push for an early start to direct
cross-Taiwan Strait passenger charter flights on Chinese traditional
festivals, preferably prior to the upcoming Moon Festival holiday.</P>
      <P>Legislator John Chiang said the KMT lawmakers met with MOTC
officials to assess the possibility of Taiwan's allowing direct
cross-strait passenger charter flights not only for the Chinese New
Year holiday but also for the three other major festivals --
Tomb-Sweeping Day, Dragon Boat Festival and Moon (Mid-Autumn)
Festival.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers also discussed with the MOTC authorities the
feasibility of simplifying and accelerating direct cargo charter
flights across the strait, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The MOTC officials responded that so long as the government gives
a green light, the ministry will have no problem helping implement
direct passenger and cargo charter flight services on special days.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers visited the MOTC for first-hand information after
the Executive Yuan had procrastinated over authorizing the Taipei
Airline Association to negotiate charter flights with their Chinese
counterparts, even though Premier Frank Hsieh announced Aug. 3 that
the Executive Yuan had decided to lift the ban on Taiwan commercial
aircraft flying over China's airspace and had agreed to simultaneous
negotiations for cross-strait cargo and passenger charter flights.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 11 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Battle lines were drawn in the legislature
Thursday over whether an extra legislative session is needed, with
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its political ally
the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) on one side and the two major
opposition parties, the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party
(PFP) on the other.</P>
      <P>The KMT, which earlier said it might agree with such a session,
albeit reluctantly, decided Thursday to align with the PFP in
opposing the session, and urged all party lawmakers to vote against
it in a showdown Friday.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Cho Poh-yuan said that according to a
survey conducted by the caucus, most KMT lawmakers do not see any
need for a special legislative session.</P>
      <P>The PFP expressed its opposition to the idea as soon as the DPP
asked for an extra session to review what the DPP administration
calls six urgent bills, arguing that there is no urgent need for the
bills as they can be acted on in a regular session.</P>
      <P>At the other end of the political spectrum, the TSU threw its
weight behind the DPP, claiming that all six bills are vital to the
country, not least budget bills of NT$80 billion for flood control
projects and the NT$480 billion arms purchase.</P>
      <P>Because of the absence of consensus among the parties on the
issue, a showdown vote is slated for Friday. The KMT and PFP, which
together control only two votes over half the entire legislature,
said they will do their best to ensure that all their lawmakers show
up to cast their votes against a special legislative session.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government-owned Aerospace Industrial
Development Corp. (AIDC) announced Thursday that it will cooperate
with two local companies to develop the unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAV).</P>
      <P>AIDC Board Chairman Sun Tao-yu made the announcement during the
signing of a letter of intent with the Space-tec Co. Ltd. and Pegasus
Co. at the opening of the Taipei Aerospace and Defense Technology
Exhibition 2005 being held at the Taipei World Trade Center.</P>
      <P>An AIDC official said the company plans to focus on the domestic
UAV market in the initial stage, and then enter into the Asian and
international markets in the future.</P>
      <P>Noting that UAVs are not subject to civil aviation regulations in
many countries, the official said now is a good time for Taiwan
companies to develop the industry.</P>
      <P>Currently in Asia, only Taiwan and South Korea have begun UAV
development and the AIDC hopes to take advantage of the trade
opportunities offered by the domestic and Asia-Pacific markets, the
official added.</P>
      <P>According to the AIDC, international market researchers have
estimated that the market value for UAVs will total NT$531.2 billion
(US$16.6 billion) over the next 10 years, with the market in Taiwan
worth NT$18.6 billion.</P>
      <P>The official said that UAVs produced abroad are still expensive,
while the prices of UAVs to be manufactured by the AIDC and the two
domestic firms will be half or two-thirds the price of imported ones.</P>
      <P>The UAVs to be developed by the AIDC can be used in military
anti-landing operations, as well as in civilian missions such as
rescue operations, anti-crime operations, anti-smuggling operations
in coastal areas, land-development planning, marine or forest data
research and typhoon-monitoring.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Thursday
that Taiwan is not in a position to monitor the appropriations of its
aid donations to its diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>"Our goodwill should not be misinterpreted.... We cannot possibly
go to those countries to monitor the appropriations of our
donations," Lu said while fielding questions at a news conference.</P>
      <P>The news conference was held to introduce the Democratic Pacific
Union (DPU) -- Lu's brainchild -- which will be formally inaugurated
in Taipei Sunday.</P>
      <P>Some foreign reporters asked Lu about her views on allegations
that Taiwan bribed leading politicians in some Latin American
countries in exchange for their diplomatic support.</P>
      <P>Lu responded that the government has conducted various foreign
aid programs under the supervision of the legislature.</P>
      <P>"Once the donations are offered, we cannot monitor the
appropriations of the donations. Those acts are internal affairs
beyond our control. We should not encroach upon our allies'
sovereignty, " Lu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lu said one of the DPU's tasks will be promoting
political reforms to wipe out official corruption and enhance
government transparency.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Vice Foreign Affairs Minister
Michael Ying-mao Kau said all of Taiwan's aid to its diplomatic
allies has been for national development assistance and carried out
in line with general international practices based on the principles
of "official, transparent and orderly planning."</P>
      <P>"It's not our policy to make donations to politicians of our ally
countries.... Our policy is to make transparent the donations with
careful planning," he said.</P>

President Chen Shui-bian's transit stops in the United States on his
way to visit allies in Central American are going smoothly,
Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Huang Chih-fang said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang dismissed as "groundless" a local newspaper report that day

transit stops on U.S. territory unless Taiwan commits itself on a
controversial U.S. arms purchase.</P>

approach on Chen's trip but no deal has been fixed because Chen's
itinerary in Central American has not yet been finalized.</P>
      <P>The president's transit through the United States has nothing to
do with the country's proposed arms purchase from America, Huang
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Chen's administration intends to buy a package of arms with a

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's proposal to talk with Taiwan on the
start of direct passenger flights across the Taiwan Strait is a
political trick, President Chen Shui-bian claimed Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with 2004 Nobel laureate in economics Edward
Prescott, Chen said his administration wants to separate economic
issues from political issues in its dealings with China but "it is
difficult" because, he claimed, China politicizes almost everything.</P>
      <P>Citing the stymied negotiations on direct chartered flights
between Taiwan and China as example, Chen said Taiwan prefers to
start with cargo flights not only because it is urgently needed by
both sides, but also because Taiwan is wary of the impact passenger
flights might have on national security.</P>
      <P>Instead of accommodating Taiwan's security concerns, Chen said,
China insists on talks on passenger flights first, "obviously" on the
grounds that passenger flights will generate more publicity than
cargo flights therefore are more valuable for what he claimed is
China's "charm offensive" on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Another reason behind China's refusal to discuss cargo flights is
that its freight fleet is much smaller than Taiwan's and cannot
compete with Taiwan in this regard, the president claimed.</P>
      <P>As a result, Chen said, the aviation negotiations were stalled
before they even started.</P>

      <P>Officials of the Department of Health (DOH)

      <P>Lin Wen-fei, quarantine session chief from the DOH's Center for

out a health questionnaire as an anti-epidemics effort.</P>

with symptoms such as diarrhea or dizziness, it was unclear exactly
how the so-called "anti-epidemic" measure would be enforceable.</P>

The Pentagon plans to shut, shrink or realign hundreds of

Wall Street Journal: To Cut Pollution, Dutch Pay a Dump in Brazil
to Clean Up

Brazilian workers and the Dutch government have been brought
together in an unusual partnership by the Kyoto Protocol to reduce
global-warming emissions by 2012. In a big dirt pit in Brazil,
workers wearing protective masks piled rocks around cement columns
jutting up from rotting trash, a modern landfill. Governments and
private investors ranging from Japanese and Canadian power companies
to London and Parisian banks have pledged more than US$1 billion
toward the purchase of greenhouse-gas credits in developing countries
such as Brazil, Chile and India. The garbage pile is a gold mine in
the greenhouse-gas emission "credits." Each credit that a buyer in
the industrialized world purchases from a seller in a developing
country reduces the buyer's obligation to clean up its act back home.
In theory, the system will reduce global emissions of greenhouse
gases by sending money from industrialized nations to developing ones
to tackle projects that otherwise wouldn't have gotten off the
ground.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) announced
Friday that foreign workers and spouses from Southeast Asia must have
their health checked prior to arriving in Taiwan and undergo regular
health check-ups during their stays in Taiwan to help prevent the
outbreak of epidemic diseases, particularly dengue fever.</P>
      <P>Lin Wen-fei, quarantine section chief from the DOH's Center for
Disease Control (CDC), urged workers and spouses from Southeast Asia
to make sure that they have health check-ups prior to departure for
Taiwan; within three days of their arrival in Taiwan; and after six
months, 18 months and 30 months in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The check-ups should include examinations for tuberculosis,
HIV/AIDS, syphilis, hepatitis B, parasites and leprosy, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Any of these people who are found to have the above-mentioned
diseases -- except for parasites, for which re-examinations will be
allowed -- and have failed to inform the health authorities may risk
not having their visas extended, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Noting that there have been 40 cases of dengue fever confirmed to
have been brought in from Southeast Asia so far this year, Lin said
that violators either risk having their visas suspended or having
their Taiwan employers liable to fines ranging from NT$60,000 to
NT$300,000.</P>

"feel sick" but fail to fill out a health questionnaire upon their

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE REGRETS LEGISLATURE'S VOTE AGAINST EXTRA SESSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office regrets the
opposition-controlled legislature's decision not to hold an extra
legislative session during its current summer recess to screen
several critical bills, a spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff, made the
remarks after lawmakers earlier in the day voted 108-100 against the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) call for the holding of
an extraordinary legislative session.</P>
      <P>"We feel deep regret over the legislature's snub because all six
of the bills are urgent and have already been stalled for a long
time," Yu said.</P>
      <P>The six bills include an arms procurement package and an
eight-year, NT$80 billion basket of flood-prevention projects.</P>
      <P>Yu said the arms procurement package was referred to the
legislature during his tenure as premier. More than one year has
passed, but the bill has yet to be placed on the legislative agenda
due to the opposition "pan-blue alliance's" stonewalling.</P>
      <P>The long delay has prompted the U.S. administration, Congress and
major American think tanks to express doubts about Taiwan's
determination to defend its own security in the face of China's ever
mounting military threat, Yu said.</P>
      <P>Quoting newly released U.S. and Japanese assessments, Yu said the
military balance across the Taiwan Strait has been tilting in favor
of China. If Taiwan fails to beef up its military arsenal as soon as
possible, Yu said, its national security will be at stake.</P>
      <P>"Arms procurement is a non-political professional issue. Partisan
bickering should not block a rational debate on the topic," Yu said.</P>
      <P>As to the flood-prevention bill, Yu said recent typhoon damage
has accentuated the importance of quick action on flood-control
projects.</P>
      <P>Yu recalled that he came up with a NT$31.6 billion special budget
plan for cleaning-up the Keelung River shortly after assuming the
premiership in 2002. The legislature at the time approved it in an
extraordinary session.</P>
      <P>"The Keelung River clean-up project took two years to complete
and has turned out to be a success," Yu said, adding that "residents
in Nankang, Hsichi, Rueifang and Keelung now feel safer when typhoons
come."</P>
      <P>In the wake of last week's Typhoon Haitang, Yu said, the
eight-year, NT$80 billion flood-prevention project has become all the
more urgent. "We hope the legislature can pass it as soon as
possible," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE YUAN NIXES REQUEST TO CONVENE SPECIAL SESSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan on Friday decided not
to convene a special session to review a bill for an eight-year,
NT$80 billion (US$2.54 billion) flood-control program and five other
prioritized bills that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
has said are crucial to the nation's development.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus the had requested the special session,
saying that the flood-prevention project, as well as the NT$480
billion U.S. arms procurement package, the confirmation of Control
Yuan members, proposed amendments to the Executive Yuan Organic Law,
proposed amendments to the tobacco and liquor tax law, and a draft
bill concerning the establishment of a labor pension fund monitoring
committee are urgent matters that need to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng chaired an inter-party
meeting on the matter Thursday where no consensus was reached, and
lawmakers met again Friday to vote on the request.</P>
      <P>In the first round of voting, 100 legislators voted "yea, " with
107 voting " nay." The DPP then requested a second vote, which
resulted in an extra "nay" vote by a lawmaker who was late to the
meeting.</P>
      <P>Upon learning of the result, the legislative caucuses of the DPP
and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , expressed deep
regret.</P>
      <P>Jiao Yung-ching, DPP caucus whip, said the main opposition - the
Kuomintang (KMT) and its ally, the People First Party (PFP) -- has
stubbornly refused its request and the DPP has waited in vain for
them to come around to their way of thinking.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the PFP once agreed to hold a special session Aug. 15
or Aug. 16, and Jiao said he felt that the party has been given the
runaround.</P>
      <P>The DPP had hoped that KMT Chairman-elect Ma Ying-jeou could
wield some influence; however, it became clear that the KMT is still
mired in its irrational opposition, Jiao said, adding that he is
"pessimistic about the future of the legislature."</P>
      <P>William Lai, a DPP whip, said that the KMT originally agreed to
hold a special session to review the flood-control proposal, but it
later reneged because it didn't want to contradict the stance of the
PFP, and that both have partisan interests in mind.</P>
      <P>On the KMT's request that the next regular legislative session
open earlier than its scheduled late September, Lai said that the KMT
was only trying to cushion the backlash of public criticism.</P>
      <P>Ho Min-hao, a TSU caucus whip, said that the party had hoped that
both the ruling and opposition parties could make concessions and
that only the flood-control project could be reviewed in the special
session, but the KMT and the PFP still blocked the request on the
grounds that the DPP was lumping the arms procurement proposal with
the flood-control project.</P>
      <P>Ho said that the KMT and the PFP are "simply opposing for the
sake of opposing."</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Hwang Yih-jiau, PFP caucus whip, was gratified
that legislators from his party were united in blocking the special
session request.</P>
      <P>Hwang said, however, that if there is consensus between the
ruling and opposition parties, the legislature could choose an
earlier date to open its next session.</P>
      <P>In an earlier floor meeting of the legislature, both ruling and
opposition camps stated their stance on convening a special session.</P>
      <P>Both Jiao and Lai of the DPP said that the six bills are urgent,
and that if the flood-control project bill is not passed, the
nightmare of flooding will reappear. Moreover, China's military
budget is growing at a double-digit pace every year, and Taiwan needs
to step up its defensive capabilities, and the Control Yuan has
received more than 10,000 petitions from the public but they have
been left unattended because the legislature refuses to review
nominated members.</P>
      <P>David Huang, a TSU party whip, said that because of the boycott
by the KMT and the PFP, the arms procurement proposal has been
blocked from being listed on the procedural committee's docket 26
times and that the legislature only passed 46 bills in the previous
session.</P>
      <P>Cho Po-yuan, a KMT whip, and Hwang said that they were opposed to
holding a special session because it would only rashly pass the
flood-control project bill. "The money should be used on things that
are most needed," they said. In addition, the government's budget has
ballooned every year, and it is still requesting a special budget,
even though it has not used the money it has at its disposal wisely.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   12  (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Six opposition Kuomingtang (KMT)
legislators said Friday that they will suggest that the KMT amend its
charter and allow party representatives to directly elect members of
the Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>The legislators, who are strong supporters of KMT Chairman-elect
Ma Ying-jeou, are Wu Yu-sheng, Chen Chieh, Lee Chia-chin, Lee
Fu-hsing, Lin Hung-chih and Lai Shyh-bao.</P>
      <P>They said at a news conference that they will raise a motion in
the 17th KMT General Assembly slated to be held Aug. 19 to amend the
party's charter and request that the party's representatives be
allowed to elect Standing Committee members through a direct vote.</P>
      <P>According to the proposal, 1,600 representatives of the KMT's
grassroots members should first be authorized to elect 210 members of
the party's Central Committee and then elect 31 members of the
Standing Committee from elected members of the Central Committee.</P>
      <P>The current rules stipulate that members of the Standing Committee
can only be elected by members of the Central Committee.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that they cannot wait for the slow pace of the
current party reforms, Lee Chia-chin and Chen Chieh said that as the
KMT has already allowed its members to elect their chairman directly,
the members of the Standing Committee should also be elected
directly. They also claimed that a direct election of the members of
the Standing Committee will help smooth interactions between the
party's decision-making body and KMT grassroots members and expand
their participation in the party's affairs.</P>
      <P>Wang Jin-pyng, the speaker of the Legislative Yuan and outgoing
vice chairman of the KMT, declined to comment on the matter the same
day, although sources close to Wang said that even if the 17th KMT
General Assembly can adopt the legislators' proposal, it would still
only go into effect in the next assembly set to be held by 2009.</P>
      <P>However, an official of the KMT Organization and Development
Department said that he and other staff members of the party will do
their utmost to help put the proposal into effect as soon as possible
if the upcoming assembly agrees to allow the party representatives to
elect members of the Standing Committee directly.</P>
      <P>Ma also proposed Wednesday that the KMT allow party
representatives to directly elect Standing Committee members, but
outgoing KMT Chairman Lien Chan, who will step down Aug. 19, did not
respond to the suggestion.</P>

      <P>He said to facilitate the convening of a special legislative

      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) is
sponsoring summer camps in Taipei for offspring of Taiwan business
people who maintain business operations in China, commonly known as
"taishang, " in an effort to provide these children with an
opportunity to better know Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The camps have drawn 247 "taishang" children and youths, aged
between 9 and 14, who have been in Taiwan in groups since July 9 to
attend the nine-day summer camp which will run until Aug. 14, dubbed
"the Beauty of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The camps are co-sponsored by the Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) and three other government agencies.</P>
      <P>Most of the 247 children are students from two schools for
"taishang" children located in Dongguan, Guangdong province and
Kunshan, Zhejiang province and some are from Beijing, Tianjing,
Suzhou, Ningbo, Nanjing, Chengdu, Shenzhen and Xiamen.</P>
      <P>The summer camps give the children lessons about Mandarin Chinese
and Taiwanese history and culture. The children also visit museums,
historic sites and watch folk performances, as well as go on field
trips to gain a better understanding of Taiwan's culture, history and

    <TEXT>
      <P>New Aviation Safety Council (ASC) Chairman
Wu Ching-hsiung was sworn in Friday, promising that he will put the
promotion of safety aviation as his top priority.</P>
      <P>Wu, graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering of
National Taiwan University and obtained a doctorate in electrical
engineering from Cornell University, is to succeed Kay Yong, who
resigned from his post on April 1.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that Singapore Airlines and Japan Airlines are noted for
their management in aviation safety, and these serve as models for
Taiwan's aerospace and aviation sector.</P>
      <P>He estimated that good management in aviation safety can prevent
at least 90 percent of aviation accidents.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the government set up the ASC seven years ago
following a series of aircraft accidents.</P>
      <P>Now, Wu went on, Taiwan's capability of decoding cockpit voice
recorders and flight data recorders, commonly known as "black boxes"
is recognized by the world community. The ASC even sent coaches to
Indonesia to teach people there the techniques that they have
developed.</P>
      <P>Wu said he hopes that the ASC's accident investigation report can
be flawless in the future, but hopes that there are no accidents to
investigate.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ASC is an independent organization, Wu said it
will keep in close contact with aircraft accident investigation
agencies of other countries, as well as the International
Transportation Safety Association.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Sanvu is unlikely to make landfall
in Taiwan, but people living in eastern and southern parts of the
island should still guard against heavy rain brought by the typhoon,
the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) warned Friday afternoon.</P>
      <P>In its weather report released at 5:30 p.m., the CWB said Typhoon
Sanvu's center was at 19.8 degrees north latitude and 119.2 degrees
east longitude -- about 290 kilometers southwest of Oluanpi, the
southernmost tip of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With a radius of 200 kilometers, Typhoon Sanvu is moving
northwest at 20 kilometers per hour and has already entered the Bashi
Channel (Luzon Strait) and the seas around the Tungsha (Pratas)
Islands. Its center winds have a maximum speed of 83 kilometers per
hour, with gusts reaching 108 kilometers per hour -- comparable to
11th-grade wind.</P>
      <P>The CWB report warned ships operating in or near the Bashi
Channel, the Taiwan Strait and the seas around the Tungsha Islands to
be on high alert.</P>
      <P>The report also warned that heavy rain brought by the typhoon may
cause landslides and mud flows in the mountain areas of Taitung,
Hualien, Kaohsiung and Pintung, and that people living in low-lying
areas should take precautions against flash floods.</P>
      <P>According to the CWB, beginning Friday evening, southern Taiwan
from Tainan downward may be hit by gusts comparable to 10th and 11th
grade winds, and the coastal areas in central Taiwan and Penghu -- an
island off Taiwan -- may also experience 9th and 10th grade gusty

      <P>Water supplies should be fully restored to
the northern part of Taoyuan County Saturday, Wu Yueh-hsi,
secretary-general of the Water Resources Agency, said Friday.</P>
      <P>Residents in the northern Taiwan county, who get their water from
the Shihmen Reservoir, have experienced water shortages over the past
two years. Whenever a powerful typhoon hits the country, water
treatment facilities are unable to tackle the increased turbidity
that comes with torrential rain.</P>
      <P>Residents in the northern part of Taoyuan County have been on a
rotational water supply during the past few days, Wu said, adding
that because the turbidity in the catchment of the Taoyuan River is
still high, full water supply to the region is impossible for the
time being.</P>
      <P>As water supplies were fully restored to the southern part of
Taoyuan County early Friday morning, government agencies decided to

      <P>New e-mail filtering software developed by
two domestic universities was launched Friday, with its creators
claiming it can filter some 97 percent of junk mails, the National
Chung Cheng University (NCCU) announced.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo Yao-huang, the software, dubbed "Nopam, " was
jointly developed by NCCU and National Tsinghua University, and can
handle more than one million e-mails in Intel Pentium 4 computers per
day, with the error margin of less than 0.01 percent.</P>
      <P>This software will be offered to various schools or academic
sectors of the country for free, Kuo said, adding that he is proud of
the achievement.</P>
      <P>NCCU Professor Lee Hsing-lin noted that the research and
development of computer software is quite difficult in Taiwan, as few
entrepreneurs are willing to dedicate themselves to this area, and
therefore it needs long-term efforts.</P>
      <P>Wu Sheng, director of NCCU's Internet center, said some junk

    <HEADLINE>GENDER MAINSTREAMING SHOULD BE PART OF DEVELOPMENT AGENDA: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
gender mainstreaming should be part of the nation's future
development agenda so that women and men benefit equally and so that
inequality will not be pertuated.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at the inaugural meeting of the
Presidential Office Gender Mainstreaming Advisory Group, which was
formed to promote gender equality in all areas and at all levels.</P>
      <P>Noting that gender mainstreaming is a strategy for making the
concerns and experiences of women and men an integral part of the
design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and
programs in all political, economic and social spheres, Chen said the
ultimate goal of mainstreaming a gender perspective is to achieve
gender equality.</P>
      <P>"The goal of mainstreaming gender equality is the transformation
of unequal social and institutional structures into equal and just
structures for both men and women," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, Chen said, the inauguration of the Gender
Mainstreaming Advisory Group will push government agencies at all
levels, as well as private corporations and organizations, to bring
the experience, knowledge and interests of women and men to bear on
legislation, policy formulation and development agendas.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that Taiwan's traditional social structure
discriminates against women, Chen said more institutional, financial
and human resources should be devoted to bringing gender issues into
the mainstream of society. In particular, Chen said, gender
mainstreaming education should be reinforced to combat the direct and
indirect consequences of past discrimination.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, Chen said, Taiwan has made progress in
promoting gender equality, including the legislation of the Sexual
Assault Prevention Law, the Sexual Harassment Prevention Law and the
Law on Gender Equality in the Workplace. The Executive Yuan and the
Ministry of Education have also set up women's rights promotion
committees.</P>
      <P>In 2004, Chen went on, Taiwan enacted a Gender Equality Education
Law to accentuate its determination to move forward from simply
stressing women's rights protection to mainstreaming a gender
perspective.</P>
      <P>Following the establishment of the Gender Mainstreaming Advisory
Group, Chen said, all future educational and vocational training
programs, civil service examinations and recruitment plans and
population policy planning should feature a gender perspective.</P>
      <P>During the advisory group's inaugural meeting, panelists You
Mei-nu and Liu Chung-tung delivered special reports on the importance
of gender mainstreaming in national development and population policy
planning.</P>
      <P>You suggested that the central government set up a special agency
to monitor the implementation of gender mainstreaming in the
operations of five government branches -- the Executive Yuan, the
Legislative Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the Examination Yuan and the
Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>For his part, Liu said a lack of gender perspectives in Taiwan's
past family planning and population policy has contributed to a host
of social problems and imbalances, including the disproportionately
high number of male infants, the greying population, the declining
birth rate, late female marriage, the growing number of foreign
spouses and the rising divorce rate.</P>
      <P>In his view, Liu said, local women have become reluctant to give
birth mainly because of the heavy burden in child rearing, as men
have traditionally done little in this regard.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference after the meeting, Presidential
Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun said the new advisory group will
meet once every three months.</P>
      <P>"Experts and scholars in gender mainstreaming will be invited to
speak at those meetings, " Yu said, adding that the topics will
include correlations between gender mainstreaming and democratic
systems, human rights protection and cultural diversity.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office will also invite experts to speak on
relevant topics at its monthly meeting to help local and central
government officials better understand the gist of gender
mainstreaming.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO ADOPT NEW U.N. BID STRATEGY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will adopt a new strategy in
promoting its bid to join the United Nations by presenting two cases
for U.N. participation, Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen said this year's U.N. General Assembly is scheduled to start
Sept. 13. Under the new strategy, 14 Republic of China allies made
two proposals to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Thursday, urging
the U.N. General Assembly to ascertain the U.N. representation of the
23 million people of Taiwan and requesting the U.N. to play an active
role in safeguarding peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks as he explained the nation's new mindset on
its bid to join the U.N.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, Taiwan has tried every year to ask the U.N. Steering
Committee, through its diplomatic allies, to place Taiwan's U.N. bid
on the General Assembly agenda. This has been unsuccessful every time
because of China's obstruction and because of the international
reality that so few countries recognize the ROC.</P>
      <P>He claimed there are several developments worth attention this
year, including the U.N. celebration of its 60th anniversary, China's
enactment of the "Anti-secession Law, " which codifies China's use of
non-peaceful means against Taiwan, and Annan's suggestion in March
for U.N. reform to enhance freedom through pursuit of development,
security and human rights.</P>
      <P>The ministry has decided to forego its traditional approach and
pitch for a core purpose of the U.N. as a peace-maintaining
organization, hoping to stand on the high moral ground of "peace" to
solicit the international community's concern and efforts in
safeguarding cross-strait peace, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen went on that the U.N. representatives of 11 ROC allies --
Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Solomon Islands, Burkina Faso, Chad,
Gambia, Malawi, Sao Tome and Principe, Belize and Saint Vincent and
the Grenadines -- proposed Taiwan's U.N. bid to Annan, asking the
U.N. General Assembly to recognize Taiwan's representation in the
U.N.</P>
      <P>The U.N. representatives of 13 ROC allies -- the Marshall
Islands, Nauru, Palau, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Burkina Faso, Chad,
Gambia, Malawi, Sao Tome and Principe, Guatemala, Saint Vincent and
the Grenadines and Saint Kitts and Nevis also proposed to Annan at
the same time that U.N. play an active role in cross-strait peace.
Kiribati, which has no mission in the U.N., had its vice minister
propose for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the proposal urging the U.N. to play an active cross-strait
role, the allies asked Annan to send an envoy or a truth
investigation delegation to Taiwan to assess the security situation
in the Taiwan Strait and report to the U.N. General Assembly and
related agencies so that they can adopt necessary measures to
encourage and assist both sides of the Taiwan Strait to engage in
peaceful dialogue and exchanges.</P>
      <P>On whether the proposal will be established, Chen said he did not
know how Annan would react.</P>
      <P>He noted that China will try to block the case from being
discussed by any means possible.</P>
      <P>He said the sending of an envoy or a truth investigation
delegation are only Taiwan's suggestions and that the U.N. might have
its own approach.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also communicate privately with the United States and
Japan, "hoping to listen to their views, and if they are in favor of
the proposal, we hope they can intercede to assist us," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Taiwan's bid is not aimed at challenging any
countries' rights or seats in the U.N. and that the Beijing
authorities should understand that repeated obstruction to Taiwan's
bid to join the international community will not be conducive to the
improvement of cross-strait relations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Wu Rong-i said Friday that
Taiwan's manpower quality has to be upgraded if the country wants
continued economic growth.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks while attending a seminar on industrial
talent nurturing in central Taiwan. Industrial and government
officials, as well as scholars, were invited to the seminar.</P>
      <P>He stressed that talent nurturing has to be geared to the needs
of industry or it will result in a waste of training resources. The
government should also have an assessment mechanism to inform
training institutes of the needs of enterprises, he said.</P>
      <P>He cited as an example that the government attaches importance to
sewage treatment construction and has appropriated budget to that
end, but cannot find suitable workers, which shows that training
agencies have yet to train personnel in line with the policy.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's industry has to step up its transformation and
upgrading if the economy is to continue to develop, adding that
manpower resources are the key point.</P>
      <P>He also reaffirmed that the government's goal of achieving 4
percent economic growth this year remains unchanged and said the
government will try to create business opportunities through the BOT
model, as well as cutting government personnel expenditure.</P>

      <P>A group of drilling technicians from the
Chinese Petroleum Corp. are helping to drill wells for water to
release Taoyuan from the water shortage from which the northern
county has been suffering since Typhoon Matsa swept the country Aug.
5.</P>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Ho Mei-yueh visited the team Friday at
the Tanan water plant in Taoyuan County while inspecting the facility
that provides water to the county's northern area.</P>
      <P>Given that the turbidity in the catchment area of the Taoyuan
river remains too high for the water treatment plant to deal with it,
Ho said they will drill five wells in the water treatment plant for
water to dilute the muddy river water.</P>
      <P>The turbidity of the Taoyuan river was at an extreme high level
of 29,000 degrees and only when the turbidity drops to the level of
3,000 degrees can the water be drawn into the plant for treatment, Ho
explained.</P>
      <P>Saying that the drilling is an urgent move to ease the water
shortage in the short term, the minister added that the most
effective way to save the area from water shortages permanently is to
allow the Panhsin water plant in Taipei County to help supply water
to Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>Water supplies to the southern part of Taoyuan have already been

    <HEADLINE>KMT, PFP MAY JOINTLY INTRODUCE FLOOD CONTROL LEGISLATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.  12 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP) -- the two largest opposition parties in Taiwan -- might
jointly introduce their own version of legislation for flood-control
when the next session of the Legislative Yuan opens, the legislative
caucuses of the two parties said Friday.</P>
      <P>The two caucuses revealed through their whips at a news
conference that the two parties have already drafted a flood control
program and that they do not rule out the possibility for the KMT and
the PFP jointly introducing the legislation.</P>
      <P>The news conference was held after the Legislative Yuan rejected
a request by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to convene
a special session to consider six bills deemed by the DPP as
"crucial" to the nation's development, including a bill that would
set aside NT$80 billion (US$2.54 billion) for an eight-year
flood-control program and another bill that would allow Taiwan to
procure advanced weaponry from the United States.</P>
      <P>Sun Ta-chien, deputy convener of the PFP legislative caucus,
questioned the ruling party's motive of tying the arms procurement
bill to the flood control bill, claiming the DPP's request for a
special Legislative Yuan session to consider the flood control bill
is merely a pretext and that the DPP's real purpose is to push for
the passage of the arms procurement bill.</P>
      <P>Sun urged President Chen Shui-bian to tell the nation whether he
made any secret promises about the planned arms purchase to Randall
G. Schriver, former U.S deputy assistant secretary general of state
in charge of Taiwan affairs, during Schriver's recent visit to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Was Schriver's visit a private one? Or was he in Taiwan to
deliver an ultimatum regarding Taiwan's military procurement from the
United States?" Sun asked.</P>
      <P>Cho Po-yuan, a KMT caucus whip, also claimed that the DPP's real
intention is not to consider the flood control bill. He pointed out
that the legislature's legal affairs office -- controlled by the
opposition -- has already reached the conclusion that the flood
control plan drafted by the DPP is "unworkable."</P>
      <P>Cho said the KMT has prepared its own version of the flood
control legislation. However, he added, the KMT caucus has not
reached a consensus yet on whether the money will come in a special
budget or in the regular fiscal budget.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taitung County Department of Health
official urged the public Friday to stay alert to the danger of
dengue fever while visiting Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>The official made the appeal after four members of a family from
Taitung who had just returned from Indonesia were confirmed to be
infected by dengue fever, a mosquito-transmitted disease.</P>
      <P>An 8-year boy was the first of the family confirmed to have
contracted dengue fever Aug. 10, while the father, the boy's younger
brother and sister also tested positive Friday.</P>
      <P>The mother, of Indonesian origin, said the family visited
Indonesia from July 23-Aug. 6.</P>
      <P>During their stay, the family were bitten by mosquitos, with her
husband, the younger boy and the girl getting fever Aug. 2. They did
not see any doctor.</P>
      <P>Upon arrival in Taiwan Aug 6, the 8-year boy was found suffering
from fever at airport and his blood sample was immediately tested by
quarantine officials, who later confirmed dengue fever.</P>
      <P>The DOH then tested samples from the other family members, which
also proved positive.</P>
      <P>As many Taiwan residents with foreign spouses will visit
Southeast Asian countries during the summer months, the official
reminded local residents to prevent mosquito bites, adding that if
they feel unwell after returning home, they should seek medical care
right away and inform the doctors about where they have traveled.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
Friday it has commissioned the Taipei Airlines Association (TAA) to
contact China over the opening of direct charter passenger and cargo
flights across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman You Ying-lung said the TAA is expected to
represent Taiwan in discussions with an as-yet unnamed Chinese
organization.</P>
      <P>The TAA is a private group composed of representatives of local
air carriers.</P>
      <P>You said the MAC is not in a position to name which Chinese
organization the TAA should contact.</P>
      <P>"I think Beijing's Civil Aviation Administration of China will
designate a private association to negotiate with the TAA for the
proposed opening of non-stop cross-strait charter passenger and cargo
flights," You said.</P>
      <P>Formal cross-strait contacts have been carried out by private
bodies because Beijing refuses to talk directly to Taiwan's
government due to its cherished "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Direct Taiwan-China air links have been banned since the two
sides split amid civil war in 1949, although an exception was made
during this year's Lunar New Year holiday, when 48 two-way, non-stop
cross-strait passenger charter flights were laid on to carry Taiwan
businessmen operating in China home for festival celebrations.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh announced Aug. 3 that the government will
allow local carriers to fly over China's airspace on their way to
other destinations to save travel time and fuel costs amid the
current upward spiral of oil prices. In his announcement, Hsieh also
proposed holding new talks with Beijing on cargo and passenger
charter flights.</P>
      <P>"As Beijing has been quick to respond positively to the premier's
proposal for simultaneous talks on charter cargo and passenger
flights, we have decided to commission the TAA to contact Beijing to
arrange the formal negotiations," You said.</P>
      <P>The lack of direct cross-strait air links requires passengers to
transfer through a third location, usually Hong Kong or Macau.
Despite the inconvenience, business links between the two sides are
booming, with last year's bilateral trade volume exceeding US$60
billion.</P>

Faced with mounting casualties and signs of d iminished support

that, despite planning by senior Pentagon officials for a potential

As in so many industries, China offers Internet companies a

companies. Yahoo Inc. said it agreed to pay US$1 billion in cash and
turn over its Chinese operations to Alibaba in return for a 40
percent stake in the Chinese e-commerce company. EBay, based in San
Jose, Calif., has built a potent global brand by cloning its popular
Web site in 33 countries. Most of the company's users are now outside

      <P>Central and southern parts of Taiwan might
experience continuous rain over the next five days because of
Tropical Storm Sanvu and that people living in these areas should
guard against floods, landslides and mudflows, the Central Weather
Bureau (CWB) warned late Friday.</P>
      <P>In an update on the storm's movement, the CWB said there had
already been heavy rain in the Pingtung area of southern Taiwan and
in areas south of Ilan in northeastern Taiwan, and that from Friday
night through Saturday, there might be heavy rain in areas south of
Taichung, in central Taiwan, and in areas south of Hualien, in
eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The CWB urged people living in mountainous areas of Kaohsiung,
Pingtung, Hualien and Taitung counties to be on high alert against
landslides, mudflows and flash floods.</P>
      <P>At 8 p.m. Friday, Sanvu's center was located 270 km southwest of
Oluanpi, the southernmost tip of Taiwan. With a radius of 200 km, the

    <HEADLINE>CRITICAL PRESS ORGANIZATIONS TO BE INVITED TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Leaders of the New York-based Committee to
Protect Journalists and the Paris-based Reporters without Borders
will be invited to visit Taiwan to learn about the country's efforts
to defend press freedom after they criticized the Taiwan authorities
for revoking the licenses of seven cable TV stations, Government
Information Office Minister Pasuya Yao said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Yao, the two international organizations, both of
which have years of wide-ranging experience of press curtailment all

and the reasons behind them, and claimed that they "do not
understand" that the environment in which local TV stations operate
is "quite different" from that of the United States.</P>
      <P>Instead of trying to bring the TV stations to heel, Yao said, the
government is simply pushing them to live up to their responsibility
to the public.</P>
      <P>He made the statement after the Committee to Protect Journalists
joined Reporters Without Borders in condemning the Taiwan
government's suspension of licenses to the news stations ETTV-S and
six other entertainment-based cable stations and its placing of all

    <HEADLINE>U.N. URGED TO TAKE STEPS TO AVERT CROSS-STRAIT CONFLICT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York, Aug. 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 10 Republic of China diplomatic
allies filed a request with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
Thursday urging him to appoint either an envoy or a task force to
look into the Taiwan Strait situation.</P>
      <P>According to Andrew L.Y. Hsia, director of the Taipei Economic
and Cultural Office in New York, the request reflected the
"international community's expectations" that the United Nations take
steps to safeguard cross-strait peace and avert any conflict in the
region.</P>
      <P>Noting that the United Nations passed Resolution 57/337 in July
2003 on the prevention of armed conflict, Hsia said Annan should
take necessary measures to encourage and assist the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait to engage in peaceful dialogue and exchanges.</P>
      <P>In the U.N. charter, Hsia went on, prevention of war and conflict
is one of the most important obligations of U.N. members. Since the
Taiwan Strait is widely seen as a potential flashpoint, he said, the
United Nations is obliged to assist in resolving cross-strait
disputes and preventing armed conflict.</P>
      <P>"This year marks the U.N.'s 60th founding anniversary. Annan has
come up with many U.N. reform programs. We think that our diplomatic
allies' request bears special meaning," Hsia said.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, Taiwan's diplomatic allies presented another
request asking the U.N. to address the representation of the 23
million Taiwan people in the world body. This is the 13th consecutive
year that the ROC has, through its allies, asked the United Nations
to consider its membership bid.</P>
      <P>The ROC, a U.N. founding member, lost the "China" U.N. seat to
Beijing's communist government in 1971, and since 1993 has launched
annual bids to get back into the organization. The past 12 bids were
quashed by China and the prospects for this year's campaign remain
"unclear."</P>
      <P>China's former Kuomintang (KMT) government lost a civil war to
the communists in 1949 and fled to Taiwan, where it claimed to be the
legitimate Chinese government. But it disavowed the claim in 1991 and
Taiwan's leaders have drifted toward a separate Taiwanese identity.</P>
      <P>However, China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and passed
legislation in March this year codifying the use of force if Taiwan
moves toward formal independence.</P>
      <P>This year's U.N. General Assembly is scheduled to start Sept. 13.
The ROC allies that filed the two requests were the Marshall Islands,
Nauru, Palau, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Burkina Faso, Chad,
Gambia, Malawi, Sao Tome and Principe, Guatemala, Saint Vincent and
the Grenadines, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Kiribati.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PEOPLE WANT TO BE THEIR OWN MASTERS: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Saturday
expounded on the issues of the nation's identity, cross-strait policy
and the nation's future, stressing that the aspiration of the
Taiwanese people to be their own masters is unstoppable.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he addressed via
teleconference the 32nd annual conference of the World Federation of
Taiwanese Associations which was held in Brisbane, Australia.</P>
      <P>The president noted that despite twists and turns during Taiwan's
process in pursuit of democratization, the island has been blessed so
that democracy has been achieved without bloody revolution. For this,
Taiwan cannot possibly be severed from its past, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that he referred to the official name of the country
as "the Republic of China (Taiwan) " during his overseas visits and
that the nation's name on the Web site of the Presidential Office has
also been changed to "the Republic of China (Taiwan)."</P>
      <P>He said he knows that some people might not be satisfied, but
they should know that the transfer of power between two political
parties is not revolution and that Taiwan cannot be severed from its
history, adding that as a national leader, he has a responsibility to
history and the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>He noted that he recently expounded "the four stages of the
Republic of China, " with an aim of giving the public a clear and
definitive idea about his ideas regarding Taiwan's sovereignty and
national identity.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the ROC was established in China in 1912. Between
1912 and 1949, the ROC was on the mainland of China. After 1949, the
ROC "moved" to Taiwan. In the third stage, during the time when Lee
Teng-hui was president (1988-2000) , "the ROC on Taiwan" was the
catch-phrase used to describe the nation.</P>
      <P>In the fourth stage after 2000, with the first peaceful transfer
of power in the ROC's history, the new phrase should be "the ROC is
Taiwan," according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The president said that "the People's Republic of China is China,
and that the ROC is Taiwan, not China, " urging the public to make a
clear distinction between the two.</P>
      <P>On the future of the nation, the president reaffirmed that the
ROC is a sovereign independent country, the nation's sovereignty lies
with the 23 million people on Taiwan and any changes concerning
Taiwan's future will be decided by the 23 million people on Taiwan
alone.</P>
      <P>He continued that the biggest challenge for Taiwan is not which
name it should call itself, but China on the other side of the Taiwan
Strait, which he said has used every possible means to try to totally
deny the rights and fact of Taiwan as a sovereign independent
country.</P>
      <P>He noted that the U.S. Defense Department in a report on China's
military power last month said clearly that with China's continued
military buildup, the cross-strait military balance is now tilting
toward China.</P>
      <P>The report said that China has used diplomatic, economic, legal,
physiological and military means to try to influence the domestic
political situation in Taiwan. China has stressed cross-strait
historical, ethnic and cultural links in an attempt to spread the
idea of unification within Taiwan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The report also said that China, using diplomatic means and
verbal intimidation, tried without success to prevent President Chen
from winning a second term in 2004, and that it issued a warning on
May 17 -- three days before Chen's inauguration for a second term --
on the consequences Taiwan will face if it pursues separatism.</P>
      <P>Faced with a series of "hostile and splitist moves from China, "
the president reiterated his cross-strait guidelines of "one
principle, three insistences and five oppositions."</P>
      <P>"The 'one principle' is to engage in dialogue, consultation and
negotiation with China under the principle of democracy, equality and
peace," Chen said.</P>
      <P>For the sake of political stability and a breakthrough in
cross-strait relations, the ruling and the opposition parties must
reconcile, and the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should also
reconcile, although the reconciliation must be based on the "three
insistences," he continued.</P>
      <P>"Our insistence on the ideals of democratic reform will not
change, our insistence on the mainstream path of national identity
will not change, and our insistence on the mission of transforming
Taiwan into a normal, complete, great and progressive country will
not change," he said.</P>
      <P>The "five oppositions" refer to the government opposing Beijing's
"one China" policy, Chen said, adding that it is China's goal to make
Taiwan a part of China. The government also opposes the "one country,
two systems" framework that would make Taiwan follow in Hong Kong or
Macau's footsteps, he continued.</P>
      <P>"We also oppose the '1992 consensus' placed within the context of
'one China' or 'one country, two systems, ' and reject any proposal
that is premised on 'unification,' or makes it the only option," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>"And we firmly oppose Beijing's so-called anti-secession law,
which codifies the use of 'non-peaceful means' against Taiwan should
the island move toward formal independence," the president added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.N. URGED TO HEED ROC'S RIGHTS AND INTERESTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  Aug.  12 (CNA)
(By C.Y. Tseng and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Gambia's envoy to the United Nations
urged the organization Friday to pay proper heed to the rights and
interests of the Republic of China as well as the representation in
the international community of the 23 million people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Gambia's representative Crispin Grey-Johnson made the appeal
while attending a press conference held by the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in New York to explain the new proposals made by the
ROC's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in its 13th bid to join the world
body.</P>
      <P>The press conference drew a lot of attention from local and
international press, including CNN and the Deutsche Press-Agentur
GmbH (DPA) . Jim Wurst, new chairman of the U.N. Correspondents
Association, also attended the gathering.</P>
      <P>According to ROC Minister of Foreign Affairs Chen Tan Sun, who
launched the bid earlier in the day, Taiwan has decided to raise two
proposals in its U.N. bid this year -- calling for the U.N. to
address the representation of the 23 million people of Taiwan in the
organization and asking the organization to play an active role in
maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that his country and other diplomatic allies of
Taiwan have raised motions in the U.N. over the past years to request
that the organization look after Taiwan's rights and interests
without bias, the envoy said that they represent a voice of justice.</P>
      <P>More than ten ROC diplomatic allies, including Gambia, filed a
request with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Thursday to appoint a
special envoy or delegation to look into the Taiwan Strait tensions.</P>
      <P>Regardless of whether Beijing defines the "cross-strait peace
issue" as an "internal affair" or an "international affair, " the
threat it has posed to Taiwan is a fact, Grey-Johnson said, stressing
that the U.N. should not turn a blind eye to such threats.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Andrew L.Y. Hsia, director of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in New York, said that although 94 U.N. members
opposed the island's bid to become a U.N. member last year, most of
them were in support of peaceful dialogue between the two sides of
the strait.</P>
      <P>This is why the ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs suggested in its
U.N. bid this year that under the premise of maintaining peace, the
U.N. can focus on concerns from the international community over
maintaining security in the Taiwan Strait, the director said.</P>
      <P>He added that the organization should play a more active role in
the issue of cross-strait peace following Beijing's passage earlier
this year of an anti-secession law that has encountered opposition
from various countries around the world.</P>
      <P>Touching on the U.N.'s recent "absurd move" of replacing "the
Republic of China" with "the People's Republic of China" on a
document on the organization's founding on display at the U.N.
headquarters, Hsieh said that those who know history know that the
PRC did not even exist when the organization was founded.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the United Nations and the international
community have no right to deny history, he said his office will
lodge a strong protest against such conduct.</P>
      <P>This year's U.N. General Assembly is slated to begin Sept. 13.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  13  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A concert organizer was reportedly
disciplined Saturday by the administration of the National Theater
and Concert Hall in Taipei for inviting President Chen Shui-bian to
sing at concert July 30.</P>
      <P>In response to the report, Chen Wen-chung, director-general of
the Presidential Office's department of public affairs, expressed
regret at the outcome, saying that the office was not aware in
advance of the regulations stipulating that all performing activities
at the National Theater and Concert Hall be censored before being
taken to the stage.</P>
      <P>At the music concert held to commemorate the 100th birth
anniversary of late Taiwanese composer Teng Yu-hsien, President Chen
sang with concert performers a song composed by Teng, "Yearning of
Spring, " under the organizer's warm invitation, as the performers
got an encore.</P>
      <P>The president's aid said he feels regret that the organizer
failed to reach agreement with the concert hall administration
regarding the invitation before the music event took place.
Nevertheless, no one should be spared in respect to the regulations,
not even the president himself, he noted.</P>
      <P>The organizer, a private artistic organization, was reported to
be banned from holding activities at the National Theater and Concert
Hall in the Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Center for three months.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States and Japan are sure to
come to Taiwan's defense if the island is attacked by China, because
Taiwan's security is their common objective, a security official said
Saturday in Chiayi, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Parris Hsu-cheng Chang, deputy secretary-general of the National
Security Council, told a group of civil leaders who attended a
training program organized by the Ketagalan Institute that war with
China is the last thing that Taiwan wants to see. However, he added
that Taiwan would be able to put up significant resistance and
inflict substantial damage on China in such a conflict.</P>
      <P>Citing a joint statement issued by the United States and Japan on
Feb. 19 which said the peaceful resolution of issues concerning the
Taiwan Strait is one of their common strategic objectives, Chang
claimed this is a promise to defend Taiwan from an attack by China.</P>
      <P>The strong international disapproval of the use of force to
settle disputes between states is also a deterrent against Beijing
pursuing any such military adventures, Chang said.</P>
      <P>He said that China has therefore tried to isolate Taiwan in the
international community while at the same time engaging in a charm
offensive to win the hearts of the Taiwan people through such moves
as offering duty-free access for the island's fruit exports.</P>
      <P>However, Chang warned, such preferential treatment could have a
price for Taiwan as China might ask for similar treatment under the
framework of the World Trade Organization of which both Taiwan and
China are members.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang also raised doubts about China's capability to
use force against Taiwan in light of the fact that China is plagued
by domestic problems such as poverty, uneven distribution of wealth,
and social unrest prompted by a lack of freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>The security official said Taiwan can turn the tables on Beijing
by encouraging the Chinese people to push their government to move on
the path toward democracy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CENTRAL STANDING COMMITTEE ELECTION CHANGES PROPOSED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Many representatives of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) have proposed that members of the party's Central
Standing Committee be directly elected by party representatives,
according to a high-ranking official of the KMT.</P>
      <P>Cho Po-yuan, a KMT legislative caucus whip, said that the KMT has
seen its complete democratization, especially after its party
chairmanship election last month, and that the different voices
represent a normal situation in a democratic party.</P>
      <P>In July's KMT chairmanship election, Taipei City Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou soundly defeated Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng by
garnering 72.4 percent of the vote.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wu Yu-sheng, who is one of Ma's confidants, is also
among those who support a change in the Central Standing Committee
election process. Wu will present a proposal at the party's upcoming
17th congress scheduled for Aug. 19.</P>
      <P>Wu and several other KMT legislators have proposed an amendment
to the KMT charter, calling for two-stage elections, with the 1,600
party representatives choosing the 210 members of Central Committee
in the first stage, and then electing the 31 members of the Central
Standing Committee from the 210 elected Central Committee members in
the second stage.</P>
      <P>Currently, the KMT's Central Standing Committee members are
chosen by the members of Central Committee among themselves.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT charter, an amendment requires the
endorsement of one-tenth of the party representatives and must obtain
the support of two-thirds of the party representatives present at the
congress to be passed.</P>
      <P>It was reported that Ma's camp has encouraged many local
government chiefs to vie for Central Standing Committee and Central
Committee membership to diversify the make-up of the policy-making
body which is now packed with lawmakers.</P>
      <P>In response to the reports, Wu said that Ma is glad to see
different voices in the policy-making organization and an increase in
the pluralistic representation in the committee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT URGES U.N. TO HEED REPRESENTATION OF PEOPLE OF TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Saturday urged
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and all the U.N. member
states to pay attention to the issue of the representation of the 23
million people of Taiwan as well as peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during talks with visiting Costa
Rican President Abel Pacheco de la Espriella at the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>President Chen expressed his appreciation for the Costa Rican
government and people's long-term support of Taiwan, saying that
President Pacheco has given his full support to Taiwan's bid to join
the World Health Organization, the United Nations and other
international organizations and that he has spoken up for Taiwan's
cause several times in the U.N.</P>
      <P>Chen also thanked Pacheco for coming to Taiwan to attend and
deliver a speech at the inauguration of the Democratic Pacific Union
(DPU) set for Sunday. The DPU, a brainchild of Vice President Annette
Lu, aims to serve as a platform for personnel and resource exchanges
around the Pacific Rim and to promote democracy, ensure peace and
spread prosperity.</P>
      <P>The inauguration of the DPU is especially significant because
this is the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He also reaffirmed the will of the 23 million people of Taiwan to
join the United Nations, saying that U.N. Resolution 2758, which gave
the Republic of China's U.N. seat to the People's Republic of China,
solved the question of the representation of the people of the PRC
but not the representation of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the principle of universality, which is enshrined in the
Charter of the United Nations, Taiwan people should not be stripped
of their right to be apart of the U.N., Chen said, adding that no
other country can represent the people of Taiwan and that only the
Taiwan people can represent themselves.</P>
      <P>He also said that cross-strait peace is a major basis of
cross-strait stability and world peace, and that the United Nations,
as an organization that champions peace, should not ignore the 700
missiles deployed along China's coastal areas against Taiwan and
Beijing's enactment in March of an anti-secession law that codifies
the use of "non-peaceful means" against the island should it move
toward formal independence.</P>
      <P>As the U.N. General Assembly is scheduled to begin next month, he
urged all U.N. members to heed the issue of cross-strait peace and
that President Pacheco will continue to support Taiwan's bid to
the U.N.</P>
      <P>Pacheco earlier was accorded full military honors at a ceremony
held in front of the National Theater Hall at the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall. He received a 21-gun salute, and the two heads of
state then inspected the honorary guards from the ROC's armed forces.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RANKS 2ND IN E. ASIA IN HIGH-TECH PRODUCTS VALUE-ADDED RATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's high technology products rank
second in East Asia in terms of value-added rate, trailing only those
of Japan, according to the latest report by the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>The four East Asian countries -- Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and
China -- have been sparing no efforts to develop their information
and communications industries since the late 1990s when a revolution
in information and communications centered on the computer occurred,
according to the CEPD report.</P>
      <P>Since August 2000, Taiwan has been making efforts in various
areas, such as infrastructure, manpower supply and governmental
administration, to build an environment for a "knowledge-based
economy" on the island as part of the country's preparations for
future economic development in the era of the "new economy" in which
the information and communications sectors will serve as one of the
key pillars.</P>
      <P>The report said that in the information and communications
technological race among Taiwan and its neighbors, the winner will be
the one that produces the most high value-added high-technology
goods.</P>
      <P>It cited the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry's
latest report on the international economy and trade as saying that
the four East Asian countries have witnessed obvious changes in terms
of their respective single-item price indexes (single-item price of
exports divided by that of imports) for high-tech products in the
1995-2003 period.</P>
      <P>According to the Japanese ministry's report, the value-added rate
of Japan's high-tech products was the highest among the four East
Asian countries. The ratio of its high-tech products with a
single-item price index greater than 1 grew to 65.6 percent in 2003
from 58.6 percent in 1995.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the figure increased from 20.4 percent in 1995 to 27.2
percent in 2003, while the figure for South Korea dropped from 25.7
percent to 24.7 percent and that for China declined from 37.9 percent
to 24.2 percent.</P>
      <P>These numbers show that Taiwan's efforts to raise its industrial
technological level have borne fruit, CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>However, they noted that the growth of Taiwan's information and
communications output has been slowing in recent years as the island
faces strong competition from countries like China and India, whose
production costs are relatively low and whose technological growth
rates are high.</P>
      <P>The CEPD officials suggested that the government encourage local
manufacturers to step up their efforts in research and development
capabilities and to create independent brand names to increase the
competitiveness of their exports.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) official said Saturday that the government has made no
mistake in its handling of Taiwan fruit exports to China but the
media is spoiling the government's plan.</P>
      <P>TAITRA Chairman Hsu Chih-jen made the remarks at a forum on
exports of agricultural products to China organized by the Ketagalan
Institute, an institute founded by President Chen Shui-bian to
cultivate future leaders of the country.</P>
      <P>In response to the media's criticism that the government has been
blocking Taiwan fruit exports to China, Hsu said he has seen no
farmers being impeded from exporting fruits to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Domestic farmers are eager to introduce their fruits to the
mainland to cash in on the trade opportunities offered by the Chinese
government, which announced in May that it would grant tariff-free
treatment to 15 categories of Taiwan fruits.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Taiwan government has not impeded fruit
exports to China, Hsu said the government has only cautioned farmers
that the sale of their fruits in the mainland may bear risks, such as
false advertising of agricultural products from uncertain sources as
being grown in Taiwan as well as demands by Beijing for agricultural
technology cooperation with Taiwan or reciprocal preferential
treatment for mainland agricultural exports to the island.</P>
      <P>Taiwan authorities have yet to engage in formal talks with
Beijing regarding Taiwan fruit exports to China, arguing that the
Chinese government has given no clear indication on whether it will
talk with TAITRA, the sole organization designated by the DPP
government to negotiate with Beijing on the issue.</P>

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's)
caucus in the Legislative Yuan on Saturday expressed the hope for an
early opening of the next legislative session.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yuan-chuan, KMT legislator and executive director of the
party's Policy Committee, made the remarks as Legislative Yuan
President Wang Jin-pyng is scheduled to convene an inter-party
consultation meeting next week to decide on the opening day of the
next session after a request by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) to convene a special session during the summer recess was
voted down by the legislature Friday.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that even before the vote, the KMT caucus had
advocated that legislators report for the next session on Sept. 1 or
Sept. 2 and that the legislature invite Premier Frank Hsieh to give an
administrative report and answer questions Sept. 6. He added that
after that, lawmakers can choose one day every two weeks to review
bills.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that a draft bill on the organic law of the National
Communications Commission (NCC) is a prioritized bill and that
legislators should vote on the bill after the Sept. 25 deadline for
inter-party consultations.</P>
      <P>He said that the NT$48 billion (US$1.52 billion) special budget
for the arms procurement plan as well as the confirmation of Control
Yuan members, which the DPP deems as prioritized bills, can wait
until late September for review.</P>
      <P>The legislators usually report to the legislature in early
September and then usually open the regular session in mid to late
September, barring major issues that require immediate attention.</P>
      <P>William Lai, a DPP caucus whip in the legislature, said that the
DPP supports an early opening of the next session and full-house
meetings to review bills. However, he added that the door to
inter-party consultations and procedure committee should be open,
otherwise, the KMT's proposed early opening will only serve to
cushion the public criticism of its opposition to a special session.</P>
      <P>Lai said that the opening day of the next session can be left for
the KMT and its ally People First Party to decide.</P>
      <P>However, a caucus whip of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, an ally of
the DPP, said the opening day should be Sept. 13.</P>
      <P>Ho Min-hao said that the legislature usually opens in late
September, and the KMT's proposal of opening on Sept. 6 is an attempt
to cover the "scandal" it created in vetoing the request for a
special session, adding: "Why should we have to toe the KMT's line
every time?"</P>
      <P>Ho also said that after the opening of the next session, four
priority bills should be reviewed -- namely the flood-control
project, major arms procurement package, confirmation of Control Yuan
members, and the proposed amendments to the Executive Yuan Organic
Law -- expressing the hope that the KMT and the PFP will not boycott
them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA TO STEP UP EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN ON FRUIT EXPORTS TO CHINA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Chairman Lee
Chin-lung said Saturday that in addition to consultations with China
on Taiwan fruit exports, the council will also diversify export
markets, and step up an educational campaign aimed at farmers and
the media.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks while attending a seminar on Taiwan's
agricultural exports to China sponsored by the Ketagalan Academy, a
school founded by President Chen Shui-bian to nurture future leaders
of the nation. Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Huang Wei-feng,
Taiwan External Trade Development Council Chairman Hsu Chih-jen and
Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-dji also attended the seminar.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that a few media reports have said the government's
"impeding of" fruit exports to China demonstrates that it is not
taking care of farmers, but he stressed that the allegation is
"unfounded."</P>
      <P>He noted that some media have also said that Taiwan's increased
fruit exports to China have led to price hikes of domestic fruits,
but he pointed out that the truth is that the number of fruit exports
to China is limited and that the main cause of increased prices at
home is decreased production.</P>
      <P>He said that although China announced zero-tariff treatment for
15 categories of Taiwan fruits Aug. 1, nine of those categories
already see major imports from Southeast Asian countries, and several
other categories, such as peaches and persimmon, are not produced in
large quantities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee said that Taiwan exported 32 tons of fruits between Aug. 1
and Aug. 10 to China, and it is estimated that monthly exports to
China will be around 96 tons, or only around 10 tons more than before
the duty-free measures were implemented.</P>
      <P>The benefits of zero-tariff policy are limited, Lee said, saying
that the main beneficiaries will be Chinese consumers and that Taiwan
farmers will not see any significant increase in revenues.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the measures may have negative consequences,
including overreliance on the Chinese market and demands by Beijing
for reciprocal treatment for its agricultural products. If cheap
agricultural produce from China is exported to Taiwan, this will have
a very detrimental impact on the production and distribution
of Taiwan's agricultural produce, he added.</P>

      <P>Government Information Office (GIO)
Minister Pasuya Yao said Saturday that the media is not controlled by
the government, claiming that fierce competition for ratings, the
personal preferences of media business owners and several other
factors influence the independence of the media.</P>
      <P>Yao made the remarks in a speech delivered on the second day of
the 2005 National Youth Conference meeting at the Chinese Culture
University organized by the National Youth Commission.</P>
      <P>In his speech on the media and culture, Yao presented many ideas
on how to improve the quality of the media.</P>
      <P>Yao revealed that when the GIO has come under strong criticism
from the public for refusing to renew the operating licenses of seven
cable TV stations, he tried to solicit the support of several women's
groups and lawmakers who had criticized the "chaos" in the media and
had called for decrease in numbers of media outlets. However, they
chose not to stand up for a variety of reasons, Yao added.</P>
      <P>Citing several examples of journalists' stories being "edited"
beyond recognition by their supervisors according to the supervisors'
political bias, Yao urged the "first-line reporters" to unite in
insisting on high standards of journalistic professionalism.</P>
      <P>Yao's remarks were echoed by Lu Tung-hsi, chairman of the
Association of Taiwan Journalists, who said that journalists will
only be respected by the public when they establish professionalism
in news coverage.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIGITAL CENTERS HELP GET QUAKE-AFFECTED AREAS WIRED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eight "digital opportunity centers"
established in four counties that were hardest hit by the Sept. 21,
1999 earthquake are contributing to narrowing the digital gap between
recovering rural townships and urban areas, Vice Education Minister
Fan Sun-lu said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Fan, who visited two of the eight digital centers recently on a
fact-finding tour, said that some residents have turned from
"computer illiterates" into electronic literates who can even design
their own Web pages.</P>
      <P>After the devastating earthquake, which killed nearly 2,400
people and damaged numerous cities and townships in central Taiwan,
the Ministry of Education, with financing from the Executive Yuan,
established the digital centers in the rural townships in Miaoli,
Taichung, Chiayi and Nantou counties.</P>
      <P>Fan and Chen Chu, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Council of
Labor Affairs (CLA), visited the Chingyun community in Hsinyi rural
township in Nantou County, and the Meilin community in Kuohsing rural
township, also in Nantou County, to check out how the locals have
been using the digital centers to learn how to use computers and
related applications.</P>
      <P>The centers began with training volunteers and "seed" computer
teachers, who then taught the local residents -- mostly Bunun
aboriginal people in the Chingyun community and Han farmers in the
Meilin community -- about computer and Internet skills, Fan said.</P>
      <P>The residents learn basic computer skills, e-commerce and Web
applications, free of charge.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, with the help of computers, farmers in the
Meilin community are marketing the area's specialty -- lemon grass
oil and related products -- to other cities and even abroad.</P>
      <P>Noting that the digital divide is one of the factors affecting a
nation's international competitiveness, Chen said the CLA provides
information technology training to some 10,000 blue-color workers
each year in an attempt to narrow the digital gap and raise Taiwan's
overall competitiveness.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO IMMEDIATE PLANS TO RAISE GASOLINE PRICES: CPC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14(CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC) said Sunday it does not have any immediate plans to raise
gasoline prices, despite the recent dramatic international crude oil
hikes.</P>
      <P>CPC President Chen Pao-lang made the remarks in response to media
speculation that the state-run oil company might raise its oil
product prices again as international crude oil prices have surged to
new highs since CPC raised its gasoline and diesel prices by NT$1.5
per liter Aug. 2.</P>
      <P>"The reports were untrue. Even though the recent fast surge in
crude oil prices has exacted great pressure on our production costs,
we won't adjust our product prices again for the time being, " Chen
said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, CPC imports an average of 16 million barrels
of crude oil per month. Therefore, whenever international crude oil
prices rise by US$1 a barrel, CPC's monthly procurement cost soars by
US$16 million, or NT$500 million.</P>
      <P>When CPC raised its gasoline and diesel prices Aug.2, the average
international crude oil price was about US$60 a barrel. As of Friday,
crude oil prices had skyrocketed to US$67. CPC's procurement costs
have thus increased by more than NT$3 billion.</P>
      <P>Chen said CPC incurred a loss of NT$3.7 billion from its oil
product trade in July. The Aug. 2 adjustment was upset when
international crude prices reached US$63 per barrel, Chen said,
adding that the dramatic price increases in the last few days was
like "rubbing salt into a wound" and will make CPC's oil product
trade deficit deteriorate further.</P>
      <P>As CPC is a state-owned enterprise, Chen said, its top priority
should be taking good care of people's livelihoods rather than making
money. For the sake of maintaining domestic consumer price stability,
Chen said, CPC is not expected to come up with any proposal to raise
gasoline prices at the moment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEMOCRACY TO USHER PACIFIC RIM COUNTRIES INTO BETTER FUTURE</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Guatemalan President Oscar Berger Perdomo
stressed the significance of democracy Sunday, claiming that
democratization will help create jobs and equally distribute wealth,
eventually ushering the Pacific Rim countries into a better future.</P>
      <P>Addressing the inauguration of the Democratic Pacific Union (DPU)
-- a non-governmental organization designed to serve as a platform
for exchanges among the Pacific Rim countries in the promotion of
democracy, peace and prosperity and other common values -- Berger
offered his admiration for Taiwan for its achievements and stressed
the importance of democratization for all countries.</P>
      <P>Berger said democratization should be a paradigm for all
governments to emulate and that all countries should strive to build
democratic political systems to allow the people to take part in
policy making.</P>
      <P>Only when the people can participate in the formation and
execution of national policies can political rulers perceive what the
people want and don't want, Berger said.</P>
      <P>Based on this concept, Berger said, the Guatemalan government
chose to be a member of the DPU Preparatory Conference that helped
pave the way for the establishment of the DPU.</P>
      <P>All the DPU members are democracy and peace-loving countries who
believe cooperation is better than confrontation and who engage in
cooperation based on a framework of freedom and democracy, Berger
said.</P>
      <P>He praised the Republic of China government -- which established
the DPU and advocates DPU values -- for its outstanding performance
in efforts to create jobs, end illiteracy and build Taiwan into a
multicultural society, which he claimed makes the country a role
model for all DPU member countries.</P>
      <P>The Guatemalan president was one of the heads of state who
delivered speeches at the DPU inauguration ceremony in which
governmental and political delegates from 26 countries around the
Pacific Rim took part.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's women gave birth for the first
time at an average age of 27.4 years in 2004, up by 1.5 years
compared with the 1994 average, according to the latest statistics
released by the government Sunday.</P>
      <P>The tallies compiled by the Cabinet-level Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) show that 37.5 percent of
the women who gave birth last year were aged between 25-29, followed
by 27.8 percent aged from 30 to 34.</P>
      <P>Compared with the level recorded 10 years ago, the birth rate
posted by the 25-29 age group was down by 4.8 percentage points
compared with the level of a decade ago. Meanwhile, women over the
age of 30 accounted for more births, an indication, according to
DGBAS officials, that women in Taiwan are increasingly having their
first child at an older age and fewer children overall.</P>
      <P>According to the same statistics, women in the 30-34 and 35-39
age groups registered increase rates of 4.6 percentage points and 3.6
percentage points in their respective birth rates over the 1994
levels, while those above 40 posted a birth rate of 1.2 percent, a
growth of 0.7 percentage points.</P>
      <P>Last year, there were a total of 218,000 newborns, a majority of
52 percent of whom were the first child, with 36 percent and 12
percent as the second and third children, respectively.</P>
      <P>According to a survey by the U. S. Bureau of the Census on the
global population, child-bearing women around the world had 2.8
children on average last year, with those in developed countries
averaging 1.6 -- still higher than Taiwan's 1.2, which was lower than
Hong Kong's 0.9 but at a similar level to those of Japan and South

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu called Sunday for
democracy, peace and prosperity in the Pacific Rim and for building
the region into a "blue bridge" linking east and west, north and
south.</P>
      <P>Lu issued the call at the opening ceremony of the Democratic
Pacific Union (DPU), her brainchild since 2001, which is designed to
serve as a quasi-government-to-government organization and comprises
26 member states, including the United States, Canada, Japan, South
Korea and various Republic of China diplomatic allies in Central
America and the Pacific to advocate democracy, peace and prosperity
in the region.</P>
      <P>Noting that World War Two -- the most devastating war in human
history -- officially ended on that day 60 years ago after Japan
surrendered to the Allies, Lu warned that China is threatening not
just Taiwan but every corner of the Pacific region with its
fast-growing military expansion -- one of the remnants of the Cold
War despite globalization and the information revolution which have
led to economic prosperity in the Pacific.</P>
      <P>As the Pacific covers one-third of the earth's surface and is
home to the 40 percent of the world's population in 30 countries, the
ocean has become the most important lifeline for mankind and the
region's security, stability and prosperity is of extremely vital
importance to the entire world, she said.</P>
      <P>She expressed the hope that the peace-loving leaders of the
Pacific Rim countries will reflect on past errors made by mankind and
join forces in building a bright future for the region through what
she called a "soft-powered Pacific" featuring the DPU's three core
values in the 21st Century.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, along with Guatemalan President Oscar

      <P>The DPU, initiated by Vice President Annette Lu, aims at
treasuring and conserving natural resources; creating environments

resources from being abused or poached; spreading the concept that
the Pacific's natural resources should be shared; eradicating
poverty, confrontation and military threats; and helping create
multicultural societies under equality and justice in the region,
Pacheco said.</P>
      <P>The DPU inauguration ceremony -- held on the 60th anniversary of

    <HEADLINE>KMT-PFP INTERACTION KEY TO 'PAN BLUE' CONSOLIDATION: OBSERVERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   14  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman-elect Ma Ying-jeou slated to take the helm as the party boss
next week, interaction between the KMT and its ally the People First
Party (PFP) in the legislature will be the benchmark for future
consolidation of the "pan blue alliance," observers said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The role of Legislative Speaker Wang Jing-pyng, a KMT vice
chairman who was favored by PFP Chairman James Soong but who was
defeated by Ma in the KMT chairmanship race, will be the key gauge in
KMT-PFP cooperation, political watchers said.</P>
      <P>As various disputed and urgent bills are waiting to be screened
in the next legislative session that will open in September, it will
be worth watching how Wang and Soong exercise their leverage in the
legislature amid strong pressure from the "pan green alliance" of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union
to approve the key bills, they said.</P>
      <P>As Wang has repeatedly made clear that he will not continue to
serve as a KMT vice chairman after Ma takes over the party helm from
outgoing Chairman Lien Chan Aug. 19, he will be the KMT's central
figure in cooperating with the PFP in the legislature, they
explained.</P>
      <P>At the same time, it will be a big test of Soong's political
acumen, as he and Ma overlap a great deal in the "pan blue" voting
base, setting the stage for strong competition between the two men
that will be underscored as the December city and county chief
elections approach, the observers pointed out.</P>
      <P>Although it remains unclear whether the two parties will keep
collaborating in the next legislative session, KMT legislative whip
Cho Po-yuan said that he is very optimistic that the two parties will
continue to do so, citing their shared ideology and political stance
in terms of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative whip Huang Yih-jiau echoed Cho's view, stressing
that the two parties share common ground on cross-strait issues and
their anti-Taiwan independence stance.</P>
      <P>Their remarks might upset President Chen Shui-bian, who said
several times prior to the KMT chairman election that he was hoping
for better ties between the ruling and opposition camps with the
leadership change in the KMT, to help push through controversial
bills on a major arms procurement plan, the approval of a
presidential nomination list of Control Yuan members and a
flood-control project, they said.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the PFP collaborated again last week in the vetoing
of a proposal to hold an extra legislative session to discuss the
various key bills during the current summer recess.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTER SAYS NO TO ANOTHER PRICE HIKE BY CPC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.  14 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Ho Mei-yueh said Sunday
that she would not support the state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC) to increase its gasoline and diesel fuel prices again after CPC
had already made an adjustment early this month.</P>
      <P>Ho said the recent fluctuations in oil prices were due to the
same factors that triggered the price hike in early August, and that
she does not believe the CPC should adjust the fuel prices twice
because of the same factors.</P>
      <P>As the international oil price broke US$67 per barrel, there was
speculation that the CPC might raise its fuel prices again.</P>
      <P>The economics minister said that although rising international
oil price has caused the CPC's cost of purchase to go up, she still
does not believe the CPC should raise its fuel prices, even if
Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (PFC) readjusts its wholesale prices.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 2, the FPC increased its gasoline and diesel fuel prices
by NT$1.5 per liter, with the CPC following suit hours later by
adding also NT$1.5 per liter to the two kinds of fuel, representing a
7.6 percent increase, the highest in the past decade.</P>
      <P>Ho said that information in her possession shows the recent wave
of oil price hikes would not persist and that most of the forecasts
also say the international oil price is unlikely to have another big
increase.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'GREAT LOVE' AWARDS HONOR EXTRAORDINARY PARENTS, GRANDPARENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14 (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ten local families were cited Sunday for
volunteering their services for needy people in addition to caring
for their own disabled children.</P>
      <P>It is the eighth consecutive year that the Chinese Mercy Love
Association has organized the Great Love Awards in recognition of the
parents of physically or mentally challenged children.</P>
      <P>A total of 32 families were recommended by city or county
governments and social welfare groups around the country to take part
in the contest. </P>
      <P>The award winners were either parents or grandparents of children
with serious physical disabilities or rare diseases. They have given
their youngsters endless love and attentive care, and all of them
have struggled to ensure that their children receive normal
opportunities to study and learn skills. More admiringly, they take
time out of their busy schedules and heavy workloads to volunteer
their services for other people.</P>
      <P>The oldest recipient was Hou-Chen Chao-se, an 80-year-old woman
from a rural township in the southern county of Chiayi who has
assisted her eldest child Hou Cheng-ping in overcoming his physical
disability and psychological despair.</P>
      <P>Hou Cheng-ping became paralyzed from the waist down after an
accidental fall 37 years ago. Under her mother's concentrating care
and passionate encouragement, Hou Cheng-ping went out of the abyss of
despair and learned vocational skills. In 1995, he formed an
association of people of spinal injuries in Chiayi to help the
handicapped to enter mainstream society.</P>
      <P>Also cited was Wen Chien-ling, a 70-year-old woman who has over
the past 18 years cared for her granddaughter Wen Hsiao-yun, a victim
of congenital cerebral palsy. Wen has assumed the duty of caring for
Hsiao-yun since her birth so that Hsiao-yun's parents can continue
their careers. When Hsiao-yun finally could enter an elementary
school, Wen carried her granddaughter to school piggyback everyday
and waited outside the classroom to offer Hsiao-yun timely help. Over
the years, Wen also volunteered her services at the school, assisting
in handling student affairs and offered counseling for other parents
with physically or mentally challenged kids.</P>
      <P>The award recipient also included a couple -- Wu Chin-hui and
Chou Li-ling -- both of whose two children are victims of an
incurable rare ailment known as Niemann-Pick Disease. The couple have
turned their grief into strength. For years, they have taken their
children to see doctors periodically for medication and examination.
They have even accompanied their children to West Africa to take part
in charitable activities for helping impoverished African children.
By so doing, the couple said they hope their children can learn to
love and treasure life.</P>
      <P>The Niemann-Pick Disease refers to a group of inherited metabolic
disorders known as the leukodystrophies whose symptoms include a lack
of muscle coordination, brain degeneration and learning problems.</P>

      <P>Chen made the remarks in a speech delivered at a luncheon in

well as push for the convening of DPU leadership meeting.</P>
      <P>As a peace promoter, Chen said he is well aware of the world

a new Pacific balance of power on the basis of a new cross-strait
balance of power.</P>
      <P>In the process, Chen said, the DPU can play the role of
"connector" to link up Pacific east and west coasts, eliminate
geographic barriers and step up Pacific cultural renaissance through
increased political, economic, social and cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>The DPU can also help integrate North and South Pacific economy
and narrow economic gaps by forging free trade agreements, customs
alliance and a Pacific common market, Chen said, adding that such
efforts will contribute to the upgrading of living standards
throughout the Pacific Rim.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chen said, the DPU is expected to play the role of
"accelerator, " helping promote globalization, narrow the digital
technology gap, boost information-technology education and establish
an environment for fair competition.</P>
      <P>In the years ahead, Chen sad the DPU can learn from the
experiences of the European Union to reinforce cooperation among its
member countries by setting up various regional development funds and
assisting member states in pursuing balanced and sustainable
development.</P>
      <P>The DPU, initiated by Vice President Annette Lu, is comprised of
26 member countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia,
New Zealand, Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica,
Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Chile, Russia, Japan, South Korea, the

Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Kiribati, Palau and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The non-governmental organization will serve as a platform for
exchanges among the Pacific Rim countries in the promotion of their
common ideals.</P>
      <P>More than 500 delegates from 26 member states attended the
inaugural conference held at Grand Hotel in the morning. Notably
absent from the meeting were China and Singapore.</P>

with the international community will promote democracy in that
country and that a democratic China would ensure peace and stability
in the Asia-Pacific region, Gilman said that although China has
become an economic power, it has not yet been become a democratic
country.</P>
      <P>"On the contrary, China poses a greater threat to Japan, Taiwan
and the United States. China also hopes to become a military power
and treats other Asian countries as its subordinates as it did
before," he added.</P>
      <P>He also quoted U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as recently
saying that China's military buildup has threatened neighboring
countries and that China seems to have the intention of forming an
alliance with Russia in order to fight against the U.S-Japan
alliance, which he said might affect security in the Asia-Pacific
region.</P>
      <P>According to the lawmaker, China will stage a military exercise
Aug. 18-25 along its northeastern coast to test its military power as
well as reactions from Japan and the United States.</P>
      <P>The pragmatists in the United States have said that faced with
the threat of China's growing military might, the only way to check
that country's expansionist ambitions is for the United States to
possess a superior military force and for all free, democratic and
peace-loving countries to unite to promote world peace, he continued.</P>
      <P>Gilman said that the DPU, which is also designed to establish a
collective cooperation and consultation mechanism for the
Asia-Pacific region, can play an important role in the fight against
the threat posed by China. He added that the organization can also
help effectively safeguard peace and stability in the region and in
the world as well as establish a democratic, peaceful and prosperous

    <HEADLINE>COSTA RICA FULLY SUPPORTS TAIWAN'S UN BID: PRESIDENT PACHECO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Costa Rica staunchly supports Taiwan's bid
to join the United Nations because the rights of Taiwan's 23 million
people should be respected by all countries, visiting Costa Rican
President Abel Pacheco de la Espriella said Monday.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Taiwan's renewed efforts this year in its bid to
join the UN -- including urging the UN to reconsider the issue of
Taiwan's representation and asking the UN to play an active role in
the Taiwan Strait issue -- Pacheco said that Costa Rica supports and
will speak for Taiwan on every possible occasion to facilitate
Taiwan's UN bid.</P>
      <P>During an exclusive interview with CNA, Pacheco, who arrived in
Taipei Friday mainly to attend the inaugural ceremony for the
Democratic Pacific Union (DPU) Sunday, said that Costa Rica will
fully support Taiwan in its unswerving resolve to pursue peace,
democracy and an identity for its people.</P>
      <P>On the development of thorny cross-Taiwan Strait relations,
Pacheco said that the best scenario is that the two sides resolve
their differences through dialogue and negotiations.</P>
      <P>Pacheco added that although Costa Rica has no right to interfere
in other country's legislation, such as Beijing's passage of its
Anti-Secession Law, which legalizes "non-peaceful means" should
Taiwan move toward formal independence, he will try his utmost to
help Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the face of stronger voices in his country's business sector
calling for Costa Rica's closer economic and trade ties with China,
Pacheco said that the Costa Rican government has remained firm in its
position. "So far, Costa Rica-China relations have been restricted in
economy and trade and it is impossible, at least presently, that
Costa Rica will establish formal diplomatic relations with China," he
reiterated.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Pacheco noted, Costa Rica and Taiwan have begun to
talk about signing a free trade agreement (FTA) . Nevertheless, he
pointed out, these efforts should be made in a prudent and even
calculating manner to make the agreement as perfect as possible.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan-Costa Rica FTA could also cover not only economic and
trade affairs, but also encompass exchanges in the fields of
humanities, sciences and arts, Pacheco added.</P>
      <P>Pacheco signed a joint communique with President Chen Shui-bian
Sunday, reaffirming their commitment to further promoting exchanges
and cooperation between the two countries. The two heads of state
said in the joint communique that the Republic of China and Costa
Rica will further expand cooperation in medical services, health
care, education, and technological and economic development based on
their 60-year friendship.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPU MEMBERS SHOULD SUPPORT U.N. ROLE IN CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS: NSC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Republic of China national
security official has urged the member states of the Democratic
Pacific Union (DPU) to help push the United Nations to accept a
proposal which was raised by the island recently to request that the
world body play an active role in maintaining peace in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Parris Chang, deputy secretary-general of the National Security
Council, made the appeal while meeting with representatives from the
26 member states of the DPU, a non-governmental organization designed
to serve as a platform for exchanges among Pacific Rim countries in
the promotion of democracy, at a forum held Sunday at the Grand Hotel
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the purpose of establishing the United Nations
was to protect and maintain world peace, Chang said that the
organization at least should serve as an arbitrator on issues related
to Taiwan; however, the United Nations has long absented itself from
dealing with the issue.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to the nation's 13th bid to join the United
Nations, the ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs raised a proposal
through its diplomatic allies to request that the organization play
an active role in maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait and
expressed the hope that the proposal will be placed on the agenda of
this year's U.N. General Assembly scheduled to be held in September
for debate and eventually be accepted by the organization.</P>
      <P>Calling for the representatives of DPU members to persuade their
governments to support the proposal, the official also expressed the
hope that Australia, the United States, South Korea and El Salvador
will clearly voice their support for the proposal.</P>
      <P>He also urged the United Nations to shoulder its responsibility
in dealing with the Taiwan issue and respond to Taiwan and the
international community's expectations of a peaceful resolution on
differences in the Strait.</P>
      <P>in response to Chang's appeal, Benjamin Gilman, former chairman
of the Committee on International Relations of the U.S. House of
Representatives, who also attended the gathering, said that each time
the U.N. discusses issues related to Taiwan, such as Taiwan's bid to
join the World Health Organization and trade issues, China always
does whatever it can to put pressure on other U.N. members who
support Taiwan to prevent the passage of all resolutions in favor of
Taiwan's U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>Saying that only a few U.N. members would like to support the
island within the organization, Gilman suggested that it is necessary
for Taiwan and its allies find a better way to persuade more
developing countries to support the island.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Uliran T. Joaquin, vice chairman of the Committee of
Foreign Affairs of the Filipino House of Representatives, also said
that Taiwan must be patient if it wants the U.N. to recognize it,
urging the DPU members to advise China not to prevent Taiwan from
participating in the world health body and not to turn a blind eye to
the health of the 23 million people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ralph A. Cossa, chairman of the Pacific Forum of the U.S. Center
for Strategic and International Studies, also said that excluding
Taiwan from many international organizations is unfair, stressing
that the DPU can help Taiwan express its opinion and that world peace
can be ensured through bilateral and multilateral cooperation and
dialogue pushed by the organization.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CALLS TAIWAN'S 1895-1945 HISTORY 'JAPANESE COLONIAL RULE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Monday termed Japan's 1895-1945 rule of Taiwan as
"colonial and aggressive, " stressing that from Taiwan's point of
view, Taiwan was indeed "occupied" during that period.</P>
      <P>This is the first time the DDP has tried to shed its previous
ambiguity about Japan's role in shaping Taiwan's modern history while
making a distinction between Taiwan's and China's aspirations.</P>
      <P>In a draft report jointly prepared by the party's departments of
culture and communications, ethnic affairs and international affairs,
the DPP said that that half century of Taiwan's history can neither
be simply called Japan's "neutral" rule, as some people think, nor be
described as having been "ceded by China, " as feudalistic Chinese
imperialists see it.</P>
      <P>The draft report was the result of five rounds of discussions by
the three departments with the participation of the Department of
China Affairs and the party's Policy Research Committee, focusing on
the theme of looking at the issue from the perspectives of universal
values and multi-culturalism.</P>
      <P>It said Taiwan's modernization during Japan's colonial occupation
should not be exaggerated or distorted, and neither should it be
minimized.</P>
      <P>"Efforts should be made to write a history of Taiwan people
resisting Japanese aggression as they sought autonomy. Efforts should
also be made to criticize the nature of colonization and suppression
that was common in both the post-war [Kuomintang] rule of Taiwan and
the Japanese occupational regime," it said.</P>
      <P>Yang Chang-chen, director of the DPP's Department of Ethnic
Affairs, who coordinated the drafting of the report, cited the
example of Nationalists China's war of resistance against Japanese
aggression, which started on July 7, 1937 with the "Marco Polo Bridge
Incident."</P>
      <P>The spirit of "war against aggression" has no borders, Yang said,
adding that therefore mainland-born Taiwan people's painful memory of
China's war against Japanese invasion and China's civil war between
the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should not be dismissed as
"their memory."</P>
      <P>Rather, he continued, the memory should be regarded as a critical
component of Taiwan's spirit of anti-aggression.</P>
      <P>The report said the DPP respects and understands why China has
since long ago demanded Japan apologize for its World War II
aggression, but hopes that the two Asian countries will not give up
any chance of exchanges that will help promote goodwill and
friendship between them.</P>
      <P>Based on the same reasoning, the report hopes that China will try
to "universalize" the values of anti-colonialism and anti-aggression
and seriously reflect on its relations with neighboring tribes and
countries -- particularly its relations with East Turkistan and
Mongolia.</P>
      <P>Only when China can truly honor universal values and think deeply
about its relations with surrounding peoples can the rest of the
world be convinced that China's rise will not be tainted with
expansionism and hegemony, it said.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that Taiwan's China-resisting efforts should not
be seen as aimed at playing down Japan's colonial aggression and war
responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Also, the report said, Taiwan's efforts to build good relations
with Japan based on their common objective of maintaining peace and
promoting democratic values should not be interpreted as "anti-China"
or "hating China."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CGA TO LOOK INTO CHINESE FISHING BOAT INTRUSIONS NEAR MATSU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Coast Guard Administration (CGA) will
investigate whether local units were derelict in their duties in
trying to protect the rights of fishermen near the outlying island of
Matsu as a media report insinuated, a senior official said Monday.</P>
      <P>CGA Minister Shi Hwei-yow was responding to a report saying that
Taiwanese fishermen's rights and national security have been
jeopardized by Chinese fishing vessels, which have recently been
intruding into waters near Matsu more often than ever. Matsu is an
island group that lies closer to the southeastern Chinese province of
Fujian than to Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Chinese fishermen not only traversed
into waters close to Matsu to fish but also went ashore to rest. The
report quoted a member of a Matsu fishing association as claiming
that the phenomenon has been going on for a long time but that the
situation has gotten worse than ever because of the CGA's sloppy
management.</P>
      <P>The claim was that some Chinese fishing boats caught by CGA
patrols were released after giving out bribes of high-quality fish
catches. He added that the association had spent two months getting
footage of intrusions by Chinese fishing boats in waters off Matsu.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Shi said he has directed CGA Deputy
Minister Chung Tung-sheng to head a team to Matsu on a field survey.
Team members include officials from coastal patrol and government
ethics departments.</P>
      <P>In addition to investigating whether CGA staff were derelict
about their official duties or indeed took bribes from Chinese
fishermen as reported, Shi said the team is also expected to map out
appropriate measures to address the Matsu offshore waters security
problems.</P>
      <P>Any staff member who is found guilty of corruption or dereliction
of duty will be given harsh penalties in accordance with the law, Shi
said, adding that the CGA will publish a report on the team's
investigative results and the CGA's response as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>With a view to upgrading working efficiency, Shi said, the CGA
has implemented a new integrated operational system since July 1 and
has made Matsu its 11th patrol region. The new system accentuates
integration of coastal and deep-sea patrols and information gathering
to enhance efficiency, he explained.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
officials and lawmakers left for China Monday to hold talks with the
Chinese side on direct charter flights across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>KMT Central Policy Committee head Tseng Yung-chuan, who led the
group, said that they will talk over the issue Tuesday in Beijing
with Chinese officials from the Taiwan Affairs Office under the State
Council and the Civil Aviation Administration of China and that they
will return to Taiwan later the same day.</P>
      <P>Stating that direct charter cargo and passenger flights between
Taiwan and China are urgently needed due to close bilateral trade and
economic relations, Tseng said that the KMT is very willing to act as
a bridge and a go-between in helping forging mutual benefits and
creating a win-win situation.</P>
      <P>Although Premier Frank Hsieh said earlier this month that Taiwan
is preparing to open the talks, Tseng said that the government has
made no concrete moves, noting that it has not responded to an

      <P>Chiang also urged the government to broaden its charter passenger
service beyond Taiwan businessmen to other occupations of Taiwan
people.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Chu Fong-chih expressed the hope that China will
open airports in Shanghai and Guangdong to serve direct links to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The private sector is eager to see the talks start off as soon as
possible based on the success of the Chinese New Year charter flights
earlier this year that were conducted in line with the "non-stop,
round-trip" principle by carriers from the two sides.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Airlines Association, which was appointed again last
week by the government as its proxy to conduct the charter passenger
and cargo talks with China, said that they have to wait patiently for
the time being until the Mainland Affairs Council gives further
instruction.</P>
      <P>EVA Airways Corporation -- Taiwan's second-largest carrier after
China Airlines (CAL) -- said that brisk cross-strait cargo business
enjoyed at present by Taiwan's carriers via Hong Kong or Macau will
last no more than two years. Taiwan carriers are set to face a plunge
in their business after foreign aviation companies complete their
deployment in the Chinese market, it pointed out.</P>
      <P>China opened its skies to U.S.-based carriers last year,
promoting Federal Express and UPS to set up transshipment centers in
China, while airlines from other Asian and European countries are
jockeying for position in forming cooperation ventures with Chinese
carriers in cargo transport.</P>
      <P>CAL is slated to own 18 Boeing 747-400 all-cargo planes by the
end of this year, making it the world's No. 1 all-cargo Boeing
747-400 fleet.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that no breakthrough has so far been made in
cross-strait transport links, business sources said that CAL is
optimistic about business prospects by having ordered new airplanes
to serve that end; however, there is not much time left for
Taiwan-based carriers to wait amid aggressive foreign competition as
Taiwan has more to ask from the Chinese side in this regard.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) announced Monday that it would award 11 government and private
institutions for their recycling efforts.</P>
      <P>The institutions, which range from hospitals to high-tech
manufacturers, were selected by an EPA panel to encourage the public
to reduce and recycle their waste.</P>
      <P>Yao Wen-huei, an agent at the EPA's Department of Waste
Management, was quoted as saying that poultry droppings and cow
manure is a good source of fertilizer for plants as they contain
nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium.</P>
      <P>One award-winning compost factory confirmed Yao's assessment by
utilizing used tea leaves, coffee beans, cow manure and farm waste to
produce the organic, odor-free fertilizer.</P>
      <P>People can also make their own compost at home by collecting
their kitchen waste and processing it with special fungi, Yao said.
The juice produced by the fungi, according to him, is nutritious
enough to be used as liquid fertilizer or to keep sewers from being
clogged by dirt or being infested with cockroaches.</P>
      <P>This is the third year for the EPA awards and 38 government
institutions and private companies have been recognized. The EPA said
it would hold a conference this year to demonstrate how schools and

    <HEADLINE>VETERAN BLOOD DONOR ENCOURAGES MIDDLE-AGED TO DONATE BLOOD MORE OFTEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The woman who has donated more blood in
Taiwan than any other female said Monday that middle-aged people
should get into the act to help enrich the nations blood banks.</P>
      <P>Wang Chiu-chiung, 47, who began to donate blood at the age of 28
in 1986, said that she has regularly given blood even though she is
now middle aged. She has donated 758 times over the past 19 years.</P>
      <P>Wang said that there is a mistaken belief that older people
should not donate blood because blood donations are harmful to
health.</P>
      <P>Wang said that she donates blood under one single purpose -- to
help people. Because she is not rich, Wang said, she has chosen to
donate blood as if donating cash to the needy.</P>
      <P>In order to donate blood repeatly, Wang said she has forced
herself to lead a healthy lifestyle -- eating and drinking right,
getting enough sleep and exercising regularly.</P>
      <P>According to officials from the Taipei Blood Organization, the
blood bank regularly suffers blood shortages during summer and it
found that most of the blood donors in Taiwan are students or young
people aged between 17 and 30. The number of donors decreases with
age, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Encouraging middle-aged people to donate blood more often, Wang
stressed that blood donations should not be the exclusive right of
the young.</P>
      <P>Wang's husband, who previously was opposed to blood donations, is
now also a regular donor. Wang said her child will be a devoted donor
too after he turns 17.</P>

(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, the chairman-elect of
Taiwan's largest opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), said Monday
there is no urgent need for him to have a face-to-face talk with
Communist Party of China (CPC) leader Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>Commenting on news reports that the CPC is seeking direct
dialogue between its leaders and the KMT, Ma said the Mainland
Affairs Department of the KMT Central Committee has been the party's
channel of communications with China, and that outgoing KMT Chairman
Lien Chan already paid a visit to China in late April and reached a
consensus with Hu on five major subjects.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Ma said, there is "no immediate or urgent need" at
present to hold talks between himself and Hu, general secretary of
the CPC Central Committee, who is also the president of China.</P>
      <P>Asked about the remarks made by Legislative Yuan speaker Wang
Jin-pyng Monday that after winning the election for KMT chairman, Ma
has become the KMT's candidate for the 2008 presidential election, Ma
disagreed, saying that the election for party chairman has not
produced a nominee for the presidential election, and that as of now,
anyone is qualified to be a candidate, including Wang.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is currently Taipei mayor, said people often
misrepresented him when he said his chief objective in running for
KMT chairman was to make the KMT the ruling party again in 2008, as
they think that he wants to run for president in 2008.</P>
      <P>Ma explained that actually his biggest concern is to place the
KMT in a favorable position through reforms, so that the party can
lead in the presidential election campaign all the way until 2008.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kaohisung,  Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Taiwan-born veterans who have gone
through Japanese and Chinese rule called on the government to give
them justice and build a "martyrs shrine" dedicated to some 50,000
Taiwanese soldiers who died in World War II, the Korean War and
China's civil war.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chao-jung and Hsu Teng-kuang were invited by the Kaohsiung
City Government to tell their stories in conjunction with the
publication of a history book about the war and the life experiences
of Taiwanese veterans.</P>
      <P>Hsu, 77, and a native of Pingtung in southern Taiwan, volunteered
to serve in the Japanese Imperial Navy and was later recruited by the
Republic of China Navy and sent to the United States on a mission to
sail a navy vessel back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It was during that mission when he read a book titled, "The Tenth
Anniversary of the Taiwan Independence Movement, " a taboo at the
time. Because of that, he was jailed for 10 years on Green Island off
Taitung.</P>
      <P>After being released from prison, Hsu was monitored all the time.
He decided to exile himself abroad. He is now chairman of the board
of directors of the Association of the ROC Soldiers and their
Bereaved Families.</P>
      <P>His personal experiences motivated him to gather as much
information as possible, through "oral history" compilations, about
Taiwan-born soldiers who had been "tricked" into joining the
Nationalist Army, many of whom died as a result of the civil war
between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party from 1945 to 1949.</P>
      <P>Hsu, 75, speaks with a Suzhou, Zhejiang province accent though he
is a Hakka from Hualien, eastern Taiwan. Soon after Japan's defeat in
1945, he joined the ROC Army, serving as a platoon leader in the
278th Regiment of the 70th Division.</P>
      <P>He fought in many skirmishes in China with the Chinese
Communists, including the major Hsupang Battle. He then became a
prisoner of war.</P>
      <P>While many of his fellow soldiers came to Taiwan with the Chiang
Kai-shek government, he was stranded in China for 43 years. In 1996,
with the assistance of some tourists from Taiwan, he returned to his
hometown in Hualien, only to encounter another downturn in his life
-- he wasn't given any compensation by the ROC government; he has
since been making a living by collecting garbage.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the ROC government did not even issue him a certificate
of discharge from military service so he would be entitled to some
veterans benefits. Now he is almost a misfit, and a burden to his
family.</P>
      <P>On the 60th anniversary of the end of WWII, Hsu Teng-kuang and
Hsu Chao-jung said they are concerned about thousands of Taiwan-born
veterans who are still in China. They also said they care very much
about the tens of thousands of others who have died fighting in
different wars on Pacific islands, the Korean Peninsula and China.</P>
      <P>They urged the government to build a monument or a shrine
dedicated to those unsung heroes to give them basic justice.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FATE OF TWO WATER OFFICIALS RESTS WITH CABINET: ECONOMICS MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two officials who offered to resign after
being criticized for water shortages in Taoyuan County were backed
Monday by Minister of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Ho Mei-yueh as "doing a
good job, " but she added that their fate rests in the hands of the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Ho was referring to Water Resources Agency Director Chen
Sheng-hsien and Taiwan Water Corp. Chairman Lee Wen-liang, adding
that both have insisted on stepping down to take responsibility for
the recent water shortages.</P>
      <P>She lauded the two for their excellent ability to execute tasks,
but said that she would report to the Executive Yuan about their
intention to leave their posts and let the Executive Yuan decide
whether they should go.</P>
      <P>After Typhoon Matsa battered Taiwan in early August, bringing
strong winds and torrential rains, the water supply to Taoyuan was
disrupted. Water to northern Taoyuan was not fully restored until
Aug. 13.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian was angry about the recurrence of water
shortages -- Taoyuan has been routinely hit with a lack of potable
water after typhoons in the last couple of years -- and inspected the
Shihmen Reservoir himself last week. The ministry convened a review
meeting Sunday, with Ho finalizing the review report Monday.</P>
      <P>Ho said that the report centers on issues that the public is most
concerned about, adding that after the typhoons last year, a second
pumping station was installed at Shihmen, but it was not able to cope
this year with the mud and silt that entered the reservoir after the
first two typhoons.</P>
      <P>She said that the review report will examine each of the
problems, and will mete out discipline if negligence is discovered.
She did not disclose the list of names under review.</P>
      <P>Premier Hsieh said earlier that a vice economic minister was not
at Taoyuan to keep abreast of the latest developments in the water
shortage crisis, and the media has speculated that the person in
question was Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming who is
responsible for water resources.</P>
      <P>Ho said Yiin in fact was involved during the entire process, but
because the ministry was busy at the time, the public couldn't
possibly have seen her and Yiin at the same time and place.</P>

      <P>A 12-year-old girl charged with
intimidating Swazi Ambassador Njabuliso Gwebu over the telephone Aug.
3 has been referred to a juvenile court in Taipei, a spokesman for
the Shihlin District police precinct said Monday.</P>
      <P>The girl, surnamed Lu, is a seventh-grade student at a school for
foreign nationals. A police task force established specifically to
investigate the case traced a series of threatening calls to the
girl's mobile phone.</P>
      <P>According to the police, the girl admitted having made the phone
calls, which she said were intended for a classmate who had stood her
up a few days earlier. She said she dialed a number of times within
five minutes from her bedroom.</P>
      <P>The girl also admitted that during the first phone call, she
threatened the person on the other end of the line in English while
trying to impersonate a male voice. In the following calls, she
remained silent.</P>
      <P>Members of the police task force who checked the phone number of
Lu's classmate found that there is only a one-digit difference
between that number and the phone number of the Swazi ambassador. The
task force concluded that the girl probably dialed the wrong number
while trying to play a trick on her classmate.</P>
      <P>Although the girl's mother pleaded that she be forgiven for the
unintended hoax, the police nevertheless referred the case to the

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than half of the 100 largest exporters
in China are foreign-funded hi-tech companies, with most of the
capital coming from Taiwan, according to a recent report by Lehman
Brothers, a U.S.-based investment bank.</P>
      <P>Among the top 100 largest exporters in China, the number of
foreign-funded corporations rose to 53 in 2004 from 48 in 2003, the
report said, adding that 21 of the 53 electronics or information
industry companies were set up with funds from Taiwan, a development
that the bank called a reflection of Taiwan businesses' success in
setting up an export platform in China.</P>
      <P>Of the other 32 concerns, 11 and 10 are funded by capital from
the United States and South Korea, respectively, while seven were
established with Japanese investment. Two account for investment from
Holland, while Germany and Finland are owners in each of the
remaining two companies, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Hi-tech exports surged to make up some 33 percent of China's
total outbound shipments in the first half of this year, more than
double the 15 percent posted in the first half in 2000, thanks to a
large amount of outsourcing business, the report said, adding that it
has created many job opportunities in China and has helped introduce
new value-added technologies.</P>
      <P>Foreign-owned corporations are playing a bigger role in the
booming Chinese export sector, with the number reaching 60 percent of
the total this year, up from 48 percent in 2000 and 32 percent in
1995.</P>
      <P>The Chinese export sector recorded an annual growth rate of 32
percent in the first half of this year, two-thirds of which was

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu claimed Monday
that China is donning the mask of a "peaceful rise," but in fact, the
Democratic Pacific Union (DPU) she initiated will "emerge softly."</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks in a press conference after the conclusion of
the three-day DPU conference, which included its inauguration and
three seminars centering on the themes of the organization --
democracy, peace and prosperity.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, all the DPU representatives have formed a "big
Pacific family" and will now spread the DPU's three ideals when they
return to their home countries.</P>
      <P>The DPU is comprised of 26 member countries -- the United States,

South Korea, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Timor, the

      <P>She said the aim of the DPU will be welcomed by peace-loving
countries and expressed the hope that Chinese people will soon enjoy
the basic rights of DPU countries, including the right to choose
their national leaders, adding that when that day comes, she will

      <P>On the plight of Taiwan in the international community, Lu said
the United Nations is unfair to Taiwan, claiming that although Taiwan
is eligible to attend any international organizations from any angle,
it is shut out because it has an unfriendly neighbor -- China.</P>
      <P>She expressed the hope that all "friends who love democracy and
freedom" can tell China's leaders to cast away their set ideas and
allow Taiwan a chance to take part in international organizations.</P>
      <P>Noting that China advocates 'peaceful emergence," Lu claimed that
Beijing is donning a mask, citing a U.S. Defense Department report
that China's continued military buildup has caused uneasiness and
misgivings among many countries.</P>
      <P>Lu also claimed that Taiwan will "never be invaded by any
countries" because of its superb strategic position, which she

      <P>In the interview with The Australian daily, Chen also appealed
for Australia's diplomatic help, asking Prime Minister John Howard to
push his case for an invitation to next month's informal leadership
meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, to be
held in South Korea.</P>
      <P>Chen was interviewed by the paper's international news section
editor Greg Sheridan in Taipei last week. After publishing an article
on Chen in its weekend edition, the newspaper carried two more
related articles and an editorial in its Monday issue.</P>
      <P>Australia has barred visits from Taiwanese leaders since 1972,
when Canberra established diplomatic relations with Beijing. Chen was
quoted as having said in the interview that he respects Australia's
diplomatic ties with China but believes this should not prevent
practical cooperation between Taipei and Canberra.</P>
      <P>Chen said he looks forward to visiting Australia -- or at least
being allowed to make transit stops in major Australian cities such
as Brisbane and Sydney -- on his way to visit the Republic of China's
six diplomatic allies in the South Pacific. Chen has managed to make
transit stops in the United States and Fiji, neither of which
maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that Australia has offered enormous support and aid for
many South Pacific countries, Chen said he believes Taiwan and
Australia can forge a partnership in assisting those countries in the
future.</P>
      <P>He also took the opportunity to make his case for an invitation
to the upcoming APEC summit meeting, claiming that APEC could be used
as a conduit for resolving disputes across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"I believe that if justice and equality exist in international
society, the Australian government should speak in favor of Taiwan"
and allow Taiwan's president to participate in APEC alongside leaders
of other APEC member states, Chen said.</P>
      <P>At a time when the U.S. government wants a peaceful resolution of
the Taiwan Strait issue, Chen said he believes APEC can serve as the
best site for discussion of the issue.</P>
      <P>He called for broader international involvement in the
cross-strait issue. With regard to the nuclear issue involving North
Korea, Chen noted that many nations came together in the six-party
talks.</P>
      <P>"I believe the dispute in the Taiwan Strait should also be
considered a regional issue," he said.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's future, Chen said he does not rule out cross-strait
unification as an option, but he insisted that Taiwan's sovereignty
rests with its 23 million people and no-one else.</P>
      <P>Under the principles of popular sovereignty and national
self-determination, Chen said it is up to the Taiwan people to decide
whether Taiwan should unify with China.</P>
      <P>Reaffirming his resolve to defend Taiwan's sovereign status, Chen
said the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are
different and separately ruled countries.</P>
      <P>In the face of China's ever-growing military threat, Chen said
Taiwan will strive to maintain sufficient self-defense capabilities.
He said optimistically that his administration's long-stalled arms
procurement plan will clear the legislature in the not-too-distant
future.</P>
      <P>He was referring to a plan to purchase three advanced weaponry
items from the United States, including eight diesel-electric
submarines, six Patriot PACIII anti-missile batteries and a squadron
of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft. The plan has been consistently
stonewalled by the opposition, which holds a legislative majority.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Chen praised Australia as "a great power" in
the Pacific and expressed gratitude for Canberra's diplomatic
assistance in the past.</P>
      <P>"We are very well aware that without the assistance of Australia
we would not have such participation in world affairs, " Chen said.
"Our successful accession into the World Trade Organization was a
result of the fruitful assistance of the Australian government, " he
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT DESCRIBES CHINA'S MILITARY RISE AS THREAT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Present Chen Shui-bian warned that China's
military expansion and modernization is not only a threat against
Taiwan, but also the entire international community.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during an interview published Monday in the
newspaper, Australian, in reply to the question of why China is
boosting its military build-up.</P>
      <P>Chen said that "their (China's) main aim is to become a hegemony
in the Pacific Ocean."</P>
      <P>Chen cited U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld as saying
that there's no reason for China to engage in a military build-up
when no countries in the world are threatening its national security.</P>
      <P>Despite this fact, China's military spending has been assessed to
be undergoing double-digit growth annually in the past 17 consecutive
years, according to Japan's 2005 defense white paper released early
August, he said.</P>
      <P>However, because China has never revealed its military budget,
the authorities in both the United States and Japan believe the
country's actual military spending could be two or three-time larger
than the estimated military budget, Chen added, adding that China's
rapid military expansion has ambitions far beyond Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He warned that China's rise is not for maintaining peace but for
its military ambition.</P>

      <P>The Marine Bureau of the Kaohsiung city
government ordered Monday that all shipbreaking operations on the
"Royal Pacific, " a Panama-registered passenger liner that sank in
Kaohsiung Harbor in June after catching fire, should cease
immediately because fuel leaking from the vessel is polluting the

      <P>A spokesman for the bureau said that an investigation by bureau
officials has found that the shipbreaking operations were
unauthorized and that light diesel fuel and heavy fuel oil leaking
from the vessel has polluted the harbor.</P>
      <P>The spokesman stressed that legal procedure must be followed in
order to obtain permission for any shipbreaking and that the job must
be done by an authorized shipyard to ensure no damage is done to the
environment.</P>
      <P>The 9,800-ton ship capsized in Kaohsiung Harbor June 30 after a
fire broke out below decks a day earlier while the vessel was

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei district prosecutors charged two Jen
Ai Hospital doctors Monday with "professional error leading to the
death" of a young girl who was beaten up by her father, who has
already been prosecuted.</P>
      <P>The five-year-old girl with the family name of Chiu, after being
hurt by her father, was first sent to Taipei's Jen Ai Hospital, where
doctors Liu Chi-hua and Lin Chih-nan were on duty at the emergency
unit.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors quoted a Department of Health report as saying
that the girl was in deep coma when she arrived at the hospital. She
was refused treatment and had to be transferred to a Taichung County
hospital some 200 km away, where she later died.</P>
      <P>The DOH report said the worsening of her condition and eventual
death cannot be conclusively linked to the two Ren Ai doctors'
failure to offer timely medical treatment.</P>
      <P>Still, the prosecution said, not only did the two doctors fail to
diagnose the girl's injury but they also forged the records of her
medical history.</P>
      <P>Forgery is a clear violation of the medical profession's ethical
guidelines, said the prosecutors, who decided to indict the two
doctors on charges of making a professional error that led to the
death of a patient.</P>
      <P>The girl's father, Chiu Kuang-jen, was charged with violent
beating and manslaughter, an offense that the prosecution said is
punishable by a 12-year jail sentence.</P>
      <P>The girl's injury and death created a storm in local society,
which demanded soul searching on the part of social workers and
doctors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REPORT OF COAST GUARD'S DERELICTION OF DUTY NOT TRUE: CGA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A media report that coast guard staff on
the outlying island of Matsu are corrupt and derelict in their duty
in protecting the nation's fishery resources and fishermen is untrue,
the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) claimed Monday.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, the CGA said, it sent a team of
officials to Matsu earlier in the day on a field survey.</P>
      <P>The team, headed by CGA Deputy Minister Chung Tung-sheng, said
that the report was not substantiated.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Chinese fishing boats have intruded into
waters near Matsu more often than ever. Worse still, the report said,
Chinese fishermen not only enter waters close to Matsu to fish but
also go ashore to rest.</P>
      <P>The report also quoted a member of a Matsu fishing association as
claiming that some Chinese fishing boats caught by CGA patrols were
released after paying bribes in the form of fish. He added that the
association spent two months getting footage of intrusions by Chinese
fishing boats in waters off Matsu -- an island group that lies closer
to the southeastern Chinese province of Fujian than to Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>Chung said after his return from the half-day field survey that
the footage provided by the association only shows individual Chinese
fishing boats operating in waters near Matsu. None of photos, he
claimed, substantiated the claim of intrusions by a large number of
Chinese fishing boats.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations also show that on the day the footage was
shot, the CGA unit in Matsu sent patrols to the area upon receiving
information about the intrusions. Due to the distance and "other
factors, " the boats had already fled when CGA patrols reached the
region.</P>
      <P>As to the claim that CGA officers have received fish bribes,
Chung said none of the Matsu fishing association members interviewed
by the team could produce evidence to back the claim.</P>
      <P>However, with a view to maintaining law and order and protecting
fishery resources in waters off Matsu and Kinmen, Chung said the CGA
will deploy more patrols in the region in the future.</P>
      <P>Since July 1, Chung said, the CGA has implemented a new
integrated operational system to upgrade working efficiency and has
made Matsu its 11th patrol region. The new system accentuates
integration of coastal and deep-sea patrols and information gathering
to enhance efficiency, he explained.</P>

      <P>Palau, which has a territory of 494 square kilometers and a

      <P>Castellon, who was in Taipei to attend the inaugural conference

close relations over the years, Castellon said his country will
continue to support Taiwan's bids to enter the United Nations.</P>
      <P>He also urged Taiwan entrepreneurs to invest in Nicaragua, as the
country is geographically close to the United States and will soon
sign a free trade agreement (FTA) with the U.S.</P>
      <P>According to Castellon, Nicaragua and Taiwan are ready to
negotiate a FTA soon.</P>
      <P>During his Taiwan visit, the seventh of its kind, Castellon said

      <P>Former Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party confirmed Monday that he met with
President Chen Shui-bian recently to express his intention of running
for the Taipei mayorship in 2006.</P>
      <P>Shen, a physician-turned-politician known for his eloquency,
humor and independent-thinking, said Chen gave a positive response
toward his bid for the Taipei mayoral post.</P>
      <P>Recent media reports revealed a short list of candidates
handpicked by Chen to represent the DPP in next year's Taipei mayoral
race, including Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyuan, DPP
Legislator Tsai Ing-wen and Yeh Chu-lan, a national policy adviser
who has previously served as a legislator, minister of transportation
and vice premier.</P>
      <P>Amid the reports, Shen said he felt compelled to meet with Chen
to express his keen interest in joining the race. Otherwise, Shen
said, he was afraid that the DPP might forget his intention to run.</P>
      <P>Shen said his relations with Chen are not as bad as some people
think, describing his meeting with Chen at the Presidential Office a
few weeks ago as "amiable and cordial."</P>
      <P>Shen's relationship with Chen was believed to have dropped to a
low ebb in the run-up to the 2004 presidential election due to

most-wanted white-collar criminals.</P>
      <P>Responding to Shen's announcement, DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan

    <HEADLINE>EDUCATION MINISTRY PUSHES FOR `FREEDOM OF HAIRSTYLE' FOR STUDENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>All education chiefs of local governments
contacted by the Ministry of Education (MOE) have voiced support for
the ministry's decision to give students freedom to decide upon their
hairstyles, Vice Minister of Education Fan Sun-lu said Monday.</P>
      <P>Fan said her office had contacted the education chiefs of 19 out
of 25 cities and counties around the country by last Friday, all of
whom are in favor of the abolishment of regulations on hairstyles.</P>
      <P>The ministry is still trying to seek the opinion of education
chiefs from the other six cities and counties, Fan said.</P>
      <P>The vice minister admitted, however, that the school principals
are the key persons who can make or break the ministry's policy, and
she said her ministry is trying to convince them to give their
students the right to determine their own hairstyles.</P>
      <P>Describing the hairstyle regulations as a relic of past
authoritarianism, Fan said the it was abandoned -- at least on paper
-- by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in 1987, but the students of
most elementary and middle schools still have to follow certain
guidelines on what hairstyle they can wear, with crewcuts the most
common styles imposed by most schools on their male students.</P>
      <P>Today, Fan said, students are more assertive about their right to
determine their attire and hairstyles than they were 18 years ago and
have united recently via the Internet in questioning the legitimacy
of school regulations about hairstyles. The school authorities should
accommodate their wishes or risk inviting criticism from
liberal-minded people outside schools, she said.</P>
      <P>In a democracy, students should be given the right to choose
their own hairstyle, which is a vital part of school training aimed
at teaching students to be responsible members of society by making
decisions for themselves and thinking on their own, Fan went on. </P>
      <P>In a bulletin issued last month, the MOE has forbidden public
elementary and middle schools to regulate hairstyles in any form from
the next school semester beginning in September.</P>
      <P>The announcement has caused uproar among school principals, many
of whom have called it a "travesty of education under the disguise of
democracy" and have vowed to maintain their own regulations for what
they called "hygiene and health reasons."</P>
      <P>Citing education laws, the opponents also argued that hairstyles
fall within the school's authority rather than the MOE.</P>

Monday to work on signing a free trade agreement with Taiwan as soon

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang Chairman-elect
Ma Ying-jeou on Tuesday expressed the hope of creating favorable
conditions for the party to be able to return to power in the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks after receiving his election certificate from
Chiu Chuan-huan, chairman of KMT's Central Advisory Committee
Presidium at the party's headquarters. Witnessing the ceremony were
KMT heavyweights Sun Yun-suan, Hau Pei-tsun, Lee Huan and Chiang
Chung-lin.</P>
      <P>Ma said he accepts the certificate with humility and a strong
sense of mission, expressing appreciation to outgoing Chairman Lien
Chan as well as for the support of the party members.</P>
      <P>He vowed to make the nearly 110-year-old party a clean, efficient
and competitive party, with the hope of making the KMT the best
choice for the people.</P>
      <P>Ma also said that his running for party chairman was aimed at
creating favorable conditions for the party to return to power,
adding that the KMT has lost in the last two presidential elections
and that it can't afford another defeat.</P>
      <P>Chiu said that the KMT, after being swept out of power in 2000,
has faced a series of difficulties, expressing the hope that the
party, under Ma's leadership, will be able to rise from defeat and
move on to victory in the 2008 election.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who was defeated by Ma
in the July 16 party chairmanship election, expressed the hope that
the party will be even better and win back power under Ma's
leadership.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, William Lai, a caucus whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , congratulated Ma on his election and
expressed the hope that he will help assuage the rivalry between the
ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Addressing Ma's remarks earlier in the day that the public is "in
misery" under the rule of the DPP and that they are hoping for the
KMT's return to power, Lai said the source of the public's misery is
actually the constant bickering between the ruling and the opposition
parties in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Lai said that because of the inter-party rivalry, such major
bills as the NT$80 billion (US$2.54 billion) flood-control project,
the arms procurement package from the United States and the
confirmation of Control Yuan members have been stalled in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>If Ma continues the boycott mindset of the outgoing KMT Chairman
Lien Chan, it will be just "empty talk" to say that he wants to
relieve the people's misery, Lai said.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the KMT under Ma can engage in
rational discussion so that the review process for the long-stalled
bills in the legislature can be started.</P>

For now, the date for the nationwide referendum

    <HEADLINE>TAOYUAN WATER CRISIS REVIEW FREE OF POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that the
Executive Yuan review of the recent water supply crisis in the
northern county of Taoyuan has been "free of any political
considerations."</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks a day after Vice Minister of Economic
Affairs Yiin Chii-ming said that the review of accountability for the
Taoyuan water problem should not "sacrifice civil servants" for
political reasons. </P>
      <P>The premier said he fully agrees with the view that
administrative accountability reviews should not be influenced by any
political considerations.</P>
      <P>"By the same token, we should not hesitate because of political
considerations to hold someone accountable for any administrative
negligence," he added.</P>
      <P>After Typhoon Matsa lashed Taiwan in early August, bringing
strong winds and torrential rains, the water supply in Taoyuan was
disrupted. The water supply in the northern part of the county was
not fully restored until Aug. 13.</P>
      <P>At one point during the crisis, Hsieh said, he wondered why no
vice minister of economic affairs had come forward to coordinate a
government response. Local news media have speculated that the person
to be held responsible will be Yiin Chii-ming, a senior vice economic
affairs minister responsible for water resources.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Yiin will be held accountable, Hsieh only said that
the name list of officials to be disciplined over the Taoyuan water
crisis will be announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Three senior officials -- Minister of Economic Affairs Ho
Mei-yueh, Water Resources Agency (WRA) Chen Shen-hsien and Taiwan
Water Corp. Chairman Lee Wen-liang -- have offered to resign over the
Taoyuan water problem.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a former WRA official contributed an article to a
local newspaper saying that the water catchment facility atop the
Shihmen Reservoir -- Taoyuan's main water supply source -- may
eventually cause the Shihmen Reservoir to collapse.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the article, Hsieh said a professional assessment
is needed to determine whether their is any validity to the former
WRA official's concerns.</P>
      <P>"Basically, water resources management units see little
possibility for such a scenario. Nevertheless, we should keep
monitoring and take precautionary measures," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He further said some catchment facilities are not for regular use
and will be reserved for emergency use only. "For example, we are
planning to drill wells in preparation for any future droughts or
post-disaster relief," he added.</P>

      <P>A legislator said Tuesday that Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman-elect Ma Ying-jeou is particularly concerned about the
possible impact of the arms procurement package on the cross-Taiwan
Strait situation.</P>
      <P>Lin Yu-Fang, a legislator from the opposition People First Party
(PFP) , who made the remarks in response to a media question, also
said that he paid Ma courtesy call Monday during which he also
briefed the new KMT head on the ramifications of the arms procurement
from the United States.</P>
      <P>The arms procurement package put forward by the Ministry of
National Defense has been stalled for months by the Legislative Yuan
due to opposition by lawmakers of the KMT and the PFP.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry, the items on the procurement list
include eight diesel-powered submarines, six Patriot PAC III
anti-missile batteries and 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.</P>
      <P>During the briefing, Lin said he suggests that Ma pay proper heed
to the five important elements of the arms deal -- the island's
defensive requirements, price, quantity, reciprocity in industry
between the two countries and impact on the cross-strait situation.</P>
      <P>Among the five elements, Ma has special concerns about the
possible influence of the arms deal on the situation in the Strait,
the legislator added.</P>
      <P>He further said that Ma and other political leaders of the
"pan-blue alliance" should set up a working group to come up with a
strategy to deal with the arms procurement issue, although he did not
propose during the meeting that Ma do so.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is also Taipei mayor, will take over his post as the KMT

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is
actively planning an international publicity campaign to raise
support and concern in the international community for Taiwan's bid
to re-enter the United Nations, a spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Michel Lu made the remarks as the U.N. General
Assembly is scheduled to open Sept. 13 in New York.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that President Chen Shui-bian made the case for Taiwan's
U.N. bid in an interview with the United Nations Correspondents
Association (UNCA) in New York via teleconference last September,
which he said has borne fruit.</P>
      <P>Lu didn't respond directly if there will be a similar
teleconference with the UNCA as last year, which was held after
strong obstruction from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lu said Taiwan will adopt a new strategy in promoting its bid to
join the United Nations by presenting two cases for U.N.
participation.</P>
      <P>Under the new strategy, 14 Republic of China allies have put
forward two proposals to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, urging
the U.N. General Assembly to affirm U.N. representation for the 23
million people of Taiwan and requesting that the U.N. play an active
role in safeguarding peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen said recently
that "we have not done enough in our publicity campaigns before, and
this time, we'll have to work harder."</P>
      <P>On the progress of the publicity campaign for the U.N. bid, Lu
only said that related government agencies are now planning the
details.</P>
      <P>He also said that the ministry will engage in good
communications, including letting the international community know
why it has to let Taiwan join the United Nations and why it is unfair
to shut the island out of the body, and will also point out the
importance to the U.N. members of the organization helping to
safeguard peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lu said that the publicity campaign will be conducted through the
channels of ROC missions overseas, international media and the U.N.

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Intrusions and poaching by Chinese fishing
boats and smuggling in waters near Taiwan's Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu
islands remain rampant, although Taiwan has asked the Chinese side to
improve the situation, a spokesman for the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) officials said late Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC official, the council has a good
understanding of the issue and it has requested the Straits Exchange
Foundation to relay its stance to the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait to avoid unnecessary conflict.
However, limited improvements have been made so far, he said.</P>
      <P>Even though the situation is somewhat improved, the root cause
remains, he acknowledged, pointing out that the MAC and the Coast
Guard Administration (CGA) will discuss countermeasures with the
local island authorities to stem illegal activities, such as poaching
and smuggling, arising from the "mini three links" maintained between
Kinmen and Matsu and China.</P>
      <P>Since the direct trade and transport links were set up in January
2001 between Taiwan-held Kinmen and Matsu islands and China's Fujian
ports of Xiamen and Fuzhou, commonly known as the "mini three link, "
more and more Chinese fishing vessels have poached or smuggled in
waters near Taiwan's remote islands, including Matsu, which lies
closer to Fujian than to Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>The "mini three links" were established in part to help put an
end to illegal trade between the two sides, but the situation has
deteriorated and become more complicated since the opening, Matsu
residents said.</P>

the ministry's failure to keep water supplies flowing to residents in

upstream landslides are apparently one of the causes for the water
shortages.</P>

this year's typhoon-related problems.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>It will be difficult for Taiwan to maintain
its expected 3 percent economic growth if the average oil price of
this year exceeds US$60 per barrel, a researcher from the Taiwan
Institute of Economic Research (TIER) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Oil prices hit a high of US$67 per barrel on the international
market recently, with the International Energy Agency cautioning that
an average oil price above the level of US$50 will drag down global
economic growth by 0.8 percent.</P>
      <P>TIER researcher Yang Chia-yen estimated that if the average oil
price registers US$50 per barrel this year, which will represent an
increase of 35 percent over last year, Taiwan's gross domestic
product (GDP) will decrease by NT$15.93 billion (US$499 million) ,
with the economic growth for the year declining from the 3.31 percent
originally estimated by TIER to 3.15 percent.</P>
      <P>Under this situation, the volume of Taiwan's exports will shrink
by NT$8.61 billion this year, a decrease of 0.12 percent over 2004,
while the price of imports will increase by NT$10.64 billion, a
growth of 0.16 percent.</P>
      <P>However, if the average oil price tops US$60 per barrel this
year, an increase of 62 percent over last year, Taiwan's GDP will
decrease by NT$25.17 billion, with economic growth dropping from the
originally expected 3.31 percent to 3.06 percent</P>
      <P>If this happens, the volume of Taiwan's exports will decrease by
NT$13.6 billion, or an annual drop of 0.2 percent, while the price of

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) will
closely monitor China-Russia war games scheduled to start Thursday,
military spokesman Liu Chih-chien said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In his view, Liu said, the maneuvers are a step short of a joint
military exercise because they will not have a common command
platform.</P>
      <P>Judging from the number of troops and high-tech military
equipment to be mobilized by Russia in the drills, Liu said, the
event is mainly aimed at showing off Russia's advanced arsenal.</P>
      <P>The drills are also designed to deepen the two countries' mutual
trust and beef up their abilities to fight terrorism, Liu added.</P>
      <P>The unusual joint exercises will run until Aug. 25, Liu said.
They will be conducted in three stages, including a computerized war
simulation at the Russian port of Vladivostok, anti-terrorist
maneuvers and amphibious landing on China's Jiaodong peninsula.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the U.S. government said Monday it hopes the exercises

to be conducted in a manner that supports some mutual goal of
regional stability shared by the United States, China and Russia."</P>
      <P>McCormack further said the United States will not have any
observers at the war games. "But we would hope that anything that
they do is not something that would be disruptive to the current
atmosphere in the region," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO KIDD-CLASS DESTROYERS EXPECTED TO JOIN NAVY BY YEAR'S END</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two of four Kidd-class destroyers purchased
from the United States are expected to be delivered to Taiwan by the
end of the year, an official of Navy General Headquarters said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Rear Adm. Lee Hao, deputy chief of staff for Combat Readiness and
Training, made the remarks at a press conference held at the Ministry
of National Defense to explain the progress of the four destroyers
purchased at a cost of NT$24 billion in June 2003.</P>
      <P>Lee said that military officers and seed instructors, as well as
repair and maintenance technicians are receiving training in the
United States to prepare for the delivery of the two de-mothballed
destroyers, which are undergoing sea trials and weaponry system
tests.</P>
      <P>The ships are entering the final tactical test and evaluation
stage and are scheduled to undergo SM-2 fire tests in October and
depart from the U.S. in early November.</P>
      <P>The other two destroyers are expected by March 2007.</P>
      <P>Lee said the navy hopes that after the commissioning of the four
destroyers, they will form the outer peripheral of the fleet, while
the navy's Perry-class, Knox-class and Lafayette-class frigates will
play an inner circle role.</P>
      <P>The Kidd-class destroyers will target enemy planes that have
fired missiles, leaving other vessels to deal with the incoming
missiles.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan authorities submitted a shopping list in 2001 that
included top-of-the-line U.S. destroyers of the Arleigh Burke class
equipped with the Aegis radar system, but the Bush administration
later approved the sale of only the much older Kidd-class destroyers.</P>
      <P>The purchase was embroiled in a fierce debate. Opponents of the
purchase included members of the legislature's powerful defense
committee, which made several attempts to block the sale.
Critics cited ships' age -- they were built in the late
1970s -- and their high cost, and suggested that Taiwan should push
the U.S. to release the Aegis system sooner.</P>

      <P>Guatemalan President Ocar Berger Perdomo
said here Tuesday that his government has formally requested help
from the government of Taiwan in investigating an alleged corruption
case involving former Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, Berger disclosed that his
government has gone through diplomatic channels to ask the government
to provide detailed information about three donations it made to the
Guatemalan government in 2000.</P>
      <P>Berger, who is visiting Taiwan to attend the inaugural conference
of the Democratic Pacific Union, said Guatemalan Foreign Minister
Jorge Briz Abularach, who is with Berger on the trip, has delivered a
note from the justice department of Guatemala, asking the government
to specify to whom the three checks were made payable, on what dates
the checks were issued and for what purposes.</P>
      <P>After receiving the information, the justice department of
Guatemala will determine whether it is necessary to prosecute
Portillo, Berger said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan donated three checks totaling US$1.5 million through its
ambassador to Guatemala about five years ago.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese ambassador to Guatemala Francisco Ou acknowledged early
this year that US$500,000 was donated to Guatemala in June 2000 to
print teachers' manuals and that the check was made out to Portillo
personally at the request of the Guatemalan government.</P>
      <P>Ou also said that after the donation, the Guatemalan government
gave several copies of the teachers' manuals to the embassy as proof
that the money had been used properly.</P>
      <P>Portillo, who was Guatemala's president from 2000, fled to Mexico
in February 2004 amid corruption charges against him.</P>
      <P>The public prosecutor's office of Guatemala issued a warrant for
Portillo's arrest in July. He is wanted over the disappearance of
US$15.7 million earmarked for the defense ministry. He has denied all
the allegations, saying that he fled because he could not get a fair
trial in Guatemala.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CARGO LINKS MUST NOT HINDER PASSENGER SERVICES: KMT OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Aug.  16 (CNA)
(By C. Y. Liao and  Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Bilateral talks on Taiwan-China charter
cargo links must not hinder the opening of direct charter passenger
services between the two sides that took place for the Chinese New
Year holiday early this year, a Kuomintang (KMT) official said here
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, the head of the Taiwan's main opposition
party's Central Policy Committee who led a KMT group to clear the way
for negotiations in Beijing on charter airlinks with Chinese civil
aviation officials, made the remarks during a meeting with Chen
Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under the State
Council.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT hopes to help cross-Taiwan Strait cargo flights
take off as soon as possible, Tseng pointed out, however, that the
party does not want to see passenger services affected by the ongoing
cargo talks during the approach of the Sept. 18 Moon Festival -- a
major traditional holiday for Chinese around the world to return home
and get together with their families.</P>
      <P>As long as charter passenger flights are in place, it would help
if some cargo transport could be carried out, Tseng said, suggesting
that China allow Dalian, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou,
Xiamen, Xian and Chengdu to have direct links with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator John Chiang further proposed that the two sides
ply "cross-strait tourist charter flights, " recommending links from
Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chongqing,
Nanjing, Xian, Hainan Island and Urumqi. </P>
      <P>He also called for the opening of point-to-point shipping links
between Taiwan and Shanghai and Shenzhen on the grounds that the two
sides should program their cargo and shipping links as a whole.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, it is very important to have charter
services in place for Taiwan businessmen on the day of the Moon
Festival.</P>
      <P>He claimed this would mark the "very first step" toward the
realization of direct cross-strait charter passenger services for
Taiwan businessmen on weekends and major holidays prior to the
eventual opening of full links. </P>
      <P>In fact, charter flights have operated for two previous Chinese
New Year holidays. The first such cross-strait charter flights were
made with stopovers in Hong Kong or Macau.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the Chinese side only showed willingness to
increase destinations and broaden the service scope beyond Taiwan
businessmen for charter passenger services in the talks, sources
said, adding that Chinese officials decided to discuss the tourist
charter service proposal with Taipei Airlines Association
representatives at a later date.</P>
      <P>The association was appointed again by the Taiwan government as
its proxy to conduct direct charter links with China.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh announced early this month that the Taiwan
government is willing to hold bilateral talks simultaneously on
direct charter passenger flights and cargo service with China amid
repeated calls from the private sector.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's announcement marked a compromise by Taiwan over the
cross-strait direct transport issue, over which Beijing was only
willing to talk about charter passenger flights initially despite
Taiwan's desire to first talk about the cargo links to serve Taiwan
businessmen operating in China.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government's change in attitude on the issue was made
in part out of a consideration to meet potential strong demand for
passenger services due to a planned opening to tourists from China.
The opening is expected to help boost Taiwan's economy and create
many businesses and job opportunities.</P>
      <P>The KMT group, which had no authority from the elected government
to represent Taiwan in the talks with China, is slated to fly back to
Taiwan later the same day after concluding the talks.</P>

      <P>An air-raid drill will be held in central
Taiwan Wednesday as part of the annual Wan-An series of civil
defense exercises, the, Ministry of National Defense announced
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The exercise, code-named Wan An 28, aims to test city and county
governments' abilities to respond to such emergencies as fires,
terrorist attacks and nuclear incidents, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>The air-raid drill will start at 2 p.m. simultaneously in eight
cities and counties in the central part of the island, including
Taichung City, Taichung County, Changhua County, Nantou County,
Miaoli County, Yunlin County and Chiayi County, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>During the drill, all cars and passengers must follow police
directions to take shelter. Trains and mass rapid transit cars will
run as usual, but alighting passengers will have to evacuate to
designated places.</P>
      <P>Freeway traffic will be controlled at all entrances -- only

      <P>As the government prepares to announce the
closure of the case involving the March 19, 2004 shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu, the police
investigation has concluded that Tainan resident Chen Yi-hsiung
remains the main suspect.</P>
      <P>The government still needs to convince the public how it is sure
that Chen killed himself 10 days after committing the crime. The
government will also need to explain how the police are sure about
the gun the suspect used to fire two shots at the president and the
vice president, despite not having found the weapon.</P>
      <P>Chen, 63, was found dead in Anping harbor in Tainan City March
29, 2004.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Prosecutor's Office will make public a 100,000-word
report Wednesday that is divided into two parts, one on forensic
examinations and the other on the criminal investigation, senior
police officers said.</P>
      <P>Investigators claim they were right to have "traced the two
bullets to the (type of) gun that fired them" and then have "traced
the (type of) gun to the man that fired the two shots."</P>
      <P>Chinese American forensic expert Henry Lee, whose expertise the
government has sought to help resolve the case, has pointed out that
the police would have done a more convincing job if they could have
found the gun that they claim Chen used.</P>
      <P>Police probes and interviews have found that Chen was disgruntled
with the nation's politics, so he planned to vent his anger through
the shooting, but then committed suicide for fear of facing the
justice system.</P>
      <P>The so-called "facts and evidence" about his actions appear to
belie the opposition theory that the president staged the shooting
incident in a bid to swing the election results.</P>
      <P>The election-eve shooting has polarized the nation, as the
defeated "pan-blue alliance" candidates filed lawsuits to claim the
vote invalid and opposition lawmakers pushed through a special

    <HEADLINE>KMT URGED NOT TO HURT NATIONAL INTERESTS IN ENGAGEMENTS WITH CPC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) should
exercise prudence and self-restraint in its engagements with the
Communist Party of China (CPC) to avoid hurting Taiwan's national
interests, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman You Ying-lung made the call after outgoing KMT
Chairman Lien Chan announced earlier in the day that the KMT and the
CPC will begin party-to-party cadre exchanges from late August.</P>
      <P>According to Lien, exchange programs between KMT cadres in six
cities, including Keelung, Taichung and Tainan and their CPC
counterparts from six Chinese cities, including Fuzhou, Ningpo and
Xiamen, will be launched in the first stage of KMT-CPC exchanges.
The second stage will include KMT cadres from 10 cities, with the
third-stage extending to Taipei City and Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>In the face of the upcoming exchanges, You said the MAC must
remind the KMT and the general public that the CPC is not a
democratic party.</P>
      <P>"The CPC is a communist totalitarian party that has wielded
one-party despotic rule in China for 56 years, " You said. The CPC
defeated the KMT in a bloody civil war in the late 1940s, forcing the
KMT to flee to Taiwan in 1949.</P>
      <P>Referring to the KMT-CPC exchanges as engagements between
Taiwan's opposition party and the People's Republic of China's
(PRC's) ruling party, You said the KMT should be prudent in dealing
with the CPC, as the PRC remains hostile toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We hope the KMT will put national interests and the people's
well-being above its own partisan interests in its engagements with
the Chinese communists, " You said, adding that the MAC will keep an
eye on the exchanges in light of national interests and legal
provisions.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, William Lai, a legislative whip of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said the exchanges are part of the
KMT's strategy to reclaim power in Taiwan in the 2008 presidential
election and bears no relevance to Taiwan's development.</P>
      <P>"It seems to me that the KMT has forgotten how it lost control of
the Chinese mainland. While forging cooperative ties with the CPC
under its 'Chinese-centered ideology, ' the KMT is believed to
continue its antagonistic strategy toward the DPP administration and
its boycotting of the DPP's policy initiatives at every turn, " Lai
said.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan said Tuesday that the KMT will support an adequate arsenal for
Taiwan as long as the government makes the arms procurement budget
clearer.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks in an apparent attempt to counter President
Chen Shui-bian, who told an Australian daily recently that Lien
opposes everything Chen does due to his being defeated twice by Chen
in presidential elections.</P>
      <P>The government plans to purchase eight diesel-electric
submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries and a squadron
of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the U.S. with a special
military budget of NT$480 billion.</P>
      <P>Lien, who has served as premier and vice president, claimed that
he does not oppose the arms purchase, "evidenced" by his approval of
several missile and submarine procurement plans during his tenure as
premier.</P>
      <P>According to Lien, the "first thing" was when former U.S.
President Bill Clinton was unwilling to agree to the arms sale to
Taiwan during the KMT administration, followed by what he claimed was
the "exaggerated rise" of the special military budget from NT$280
billion to NT$480, with the figure once surging to NT$610.8 billion.</P>
      <P>In addition, the outcome of a referendum on Taiwan's self defense
held along with last year's presidential election vetoed the idea
that Taiwan purchase anti-missile weaponry, Lien claimed.</P>
      <P>In the referendum, the voters were asked whether the government
should acquire more advanced anti-missile weapons and whether the
government should engage in negotiations with China on the
establishment of a peace and stability framework for cross-strait

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
Tuesday it hopes China will honor its promise to start talks with
Taiwan as soon as possible on the opening of charter cargo and
passenger flights across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The MAC made the remarks after Chen Yulin, director of China's

charter cargo and passenger flight talks can be conducted in line
with the formula set forth in the previous "Macau talks" that led to
the opening of 48 direct cross-strait passenger flights during the
Chinese New Year holiday earlier this year for Taiwan businessmen
operating in China -- known locally as "taishang" -- to return for
festival celebrations.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level council, which charts Taiwan's policy toward

      <P>"It would be perfect if MAC officials could be allowed to take
part in the talks. Should that be the case, more topics can be
discussed, " said Fu Dong-cheng, director of the MAC's economic

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT REITERATES WISH TO ATTEND APEC INFORMAL LEADERSHIP SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian told former South
Korean Prime Minister Lee Han-dong Wednesday that he is very much
looking forward to taking part in next month's informal leadership
meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in
Busan, South Korea.</P>
      <P>Chen reiterated his wish while meeting with Lee at the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The president said Taiwan is very grateful to the government of
the Republic of Korea for its "political wisdom and skillful
handling" in pushing for Taiwan's entry into the regional economic
organization in 1991 along with China and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes that the friendly neighbor, the 2005 APEC
meeting host, can continue its support for Taiwan, using the same
political wisdom and skillful handling to make possible his
participation in the APEC summit, an occasion which Taiwan's head of
state has been absent from in previous years due to China's
opposition.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the president also expressed his hope for the
resumption of Taiwan-South Korea ministerial meetings on trade and
economic affairs, and that the two countries can work in an active
manner for the formation of a Taiwan-South Korean free trade
agreement.</P>
      <P>Chen also told his visitor that the two countries have maintained
close and friendly relations in recent years, referring to the
resumption of direct Taiwan-South Korean flight services and the
exchange of visa-free privileges.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also opened a representative office in Busan in January, a
move that marks the restoration of the friendship between the two
countries after it was damaged in 1992 when Seoul severed its
diplomatic ties with Taipei to establish formal relations with
Beijing, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>He also indicated that bilateral trade between Taiwan and South
Korea reached a historic high of US$16.9 billion last year, with
South Korea registering a trade surplus of US$6.3 billion. The figure
was the second largest in terms of Taiwan's foreign trade deficits.</P>
      <P>The number of people in the two countries traveling to the other
side also surged to a record high of 45,000 last year, with 32,000 of
that total being Taiwan visitors to South Korea, Chen said.</P>

Su Tseng-chang on Wednesday appealed to the new chairman of the
Kuomintang (KMT) to lead Taiwan's major opposition party to engage in
"constructive competition" with the ruling DPP.</P>
      <P>Su expressed his keen expectation that Taipei City Mayor Ma

his new post Friday -- will have new vision to lead the KMT to become
a strong and helpful opposition party which will help pass
legislation beneficial to the people's wellbeing.</P>

with the ruling DPP rather than resuming "unnecessary boycotts and
political fighting with the DPP."</P>
      <P>Ma won a landslide victory in the KMT chairmanship election July

sacrifices of the party members and other people in Taiwan, we have

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT RESPECTS RESULTS OF ELECTION-EVE SHOOTING PROBE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday he
respects the results of the probe into last year's election-eve
shooting of him and Vice President Annette Lu, an incident that
injured Chen and Lu only slightly but triggered months of political
upheaval.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after the State Public Prosecutor-General's
Office announced earlier in the day the close of the investigation.</P>
      <P>Noting that the investigation panel has devoted a great deal of
manpower and resources to investigate the case, Chen said all the
investigators have done their utmost.</P>
      <P>"I respect the investigative results and I'm hopeful that all
social quarters can likewise respect the results, which have been
achieved through professional, objective and independent inquiries, "
Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president also expressed his gratitude to all the
investigators for their efforts.</P>
      <P>Lu also expressed her admiration for the investigators' work on
the case.</P>
      <P>"There is only one truth. We must have clear and solid evidence
to convince others about the investigative results. I cannot make any
comments until after I read the complete investigative report, " Lu
added.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, State Public Prosecutor-General Wu
Ying-chao confirmed investigators' findings that Chen Yi-hsiung, a
50-something outspoken supporter of the opposition "pan-blue
alliance," was the most likely suspect in the election-eve shooting.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-hsiung died shortly after the March 19, 2004 shooting in
an apparent suicide. According to the investigators, he targeted the
president and vice president because of unhappiness over the nation's
economic situation.</P>
      <P>Chen and Lu were riding in an open-top Jeep when they were shot
while campaigning in the southern city of Tainan. A bullet grazed
Chen's stomach and Lu was hit in the knee.</P>
      <P>The next day, Chen defeated his presidential opponent, opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, by a razor-thin margin.</P>
      <P>Lien and his running mate, People First Party Chairman James
Soong, contested the electoral results, claiming the shooting was
rigged to gain sympathy votes and boost Chen's re-election bid.</P>
      <P>A vote recount confirmed Chen's narrow victory, and the courts
ruled the election valid.</P>
      <P>The presidential election was followed by a week of protests that
sometimes turned violent, but since legislative elections last
December, political tensions have subsided.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPIDEMICS COULD JEOPARDIZE NATIONAL SECURITY: EXPERT</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major epidemics in Taiwan could result in
repercussions affecting the country's national security, a professor
from Central Police University said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Professor Chang Chung-yung of the Central Police University's
Public Security Department said that should major epidemic diseases,
such as bird flu, occur in a country, the fallout would directly
affect national security and have a tremendous impact on the
economic, social and political aspects.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks when he spoke at a colloquium titled
"Prevention of Large-scale Epidemic Diseases and Countermeasures"
sponsored by the Foundation on International &amp; Cross-Strait Studies.</P>
      <P>He quoted the World Bank as estimating that economically,
countries seriously affected by AIDS tend to suffer a 1 percent
decline in gross domestic product (GDP) , while malaria-affected
countries can witness a decline of 2 percent in GDP, in addition to
decreases in revenues from tourism and foreign investment.</P>
      <P>From the social point of view, he said, major epidemics result in
heavy fatalities, plummeting of the labor force, the creation of many
orphans, a much heavier burden on the national coffers, an increase
of single-parent families and the collapse of core family values.</P>
      <P>On the political aspect, he added, governmental hierarchy
reshuffles might occur often and political unrest will easily occur,
particularly in developing countries as a result of competition for
limited resources.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that major epidemics could also be used by global
terrorist organizations and hostile countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUSPECT'S SON: FATHER NOT INVOLVED IN 319 SHOOTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,  Aug.  17 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The second son of Chen Yi-hsiung, who
police say is the only suspect in the election-eve shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu, denied
Wednesday that his father was the would-be assassin.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-chou made the statement after the Supreme Prosecutor's
Office announced the close of the investigation into the March 19,
2004 shooting of the president and the vice president, invoking a new
wave of media interest in the case.</P>
      <P>"No direct evidence points to my father as a suspect, so in my
mind, my father absolutely was not involved, " he told the media.</P>
      <P>He said the police have not found the gun they claim his father
used to fire two shots at the president and vice president,
questioned why the government was announcing an end to the
investigation and said his family refused to accept the results.</P>
      <P>He admitted that he did not know what his father meant in his
will when he wrote: "What I have done, I myself will handle." Police
have used the statement as indirect proof of his father having
planned and executed the attempted assassination.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-hsiung, 63, was found drowned in Anping harbor in Tainan
City 10 days after the shooting, in an apparent suicide.</P>
      <P>When his wife was asked Wednesday if she was being coerced by the
authorities when she made an apology to society for her husband's
alleged act, she did not respond.</P>
      <P>The investigative team's final report, released earlier in the
day, said that after Chen's death, the bereaved family tried to cover
up everything that might indicate Chen's involvement in the incident.</P>
      <P>The report quoted Chen's wife as telling police that he acted in
a strange manner in the days after the shooting, such as altering his
hair style and destroying a jacket.</P>
      <P>This, according to the report, led investigators to conclude that
the two actions were Chen's way of "hinting to his family that he had
committed the crime."</P>
      <P>Other pieces of evidence that the investigative team cited to
substantiate its charges include a family meeting in which they
decided not to mention Chen's involvement in the shooting, to
incinerate Chen's body instead of burying it for fear the police
might in the future re-open the coffin to gather further forensic
evidence. The family members were apparently also heard reminding one
another over the phone not to leave any possible evidence behind.</P>
      <P>"These indicate that even Chen's own family members believe he
was the man who fired the shots," said the report.</P>
      <P>Chu Chao-liang, Tainan District chief prosecutor, admitted that
the team has no direct evidence but claimed that forensic
examinations and testimonies by family members all point to Chen
Yi-hsiung as the sole suspect.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROSECUTORS CLOSE ELECTION-EVE SHOOTING PROBE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>State Public Prosecutor-General Wu
Ying-chao on Wednesday announced the closure of the investigation
into the election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu last year.</P>
      <P>Wu announced the close of the high-profile case after nearly 17
months at a press conference at the Judicial Yuan.
Accompanying him were the key members of the ad hoc investigation
team, including Kuo Jen-ni, chief prosecutor in Tainan, Hou Yu-ih,
commissioner of the Criminal Investigation Bureau and forensic
expert Shih Tai-ping.</P>
      <P>The shooting was generally believed to have polarized Taiwan
society, with opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, Chen's
defeated election rival, filing two separate suits to challenge the
result of the election and seek a new election.</P>
      <P>Wu expressed the hope that the closure of the case will help
assuage the misgivings and upheaval in society so that social harmony
and tranquility can return.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors turned over a 300-page report on the case,
listing Chen Yi-hsiung as the only suspect, with no other accomplices
in the case. Chen died 10 days after the March 19, 2004 shooting in
an apparent suicide.</P>
      <P>The report said that Chen, 63, obtained a remodeled gun and
bullets via his brother-in-law from a criminal ring led by Tang
Shou-yi, the maker of two bullets used in the shooting. The gun has
not been found.
</P>
      <P>The report cited five reasons for identifying Chen as the sole
suspect, including that his image appeared in the "hot zone, " where
the perpetrator of the shooting was most likely to have fired the
shots when the president and vice president were campaigning in an
open-topped jeep in Tainan, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen also had motive, according to the investigators. He is
alleged to have been venting his resentment over the political
situation and to have committed suicide by drowning in the Anping
fishing harbor in Tainan on March 29. His family claim to have burned
an alleged suicide note he supposedly left behind.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the shooting was not staged by the
president with the intention of winning sympathy votes in the
bitterly contested election, one of the opposition's claims.</P>
      <P>The report also specifically rules out the possibility of the
president's wound having been faked by security or hospital staff.</P>
      <P>It is impossible for President Chen to stage a gunshot wound in
other places. It is also unlikely for security personnel in the
same vehicle to have fired shots at close range at the president
during the motorcade parade, or that Chen's wound was created by
hospital staff, the report said.</P>
      <P>The president's injury to his abdomen was a fresh gunshot wound,
the report also said.</P>
      <P>The State Public Prosecutor General's Office solicited the
assistance of internationally renowned forensic expert Henry Lee, who
was invited by then-State Public Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa to help
the investigation.</P>
      <P>U.S.-based Lee led a group of experts to Taiwan in April 2004 and
worked with the ad hoc investigation team examining the president's
wounds and reconstructing the crime scene as best he could.</P>
      <P>Lee unveiled his report in late August 2004, confirming that the
wound suffered by the president to his abdomen was caused by a bullet
and that the bullets retrieved were not fired from a regular handgun
but from a remodeled replica.</P>
      <P>His report concluded that the two bullets retrieved at the
shooting scene were fired either from the same gun or from two guns
with barrels cut from the same piece of tubing.</P>
      <P>From the suspect's military record, he could have possessed the
shooting ability.</P>
      <P>The suspect was said to have a simple lifestyle with a small
coterie of friends. He had no extraordinary communications after the
shooting and there was no abnormal capital flow or remittance after
the shooting, which the report claims is an indication that there was
no ring behind Chen's shooting and that he was the lone shooter.</P>

      <P>State Public Prosecutor-General Wu
Ying-chao said Wednesday that he regrets not being able to find the
handgun used in the election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian
and Vice President Annette Lu last year.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks after announcing earlier in the day the
closure of the controversial case after a nearly 17-month probe
concluding that President Chen Shui-bian did not stage the shooting
-- as claimed by the opposition -- to gain the advantage in the
bitterly contested election and that key suspect Chen Yi-hsiung was
the sole perpetrator of the shooting.</P>
      <P>"We can say that we have not let the public down after the case
comes to a close, " Wu said, expressing the hope that "there will be
continued efforts to find the gun so that the case can be ended
perfectly."</P>
      <P>The closure of the investigation into the March 19, 2004 shooting
was the first major criminal case to be closed since he assumed his
post last September, Wu said.</P>
      <P>He noted that there will be an anti-graft campaign during the
year-end city and county chief elections and a crackdown on
gangsters, especially criminals from China who commit crimes in
Taiwan, which he said are waiting to be solved.</P>
      <P>Wu was positive about the work done by the investigators,
including the ad hoc investigation group and internationally renowned
forensic expert Henry Lee, claiming that they have "answered in
detail" all the public misgivings and that all "unfounded
speculation" can be put to rest.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION REFUSES TO ACCEPT CLOSE OF 319 SHOOTING PROBE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug 17 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of the two major
opposition parties Wednesday rejected the decision by the State
Public Prosecutor General's Office to close the investigation into
the March 19, 2004 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>At a news conference held in the Legislative Yuan, the caucuses
of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) vowed to
form another "investigation commission" to pursue the case.</P>
      <P>Cho Po-yuan, a KMT caucus whip, noted that the decision of the
Prosecutor General's Office was announced on the day outgoing KMT
Chairman Lien Chan presided over his last KMT Central Standing
Committee meeting and suggested that this was intentional.</P>
      <P>Cho claimed that "political forces" have "clearly intervened" in
the investigation process of the 319 shooting and that the decision
of the Prosecutor General's Office to close the case is apparently a
political one because there is no direct evidence to prove that the
sole suspect, suicide victim Lin Yi-hsiung, was involved in the
shooting.</P>
      <P>"A dead man cannot defend himself. There is neither a murder
weapon nor a confession from the suspect. If the case is closed like
this, the nation's criminal law can be rewritten, " Cho said,
describing the decision as "ridiculous, flippant and irresponsible."</P>
      <P>PFP legislative whip Huang Yi-chao claimed that the general
public are not convinced by the conclusion and that the truth about
the case will only come out if the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT,
the PFP and the New Party win power in the 2008 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on the ending of the case at a separate occasion,
Chao Yung-ching, legislative caucus convener of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), praised the work of the police and the
prosecutors in pursuing the case over the past 17 months.</P>
      <P>He said the DPP legislative caucus supports an amendment to the
relevant law to allow the formation of an investigation commission
that would allow participation by opposition parties.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue" opposition parties, which hold a slight majority
in the legislature, established an investigation commission in August
last year to conduct its own probe into the shooting, but DPP
legislators refused to join them as the commission was
"unconstitutional".</P>
      <P>The shooting occurred the day before the 2004 presidential
election when Chen and Lu were shot while campaigning in a jeep in
Tainan. The opposition believes the incident generated sympathy votes
for Chen and Lu and helped them to win the election by a mere 29,500
votes.</P>
      <P>The "truth commission" formed by the opposition parties claims
that the incident was staged and the wounds "self-inflicted" in order
to influence the election, but the claims were dismissed by
internationally reknowned U.S. forensics expert Henry Lee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARMS PACKAGE TO BE PARTIALLY FINANCED BY REGULAR MILITARY BUDGET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The controversial U.S. arms procurement
package can be partly funded from the government's regular budget
instead of from appropriations from a special budget, the Cabinet
decided Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet passed a draft budget plan for next year that
included NT$7 billion for the special arms procurement project.</P>
      <P>Of that amount, NT$350 million will be contributed by the Cabinet
and the remaining will be from the Ministry of National Defense's
regular budget.</P>
      <P>As a result, the nation's overall defense spending for 2006 will
be NT$253.8 billion, a NT$4.1 billion increase from the 2005 level
and accounting for 15.9 percent of the government's total annual
expenditure.</P>
      <P>The special arms procurement project refers to a plan to purchase
eight diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the
United States. The package will call for an outlay of NT$480 billion.
The government originally planned to finance it with a special budget
plan to span a period of 15 years.</P>
      <P>The bill has been held up in the legislature because of
opposition parties' feeling that the cost of the weaponry is too
expensive and that any payments ought not come from a special budget.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet approved the government's 2006 budget plan at its
weekly meeting earlier in the day, which projects annual total
revenues to be NT$1.4 trillion and annual expenditures of NT$1.6
trillion.</P>
      <P>"The budgetary gap is less than in 2005, " a budget planning
official said, adding that in addition to using its previous budget
surplus, the government will have to float NT$239 billion in state
bonds, or 14.8 percent of its total spending, to make ends meet.</P>
      <P>Compared with the 2005 budget plan, 2006 government expenditures
will mark a 0.5 percent decrease.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the weekly Cabinet meeting, Premier Frank Hsieh said
that although the government's budget will not increase next year,
the Cabinet has adjusted its spending structure in line with its
overall national development plans.</P>
      <P>In the 2006 budget plan, Hsieh said, disbursements related to the
upgrading of national competitiveness and industrial technological
development will grow substantially, and spending on the upgrading of
living quality and public safety, including physical education,
health care, community services, fighting crime and ethnic diversity,
will also increase.</P>
      <P>"Our 2006 budget plan has given balanced emphasis on economic
development, social justice, environmental protection and cultural
renaissance," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>According to the Cabinet-drafted budget bill, NT$84.3 billion
will be appropriated for technological development projects, marking
all-time-high growth of 19.7 percent from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>NT$11.5 billion will be earmarked for a "six-star" community
development project, marking 14.2 percent in annual growth; the
spending for fighting crime will surge 6.5 percent; expenditures for
welfare services for minority ethnic groups will post a 10.8 percent
rise.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the budget for the National Council on Physical
Fitness and Sports will register a whopping 82 percent growth to
reach NT$4.9 billion and the National Youth Commission's budget will
increase to NT$520 million, up 19.2 percent.</P>
      <P>By category, spending on education, science, technology and
culture will account for the largest share of the government's 2006
expenditures, making up 22 percent of the total; social welfare
spending will account for 18.5 percent of the total; and spending on
economic development projects will make up 12.8 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP HEAD TO RETURN HOME NEXT WEEK, MEET KMT LEADERS: AIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong will meet outgoing opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan as soon as he returns to Taiwan next week from the
United States, PFP Policy Research Center Director Chang Hsien-yao
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Soong will also meet with KMT Chairman-elect Ma Ying-jeou and
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng to exchange opinions on a
major arms procurement bill that has been held up by the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan during the last two sessions,
Chang said.</P>
      <P>He added that Soong is also expected to discuss issues
surrounding the city and county chief elections in December with Ma,
who will take over the KMT's helm from Lien Friday to become the main
opposition party chairman.</P>
      <P>Following these meetings, the PFP head will immediately start a
tour to campaign for PFP candidates in nine constituencies, including
Keelung city, Taichung city, Changhua county, Chiayi city, Lienchiang
county, Miaoli county and Hsinchu county for the year-end elections,
he added.</P>
      <P>Cooperation is imperative among the KMT, the PFP and the New
Party -- the "pan blue alliance" -- to score victories in the coming
local elections, which are widely seen as a major gauge of the
opposition alliance's chances in the 2008 presidential election
against the "pan green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU).</P>
      <P>However, it remains unclear whether the three parties will
collaborate in the December elections to lay a sound foundation for
bilateral cooperation in the next presidential election.</P>
      <P>Huang Pan-gung, head of the PFP's Organization Affairs
Department, said last Sunday that the KMT, as the largest opposition
party, should allow the PFP to run on its own in five or six out of
the country's total 23 cities and counties -- a "one-fourth clause"
put forward by Huang in proportion to the number of legislative seats
held by the two parties.</P>
      <P>If the KMT is willing to do this, it would help the "pan blue
alliance" expand its voter base in order to gain an advantage in the
2008 presidential election, PFP aides said, stressing that the PFP
candidate for Keelung mayor, Liu Wen-hsiung, and Changhua county
magistrate candidate Hsieh Chang-chieh, are charismatic competitors
capable of swaying voters to win over aspirants fielded by the "pan
green camp."</P>
      <P>Should the KMT and the PFP be able to implement a "coalition
rule" in local governments, it would help lead to a further
consolidation between the two parties ahead of the 2008 presidential
race, PFP aides said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION'S  ENGAGEMENT WITH CHINA WILL AFFECT DIPLOMATIC WORK: FM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen said
Wednesday that engagement with China by the opposition parties will
affect the nation's diplomatic work.</P>
      <P> Chen made the remarks during an interview with CNA in which he
said Beijing has been soliciting engagement with Taiwan opposition
parties ever since its March 14 enactment of the Anti-Secession Law,
which codifies the use of "non-peaceful means" against Taiwan should
the island move toward formal independence.</P>
      <P>Since then, the leaders of the two main opposition parties -- the
Kuomintang and the People First Party -- have visited China in April
and May, respectively, followed by visits by delegations from both
parties.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the Republic of China is a sovereign state, which
is why it has a Ministry of Foreign Affairs, adding that diplomacy
has sovereignty significance connotations.</P>
      <P>He complained that he is barred from visiting many other counties
because of their "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the ROC currently has 26 diplomatic allies
and that if the opposition parties continue to engage with China,
others might think the opposition parties "are not taking the
sovereignty issue seriously."</P>
      <P>If that is the impression given, it could "undermine the nation's
relations with its allies," as the approach of the opposition parties
is contradictory to the perception of the country's allies that
"Taiwan is a sovereign state."</P>
      <P>Even if this does not affect diplomatic work, the ruling and
opposition parties should be as of one mind in terms of the nation's
diplomatic policy, he said.</P>
      <P>If there is no uniform diplomatic policy, "then it will be easily 
divided by others," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said the people of Taiwan need to stand firm in their belief
and act in unison, and that national interests should take precedence
over partisan interests.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SEEKS SWISS SUPPORT FOR TAIWAN'S WHO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian appealed to
Switzerland Wednesday to support Taiwan's bid to join the World
Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer.</P>
      <P>Taking the advantage of a meeting at his office with visiting
Switzerland Federal Assembly Speaker Bruno Frick, the president said
Bern should opt for abstention rather than vote against Taiwan's bid
as it did last year at the WHA, which is the governing body of the
World Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Just as pandemics know no boundaries, the WHO's battle against
disease should not be limited by political boundaries by excluding a
country like Taiwan, that is why the European Parliament has
repeatedly voiced its support for Taiwan's inclusion in the WHA, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>As a state of Europe, it is regrettable that Switzerland flew in
the face of the European Parliament's decision by voting against
Taiwan last year.</P>
      <P>The president also urged Frick to help Taiwan rename its
representative office in Bern, saying it has run into problems. The
president didn't elaborate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SIX MAINLANDERS ARRESTED AMONG LOCALS RUNNING ILLEGAL BETTING STATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Changhua  County, central  Taiwan  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 23 members of an
illegal ring arrested Tuesday night for running a betting station for
an online gambling site include six Chinese nationals who entered
Taiwan on student visas, a spokesman for Changhua County police said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that police precincts in central Taiwan
dispatched 11 teams of detectives to search suspected locations in
Taichung City and Chunghua County. They arrested three ringleaders
and 20 members of the ring, including the six Chinese nationals who
were in charge of maintenance and service of the computers and
gambling equipment of the betting station.</P>
      <P>Shih Chia-chin, one of the ringleaders, told the police that the
gambling Web site is located in China, and that the betting station
in Taiwan was only taking bets from gamblers.</P>
      <P>Customers could bet on a wide variety of games, including China's
soccer matches, the lotteries in Hong Kong and Taiwan, baccarat,
bingo, the underground Hong Kong Mark Six Lottery, and America's
professional baseball games.</P>
      <P>The betting station has been in operation for about four months,
with its weekly turnover reaching NT$100 million, according to the
police spokesman.</P>
      <P>He said police believe that the six Chinese nationals were
training on the betting station so that they could eventually go back
to China to open similar betting stations.</P>
      <P>All 23 suspects were referred to the Changhua District Attorney's
Office on charges of gambling and money laundering. The six
mainlanders will face an additional charge of violating the
regulations governing the relationship between the people on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN'S GRANTING OF VISA-FREE TREATMENT PRIDE OF TAIWAN PEOPLE: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
said Wednesday that Japan's granting permanent visa-free treatment
for Taiwan tourists is the "pride of the 23 million people on Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks when he was interviewed by CNA, noting that
it was a major breakthrough in Taiwan-Japan relations.</P>
      <P>Chen said that if both countries have diplomatic relations, then
it will be a small thing to waive visa requirements, adding that
Japan has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but it is allowing
visa-free treatment, while Japan has diplomatic relations with China,
but it is denying the same privilege to China.</P>
      <P>"Judging from this, one can clearly see that the standard of a
nation and its performance in various aspects are the basis of the
nation's diplomatic works," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He noted that if a country has failed to live up to the standard,
and that its nationals are overstaying their visas, then they will be
despised by the visiting countries and unable to obtain the same
preferential visa treatment, indirectly referring to China.
The Japanese House of Councilors, or upper house of the Japanese
Diet, revised a bill earlier this month to allow the permanent waiver
of the visa requirement for Taiwan tourists.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwan has been pushing for visa-free treatment
for years, and that Taiwan originally worried that the latest round
of Taiwan-Japanese fishery talks last month could derail the matter.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that even though neither side has made headway in
the past fishery talks, the government has insisted on maintaining
the nation's sovereignty, although it worried that disagreements in
the talks might affect the lifting of the visa requirement. Japan's
new move will be put into practice Sept. 26, or the day after the
closing of Expo 2005 Aichi in central Japan.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, the Japanese parliament passed a special bill
to grant 90-day, visa-free entry to Taiwan visitors from March 25
through Sept. 25 in connection with the Aichi expo.</P>
      <P>With the temporary visa waiver period soon to expire, Japanese
parliamentarians decided to pass a new bill to allow for permanent
visa-free status for Taiwan citizens.</P>
      <P>The move will boost Taiwan tourist arrivals to Japan from the
current figure of just over one million per year to between 1.3
million and 1.4 million per year. Taiwan is Japan's second-largest
source of foreign tourists after South Korea.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US TRADE COUNCIL OPPOSES CHINA'S PLOT TO UNDERMINE DPP ADMINISTRATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's attempts to use trade as a
mechanism for undermining Taiwan's Democratic Progressive
Party administration is hampering further liberalization and progress
towards the normalization of cross-strait trade relations, the
US-Taiwan Business Council warned recently.</P>
      <P>In an statement about China's recent detente with Taiwan's two
opposition parties, Kuomintang and People First Party, the council's
President Rupert Hammond-Chambers expressed concern that any process
to undermine Chen Shui-bian administration's authority over trade
negotiations will result in a political backlash in Taiwan that will
slow or even halt incremental trade liberalization across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Hammond-Chambers said his council welcomes dialogue between China
and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, he noted that the unilateral announcement
by the Chinese government that it will offer tariff-free treatment to
certain agricultural products from Taiwan, following the China visits
by several Taiwan opposition leaders, is aimed at luring away
President Chen Shui-bian's supporters, such as fruit farmers in
southern Taiwan, and planting the seeds of doubt about the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) ability to handle cross-Taiwan
Strait trade.</P>
      <P>While the council welcomes dialogue between China and Taiwan, it
is clear that these initiatives are designed to undermine the
position of Chen and the DPP, the statement said.</P>
      <P>"If the DPP is to proceed with further liberalization in areas
such as chip packaging and testing as well as 0.18-micron chip
manufacturing, it will require a level of control over the process,"
it said.</P>
      <P>According to Hammond-Chambers, the Chen administration has become
more cautious with regard to economic interactions with China, and
will pursue policies to address the seemingly incremental erosion of
its authority over cross-strait trade matters.</P>
      <P>"The U.S.-Taiwan Business Council believes that normalized trade
across the Taiwan Strait will result in reductions in cross-strait
political tension, increased efficiencies for Taiwan companies, and
therefore price, quality, and time of delivery improvements for the
myriad of U.S. companies that participate in the integrated
technology supply chain that links the U.S., Taiwan and China, "
Hammond-Chambers said.</P>
      <P>"In addition, economic integration should also contribute greatly
to bridging the political gap that remains between the two, and offer
positive momentum to a relationship that has undergone an extended
period of strain," he added.</P>
      <P>The U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, which comprises a large network
of companies involved in business between Taiwan and the United
States, gives members access to people and information to help them
succeed in their Taiwan endeavors.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Israeli Troops Persuade,
and Force, Settlers to Leave

Israeli soldiers moved into the Jewish settlements in larger
numbers this morning, persuaded some reluctant residents to leave
their homes voluntarily, and forced out others. There were no signs
of serious violence, and it seemed that many residents were coming to
terms with the pullout. Some 14,000 troops entered five Jewish
settlements: Neve Dekalim, Morag, Bedolah, Ganei Tal and Tel Katifa.
Security officials said the goal was to clear out the 21 Gaza
settlements in just a few days. Since Monday it has been illegal for
Israeli civilians to be here, and Tuesday was the last day they could
leave on their own, with belongings.

Wall Street Journal: War Wounds, Breaking a Taboo, Army Confronts
Guilt after Combat

Not long ago Maj. Peter Kilner posted on an Army-sponsored Web
site a short essay he had written on the morality of killing in
combat. Maj. Kilner's writings -- which encourage officers to talk to
their troops about the morality of killing in combat and the guilt
that often comes with taking another's life -- have begun gathering a
wide audience. Maj. Kilner is pushing America's current crop of Army
officers to help their soldiers confront the morality of killing on a
personal level. Failure to address these issues in training, Maj.
Kilner argues, can sometimes disable soldiers in combat, and leave
them more prone to psychological traumas after the battle is
finished. There is no established program or training for commanders
who want to talk with their soldiers about killing and its aftermath,
leaving soldiers and commanders to cobble together their own
solutions.</TEXT>

five directions.</P>
      <P>First, he explained, is to seek the support of foreign political

    <HEADLINE>ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW AIMS TO IMPROVE WATER MANAGEMENT: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday the
Cabinet's review of accountability for the recent water supply
shortfalls in the northern county of Taoyuan is mainly aimed at
improving water resources management rather than at faulting anyone.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks after a Cabinet meeting during which he
announced disciplinary measures for a shortlist of officials who are
being held responsible for the Taoyuan water problems.</P>
      <P>The premier said although Minister of Economic Affairs Ho
Mei-yueh, Water Resources Agency (WRA) Director Chen Shen-hsien and
Taiwan Water Corp. (TWC) Chairman Lee Wen-liang all tendered written
resignations, a crucial problem worthy of review is that the Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA) lacks a vice minister versed in hydraulic
power issues.</P>
      <P>After Typhoon Matsa lashed Taiwan in early August bringing strong
winds and torrential rains, the water supply in Taoyuan was disrupted
because of the high turbidity in the Shihmen Reservoir -- the
county's main water source. The water supply in the northern part of
the county was not fully restored until Aug. 13.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he has approved TWC Corp. Chairman Lee's resignation,
but he asked Lee not to leave the post until after a broken main at
the Nanhua Dam in the southern county of Tainan is repaired.</P>
      <P>Lee assumed his current post late last year. Hsieh acknowledged
that some of the flawed Shihmen Reservoir catchment and purification
facilities were designed before Lee took the TWC helm. "But as a
political appointee, Lee has to take the blame. He has to set an
example for all politically appointed officials," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh said he wants WRA Director Chen Shen-hsien to
remain at the post because the MOEA needs his professional expertise
in carrying out many new flood-control programs around the country.</P>
      <P>"Chen is a civil servant. Unless he commits a crime, he need not
leave public service. We can only adjust his official duties. As the
Legislative Yuan will soon screen a special flood-prevention statute,
the WRA has become very important. If Chen leaves now, it might
hinder implementation of some flood-control projects," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that none of the three sitting vice economic affairs
ministers are familiar with water problems, Hsieh said their jobs
might have to be adjusted.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the economics ministry needs a water resources expert
to serve as its vice minister to assist in addressing water
management problems.</P>
      <P>At present, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin
Chii-ming serves as convener of the ministry's water resources
screening committee and water resources coordination committee.</P>
      <P>"Even though Yiin is a senior civil servant, we cannot ask him to
resign. He has not offered to resign. But I think his official duties
should be adjusted. We'll make an appropriate adjustment in the near
future," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The premier already rejected Minister Ho's resignation a few days
ago.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's high-speed rail is scheduled to

beginning with 120 kph from Aug. 23. The train speed will be

200 kph in late August or early September.</P>
      <P>He said that according to the ministry's standard, the train will
have to run at 200 kph while being operated by the rail system,
instead by a human driver. If everything goes smoothly, the Taiwan
High-Speed Railway Corp. will be able to announce before Sept. 10 the

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-CHINA TALKS ON CHARTER LINKS LIKELY: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan-China talks on cross-Taiwan Strait
direct charter links seems likely to happen, judging from the current
developments, and the government will try its best to safeguard
national interests by making a detailed proposal to the Chinese side,
a ranking Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC official, the government will put forward a
well-crafted proposal covering comprehensive and concrete details
regarding destinations, routes and passenger capacities to help
crystallize both the charter cargo and passenger flights across the
Strait.</P>
      <P>The MAC has commissioned the Taipei Airlines Association to make
necessary arrangements with its Chinese counterpart and bilateral
talks should open as soon as possible based on the model set earlier
this year when the two sides held talks on Chinese New Year holiday
charter flights -- the first direct cross-strait flights that were
operated in the form of "non-stop, round trip" by Taiwanese and
Chinese airlines, the official said.</P>
      <P>The MAC is determined to gain maximum benefits for the country
and the people of Taiwan in the negotiations, he stressed, although
he also admitted that talks on regular charter services are much more
complicated than the talks on Chinese New Year holiday charter
flights.</P>
      <P>"We will be waiting for a concrete timetable for the talks to be
worked out, " he said, expressing the hope that the MAC can offer
more to help broaden two-way participation in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, members of a main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) group
told a news conference after returning from a trip to Beijing earlier
the same day that China is willing to negotiate direct charter cargo
and passenger links with Taiwan for mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>KMT Central Policy Committee Director Tseng Yung-chuan, who led
the group to help arrange the talks with Chinese civil aviation
officials Tuesday in Beijing, said that China has agreed to hold
talks simultaneously on direct charter links for cargo and passenger
transport with Taiwan to launch the two services at the same time.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, the Chinese side has authorized the
Cross-Straits Shipping Exchange Association to have technical talks
regarding the issue with the Taipei Airlines Association -- a civil
group appointed by the government on Taiwan to serve that purpose in
the absence of government-to government contacts between Taiwan and
China.</P>
      <P>The Chinese side also agreed to increase destinations and broaden
the service scope for charter passenger flights and made it clear
again that it stands firm on its pledge to allow Taiwan-based
airlines to fly over its skies en route to Europe, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator John Chiang, who advocates "cross-strait tourist
charter flights," pointed out that Chen Yunlin, Taiwan Affairs Office
director under the Beijing-based State Council, also agreed to talk
over the issue in the next round of negotiations.</P>
      <P>Chiang is high optimistic about the prospects of the
"cross-strait tourist charter flights, " claiming that business will
be brisk as people on the two sides exchange at least 3.5 million
visits each year and suggested links from Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai,
Dalian, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chongqing, Xian, Urumqi and Hainan
Island to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The KMT keenly hopes to help push for regular cargo and passenger
charter flights to serve all the Taiwan people, not just businessmen
operating in China, party spokesman Chang Jung-kung said.</P>
      <P>The KMT group, which had no authority from the government to get
involved in the charter service talks, flew to Beijing Monday and
returned early this morning.</P>

    <HEADLINE>V.P. URGES U.S. TO PERSUADE JAPAN TO ADOPT A 'TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President
Annette Lu has urged the United States to encourage Japan to adopt a
law similar to the U.S. Taiwan Relations Act to facilitate efforts in
handling relations between Japan and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the U.S. quarterly Foreign Policy, Lu said
that it would be "most helpful" if the United States could encourage
Japan to pass a law like the Taiwan Relations Act to regulate the
relationship between Japan and Taiwan even in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Lu said that thanks to the Taiwan Relations Act signed into law
by U.S. President Jimmy Carter in 1979, the substantial relationship
between the United States and Taiwan has been sustained. "Currently
the parliament in Canada is debating such a bill. So it is time to
encourage Japan to adopt such a formula," she added.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Relations Act is the bedrock of relations between
Taiwan and the United States. The U.S. law stipulates clearly that
differences across the Taiwan Strait must be resolved peacefully.</P>
      <P>Following are excerpts of other questions that Foreign Policy
asked Lu during the interview, which is carried in the quarterly's
latest issue.</P>
      <P>FP: Is there a difference between what you think should happen
and what will happen with cross-strait relations with China in the
coming years?</P>
      <P>Lu: The relationship requires mutual understanding and trust. The
best way to define the relationship is that culturally and
ethnically, Taiwan and China are relatives, and geographically, we
are neighbors. As relatives, we should not fight against each other.
As neighbors, we should peacefully coexist and cooperate. The
mainland says, "Yes, we are relatives, but we are one country, not
neighbors." They say we are one family. But they have to prove it,
because they treat us more like enemies.</P>
      <P>FP: China has proposed sending two pandas to Taiwan as a goodwill
gesture. Do you support accepting them?</P>
      <P>Lu: In the interest of the pandas, we worry about whether we can
really take care of them properly. Everything should be done in
accordance with international norms regarding the care of endangered
species. But if the mainland people are truly in favor of sending the
pandas, I wouldn't mind. Perhaps the best option is to have the KMT
take care of the pandas. The KMT is so rich, so why not?</P>
      <P>FP: There is a growing concern in some quarters that the hundreds
of thousands of Taiwanese businessmen who live and work in mainland
China are developing a greater affinity for China. To what extent do
you share this concern?</P>
      <P>Lu: I'm certainly concerned. It's ironic that as economic ties
become tighter, political relations become tenser. We understand that
many Taiwanese people go to China for investment opportunities and
are in a bit of a dilemma over how to uphold their patriotism to
Taiwan. Balancing this is a challenge for us.</P>
      <P>FP: Some say that because of China's growing economic and
military power, in a few decades it will be too powerful to be
deterred. Is there a time window in which cross-strait issues need to
be peacefully settled before China gets too powerful for anyone to
stop?</P>
      <P>Lu: The key is the definition of the status quo. Some people say
that the status quo means no independence, no force. The facts are on
the contrary. Taiwan has been independent for decades, with or
without recognition. We are independent, and there is no peace at
all. China's communists in the past decade have spent so much money
to build up their military power. Everybody knows that. So the status
quo is that Taiwan has been independent and that China is militant.</P>
      <P>FP: What is Taiwan's greatest challenge aside from cross-strait
relations?</P>
      <P>Lu: The most urgent priority is reconciliation between the ruling
party government and the opposition. Our opponents still refuse to
recognize the legitimacy of President Chen Shui-bian. Last year, we
were nearly assassinated. It was a miracle that both President Chen
and I survived. [Chen and Lu were shot during a campaign event the
day before the presidential election, which they won by a 0.2 percent
margin.] However, our opponents refuse to recognize that we were
elected in accordance with the law. So they refuse to cooperate with
us in the Legislative Yuan, making everything difficult.</P>
      <P>FP: Are you considering running for president in 2008?</P>
      <P>Lu: That is a sensitive question that I won't answer. It's too
early to say.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)

    <HEADLINE>SCI-TECH MEETING CONCLUSIONS TO BECOME POLICY GOALS: PREMIER HSIEH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Thursday experts'
recommendations at a science and technology strategy meeting will be
adopted to improve the people's living standard.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the closing ceremony of this year's Strategic Review
Board ( SRB) meeting, the premier said if all government offices can
change to white-light LED products within 10 years, Taiwan will be in
a better position to tell the world that it has been implementing the
Kyoto Protocol.</P>
      <P>The SBR meeting was sponsored by the Cabinet's Science and
Technology Advisory Group (STAG) , which coordinates government and
private sector efforts to promote the nation's science and
technological development.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the government will work harder to train sci-tech
manpower, coordinate interdisciplinary research, promote the
application of science and technology in daily life, and identify
leading strategies to help commercialize and popularize the nation's
research results.</P>
      <P>He noted that the government could go as far as coordinating
support for nanotechnology, flexible electronics and radio frequency
identification technology (RFID).</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Taiwan is the world leader in the manufacture of
organic light emitting diode (OLED) products, but is behind South
Korea in production technology.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said he has asked Minister-without-Portfolio Lin
Feng-ching to form an industry group that will focus on
commercializing research in this area to help the industry improve
its manufacturing technology.</P>
      <P>He hoped that within 10 years, all government offices will be
using Taiwan-made white-light LED products, thus saving a lot of
energy, an achievement that could be presented to the world in the
post-Kyoto Protocol era.</P>
      <P>On the application of RFID technology, which used to be
concentrated in the military, he said it can also be used by the
government's customs, the private sector's department stores and even
ordinary households.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said when he was mayor of Kaohsiung City, he
encouraged parents to install RFID chips in the school bags of their
children so they could keep track of their whereabouts.</P>
      <P>The premier disclosed that the government's sci-tech spending
will go up next year even as the total budget goes down, advancing
the government schedule of spending 3 percent of the GDP on science
and technology R&amp;D by 2008.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed the
government's commitment Thursday to offering better care and benefits
for disadvantaged groups, including aborigines, foreign spouses and
impoverished families.</P>
      <P>Chen made the comments while receiving some 100 aboriginal
schoolchildren from the southern counties of Kaohsiung and Pingtung
who were in Taipei on an "experiencing urban life" trip.</P>
      <P>To deliver on the commitment, Chen said his administration has
offered subsidies for five-year-old aboriginal children to receive
pre-school education since Aug. 1 this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, the government has also earmarked an
additional outlay of NT$20 million to finance training for language,
reading and to help those with learning disabilities under the
Ministry of the Interior's 2005 social welfare fund.</P>
      <P>Since 2000, Chen said the government has offered more than NT$230
million to subsidize aboriginal communities to build 24 day-care
centers and renovate facilities at 59 existing ones.</P>
      <P>In the future, Chen said the government will continue to set
aside more funds to improve welfare services for the disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>The aboriginal schoolchildren sang their tribal songs and danced
to express their pleasure at having met with the president.</P>
      <P>Noting that the young visitors come from different indigenous
tribes, including Bunun, Paiwan, Rukai and Tsou, and 15 of them were
born to mothers from the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and South
Africa, Chen said they embody Taiwan's ethnic and cultural diversity.</P>
      <P>Over the past 400-plus years, Chen said, Taiwan has seen many
major waves of migrants. From the Dutch-Spanish colonial rule periods
to Ming-Ching dynasties to the Japanese colonial rule to the
Nationalist government period, many new migrants settled in Taiwan. In
recent years, foreign brides and laborers have instilled new vitality
into Taiwan's life tapestry.</P>
      <P>"Ethnic and cultural diversity has been Taiwan's important asset
and a major driving force behind Taiwan's social progress and
international competitiveness," Chen added.</P>

      <P>A Chinese ocean survey vessel was chased
out of Taiwan waters Thursday by two patrol ships from the Coast
Guard Administration (CGA), a CGA official said.</P>
      <P>The Chinese vessel, the "Striving 4, " was spotted Wednesday
mid-morning operating in Taiwan waters about 100 nautical miles west
of Kaohsiung, in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The CGA sent a patrol ship to drive it away and asked the air
force to keep an eye on the ship from its surveillance airplanes.</P>
      <P>The patrol ship found the Chinese vessel at sea some 110 nautical
miles west of Kaohsiung Wednesday night and monitored its operations
from a distance. A second CGA ship arrived at the scene Thursday
morning and asked the "Struggling 4" to leave.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the Strait Exchange Foundation in Taipei was
alerted to the intrusion of the Chinese vessel and relayed a request
from the CGA to the Chinese authorities for the survey vessel to
leave.</P>
      <P>The "Striving 4" left the area Thursday afternoon as the weather
at sea was worsening. The vessel had intruded into Taiwan waters in
May and operated near the Taiwan-claimed Pratas Islands in the South
China Sea. It left reluctantly after confronting Taiwan patrol ships
for four days.</P>

officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the third Asian country to gain the accreditation, the
officials said, adding that Taiwan also has become the first country
in the world to gain the accreditation by successfully promoting four
different community types: urban for Neihu, agricultural for Tungshi,
mountainous for Alishan and coastal for Fengpin, they said.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the CCCSP is slated to visit Taiwan to present
safety accreditation logos Oct. 15-19 to the four communities, thus

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-INDIA COOPERATION SAID STRONG ENOUGH TO TAP WORLD MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan-India cooperation, particularly in
the information technology field, has a huge potential to make the
two countries invincible around the world, Taiwan and Indian
officials claimed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the CNA on Taiwan-India
business prospects and challenges, India-Taipei Association Chairman
Vijay Gokhale said that India, which is undergoing a "profound and
incredible" transformation since economic opening in 1991, provides
enormous business and investment opportunities.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the Indian government's stable economic policy, the
country now counts a middle class of more than 100 million people, a
number that is expected to quadruple by 2015, Gokhale said,
encouraging Taiwan people to visit India.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsin-hua, deputy director-general of the Bureau of Foreign
Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , said t that he
ministry has listed India as one of its nine foreign markets worthy
of exploration by Taiwan companies. The ministry sent two trade
promotion missions to India last year, while India also dispatched a
group to Taiwan, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, some 1.24 million of India's 1 billion
population are customers with strong purchasing power, while 37
million families are capable of buying durable goods, making India a
market attractive to foreign traders.</P>
      <P>The MOEA will be very happy to see cooperative ventures forged
between Taiwanese and Indian enterprises, in particular in the IT
sector, he said, adding that the two countries will be able "to sweep
through the whole world" if they team up to tap the global market.</P>
      <P>Wang Hsi-mong, a deputy director at the semi-official Taiwan
External Trade Development Council, said that the two countries stand
a good chance of breaking into other fields such as electronics and
automobile parts and accessories.</P>
      <P>Citing government statistics, Wang reported that Taiwan exports
to India hit more than US$1.07 million last year, while imports from
totaled US$860 million. Two-way Taiwan-India trade exceeded the
combined level of Taiwan's trade with Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and
Pakistan, he noted.</P>
      <P>Claiming that India offers a tremendous potential market for
Taiwan businesses keen to diversify, he suggested that domestic
companies make the Indian market a target in their strategic market
deployment plans to pursue new horizons.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's elementary and junior high school
students exercise less than their foreign counterparts, according to
the results of a survey released Thursday by the Ministry of
Education (MOE).</P>
      <P>In U.S. grade schools and high schools, students have physical
education class every day, according to the MOE report. In
comparison, the weekly physical education time is only 90 minutes in
Taiwan's junior high schools and 80 minutes in elementary schools,
far less than the 250 minutes in French high schools and 200 minutes
in French elementary schools.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also lags behind China and Japan in terms of the weekly
physical education hours in high schools and elementary schools, the
MOE report said.</P>
      <P>According to the MOE survey, local people aged over 15 spend two
hours and 20 minutes watching television per day, about 50 minutes
reading newspapers or resting, and only 19 minutes exercising.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-GROWN PAPAYAS BOUND FOR CANADIAN MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Yunlin  County, southern  Taiwan  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's famous Lingnei
papayas, grown in the rural township of Lingnei in southern Yunlin
County, have found new customers in Canada, with a batch of 500 boxes
of the fruit set to be shipped Aug. 23 for the first time.</P>
      <P>The tropical fruit is now in season. While growers used to worry
that a bountiful harvest would result in glut, there is now hope that
their fruit can compete with Hawaii-grown papayas in the North
American market.</P>
      <P>Papaya is a major item of Yunlin County's agricultural produce,
with 150 hectares of orchards yielding 12,600 metric tons of papayas
annually, of which 66 percent are grown in Lingnei township.</P>
      <P>In recent years, agricultural experts from the Council of
Agriculture and Chunghsin University have helped the township set
aside 20 hectares specifically to grow papayas for export. These
orchards are netted to prevent fruit flies and plant diseases from
affecting the fruit.</P>
      <P>The harvested fruit will be strictly graded according to
international standards and kept refrigerated for shipping to
overseas markets.</P>
      <P>The Yunlin county government and the Farmers Association of
Lingnei township jointly held a workshop Thursday to explain to fruit
growers how to supply the export market.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the workshop, Li Ching-yung, acting Yunlin county
magistrate, described the export of papayas to Canada as a milestone
in the county's agricultural development and said there are more
challenges ahead in promoting the county's other farm produce such as
pineapples and tea.</P>

Hundreds of teenagers and other young people barricaded

Wall Street Journal: High Life Behind Zooming Condo Prices: New
Demographics or a Bubble?

As condominium prices reach never-before-seen heights, a debate
is brewing over whether a fundamental demographic shift is driving
the trend or whether this is simply the latest speculative bubble in
a corner of the real-estate market that has seen plenty of them.
Demographic changes in the middle class can explain some of this. The
ideal of the two-parent family with 2.2 children living in a suburban
house is being supplanted by an array of arrangements, including
single professionals, divorcees, active retirees and single parents.
For many of these people, an urban condo is both more luxurious and
convenient than a house with a yard. But economists and housing
experts are increasingly concerned that too many people, trying to
cash in on the phenomenon, are buying speculatively, causing prices
to rise faster than economic fundamentals can support.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA SUPPORTS TAIWAN'S WHO ROLE BUT REJECTS TAIWAN AFFAIRS ACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Vancouver, Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Ho Feng-yun and S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Pierre
Pettigrew said Thursday that Canada supports Taiwan's right to join
the World Health Organization (WHO) but opposes a private member's
bill that would formalize bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>During an interview in Vancouver, Pettigrew said the proposed
Taiwan Affairs Act contradicts Canada's one-China policy and will not
be in the interests of the people of the three countries.</P>
      <P>He said Canada has built constructive relations with Taiwan under
the "one China" principle. As the proposed Taiwan Affairs Act, which
aims to "provide for an improved framework for economic, trade,
cultural and other initiatives between the people of Canada and the
people of Taiwan, " could seriously damage Canada's ties with China,
both his ministry and the federal government are against it, he said.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, he went on, because the people of Taiwan have
a right to information and services from the WHO and to contribute to
the world community through participating in WHO activities, Canada
supports Taiwan's bid to join the WHO as an observer.</P>
      <P>He noted that supporting Taiwan's WHO status and opposing the
Taiwan Affairs Act are not self-contradictory -- the former will help
the people of Taiwan acquire assistance from the WHO, whereas the
latter will touch on the nerves of Beijing and Taipei in their
sovereignty dispute.</P>
      <P>Jim Abbot, a member of parliament of the opposition Conservative
Party, put forward the bill, which passed its first reading in April,
angering Chinese diplomats based in Ottawa.</P>
      <P>As Canada's ruling Liberal Party does not enjoy a majority in the
House of Commons, both the Liberal government and the Chinese
government were nervous that the bill might become law, given the
prevailing sympathy of opposition lawmakers toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pettigrew said the bill is being reviewed by the House's Foreign
Affairs Committee, which will decide whether or not to make any
amendments before putting it to a second reading.</P>
      <P>Stephen Harper, Conservative Party leader, told Chinese-language
media in Toronto last month that the chances of a private member's
bill becoming a law are very slim.</P>
      <P>Harper said he expected the bill to be put to the second reading
in November at the earliest, by which time, he added, it might have
been altered or, if put to a vote, blocked.</P>
      <P>He added that his party's platform recognizes only one China but
the party is very willing to maintain good trade ties with Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei 2005 18th Asian International
Stamp Exhibition will open at the Taipei World Trade Center Friday,
with more than 1,500 frames of stamps from 22 countries on show.</P>
      <P>Among them, 1,415 are in the competitive class while 141 are in
the non-competitive class, according to Chunghwa Post Co., sponsor of
the event.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, the first large international stamp show to be
held in Taiwan since the Directorate General of Posts was transformed
in January 2003 into Chunghwa Post, will run through Aug. 24.</P>
      <P>The theme of the exhibition is "tourism and stamps," with the aim
that through the combination of stamps and sightseeing, Taiwan's
beauty can be seen by all. The Formosan black bear -- an indigenous
animal -- has been chosen as the mascot of the event.</P>
      <P>The logo of the exhibition is Taipei 101, the world's tallest
skyscraper, located near the exhibition venue, which the sponsor
hopes will demonstrate Taiwan's new vibrancy.</P>
      <P>The exhibition features several valuable stamps deemed "jewels of
the nation's stamps" -- the surcharged issue of Flying Geese stamps
from around the early 1950s and the unique Flying Dragon stamps for
express mail from the Qing dynasty, as well as the red revenue stamps
temporarily surcharged at one dollar, which are estimated to be worth
around NT$10 million (US$312,500).</P>
      <P>To publicize and celebrate the occasion, Chunghwa Post is issuing
a series of eight separate souvenir sheets. The first and second --
Taiwan landscape and Taiwan Culture -- were released Aug. 27, 2004
and April 19, 2005, respectively. The third to the eighth -- Taiwan
Conservation, Taiwan Technology, Taiwan Flowers and Fruits, Taiwan
Festivals, Taiwan Cuisine and Taiwan Ocean Life -- will be released
during each day of the exhibition. Each sheet consists of one NT$5
stamp and one NT$25 stamp.</P>
      <P>To commemorate the show, Chunghwa Post is also releasing a set of
four "Taipei 2005 - 18th Asian International Stamp Exhibition
Commemorative Postage Labels, " each of which features a different
section of the ancient painting of cranes titled "taisiantu" from the
National Palace Museum collection. The numbered postage labels will
be printed with four different designs in consecutive order in a
roll.</P>
      <P>The "taisiantu" was painted by the Ming painter Bian Wen-jin. The
scroll depicts 136 cranes, flying, making calls, pecking, fighting,
swimming -- in every pose imaginable and all rendered beautifully.
The crane is a symbol of longevity. </P>
      <P>The set will be available at the exhibition venue and at all
locations equipped with postage label vending machines around the
island starting Friday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PUSHING JAPAN TO ENACT TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT PRIORITY: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Thursday that urging Japan to enact a law similar to the U.S.
Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) is one of the ministry's priorities.</P>
      <P>Lin Sung-huan, director-general of the Department of East Asian
and Pacific Affairs, made the remarks after U.S. quarterly Foreign
Policy published an interview with Vice President Annette Lu in which
she said it would be "most helpful" if the United States could
encourage Japan to pass a law like the TRA to regulate relations
between Japan and Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Lu said that thanks to the TRA signed into law by former U.S.
President Jimmy Carter in 1979, relations between the United States
and Taiwan have been sustained. "Currently, Canada's Parliament is
debating such a bill," she claimed. "So it is time to encourage Japan
to adopt such a formula," she added.</P>
      <P>Lin said that as the law will require approval by the majority of
the Japanese Diet, the ministry will continue to push for the cause
after the parliament elections next month.</P>
      <P>Lin also said Japan supports a proposal that the United Nations
should play a role in safeguarding peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan is adopting a new strategy to enter the
United Nations this year. Under the new strategy, 14 Republic of
China allies, recently made two proposals to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan urging the U.N. General Assembly to ascertain the U.N.
representation of the 23 million people of Taiwan and requesting the
U.N. to play a role in safeguarding peace in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen also said that
with the nation's 13th consecutive bid to enter the U.N., Taiwan
needs to step up an international publicity campaign to solicit the
support of such countries as Japan and the United States.</P>
      <P>Lin said that although Tokyo has yet to formally express its
stance, the ministry has learned from initial communications that
Japan thinks peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is a mutual
concern of the U.S. and Japan and that the U.N.'s part in
safeguarding peace in the Taiwan Strait should get international
community attention.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN INVESTORS WELCOME IN INDIA'S SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan investors are welcome to set up
footholds in India's special economic zones, which levy lower
investment taxes than China's zones, India-Taipei Association
Chairman Vijay Gokhale said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Gokhale extended a welcome at a seminar sponsored by the CNA on
Taiwan-India business prospects and challenges, in which about 20
trade officials and experts of the two countries participated.</P>
      <P>Since the Indian government enacted its Special Economic Zone
Bill in May this year, 11 such zones have been set up so far, while
30 another have applied to do so, Gokhale said, adding that foreign
investors will be provided with handsome incentives and good
services.</P>
      <P>India's economic opening from 1991 has pushed the country to
brace for foreign investment, including from Taiwan, he said, adding
that Taiwan businessmen are welcome to make long-term strategic
investments in India.</P>
      <P>According to the top Indian trade official stationed in Taipei,
his country is rife with trade and business opportunities given that
it has a middle class of more than 100 million people and counts a
larger number of young people than Brazil, China or Russia -- the
three other BRIC countries.</P>
      <P>Gokhale expressed hope that more people in Taiwan will visit
India as his country becomes more and more globalized.</P>
      <P> E.K. Bharat Bhushan, a deputy tourism minister from Kerala
State in southwest India, suggested that Taiwan businessmen
consider exploring India's tourism and hotel industries at a time
when travel-related sectors have become the major engine
behind the country's economic development.</P>
      <P>Although India has a long history and possesses abundant cultural
and natural resources, Bhushan pointed out that there are not enough
large tourism hotels in India and that Taiwan enterprises are welcome
to invest in this sector.</P>
      <P>Lin Chih-huei, a deputy sales manager at China Airlines, Taiwan's
largest carrier, said businessmen account for about 30 percent of the
passengers traveling on the route between Taipei and New Delhi
operated by CAL three times a week -- the sole direct air links
between the two countries.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, only a little over 10,000 people from Taiwan
traveled to India last year, while around 11,000 people from India
visited Taiwan -- an indication that there is ample room for the
development of two-way business and tourism activities.</P>
      <P>Claiming that an adequate government policy coupled with private
sector promotion will help serve that end, Lin called for government
subsidies to help finance charter flight services as a way to step up
bilateral tourist exchanges.</P>

      <P>Lee returned to Taiwan in 1994 after staying in the United States

    <HEADLINE>PFP LEGISLATOR WITHDRAWS FROM JAPAN DELEGATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the opposition People First
Party (PFP) announced Thursday his withdrawal from a fact-finding
mission of the Legislative Yuan's National Defense Committee set to
visit Japan from Aug. 22, in protest over a scheduled meeting with an
ultra-rightist Japanese politician.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Yu-fang, a co-convener of the Legislative Yuan's
National Defense Committee, said in a news release that he is
"extremely unhappy" that the Ministry of National Defense (MND) has
included in the mission's itinerary a meeting with former Japanese
Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano -- a controversial figure known for
his attempts in 1994 to whitewash Japanese atrocities during the
Second World War.</P>
      <P>Lin demanded an apology from the MND, which arranged the
itinerary after consulting with Taiwan's representative office in
Japan.</P>
      <P>"By allowing the representative office in Japan to make such an
arrangement, you are failing those soldiers who sacrificed their
lives resisting Japanese aggression and those innocent Asian people
murdered by Japanese troops," he said.</P>
      <P>Lin claimed that if the MND fails to apologize, it will become an
"endless issue" for the next Legislative Yuan session, which begins
Sept. 13.</P>
      <P>The PFP lawmaker pointed out that Nagano is on record as saying
that the Pacific War launched by Japan was "a war of liberation" and
that the Nanjing Massacre of 1937-38 was a "fabrication."</P>
      <P>Nagano made the assertions during an interview with Japan's
Mainichi newspaper shortly after he was appointed justice minister in
1994. He was forced to resign under mounting domestic and
international pressure only 10 days after taking office.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The gap between rich and poor in Taiwan is
narrowing, thanks to the government's generous social welfare
programs, according to statistics released Thursday by the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics under the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that the richest 20 percent of the population
earned an average of NT$1.79 million in 2004, which is 6.03 times the
average of NT$297,000 earned by the poorest 20 percent of the
population.</P>
      <P>The gap is narrower than the 6.07 times of the previous year,
mainly because of the government's welfare programs, not least a
raise from NT$3,000 to NT$4,000 in the government's monthly pension
to elderly farmers and low-income laborers, the DGBAS said in a
statement accompanying the statistics.</P>
      <P>The difference of 6.03 times is higher than the 4.8 times in
Japan and 5.8 percent in Germany, but lower than the 6.8 times in
South Korea, 9.8 times in the United States, 17.7 times in Hong Kong
and 20.9 times in Singapore.</P>
      <P>On average, each household earned NT$1.12 million in 2004, or
NT$94,000 per month, which is 1 percent more than that of the
previous year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER HOPES TO FILL VICE ECONOMICS MINISTER VACANCY WITHIN WEEK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh hopes to fill the
vacant vice economic affairs minister post within a week, an
Executive Yuan spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>Cho Jung-tai said that in reviewing accountability for the recent
water supply problem in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan, the premier had
expressed the hope of soliciting a water supply expert to replace
Yiin Chii-ming, vice economic affairs minister who served as convener
of the ministry's water resources screening committee and water
resources coordination committee before being demoted Wednesday over
the Taoyuan water supply problem.</P>
      <P>After Typhoon Matsa battered Taiwan in early August bringing
strong winds and torrential rains, water supply in Taoyuan was
disrupted because of the high turbidity in the Shihmen Reservoir --
the county's main water source. The water supply in the northern part
of the county was not fully restored until Aug. 13.</P>
      <P>Cho said the premier has talked with nearly 10 former officials,
hydraulic power scholars, and experts on how to solve the persistent
water problems in Taoyuan County, although he has yet to inquire
about their intention to serve as vice economic affairs minister.</P>
      <P>Cho also said that during a regular weekly meeting with President
Chen Shui-bian Thursday, the premier also exchanged views with the
president on how to promote hydraulic works, and that the president
had given no instructions on who should fill the post left open by
Yiin.</P>
      <P>The premier had recently pointed out that none of the three
sitting vice economic affairs ministers are water experts, and that
their "jobs might have to be adjusted."</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. HOUSE ARMED SERVICE COMMITTEE MEMBERS CONSIDERING VISITING TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  18 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several members of the U.S. House of
Representatives Armed Services Committee have been talking about
possibly visiting Taiwan to exchange views with Taiwan's opposition
lawmakers on the long-stalled special arms procurement bill.</P>
      <P>The Bush administration has offered to sell eight diesel-electric
submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries and a squadron
of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft to Taiwan to beef up the island's
self-defense capabilities.</P>
      <P>Members of the House Armed Services Committee are scheduled to
embark on an Asian tour in September, and some have suggested
detouring to Taiwan for talks with Taiwan's legislators to push for
passage of the arms procurement bill in the new session of the
Legislative Yuan which is set to open early next month.</P>
      <P>Most of the committee members have expressed high expectations
about Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who is set to take over the
chairmanship of the main opposition Kuomintang Friday, being able to
improve interactions between the opposition parties and the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party and thereby facilitating passage of the
arms procurement bill.</P>
      <P>The bill's prospects seem to have improved recently with
legislators from both sides moving closer on the issue by suggesting
that some of the items in the arms procurement package could be
listed in the military's regular annual budget instead of being
financed by a special budget.</P>
      <P>As to making a stop in Taiwan, several of the members of the U.S.
House Armed Services Committee have said they feel it has become
necessary, particularly following the recent release by the Pentagon
of its latest report on China's military.</P>
      <P>In the report issued July 19, 2005, the U.S. Defense Department
stated that "the cross-strait balance of power is shifting towards
Beijing.... Chinese air, naval and missile force modernization is
increasing demands on Taiwan to develop countermeasures that would
enable it to avoid being quickly overwhelmed."</P>
      <P>The congressmen said that China's continued deployment of
hundreds of ballistic missiles directed toward Taiwan is threatening
the security and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>There have been rumblings of impatience and dissatisfaction on
Capitol Hill recently that Taiwan lawmakers are using the arms
procurement bill as a political power struggle tool. Some have
expressed doubts about whether the United States should be committed
to Taiwan's defense when the island itself doesn't seem committed to
the task.</P>
      <P>Some China hands in Washington, D.C. have also said that in the
face of the increasing military imbalance across the Taiwan Strait,
Taiwan should at least be equipped with proper defense capabilities
to allow it to stave off an attack until outside help arrives.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RARE STAMPS ON DISPLAY INSURED FOR OVER NT$2 BILLION</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Sponsors have purchased more than NT$2
billion (US$60.6 million) worth of insurance for the rare and
valuable stamps and related collections on display at the Taipei 2005
- 18th Asian International Stamp Exhibition which opened at the
Taipei World Trade Center Friday.</P>
      <P>Among the 1,556 stamps on display, several are deemed "jewels of
the nation's stamps" -- including the Flying Geese stamps issued in
the early 1950s, the unique Flying Dragon postage stamps for express
mail items during the Qing Dynasty, and the rare Red Color revenue
stamps currently estimated to be worth around NT$10 million
(US$312,500) , according to Chunghwa Post Co., key sponsor of the
event.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is the first large international stamp show to be
held in Taiwan since the Directorate General of Posts became Chunghwa
Post in January 2003. It is set to run through Aug. 24.</P>
      <P>The event, whose theme is "Tourism and Stamps, " is aimed at
promoting Taiwan's stamps as well as tourism. The Formosan black
bear, which is indigenous to Taiwan, has been chosen as the mascot of
the event.</P>
      <P>The logo of the exhibition is the Taipei 101 tower -- the world's
tallest skyscraper -- which the sponsor said hopes will demonstrate
Taiwan's new vibrancy.</P>
      <P>To publicize and celebrate the occasion, Chunghwa Post is issuing
a series of eight separate souvenir sheets. The first and second --
No. 1 Taiwan Landscape and No.2 Taiwan Culture -- were released on
Aug. 27, 2004, and April 19, 2005, respectively. The third through
eighth -- No. 3 Taiwan Conservation, No. 4 Taiwan Technology, No. 5
Taiwan Flowers and Fruits, No. 6 Taiwan Festivals, No. 7 Taiwan
Cuisine and No. 8 Marine Taiwan -- will be released one per day
during the course of the exhibition.</P>
      <P>To commemorate the event, Chunghwa Post is also releasing a set
of four "Taipei 2005 - 18th Asian International Stamp Exhibition
Commemorative Postage Labels, " each of which features a different
section of the ancient painting "Taisiantu" from the National Palace
Museum collection. The postage labels will be printed with four
different designs in consecutive order in a roll. On the lower left
corner of each label is a serial number that consists of two letters
from the Roman alphabet and four Arabic numerals.</P>
      <P>"Taisiantu" was created by the Ming painter Bian Wen-jin. The
scroll depicts 136 cranes, flying, making calls, pecking, fighting,
swimming -- in every pose imaginable and all rendered beautifully.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou officially took
over as main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) chairman from outgoing
Chairman Lien Chan Friday, vowing to continue with reform at this
historical juncture for the centenarian party.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the KMT's 17th plenary session following the
changeover ceremony, Ma admitted feeling "strong pressure" but also
hopeful about the future.</P>
      <P>Ma hailed Lien for his outstanding contribution to the KMT and
cross-Taiwan Strait relations over the past five years, saying that
Lien will be remembered in history for making a landmark "journey of
peace" to China, for allowing for direct election of the KMT
chairman, and for his efforts to wipe out the party's moneyed
politics and dump its ill-gotten assets.</P>
      <P>Ma also thanked Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng for
running in "a gentlemen's race" in the KMT chairmanship election,
saying it helped a great deal in improving the party's image. The
July 16 election was the first time in the KMT's history that two
vice chairmen competed for the party's top post through a direct vote
by its members.</P>
      <P>Ma promised to follow Lien's line and pledged to be open minded
and visionary and to make the KMT into a clean party and win back
power in 2008.</P>
      <P>In his farewell speech, Lien praised Ma as young and savvy and
urged Ma to ready himself for the 2008 presidential election and win
back power from the Democratic Progressive Party despite all kinds of
possible challenges ahead.</P>
      <P>Lien also urged Wang to keep on helping Ma lead the KMT, lauding
the legislative speaker's participation in the chairmanship election
as helping deepen democracy within the party.</P>
      <P>Wang has repeatedly turned down Ma's offer to serve as his deputy
after losing the KMT chairmanship election but has made it clear that
he will always be "a volunteer devoted to the party."</P>

    <HEADLINE>STAMP EXHIBITION CLOSING GAP BETWEEN TAIWAN AND THE WORLD: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The holding of the Taipei 2005 - 18th Asian
International Stamp Exhibition is helping close the gap between
Taiwan and countries around Asia, an official from the Presidential
Office said Friday.</P>
      <P>In his speech to the opening of the exhibition held at the Taipei
World Trade Center, James Huang, deputy secretary-general of the
Presidential Office, offered a hearty welcome on behalf of President
Chen Shui-bian to participants at the stamp show coming from 22 Asian
countries.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan hosted the Asian Stamp Invitational Exhibition in 1993
and the 10th Asian International Stamp Exhibition in 1996, Huang
said, it is believed that with the experience that Taiwan gained from
the two former shows and the passion and devotion demonstrated by
stamp collectors, we will help make the current Taipei 2005 -18th
Asian International Stamp Exhibition a huge success.</P>
      <P>Noting that many people equate a country's stamps to a country's
"visiting or business card, " Huang said that his experience in
learning about stamps when he was a child helped him gain more
knowledge about the history and culture of many other countries
around the world.</P>
      <P>Also addressing the opening ceremony, Vice Minister of
Transportation and Communications Oliver Yu said that learning about
and collecting stamps is a common experience among many people.</P>
      <P>Yu said that stamp collection has become a hobby full of fun in
Taiwan thanks in large part to the efforts of Chunghwa Post, adding
that through the holding of the Taipei 2005 - 18th Asian
International Stamp Exhibition, friendships are expected to be
developed further among people from home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Samuel J.S. Hsu, chairman of Chunghwa Post Co., key sponsor of
the Taipei 2005 - 18th Asian International Stamp Exhibition, said
that the event, whose theme is "Tourism and Stamps, " is aimed at
promoting Taiwan's stamps as well as tourism. The Formosan black
bear, which is indigenous to Taiwan, has been chosen as the mascot of
the exhibition.</P>
      <P>The logo of the exhibition is the Taipei 101 tower -- the world's
tallest skyscraper -- which Hsu said demonstrates Taiwan's new
vibrancy.</P>
      <P>During the six-day run of the event, Hsu said, Chunghwa Post will
issue a series of eight separate souvenir sheets, with one sheet to
be released on each of the days of the exhibition, to introduce the
beauty of Taiwan and its unique characteristics.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that of the 1,556 stamps on display, one-third are from
Taiwan, indicating that Taiwan has high standards in the area of
philately.</P>

Bush's Aid Cuts on Court Issue Roil Latin
America Neighbors

Three years ago the Bush administration
began prodding countries to shield Americans
from the fledgling International Criminal Court
in The Hague. The United States has since cut
aid to some two dozens nations that refused to
sign immunity agreements that American officials
say are intended to protect American soldiers
and policy makers from politically motivated
prosecutions. Particularly in Latin America and
the Caribbean, home to 12 nations that have
been penalized, the cuts are generating strong
resentment at what many see as heavy-handed
diplomacy, officials and diplomats in seven
countries said.

Wall Street Journal: As Iraqi Terror Rises,
Business Find Niche in Life Insurance

Traditional life-insurance policies
available in Iraq don't cover deaths from car
bombings, ambushes, suicide attacks and the
like. Iraqi insurance companies typically resell
policies purchased from foreign conglomerates,
and executives say foreign companies aren't
willing to include coverage for terrorist
attacks in those policies because of Iraq's
frequent violence. Sensing an opportunity, five
private and two government-owned insurance
companies in Iraq recently banded together,
jointly offering a life-insurance product that
exclusively covers terrorism. The companies keep
10 percent of the money from policies they sell,
putting the remaining 90 percent into a shared
pool. The pool allows each firm to accept risks
it would be unwilling to bear on its own.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Su Tseng-chang challenged major opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma ying-jeou right after he took over the party leadership
Friday to mean business in his pledge to reform the party,
particularly on the issues of "black gold" and vote-buying.</P>
      <P>Su also challenged Ma to lead the KMT into what he described as
"benevolent competition" with the DPP during the year-end elections
of county magistrates and mayors.</P>
      <P>During a stumping tour of Taoyuan in northern Taiwan, Su advised
Ma to shed his "teflon" image if he wants to wean his party off the
so-called "black gold" or money politics and vote-buying.</P>
      <P>Su said he understands Ma's ambition to lead the KMT to win back
power in the 2008 presidential election but the DPP will do its
utmost to get good grades on President Chen Shui-bian's
administration, an achievement that he claimed will ensure the DPP
continues as the ruling party.</P>
      <P>William C.T. Lai, secretary-general of the DPP legislative
caucus, criticized Ma's inaugural speech and challenged him to address
the questions of party assets and vote-buying.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, Ma spent much of his speech attacking the
president and his administrative record as if he was delivering a
campaign speech in 2008. "Loud criticism of the DPP does not mean the
KMT will improve, as that requires concrete strategies," added Lai.</P>
      <P>He also ridiculed Ma for "copying what Lien Chan has been doing
-- fanning the KMT members' anger over the 319 shooting as the only
step to unite the party."</P>
      <P>Cheng Chen-lung, secretary-general of the pro-independence
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union, said that if Ma wants the
"pan-blue alliance" to take power in 2008, he must adequately deal
with the baggage of the party's ill-gotten assets, return the party
to the middle ground and respect the people's right to choose between
unification and independence.</P>
      <P>Ma's anti-Taiwan independence remarks show that he does not
respect the people, he claimed, adding that Ma should agree to allow
the people a free choice between unification with China and Taiwan
independence.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) topped the other political parties with respect to the balance
of political donations, with more than NT$97.31 million (US$3.04
million) as of the end of 2004, the nation's highest watchdog body
said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan said that the DPP was followed by its ally, the
Taiwan Solidarity Union, with more than NT$7.18 million, and the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) with more than NT$7.05 million.</P>
      <P>The People First Party (PFP) , an ally of the KMT, had NT$2.42
million, Non-Partisan Solidarity Union had NT$550,000 and the New
Party had NT$9,000.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Yu-nan, the director in charge of public functionary assets
disclosure in the Control Yuan, noted that after various political
parties file their accounting reports of political donations, the
Control Yuan must review them in accordance with the law. However, as
the confirmation of the new members of the Control Yuan is stalled in
the Legislative Yuan, the review will have to wait until their
confirmation.</P>
      <P>The political donation law was promulgated last year under which
the recipients of political donations have to apply to the Control
Yuan for approval. Political parties and groups are required to set
up special accounts in financial institutions to receive political
donations after approval by the Control Yuan, and the recipients are
required to report on the balance of their accounts five months after
the end of the previous year.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that the balance of political donations
had been announced.</P>

      <P>An official from the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) renewed Friday the MAC's calls for
China to return to the negotiating table to facilitate efforts in
seeking eternal peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman You Ying-lung called for the Beijing
authorities to resume talks with Taiwan on issues including China's
plans to give a pair of pandas to Taiwan and visits to Taiwan by
Chinese citizens.</P>
      <P>You said that despite Beijing's two-handed maneuvering against
Taiwan, the country will stick firmly to the policy of "seeking
friendly reconciliation, active cooperation and eternal peace" with
China.</P>
      <P>This policy is also a reflection of President Chen Shui-bian's
oft-repeated advocacy of "negotiation and reconciliation," You said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the MAC will work to shelve controversial
differences and hard-to-resolve issues, push for cross-strait
negotiations and promote exchanges based on the principles of
equality and reciprocity.</P>
      <P>You said Taiwan needs to adopt new strategies to face the
challenges from the other side of the strait because of Beijing's
passage of its "Anti-Secession Law" authorizing the use of force if
Taiwan edges toward formal independence on the one hand, while on the
other putting forward a spate of gestures ostensibly to improve
cross-strait interactions, including inviting opposition leaders to
visit China, offering pandas to Taiwan, giving duty-free access for
Taiwan agricultural produce and agreeing in principle to allow
Chinese citizens to make tourism trips to Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Wu Rong-i said Friday that
Taiwan has made three contributions to the Asia-Pacific region --
trade and investment liberalization, security enhancement and
economic and technical cooperation -- through its participation in
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks when he attended a seminar on 2005 APEC
issues sponsored by the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER),
a local think tank.</P>
      <P>Wu, who served as TIER president for a long time before taking up
the post of vice premier, has taken part in many APEC-related
activities over the years.</P>
      <P>On trade and investment liberalization, Wu said Taiwan has
carried out over 100 liberalization measures on tariffs, non-tariff
hurdles, the service sector, investment, standardization,
intellectual property rights, government procurement and personnel
movement.</P>
      <P>On safety enhancement, Wu said that as Taiwan is not a member of
the United Nations, it has been unable to take part in anti-terrorism
activities under the auspices of the United Nations.
Since the APEC started to discuss anti-terrorism and security
issues, however, Taiwan has been able to get involved in
international anti-terrorism activities, he said.</P>
      <P>On economic and technology cooperation, Taiwan has made several
major initiatives, he went on, including an IT schools initiative,
which has already been implemented, and an APEC Digital Opportunity
Center (ADOC) initiative, which is still being implemented.</P>
      <P>Wu added that if the number of times "Chinese Taipei" is
mentioned in major APEC declarations is any indication of importance,
then Taiwan is becoming more important.</P>
      <P>He noted that "Chinese Taipei" was only mentioned six times in
the major declaration of APEC before 2000. But from 2000 to the
present, Taiwan has been mentioned twice in APEC Leaders'
Declarations and 23 times in the annual ministers' declaration.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou outlined a blueprint for party reforms Friday,
suggesting seven measures to carry out the mission by 2008.</P>
      <P>Ma outlined the reform plan in a speech in the KMT's 17th plenary
session after officially taking over the party helm from his
predecessor, Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the KMT must stick to its reform promise to garner
greater public backing, Ma proposed cementing democracy in the party,
expanding the public support base, rejuvenating the party, reaching
out to southern Taiwan, handling the issue of the party's assets,
consolidating the opposition "pan blue alliance" and taking care of
retired and laid-off party workers.</P>
      <P>In an effort to strengthen support for the KMT, Ma suggested that
the party's decision-making Central Standing Committee (CSC) hold its
weekly meetings in various cities and counties in southern regions.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that CSC members will be directly elected
by party delegates in the future, but said that he will respect any
final decision to be made with regard to the plenary session.</P>
      <P>The KMT must set a clear timetable for dealing with its assets by
2008, the proceedings of which will be used to look after retired and
departing party workers, he said.</P>
      <P>To meet high supporter expectations for a merger of the "pan blue
alliance" of the KMT, the People First Party and the New Party, the
new KMT boss said that his party will cooperate with its two
political allies through crafting common policies, forging mutual
trust and building cooperative mechanisms in a three-phase
consolidation plan.</P>
      <P>The party is determined to sway younger and middle-road
supporters with a fresh and clean image and will do its best to check
and balance the executive branch in the legislature by putting
forward well crafted policies, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the direct vote proposal for CSC members was approved
later that day in the plenary session. A total of 202 CSC members are
to be directly elected for a one-year term by attending party
delegates the following day.</P>
      <P>The KMT was defeated by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
for the first time in the 2000 presidential election after ruling
Taiwan for more than 50 years since its retreat from China in 1949.
President Chen Shui-bian of the ruling DPP was re-elected in 2004.</P>

counterparts to arrange the flights, Wu said that further
negotiations are needed to reach a final settlement, adding that the
MAC will announce the results only when substantial progress has been
made.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the government will remain flexible to help push for
the realization of the Moon Festival holiday charter flights,
including considering allowing a broader range of Taiwan people to
take the flights beyond Taiwan businessmen operating in China.</P>
      <P>Based on the model set early this year in Macau for the Chinese
New Year charter flights -- the first direct flights across the
strait -- representatives of the two sides are engaged in talks to
arrange direct charter flights for the Sept. 18 Moon Festival holiday
as the first step toward their efforts to make the services regular
on weekends and major holidays prior to an opening of full air links.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the issue of repeated intrusions into Taiwan waters
by ocean survey research vessels from China, the MAC head described
it as an indication of China's growing military expansion, with
further evidence in that China and Russia are conducting joint
military drills on the Shandong peninsula near South Korea and Japan.</P>
      <P>Chinese vessels are not only increasingly entering waters near
Taiwan but also waters adjacent to other neighboring countries, he
noted, urging the public to support the government's national defense
upgrading policy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HEALTH AUTHORITIES WARN OF POSSIBLE AVIAN FLU OUTBREAK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  19 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official report suggested Friday that
about 5.3 million people in Taiwan would be prone to avian influenza
should it become capable of human-to-human transmission and trigger a
worldwide pandemic.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) released the report
at a top-level national security meeting convened by President Chen
Shui-bian. It indicates that under a stimulated model set up by the
U.S. disease control authorities, an avian flu pandemic could take
14,000 lives in Taiwan, causing an economic impact 10 times larger
than that of the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.</P>
      <P>The report names the avian flu virus -- most possibly a mutated
strain of H5N1 -- as a "killer flu" and "super flu, " which the World
Health Organization (WHO) has assessed would kill between 2 million
and 7 million around the world should it become as infectious as
human flu.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Hou Sheng-mao said at a news conference following
the meeting that based on an analysis of experts and scholars, from
next January to March will be a critical period for a possible
outbreak. He said all public health experts have agreed that there
will be an avian flu epidemic sometime in the future. Now, the only
question is when the epidemic will occur.</P>
      <P>Citing historical records, Hou said the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic
killed about 40 million people around the globe and 25,000 in Taiwan,
which had a population of only 3 million at that time.</P>
      <P>To prevent such a threat from endangering the nation's
development, he noted, two packages of plans have been mapped out to
deal with a possible avian flu pandemic.</P>
      <P>The health minister added that the Executive Yuan has promised to
appropriate NT$6 billion (US$186.65 million) for the construction of
pharmaceutical factories to produce anti-flu vaccines. He explained
that Taiwan has stockpiled about 160,000 doses of "Tamiflu, " the
most effective anti-flu medicine in the world, or enough for 0.7
percent of the population. The stocks will be raised to 4 percent by
next year, while the government is planning to further increase the
stocks to 10 percent, the level suggested by the WHO.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPC CENTRAL COMMITTEE CONGRATULATES NEW KMT CHAIRMAN MA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing, Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee sent a congratulatory message to the Kuomintang (KMT)
Central Committee and new KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou Friday over the
convening of a KMT party meeting, according to a Beijing-based
Xinhuanet report.</P>
      <P>Ma took over the helm of the KMT from Lien Chan, the outgoing
chairman who will serve as honorary chairman in the party's 17th
plenary session earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>The CPC Central Committee said the CPC and the KMT published
acommon vision for peaceful development across the Taiwan Strait in
Beijing in late April this year during Lien's trip to the mainland,
which reflects the will of people on both sides of the Strait and
ushers in an historic era of cross-strait party exchanges, the
message said.</P>
      <P>It expressed hope that both sides can insist on the 1992
consensus, which China deems as the "one China" principle, while
Taiwan believes it should be "one China with different interpretation
as to its meaning, " and that both sides will also oppose Taiwan
independence to safeguard peace in the Taiwan Strait and create a
win-win situation for both sides across the Strait.</P>
      <P>CPC Secretary General Hu Jintao also sent a message to Lien to
congratulate him for serving as the honorary chairman of the main
opposition party in Taiwan, the report said.</P>
      <P>In the congratulatory message to Lien, Hu said that Lien has
contributed a great deal to improving and developing cross-strait
relations since he began leading the party in 2000.</P>
      <P>Lien, leading a delegation to visit China in late April,
conducted exchanges and dialogue with China, the message said, adding
that both sides then announced their common vision for the
advancement of cross-strait peace, which it said is significant in
promoting cross-strait relations toward the direction of peace and
stability.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT ON ALERT FOR POSSIBLE MUTATED AVIAN FLU OUTBREAK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With a health report that suggests millions
of Taiwan people could be at risk of avian influenza should it become
capable of human-to-human transmission, President Chen Shui-bian told
his Cabinet Friday that seven major administrative flaws, which
caused outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on the
island in 2003, should never happen again.</P>
      <P>Chen gave the instruction at a top-level national security
meeting he convened at the Presidential Office. He said that the
flaws led not only to the fast spread of the highly contagious
disease, but also to deaths of many medical and health care
personnel.</P>
      <P>The flaws included no coordinating mechanism between the central
and local governments during the SARS outbreak, which led to
different government agencies having different policies and
strategies to control and prevent the pandemic.</P>
      <P>More problems came from an ill-functioning reporting system on
SARS cases and an inefficient diagnosis procedure. Insufficient
training of medical and health care personnel resulted in losses of
professionals.</P>
      <P>Chen mentioned that a serious shortage of anti-pandemic gear and
medical supplies and the government's failure to build an "airtight"
disease control network in the country was also to blame for the
outbreak of SARS, which killed over 70 people beginning in April,
2003.</P>
      <P>With the painful "lessons, " the president instructed his Cabinet
to be well-prepared for a possible avian flu pandemic, which,
according to a report released by the Department of Health (DOH)
Friday, could take 14,000 lives in Taiwan, causing economic losses 10
times larger than those caused by the SARS outbreaks.</P>
      <P>Besides acting to review the previous flaws and to put right the
government's disease control and prevention systems, efforts have
also to be made to stockpile enough anti-flu vaccines -- at least
reaching the level suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO)
at 10 percent of the population.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan stockpiles about 160,000 doses of "Tamiflu, "
the most effective anti-flu medicine in the world, or enough for 0.7
percent of its population, according to DOH statistics.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that encountering a pandemic should be considered
like fighting a war, saying well-prepared anti-pandemic procedures
and enough medical supplies are the key to winning the war.</P>
      <P>The DOH report cited an assessment by the WHO as saying that the
avian flu virus -- most possibly a mutated strain of H5N1 -- would
kill between 2 million and 7 million people around the world should
it become as infectious as human flu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROSECUTOR DISCIPLINED FOR SUBPOENAING PRESIDENT AS WITNESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  19  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A prosecutor who made headlines for
summoning the president as a witness last year in a vote-buying case
was disciplined Friday for doing so without first getting the
approval of his superiors.</P>
      <P>The Committee on the Discipline of Public Functionaries ordered
prosecutor Lee Tzu-chun of the Hualien Prosecutors' Office to be
demoted to a lower rank and have his salary reduced.</P>
      <P>The committee blamed Lee for sending a subpoena by post to
President Chen Shui-bian, without informing his superiors at the
Hualien Prosecutors' Office, let alone getting their approval as is
usual.</P>
      <P>In his subpoena, Lee demanded that President Chen give testimony
in his capacity as the then-chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) in the investigation of vote-buying
allegations against DPP candidate You Ying-lung in the 2003
by-election of magistrate of Hualien County.</P>
      <P>The committee also condemned Lee for prosecuting Yu for
vote-buying in December 2004 -- more than one year after You lost the
election -- without bothering to notify his superiors at the
prosecutors' office or seeking their approval as is necessary.</P>
      <P>Instead of having You's indictment examined and approved by his
superiors, Lee send it secretly to the Hualien District Court, which
accepted it and assigned a panel of judges to look into it despite
State Public Prosecutor-General Wu Ying-chao having denounced it as
invalid and having requested its withdrawal.</P>
      <P>In his indictment, Lee claimed You's campaign promise to give
monthly allowances to chiefs of Hualien's aboriginal tribes if he was
elected constituted a form of vote-buying, and asked the court to
sentence him to two months in jail.</P>
      <P>The president was summoned to give testimony because Yu claimed
during the campaign that all his promises had been endorsed by the
president and were, therefore, far from empty words.</P>
      <P>To the surprise of the country, the lawyer-turned-president
showed up in Lee's office in Hualien on time to answer the
prosecutor's questions, and successfully turned a potential political
embarrassment into personal political capital by waiving presidential
executive immunity from criminal investigation.</P>
      <P>However, the Committee on the Discipline of Public Functionaries
said in its ruling that the elected head of state deserves due
respect. By summoning him for questioning recklessly, the prosecutor
obstructed the president's work in leading the country and serving
the people.</P>
      <P>Determining that Lee had acted unethically by avoiding the
supervision of his superiors, the ruling said Lee should be
disciplined by a demotion, although the indictment he brought without
following due process of law had been accepted by the court as valid.</P>
      <P>Lee, known as a maverick law enforcement official, was referred
to the committee for punishment by his embarrassed superiors at the
Hualien Prosecutors' Office.</P>
      <P>He was not available for comment Friday and his superiors at the
Hualien Prosecutors' Office refused to comment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'PHILATELIST PASSPORT' SIMULATES 'ROUND-THE-WORLD' TRIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visitors to the Taipei 2005-18th Asian
International Stamp Exhibition can use a "philatelist passport" to
simulate a round-the-world trip if they stop at all the booths of the
22 participating countries.</P>
      <P>Veteran stamp collector Ms. Lin spent more than two hours and
NT$1,500 (US$46.80) in a tour around all the booths of the 22
countries, purchasing their stamps and acquiring their postmarks.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Post, the key sponsor of the stamp exhibition, has
prepared 12,000 copies of the "philatelist passport" at the Taipei
World Trade Center. Visitors who purchase NT$100 worth of philatelic
items or stamps will receive a passport.</P>
      <P>After visiting the 22 countries' booths and having the countries'
stamps affixed to passport with their various postmarks, the
passport-holder will feel like they have really made a trip around
the world, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin had two other similar philatelist passports that she acquired
from the Asian Stamp Invitational Exhibition in 1993 and the 10th
Asian International Stamp Exhibition in 1996, both held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Post has opened several temporary post offices to serve
stamp collectors and exhibition visitors during the six-day run of
the Taipei 2005-18th Asian International Stamp Exhibition, which
opened Friday.</P>
      <P>Among the 1,556 frames of stamps on display, several are deemed
"jewels of the nation's stamps" -- including the Flying Geese stamps
issued in the early 1950s, the unique Flying Dragon postage stamps
for express mail items during the Qing dynasty, and the rare Red
Color revenue stamps currently estimated to be worth around NT$10
million (US$312,500).</P>
      <P>To publicize and celebrate the occasion, Chunghwa Post is issuing
a series of eight separate souvenir sheets. The first and second --
No. 1 Taiwan Landscape and No. 2 Taiwan Culture -- were released on
Aug. 27, 2004, and April 19, 2005, respectively. The third through
eighth -- No. 3 Taiwan Conservation, No. 4 Taiwan Technology, No. 5
Taiwan Flowers and Fruits, No. 6 Taiwan Festivals, No. 7 Taiwan
Cuisine and No. 8 Marine Taiwan -- will be released one each day
during the course of the exhibition.</P>
      <P>To commemorate the event, Chunghwa Post has also released a set
of four "Taipei 2005-18th Asian International Stamp Exhibition
Commemorative Postage Labels, " each of which features a different
section of the ancient painting "Taisiantu" from the National Palace
Museum collection.</P>
      <P>"Taisiantu" was created by the Ming painter Bian Wen-jin. The
scroll depicts 136 cranes -- flying, making calls, pecking, fighting,
swimming -- in every pose imaginable and all rendered beautifully.
The crane is a symbol of longevity. The postage label set is
available at the venue of the exhibition and at all locations
equipped with postage label vending machines around the island
starting Friday.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Post is also offering 10,000 gifts by prize draw, in
addition to offering exhibition visitors the opportunity to have
their own personalized stamps and postcards made digitally.</P>
      <P>The event, whose theme is "Tourism and Stamps, " is aimed at
promoting Taiwan's stamps as well as tourism. The Formosan black
bear, which is indigenous to Taiwan, has been chosen as the mascot of
the exhibition.</P>
      <P>The logo of the exhibition is the Taipei 101 tower -- the world's
tallest skyscraper -- which the sponsor said hopes will demonstrate
Taiwan's new vibrancy.</P>

      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh attended a ceremony
to worship to the Buddha Saturday at a temple in Kaohsiung County,
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although he is a devoted Buddhist, Hsieh said this was the first
time he has taken part in such a ceremony since assuming the
premiership in February.</P>
      <P>Among the many precepts written on papers hanged on the walls in
the temple, Hsieh said he found "resisting the insult" to be the one
that he feels he has done will in, referring to the strong criticism
he has received in the legislature from opposition parties.</P>

preaching, Hsieh urged all the eight million Buddhists around the
island to deepen their learning of Buddhism and purify their bodies
and minds for the benefit of society.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COAST GUARD LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN AGAINST INTRUDING CHINESE SHIPS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Coast Guard Administration (CGA)
launched a weeklong "clean sweep" campaign Saturday against Chinese
fishing boats and ocean survey ships intruding into waters near
Taiwan's outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu.</P>
      <P>The campaign was launched in response to a Chinese ocean survey
ship, the "Fendou [striving] No. 4, " that has sailed into waters
close to the three outlying islands three times since May, and
poaching by Chinese fishing boats in Taiwan waters.</P>
      <P>"The operation is also aimed at cracking down on human and cargo
smuggling across the Taiwan Strait and preventing a possible spread
of avian flu into Taiwan as an outbreak of human influenza mutated
from bird flu is very likely to emerge in China, " a CGA official
explained.</P>
      <P>According to a CGA study, locations where Chinese fishing boats
have often traversed and converged include the outlying islands of
Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu and Wuchiu as well as Keelung, Hsinchu and
Taichung on Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>In addition to mobilizing large patrols to beef up its presence,
the official said the CGA has also enlisted helicopters and coastal
radar systems to facilitate reconnaissance and form a
three-dimensional dragnet to enhance operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>"We hope such precautionary actions can deter Chinese fishermen
from traversing into our territorial waters so that we can better
protect our fishery resources, maritime ecology and the safety of
local fishermen operating in the areas," the official said.</P>
      <P>Amid reports of avian flu outbreaks in certain parts of China and
its neighboring countries, Taiwan has stepped up inspection and
quarantine work at Kinmen and Matsu where direct shipping services
with China's Fujian province have been allowed to prevent the spread
of the virus to the two Taiwan-held outlying islands and Taiwan
proper.</P>
      <P>During the campaign, the CGA official said Chinese fishing boats
intruding into Taiwan's restricted waters will be chased away and
those that traverse into off-limit areas will be impounded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RUSSIA-CHINA MILITARY EXERCISE A PRETEXT TO SUPPRESS TAIWAN: ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Moscow,  Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By H.K.Chang and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing seems to be attempting to use the
current Russia-China joint military exercise as a pretext to suppress
Taiwan, although it describes the war game as "anti-terrorist and
peace-keeping" maneuvers, the Republic of China's top envoy to Russia
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Rong-jye, Taiwan's representative to Russia, made the
comments in an interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>The eight-day exercises started Thursday and involve some 10,000
troops from air, sea and land. They are designed to test the ability
of the two countries in the fight against terrorism and separatism.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the drills are not expected to change the
status quo in the Taiwan Strait, but he warned that all countries
concerned should avoid escalating tensions in the region by
restraining themselves from taking any irrational actions.</P>
      <P>Now is not the right time for Beijing and Moscow to hold such
exercises, known as "Peace Mission 2005, " as China has just passed
its Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan, and the European Union has
still been discussing whether it should lift its arms sales ban on
China, he said, adding that it seems that Beijing is attempting to
relate Taiwan to "terrorism" and "separatism, " as well as practicing
an invasion of the island by taking part in the exercises.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Russia and China have established a legal basis
for them to build a strategic and cooperation partnership since they
signed a cooperation treaty in 2001, the envoy said that as a result,
military relations between the two countries, including arms sales
and military high-tech exchanges and joint military exercises, have
particularly been strengthened. "This has also caused concerns in the
international community and neighboring countries in particular, "
he added.</P>
      <P>Commenting on recent media reports that the drills are aimed at
Taiwan, Chen said that Beijing seems to use the war games on the
Shandong peninsula to reinforce its ability should conflict break out
across the Strait.</P>
      <P>China also wants to give a warning to Japan and the United States
by expanding its navy's "action area" to the region close to the
seaboard of Japan, he continued, noting that the selections of
scenario and places of the war games can hardly make people turn a
blind eye to the drills that are believed to target certain countries
in the region.</P>
      <P>Saying that Russia wants to lure Chinese buyers by showing its
high-tech and modern arms equipment, including T-22 M3, T-95 MS and
long-range strategic bombers in the exercises, Chen said that China
also wants to use the drills to strengthen its relations with Russia
as well as increase its military influence in Central Asia and
accumulate experience of holding joint military exercises with
Russian troops.</P>
      <P>Although a high-ranking Russian defense official has reiterated
that the exercises are not aimed at any third country, including
Taiwan, Chen, however, said that many media reports have said the
exercises are to defy the United States, Japan and Taiwan. "A Russian
newspaper even said frankly that the exercises are targeting the
island, " he added.</P>
      <P>Some Russian analysts consider that the refusal of the Russian
government to launch its joint military exercises with China off the
area near the Taiwan Strait clearly shows that Moscow does not want
to see the war games used by China as an instrument to obstruct
Taiwan, he continued.</P>

and production, a bureau official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The MJIB sent some staff members to take part in a six-country

the MJIB to take part in its special task force responsible for

      <P>The MJIB designated Hsueh Pao-shu, an MJIB official posted at

      <P>Support from the South Korean government
would help facilitate President Chen Shui-bian's participation in the
informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum slated for next month in Busan, South Korea, Minister of
Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is trying its utmost through
various channels to make President Chen's dream come true to attend
the APEC summit, Tan Sun Chen said.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister said that Taiwan is very grateful to the
government of the Republic of Korea for its political wisdom and
skillful handling in pushing for Taiwan's entry into APEC in 1991
along with China and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>If Seoul, the 2005 APEC summit meeting host, can continue its
support for Taiwan, using the same political wisdom and skillful
handling to make possible President Chen's participation in the APEC
summit, it would be the second South Korean success that would have
great historical significance regarding bolstering Taiwan's

      <P>Tan Sun Chen told the colloquium participants that although
everybody in Taiwan is very much looking forward to President Chen's
attendance at the APEC summit, Taiwan should also fully understand
that Seoul has said that APEC summit representation is an issue to be
decided by all APEC member countries but not a matter which can be
decided solely by South Korea.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China is not "rising peacefully" as it
claims, which can be evidenced by its increasing annual military
budget, ROC Minister of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Tan Sun Chen said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>In his speech about "new challenge in diplomacy" delivered at a
colloquium held at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, Chen criticized
China as playing a zero-sum diplomatic war with Taiwan by claiming
that Taiwan is part of China and luring Taiwan's diplomatic allies
away to squeeze its diplomacy efforts.</P>
      <P>Concerning the "peaceful rise" claimed by China, Chen revealed
that at a heavyweight forum he attended in the United States in June,
no one believed that China is rising peacefully.</P>
      <P>Noting that China's military budget tops the list among Asian
countries, Chen said China does not need such a large military budget
if it is only targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan in World
War II and the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 involving the United
States and the Soviet Union made the world nervous.</P>
      <P>Now, China has deployed several hundreds of missiles targeting
Taiwan, and the world community seems to pretend that they can't see
them, Chen said, adding that it was only after China's enactment of
its Anti-Secession Law in March this year that the world began to
understand that China is not rising peacefully, and it desires
hegemony.</P>
      <P>The Anti-Secession Law authorizes the use of "non-peaceful means"
against Taiwan should the island declare formal independence.</P>
      <P>Noting that Americans have now realized Beijing's real face, Chen
urged Taiwan people not to have any illusions about China's
proposals, including its offer to help Taiwan enter the World Health
Organization, which has been proven to be a lie.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed the hope that the European Union will not
lift its arms embargo against China, which has been imposed since the
Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989. According to Chen, the U.S. and
Japan have opposed the lifting of the embargo.</P>
      <P>Referring to Taiwan's plan to purchase advanced arms from the
United States for the defense of the country, Chen stressed that if
the arms procurement budget is not approved in the legislature,
Taiwan can be swallowed up by China at any time.</P>

percent from the amount of US$5.91 billion registered in the same

    <HEADLINE>DPP ASKS GOVERNMENT TO ADOPT MULTI-PRONGED APPROACH AGAINST BIRD FLU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should adopt a multi-pronged
approach to prevent a possible outbreak of human influenza mutated
from avian influenza virus and the public should also be vigilant
against the disease, a caucus whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>William Lai made the remarks one day after President Chen
Shui-bian presided over a top-level national security meeting on
control contingencies in response to a possible outbreak of avian
flu.</P>
      <P>Lai said the party is upbeat on the government's early
preparations for a possible outbreak. But he also said that a mutated
strain of avian flu virus could lead to a global situation, saying
that according to a simulation by the U.S. disease control
authorities, an avian flu pandemic could infect 5.3 million people,
hospitalize 70,000 and take 14,000 lives in Taiwan, causing an
economic impact 10 times larger than that of the 2003 outbreaks of
severe acute respiratory syndrome on the island.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the avian flu virus could be transmitted from
migratory birds to poultry and then to people, and then from person
to person, and could also be imported from foreign countries. For
this reason, poultry operators and those who have contact with
migratory birds should be on guard, he said.</P>
      <P>Lai also said that the government should step up cracking down on
smuggled poultry, and the health authorities should also work with
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to work out a
standard operating procedure as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Taiwan Solidarity Union caucus whip said Saturday
that the party was happy to see that the government is taking action
to plug the loopholes of human and animal smuggling as well as the
invasion of infectious diseases.</P>
      <P>Ho Min-hao made the remarks after the Coast Guard Administration
embarked on a weeklong "clean sweep" campaign earlier in the day
against Chinese fishing boats and ocean survey ships intruding into
waters near Taiwan's outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu.</P>
      <P>Ho expressed the hope that the government will rigorously enforce
the law to protect national security.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the government's efforts to
make inroads in the Japanese market, mango exports from Tainan County
still registered a dramatic decline as a result of the typhoons and
heavy rains this year, a local official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>With the mango crop in the final phase of maturing, the
performance of mango exports still remains gloomy in Tainan.
According to the Bureau of Agriculture (BOA) under the Tainan County
Government, this year's exports to Japan did not even make one-third
of the expected growth, totaling 486 tons; exports to
South Korea, which has never been a big customer of Taiwan, are also
flat at 43 tons this year.</P>
      <P>Exports to Hong Kong and China have yet to be estimated by
Customs, the BOA added. According to the BOA, the bad weather this
year has posed great challenges to the growth of mangoes, whose
production has shown an unprecedented downturn this year. Along with
the stricter quarantine requirements implemented in Japan, the
decline in exports should therefore be understandable to the public.</P>
      <P>Aside from doing business with regular buyers, Taiwan has also
exported one ton of mangoes to New Zealand as a trial this year, the
BOA noted.</P>

People First Party's (PFP) failure to allow the bill for the arms
procurement package to be considered has misled Americans to believe
that Taiwan thinks that the U.S. will bail them out of any military
problem, when in fact Taiwan should be strengthening its own defense
in case of war.</P>
      <P>Huang called the KMT and the PFP "pro-China parties" because of
the way they have damaged Taiwan's national security.</P>
      <P>Facing Beijing's missile threat, Taiwan should maintain a certain
level of defense capability -- one month or half a month -- for
foreign allies to render help to the island later, Yao stressed.</P>
      <P>The march will begin at 3 p.m. on Sept. 25, starting from the
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall and proceed through downtown Taipei,
ending at Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office.</P>

      <P>Minister of Transportation and

international stamp exhibition will help exchanges between countries.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks when he visited the Taipei 2005 and the 18th

Exhibition Hall, noting that this was the first time Chunghwa Post
has sponsored an international stamp exhibition in nine years, urging
Chunghwa Post to solicit more opportunities to host similar events.</P>
      <P>Lin was invited to make personalized greeting stamps as a

      <P>Among a great multitude of valuable stamps, Lin said that he
wanted most to see a trial print proof of Mauritius double

      <P>New Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou

      <P>Ma also reaffirmed at the close of the 17th plenary session of

      <P>He said that the party has been the opposition for more than five

      <P>On issues such as agricultural exchanges with China, Chinese

      <P>A delegation from the opposition People

with Beijing authorities related to a cross-strait forum and
cross-strait charter cargo flights.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsien-yao, director of the PFP's policy research center and

discuss a cross-strait forum in Shanghai next month. Five seminars
will focus on economic issues and avoid politics, and both PFP
Chairman James Soong and Vice Chairman Chang Chao-hsiung will attend.</P>
      <P>Whether Hu Jintao, general secretary of the Communist Party of
China and Chinese president, will attend the forum to meet with Soong
will be finalized during the trip.</P>
      <P>The forum will invite heads of the chambers of commerce and major

    <HEADLINE>INTERMENT OF TWO LATE PRESIDENTS' EMBALMED BODIES MAY BE POSTPONED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The interment of the The embalmed bodies of
the late President Chiang Kai-shek and his son and successor Chiang</P>
      <P>Ching-kuo may be postponed further, Vice Minister of the Interior
Chien Tai-lang said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chien made the remarks after Nancy Chiang, a daughter-in-law of
Chiang Ching-kuo, died of complications from acquired aplastic anemia
at the age of 68 earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>On behalf of an ad hoc office in charge of preparations for the
two late presidents' interment, Chien expressed his condolences over
Nancy Chiang's death.</P>
      <P>Nancy Chiang, who was born to a Chinese father and a German
mother, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia in late 1999 probably
because of long-term use of a drug to treat her chronic headaches.</P>
      <P>Aplastic anemia is a disorder in which the bone marrow greatly
decreases or stops production of blood cells.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Yen-yao, deputy superintendent of the Koo Foundation Sun
Yat-sen Cancer Center, said Nancy Chiang had since suffered from
relapses of the disease. Her immune system had also been affected.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, Nancy Chiang had been hospitalized since June
after contracting pneumonia. Despite undergoing various kinds of
treatments, her condition continued to deteriorate and she died at 2
p.m. Saturday.</P>
      <P>Nancy Chiang is survived by an adult daughter. Her husband,
Chiang Hsiao-wen, Chiang Ching-kuo's eldest son, died less than two
years after Chiang Ching-kuo's death in 1988.</P>
      <P>The interment of the two late presidents was originally scheduled
for July, but was later postponed to September. According to Chien,
Nancy Chiang attended the first meeting of the interment preparatory
office on June 7, but was absent from the second meeting held on Aug.
10.</P>
      <P>"As the Chiang family didn't make a decision on the interment
date at the Aug. 10 meeting, I think the previously scheduled
September interment may be postponed to a later date. We'll fully
respect the Chiang family's opinion," Chien said.</P>
      <P>The Chiang family sent a letter to the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) last year asking it to help with the relocation of the
two Chiangs -- who have been embalmed in interim mausoleums in
Taoyuan, northern Taiwan -- to the Wutzushan military cemetery in
Hsichih, Taipei County, for permanent interment.</P>
      <P>With the consent of President Chen Shui-bian, the MND, the
Ministry of the Interior and various other government agencies began
to plan for the relocation and burial in line with the state funeral
law. The MND has commissioned contractors to build tombs for the two
late presidents.</P>
      <P>Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Chinese
mainland to the Mao Zedong-led communist party in a bloody civil war.
He died in 1975 and his remains were embalmed in a temporary
mausoleum at Tzuhu in Taoyuan, awaiting a proper burial on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Chiang Kai-shek ruled Taiwan with an iron fist, using martial law
to suppress democracy. However, some view him as a hero for keeping
the island out of reach of the Chinese communists and claim that it
was he who fostered Taiwan's freewheeling market economy.</P>
      <P>Chiang Ching-kuo is respected for ending martial law in 1987,
shortly before his death, thus unleashing the democratic forces that
broke his family's vice-grip on power and eventually ended the
Kuomintang's half-century of rule over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988 and his remains also lie embalmed
in an interim mausoleum at Touliao in Taoyuan. His Russian-born wife
died Dec. 15, 2004 and her cremated ashes, which are being kept at
Chiang's mausoleum, will be buried along with her husband.</P>

      <P>Those who have developed cardiac diseases
after using the once-popular painkiller Vioxx can apply for drug
injury relief with the Department of Health (DOH) , an official said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Liao Chi-chou, director of the DOH's Bureau of Pharmaceutical

giant Merck &amp; Co. liable for the death of a man who took Vioxx.</P>
      <P>Jurors awarded Robert Ernst's widow, Carol, US$253.4 million in
damages, which is a combination of his lost pay as a Wal-Mart produce
manager, mental anguish, loss of companionship and punitive damages.</P>
      <P>Liao said the drug was recalled globally last September after
medical studies confirmed that Vioxx could increase the risk of
developing heart ailments.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, Liao said, the drug has all been recalled. But those
who feel ill after using Vioxx can apply for drug injury relief with
the DOH's screening committee.</P>
      <P>"If their cases are established or verified, the victims can not
only receive injury relief from the committee but can also seek
compensation from the pharmaceutical manufacturer," Liao added.</P>

Battered but Unbowed: Can Painkillers Recover?

By deciding yesterday that the Merck drug
Vioxx contributed to the death of a Texas man, a
jury dealt another punch to the battered class
of arthritis painkillers known as cox-2's. Merck
withdrew Vioxx from the market last fall over
safety concerns, and Pfizer did the same thing a
few months later with one of its cox-2 drugs,
Bextra. Some companies, including Merck and
Pfizer, are still betting on a big cox-2
comeback. Many analysts and doctors predict that
the dearth of effective painkillers and the
growing ranks of baby boomers suffering from
aching joints will drive growth in the market.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>STAMP PRINTING PROCESS AS RIGOROUS AS PRINTING MONEY</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The postage stamp design and printing
process is so rigorous that it can be equated to that for actual
money, an official with China Color, which cooperates with the
Central Engraving and Printing Plant to print stamps for Chunghwa
Post Co., said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that many production procedures have been
automated due to technological advances, stamp printing is still
highly labor-intensive, said Lin Fu-rong, a senior designer with
China Color.</P>
      <P>The stamp printing process requires a high degree of attention,
from the entrance of stacks of white paper sheets to the final
separation procedure, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Workers at the stamp printing station must count and double check
that the number of sheets fed in and the number of stamps printed out
match at the end of each production day, Lin said, adding that if the
numbers don't add up, the workers have to stay on until the source of
the error is discovered.</P>
      <P>If stamps with printing mistakes are delivered unnoticedly to the
post office, workers face stiff penalties and the even possibility of
being fired, she added.</P>
      <P>Because the stamp making process is so rigorous, Lin said, stamps
with printing flaws or some related unusual feature, such as a part
of the print design being upside, are particularly valued by
collectors, who are willing to pay thousands of dollars for such
stamps.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMPLAINT CENTER FOR FOREIGN LABORERS TO BE SET UP AT CKS AIRPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
announced Sunday that it will soon set up a service center at Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport to handle complaints by foreign
laborers.</P>
      <P>The announcement comes in the wake of criticism from a labor
organization in the Philippines that a Taiwan factory had condoned
its security guards using force against four Filipino laborers who
organized a strike to protest against the management's unreasonable
wage cuts. The laborers were then deported.</P>
      <P>Kuo Fong-yu, director general of the CLA's Bureau of Employment
and Vocational Training, noted that one cannot listen to only one
side of the story during disputes between laborers and management.</P>
      <P>Usually, if foreign laborers and employers reach agreement, the
CLA will not interfere with employers deporting foreign laborers, Kuo
said. However, he continued, in order to avoid a situation where
foreign laborers sign agreements under coercion, the CLA has decided
to set up the service center at the CKS International Airport to
provide the foreign laborers with a last channel to file complaints.</P>
      <P>Kuo said the center will be set up at the departure area of the
airport with the aim of allowing foreign laborers to freely express
their complaints without interference from their employers.</P>
      <P>There will be volunteers stationed at the center, and the
Philippine, Thai, Indonesian and Vietnamese missions in Taiwan will
also send personnel to provide support, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>He said that after the service center receives a complaint, the
CLA will begin verification work, and if the laborer or laborers are
found to indeed have been improperly treated during their stay in
Taiwan, then the employers will be disciplined and the deported
laborers will be allowed to apply to come to Taiwan again. If the
laborer is found to be responsible for a dispute, then the CLA will
agree to the deportation, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEEING IDEAS TURNED INTO STAMP DESIGN GRATIFYING: DEBUT DESIGNER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The designer of the No. 5 souvenir sheet --
Taiwan Flowers and Fruits -- for an international stamp exhibition
currently being held in Taipei said Sunday that it is very gratifying
to see one of her ideas used as the design for a stamp.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yung-hua, 28, made the remarks during an autograph session on
the third day of the six-day Taipei 2005 and 18th Asian
International Stamp Exhibition.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who graduated from Ming Chuan University where she majored
in business design, said that this is the first time that any of her
work has been used as a design for a stamp and that she is very
happy.</P>
      <P>On the layout of the stamp, she said subtropical Taiwan is
blessed with a great variety of fruits and flowers, and that the
upper half of the layout is a bamboo basket packed with such common
fruits in Taiwan as watermelon, apples, wax apples and grapes, and
that there are also sweet melons, peaches, starfruit and the
omnipresent fruit in Taiwan -- bananas -- surrounding the basket.</P>
      <P>The lower part of the stamp features diverse kinds of flowers,
including azaleas, butterfly orchids, roses, hydrangea, and
poinsettia, making the stamp both rich and colorful.</P>
      <P>Though a wide variety of fruits and flowers have been packed into
the stamp, Hsu said that she felt that there were some "jewels" left
out, such as the guava, lychee, and plum blossom.</P>
      <P>She said that some fruits and flowers had to be left out because
she had to consider the overall beauty and harmony of the design.</P>

      <P>Microsoft is touting its latest radio
frequency identification device (RFID) at the ongoing Taipei 2005 -
18th Asian International Stamp Exhibition to help post offices and
express delivery companies manage parcel tagging and tracking.</P>
      <P>The Taipei 2005 - 18th Asian International Stamp Exhibition,
which opened at the Taipei World Trade Center Aug. 19, has drawn
swarms of visitors and stamp collectors, as well as representatives
of companies, such as Microsoft, to explore the potentially lucrative
market in postal and speedy delivery services.</P>
      <P>According to Microsoft Taiwan people, post offices can
incorporate RFID into their own mail or parcel management systems for
efficient tracking of parcels on the road.</P>
      <P>Once the post office counter is equipped with RFID, the entire
courier system -- from the first post office where the parcel is
received to the destination post office where the parcel is supposed
to be delivered to the end receiver, regardless of how many "stops"
the parcel must make -- needs only one punch of information about the
parcel.</P>
      <P>After the information about the parcel is punched into a post
office's computer, the computer will print out an RFID tag which
contains the parcel's information. Once the post office worker sticks
the tag onto the departing parcel, it can tracked digitally wherever
it is.</P>
      <P>The post office can also contact the parcel senders via MSN or
mobile phone messages, allowing the senders to know their parcel's
latest whereabouts and exactly when it will arrive, the Microsoft
Taiwan people said.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Post Co., the key sponsor of the ongoing stamp
exhibition, has yet decide when or if it will sign a contract with
Microsoft to use its latest RFID technology.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH TO PURCHASE 1.5 MILLION VACCINES AGAINST POSSIBLE FLU ONSLAUGHT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug  21 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Center for Disease Control of the
Department of Health (DOH) will purchase 1.5 million flu vaccines to
cope with the possible threat of a deadly new flu strain that might
develop through mutation in the event that the influenza virus
combines with that of avian flu.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the center, said Sunday that as
Taiwan will soon enter the "flu season" in October, the DOH needs to
be well-prepared for a possible flu pandemic.</P>
      <P>He added that vaccination will begin in the second half of
September, with the high-risk groups given first priority. These
groups include people over 65 years old, infants under 2, patients
with respiratory problems, health workers, poultry farmers, butchers
and transport workers.</P>
      <P>Although the vaccines will not be able to prevent a new flu
strain or a human strain of avian flu from spreading, they can help
reduce the mortality rate among the weak and the old, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Shih also said the DOH has stashed enough Tamiflu -- a capsuled
medicine said to be highly effective against avain flu -- for 160,000
patients. He admitted that if a human strain of bird flu strikes
Taiwan, supply would become a serious problem.</P>
      <P>In a report at a National Security Council meeting last week, the
DOH warned that an estimated 5.3 million people will be infected if
an outbreak of bird flu hits Taiwan. The DOH said its has already
mapped out an emergency plan, including requesting the National
Health Research Institutes (NHRI) to develop a drug against avian
flu.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a spokesman for the NHRI disclosed that research is
near completion at the NHRI in the development of a Taiwan version of
Tamiflu, and that such technology can be transferred to domestic
biopharmaceutical companies early next year.</P>
      <P>Avian flu was first known to have jumped from chickens to humans
in 1997. The disease has killed millions of birds in Southeast Asia
since 2004 and recorded a 70 percent mortality rate in the first 70
people known to have been infected. There are widespread worries in
the international community that the next outbreak of a lethal global
flu pandemic may kill billions of people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>4,500 SMUGGLED BIRDS FROM CHINA TO BE DESTROYED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug.  21 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan coast guard forces confiscated
4,500 birds aboard a fishing boat that was trying to smuggle them
from China into the southern Taiwan port of Kaohsiung Sunday.</P>
      <P>As China has been listed as an avian flu affected area, the birds
will be destroyed, officials said. Taiwan is currently listed as a
non-affected area.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung-registered fishing boat "Yung Chi Fa" was
transporting the birds, including Indian Grackle, song thrush and Red
Beak, from a Chinese fishing boat in the Taiwan Strait, according to
the Coast Guard Administration.</P>
      <P>Coast guard vessels intercepted the "Yung Chi Fa" and arrested
its captain, Chen Sze-fu, 37, and fisherman Tseng Man-teh, 24, both
of whom were trying to cover the birds' chirping sounds with the
boat's loud engines.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, the Council of Agriculture (COA) urged the public not
to smuggle fowl and poultry, whose illegal importation might deal a
severe blow to Taiwan's poultry industry and threaten public health.</P>
      <P>A Department of Health report has warned that a mutated strain of
the avian flu virus could cause a global outbreak. In one scenario,
as many as 5.3 million people could be stricken with the virus in
Taiwan, which would have an impact on Taiwan's society and economy 10
times more severe than that of the SARS epidemic in 2003, according
to the report.</P>
      <P>The COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and
Quarantine said the government has beefed up monitoring of migrant
birds and reminded farm workers to step up preventive measures,
including vaccination of humans.</P>
      <P>Stopping the smuggling of birds and poultry is another way to
keep Taiwan from being affected, according to the bureau, which vowed
to cooperate with other government agencies in cracking down on
illegal imports of birds and poultry.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu appealed Sunday
to leaders of Taiwan's religious community to use their influence to
raise public awareness of the importance of conserving the natural
environment to ensure the country's sustainable development.</P>
      <P>Referring to what she saw during a helicopter trip to mountainous
areas in the northern counties of Taoyuan, Hsinchu and Miaoli as an
"environmental nightmare, " Lu called for members of the religious
community to help "enlighten" the Taiwan public to become more
environmentally friendly.</P>
      <P>In a speech to a nationwide convention of vegetarian Buddhist
monks held at the Linkou Stadium in Taoyuan County, Lu urged the
religious leaders to promote conservation in the spirit of
"respecting heaven, cherishing the Earth and loving the people."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lu appealed to the Taiwan public to help prevent the
outbreak of epidemic diseases, such as severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) and avian flu, by improving personal hygiene,
upgrading public sanitation and conserving the environment.</P>
      <P>With global warming and the outbreaks of diseases around the
world, Taiwan has been experiencing some "uneasy years, " Lu said,
warning that Taiwan will face another severe challenge of the
possible outbreak of epidemic diseases this winter and next spring.</P>
      <P>Noting that the world was battered by three major epidemics, in
1919, 1957 and 1968, Lu said that avian flu threatens to be the next
major scourge.</P>

      <P>Newly-sworn in opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou vowed Sunday that the oft-talked about and
long-disputed issue of the KMT's assets will be solved before the end
of 2008.</P>
      <P>Ma said that all KMT assets, including the KMT Central Committee
Building, will be handled based on the principles of law, justice and
fairness to demonstrate the party's resolve in reforming itself and
to win back the hearts and souls of its supporters. He said dealing
with the issue is important to re-establish the party's "plain and
honest" image from the era when President Chiang Ching-kuo was at the
helm.</P>
      <P>Ma, who has sworn that the KMT will win back power from the
Democratic Progressive Party in the 2008 presidential election,
stressed the imperative of delegating power within the party
apparatus to the younger generation.</P>
      <P>He said that one of his priorities as the KMT leader is to give
more opportunities to young party members to take up more important
party jobs or to run for public office posts.</P>
      <P>Only by continuing to cultivate younger members and injecting new
blood into the party can the KMT avoid witnessing a "fault of

    <TEXT>
      <P>As part of the government's efforts to
double tourist arrivals to Taiwan, relevant agencies are considering
allowing foreign tourists to get their tax rebates directly at
department stores instead of at airports upon departure.</P>
      <P>Council for Economic Planning and Development Vice Chairman
Thomas Yeh made the revelation following a Cabinet meeting over the
weekend.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, officials of the Tourism Bureau under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications suggested the
simplification in the existing tax rebate measures for foreign
tourists.</P>
      <P>To that end, the Ministry of Finance is planning to include
Taiwan specialty products, such as ceramics, wooden sculptures, tea
and marble items, in the tax rebate list, Yeh said, adding that
foreign tourists can enjoy a 5 percent tax rebate as long as their
purchases in Taiwan exceed NT$3,000 (about US$95).</P>
      <P>In addition, the Ministry of Finance is also considering reducing
the minimum amount of capital required to open a duty-free store,

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HOUSING MARKET NOT EXPECTED TO EXPERIENCE BUBBLE: EXPERTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's real estate market is unlikely to
experience a bubble as supply and demand in the domestic housing
market has remained within reasonable levels in recent years, experts
said at a seminar sponsored by the Taiwan Research Institute over the
weekend.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the seminar on whether a bubble is forming in the
global real estate market, local experts opined that a bubble is
unlikely to occur in Taiwan as prices in the domestic housing market
have not surged as much as in other countries in recent years.</P>
      <P>They predicted that domestic house prices will remain stable in
the years ahead on the grounds that supply is on the rise and that
house ownership rates have reached around 85 percent.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the domestic real estate market has become
quite mature after having gone through a serious recession during the
1990-2002 period, they said that the most recent surge, from June
2003 to May 2004, only saw a hike in housing prices of between 5
percent and 10 percent, which is tiny in comparison to the over 100
percent hikes seen in developed countries over the past five years.</P>
      <P>According to a recent report by the Economist, the total value of
the housing market in developed countries swelled from US$30 trillion
to US$70 trillion in the last five years, the largest real estate
bubble in history.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the possible impact on Taiwan's housing market of
the recent 2 percent revaluation upward of mainland China's currency
-- the renminbi, the experts contended that the domestic market will
be affected mainly by long-term economic prospects rather than by any
short-term fluctuations in currency values.</P>
      <P>The small appreciation of the renminbi will have no impact on
Taiwan's economy, and foreign hot money is not expected to flow into
Taiwan on rampant speculation that the renminbi will further
appreciate in the near term, they said, claiming that China's efforts
to stem its red-hot economy will likely have a greater impact on
Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) disclosed
Sunday that new provisions may be added to the artificial births bill
being drafted by the DOH to allow surrogate motherhood under certain
conditions.</P>
      <P>The DOH said that the draft law would allow a childless couple
with infertility problems to use a surrogate mother if they can
provide their own egg and sperm for artificial insemination. The law
would require that the surrogate mother must be an adult with
successful childbearing experience.</P>
      <P>The surrogate mother may get paid for her service, and there is
no restriction as to her nationality. She will also be entitled to
financial compensation to cover her hospital bills, losses of pay
from her job due to pregnancy, and expenses for transportation and
nutrition, according to the bill.</P>
      <P>However, voices from the medical circle warned that if the bill
gets passed in its current form, commercial brokers may emerge and
try to find foreign women working in Taiwan's factories and
households to become surrogate mothers.</P>
      <P>While acknowledging the good intentions of the DOH in adding the
new provisions, some medical doctors expressed concerns that couples
who are unable to bear a child may make use of the law's loopholes
and work with crooked brokers to encourage women laborers from
southeast Asian countries like the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam
to provide the service in exchange for money.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT SELLING ASSETS CHEAPLY IS NOT THE SAME AS RETURNING THEM: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, August 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
sells the National Development Institute (NDI) cheaply, this will not
be an action that represents returning its "ill-gotten" assets to the
people, Su Tseng-chang, chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks before joining Legislator Wang Toh, DPP
candidate for Keelung mayor, for a campaign activity in the northern
Taiwan city.</P>
      <P>On vows by the new KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou that he will deal
with the issue of the party's assets based on "the principles of
law, justice, and fairness" by 2008 to show the party's resolve in
reforming itself, Su said selling the party's assets cheaply does not
equate to returning them to the people.</P>
      <P>Su said that the NDI, the KMT's school for nurturing future
leaders of the nation, is not a legitimate asset of the KMT's and
that it therefore doesn't make sense to consider the KMT selling it
as equating to returning it to the people.</P>
      <P>The NDI, located in the Wenshan district of Taipei, is made up of
28 land lots totaling 78,541 square meters. The listed value of the
land currently stands at more than NT$5.2 billion (US$185.07
million).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), an ally of the DPP,
urged Ma not to agree to the selling of the NDI.</P>
      <P>Huang Shih-cho, a TSU caucus whip in the legislature, said that
the KMT had used the means of threats and intimidation to obtain
the NDI land, urging Ma to veto its sale.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks following reports that a prospective buyer
has signed an initial agreement with the KMT for the land and that
the formal transaction contract must be signed by Aug. 25. According
to the report, former KMT Chairman Lien Chan did not give any
instructions as to whether he agreed to the land's sale, and the
matter is now in Ma's hands to deal with at his own discretion.</P>
      <P>Huang reiterated that the "ill-gotten" assets of the KMT should
be returned to the people, especially because the land of the NDI was
obtained during the authoritarian era, and that the previous owners
of the land are now filing suits to challenge its sale.</P>
      <P>He also said that the KMT is anxious to sell the land with the
aim of "laundering its ill-gotten wealth and making the property of
the people into cash to finance the party's needs."</P>
      <P>The TSU condemns the actions of the KMT, Huang said, urging the
judicial authorities to intervene in the transaction.</P>
      <P>He also urged those conglomerates who intend to buy the NDI land
not to act against their conscience and social responsibility,
cautioning that they face possible ownership problems after the deal.</P>
      <P>Huang also urged Ma to support the passage in the next
legislative session of a bill governing the assets of political
parties.</P>
      <P>The DPP tried to put the bill on the Legislative Yuan's agenda in
the last session but failed because the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the KMT and its ally, the People First Party, who
together command a slight majority, blocked it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO SPEND NT$1 B. TO CLEAN UP DANSHUI RIVER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) will spend NT$1 billion (US$31.1 million) over the next three
years to clean up Danshui (Tamsui) River that runs through Taiwan's
most densely populated area, officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>EPA Minister Chang Kow-Lung said his staff have drafted a plan to
build seven waste water processing centers and complete three
ecological engineering projects along the northern Taiwan river.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks during a publicity activity aimed at
encouraging more people to volunteer as patrol guards to help prevent
dumping on river banks.</P>
      <P>EPA statistics show that 12.9 percent of Danshui River are
seriously polluted, down from 21.84 percent two years ago. The
three-year plan will focus on cleaning up the polluted sections of
the river.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh, who was also attending the activity, used
his "Kaohsiung City experience" as an example, saying that increasing
water sewages and waste processing facilities had improved the water
quality of that city's Love River.</P>
      <P>Now Love River no longer smells, along the river real estate
prices have gone up, and as a result tourism and leisure industries
are booming, a telling example of symbiosis between man and nature,
Hsieh added.</P>
      <P>Chang said Taiwan's river have been polluted mainly because too
few sewage systems and waste processing stations have been installed,
and household and farming waste water have been flowing into rivers.</P>
      <P>He urged local governments to budget more money for building
sewage systems and waste processing centers to stop waste water
entering rivers.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou stressed the close historical ties between KMT and Taiwan
Sunday in an attempt to dispel criticism that KMT is an alien regime
intruding into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting of the KMT Advisory Committee, Ma said ,
the party should emphasized its historical ties with Taiwan, in
addition to its Chinese root.</P>
      <P>Citing the story of a late Taiwanese painter Liao Chin-ping as an
example, Ma said Liao donated funds to KMT-founder Sun Yat-sen in
1913 when Sun arrived in Taipei on his way to exile in Japan after
KMT lost a war against then Chinese President Yuan Shih-kai.</P>
      <P>In appreciation of Liao's donation, Sun gave Liao a bottle of
whisky which was kept by Liao's son after Liao was killed in 1947
when the KMT-led government cracked down ruthlessly a disturbance in
Taiwan known as the 228 Incident.</P>
      <P>Liao's son gave the liquor to Ma at a ceremony marking the 228
incident this year in Taipei, and disclosing the friendship between
his late father and Sun Yat-sen, Ma said, adding that he was deeply
moved by the story which is footnote to the KMT's close ties with
Taiwan, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"Those who claimed that Kuomintang is an alien regime are just
ignorant of the history." Ma said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FRUIT TO FACE STIFF COMPETITION IN CHINA: PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
Taiwan fruits will face stiff competition in the Chinese market once
the mainland people's "fever" for them subsides.</P>
      <P>President Chen made the remarks on Taiwan fruit exports to China
while receiving 10 winners of outstanding agricultural expert awards
at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The president noted that the government will take good care of
Taiwan's farmers. He also suggested that they "look to the future, "
instead of focusing on short-term gains.</P>
      <P>The farmers should upgrade their competitive edge and target
those high income nations such as Singapore, Japan, the United States
and those in Europe, the president said.</P>
      <P>He said that although Taiwan fruits have enjoyed brisk sales in
China since Beijing's announcement to provide zero-tariff treatment
for 15 varieties of Taiwan fruits starting this month, the "fever"
has rapidly been subsiding and the issue will have to return to
market economy fundamentals. </P>
      <P>Compared with Japan, China has lower standards in terms of
quarantine, inspection and food sanitation, the president said,
adding that for this reason, even though Taiwan fruits enjoy
duty-free treatment, they still have to face competition from cheap
fruits from Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that because Japan has high standards in terms of
accepting imports, Taiwan produce will be assured of market share in
Japan if it can make inroads into that country. He added that
Japanese consumers are willing to pay higher prices for safe,
high-quality produce.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STAMP DESIGNER FEELS LIKE A MOVIE STAR AT AUTOGRAPH EVENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The designer of the No. 6 souvenir sheet --
Taiwan Festivals -- for the Taipei 2005 - 18th Asian International
Stamp Exhibition currently being held at the Taipei World Trade
Center said Monday that she felt like a movie star when she was
giving out her autograph to collectors who waited in a long line to
see her.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-wen, 26, said she had the jitters with so many people
waiting for her autograph -- the first time this has happened in her
young life -- although she said the collectors' enthusiasm boosted her
ego tremendously.</P>
      <P>Chen said she spent about six months on the design after signing
a contract with Chunghwa Post Co., the key sponsor of the exhibition.
To stress the significance of Taiwan festivals, Chen said, she picked
images of several traditional festivals that she considers as the
most representative of Taiwanese culture and religions as the
material of her design for the No. 6 souvenir sheet -- the burning
of ships for the God of the Plague; the Bunun tribesmen's deer ear
shooting ritual; and the Dragon Boat Festival.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that as a designer of printed commercial pamphlets,
mostly DMs, which have short shelf lives and little artistic value,
she was really flattered to be asked to design stamps.</P>
      <P>To publicize and celebrate the occasion, Chunghwa Post is issuing
a series of eight separate souvenir sheets. The first and second --
No. 1 Taiwan Landscape and No. 2 Taiwan Culture -- were released on

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG MTR FOREIGN WORKERS RIOT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Over 100 foreign workers, mostly Thais,
rioted against what they called "unfair and unjust" management in
Kangshan, suburban Kaohsiung, by burning houses, cars and facilities,
and attacking police Sunday night. No serious injuries were reported.</P>
      <P>Police said the incident occurred when several Thai workers
returned to their dormitory with liquor and cigarettes, which are
banned from the premises. When they were prevented from entering the
dormitory, they vented their anger by burning houses, breaking
glasses and throwing stones at the management staff, some of whom
were beaten up.</P>
      <P>Riot police were called in to restore order, and the rioting
workers sent delegates to negotiate with the human resources company
that brought them to work in Taiwan. The negotiations went on until a
little past 7:00 a.m. Monday before breaking down.</P>
      <P>The government has dispatched Council of Labor Affairs officials
down to Kaohsiung and the Thai representative office came forward to
try and mediate.</P>
      <P>By noon, peace returned to the Kangshan foreign workers' living
quarters that were built to accommodate 3,000 people hired to build
Kaohsiung's mass rapid transit system. At present, only 1,700 foreign
workers, mostly Thais, are living there.</P>
      <P>Thai workers were seen taking the initiative to clean up the mess
they had created, but police said they would gather evidence and
charge those who led the rioting.</P>
      <P>The workers demanded that they be allowed to use cell phones,
that food quality at the cafeterias be improved and that a satellite
dish be installed so they can watch TV programs from their home
country.</P>
      <P>They also protested the management company's unreasonable way of
payment -- for each 100 hours of overtime, they are only paid for 46
hours.</P>
      <P>Another disgruntlement of the workers was that they could not
take back food and daily necessities that were not purchased at the
dormitory store -- what they called a form of exploitation.</P>
      <P>The Huapan Administration Consultant Co. Ltd. would not comment
on the accusations as negotiations were continuing.</P>
      <P>Some 94,000 Thai workers are currently in Taiwan, the largest
foreign group followed by those from the Philippines and Vietnam.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Rare and valuable stamps were a big draw at
the Taipei 2005 and 18th Asian International Stamp Exhibition and one
of the more fascinating exhibits was the 10-stamp sheet Dr. Sun
Yat-sen issue, New York print, on which the image of the founding
father of the Republic of China was printed upside down.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Post Co., main sponsor of the six-day event, said that
it is the only 10-stamp sheet of this issue in the world.</P>
      <P>The sheet is now owned by Huang Ming-fang, president of the
Chinese Taipei Philatelic Society, Chunghwa Post officials said.</P>
      <P>According to Chunghwa Post, the value of stamps hinges on
several factors, and one of them is errors.</P>
      <P>The ROC post authorities commissioned American Bank Note Co. to
print the Dr. Sun Yat-sen issue, and the stamps were issued in 1941,
and the mistake was not found until 1945 when a junior high school
student found the image of Dr. Sun was printed upside down.</P>
      <P>Huang said that a single Dr. Sun issue could fetch between NT$1.8
million (US$56,250) and NT$2 million, and that the 10-stamp sheet is
estimated at NT$25 million.</P>

    <DATELINE>Beijing, Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By C. L. Tseng and  Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's People First Party (PFP) Chairman
James Soong is expected to preside over a cross-Taiwan Strait
economic forum next month in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>The matter was discussed during a meeting Monday between a
visiting PFP delegation led by PFP Secretary-General Chin Chin-sheng
and Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under the
Beijing-based State Council. It will be Soong's second visit to China
this year following a visit in May.</P>
      <P>Speaking following a working meeting between the two parties
later the same day, PFP Policy Center Director Chang Hsien-yao said
that his party prefers to start engagement with the Chinese side
through the most urgent and less complex economic and financial
issues, such as cargo and passenger services and financial
cooperation, amid highly sensitive cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The Shanghai forum will only touch on cross-strait trade and
economic issues and exclude complicated political issues, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, representatives of major trade associations
and chief executive officers of various leading enterprises from the
United States, Europe and Japan will be invited to take part in
discussions centering on the opening of direct cross-strait trade,
transport and postal links, and the impact on foreign investment in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The PFP hopes to fully implement the six-point consensus reached
in the May 12 meeting between Soong and Communist Party of China
(CPC) General Secretary Hu Jintao that calls for an early
commencement of cross-strait talks, the ending of hostilities between
the two sides, the stepping up of Taiwan-China exchanges and two-way
cooperative mechanisms, and the opposing of Taiwan independence, he
said.</P>
      <P>In the coming PFP-CPC working meetings, the two sides are
expected to talk over substantial issues related to mainland-based
Taiwan business people and students and the establishment of free
trade zones.</P>
      <P>Soong is currently in the United States and is slated to return
to Taiwan this week.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a 30-member legislative mission led by PFP lawmaker
Christina Y. Liu arrived in Shanghai Sunday to attend a 2005 cross-
strait financial forum.</P>
      <P>The group will visit the Shanghai stock exchange Monday and will
call at the newly inaugurated headquarters of the People's Bank of
China -- the Chinese central bank -- in Shanghai Tuesday, where they
will hold talks with its vice governors on currency exchange
mechanisms between the new Taiwan dollar and the renminbi, Liu said.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, they hope to discuss and exchange views with
Chinese central bank officials on substantial issues related to
Taiwan investors to help protect Taiwan business interest in China.</P>

      <P>A 10-member group of legislators from
Taiwan's major political parties departed for Japan Monday for a
four-day visit, where they will exchange views on security issues
with Japanese dietmen and think tank members.</P>
      <P>The group will first call on Koh Se-kai, Taiwan's top

security policies and its relations with neighboring countries. It
will also visit dietmen at the Japanese upper house's Foreign Affairs
and Defense Committee and hold seminars with think tank members
attached to the Japanese Defense Agency and retired military
generals.</P>
      <P>Lee Wen-chung, a legislator of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , said that there has been a nuanced change in Japan's
attitude toward Taiwan in the face of a rising China.</P>
      <P>Military exchanges between Taiwan and Japan were stalemated for a
long time in the past due to Japan's softness toward China, but Japan
began to pay greater importance to security in the Taiwan Strait
since two or three years ago out of fears that a cross-strait
conflict will cut the lifelines of its foreign trade and oil supply,
he explained.</P>
      <P>Lee described the legislative group's visit to Japan as an
"ice-breaking" trip, as it is the first military exchange between
National Defense Committee lawmakers and their Japanese counterparts
in many years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER APPEALS FOR LENIENCY FOR FOREIGN LABORERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh appealed to relevant
government agencies Monday to be lenient with foreign laborers,
saying that the country should extend greater hospitality to the
foreign nationals who are here doing laborious jobs that many Taiwan
citizens would rather not do.</P>
      <P>Noting that efforts to protect the foreign laborers' basic human
rights and interests should be made regularly, Hsieh said that it
would be a "bad thing" if the laborers' dissatisfaction or
indignation with their Taiwan managers came to a head to become a
riot like what occurred in Koahsiung between late Sunday night and
early Monday morning.</P>
      <P>The premier said he has already directed the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) to look into the latest incident, which was rare since
Taiwan began to introduce foreign workers, mostly from Southeast
Asian countries, in the early 1990s.</P>
      <P>Over 100 foreign workers, mostly Thais, rioted against what they
called "unfair and unjust" management at the Kaohsiung Mass Rapid
Transit Bureau, southern Taiwan, by burning cars and a makeshift
office of the Kaohsiung MRT authorities, as well as attacking police
Sunday night. No serious injuries were reported.</P>
      <P>Police said the incident occurred when several Thai workers
returned to their dormitory with liquor and cigarettes, which are
banned from the premises. When they were prevented from entering the
dormitory, they vented their anger by setting fire to the MRT office,
breaking glass and hurling rocks at the management staff, some of
whom were beaten up.</P>
      <P>Riot police were called in to restore order, and the rioting
workers sent delegates to negotiate with the human resources company
that brought them to work in Taiwan. The negotiations went on until a
little past 7:00 a.m. Monday.</P>
      <P>By noon, peace was restored at the Kangshan foreign workers'
living quarters that were built to accommodate 3,000 people hired to
build the Kaohsiung MRT system.</P>
      <P>Kuo Fang-yu, director-general of the CLA Employment and
Vocational Training Administration, said that officials from the
Kaohsiung Police Department, the Kaohsiung Bureau of Labor Affairs
and the Thai liaison office in Taiwan have begun investigating the
incident.</P>
      <P>If the investigation results find that the management or the
Kaohsiung MRT Bureau, which hired the Thai workers to build a subway
line, was at fault, they will be dealt with in accordance with the
Employment Law, could have their right to hire foreign workers
canceled, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>He added that if the Thai workers are found to be guilty of
disturbing Taiwan's social order, they could also be punished,
including having their work permits nullified.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai expressed concern
about the incident, urging all related parties to step forward to
resolve the management-labor controversy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Chen also called for the Thai workers' brokerage firm to mediate
so that the laborers can resume their work to prevent the MRT project
from being disrupted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The riot by around 100 Thai laborers
working on Kaohsiung's mass rapid transit railway project reached a
happy ending Monday after their manpower management company agreed to
meet most of their demands for better treatment.</P>
      <P>Officials from the representative office of Thailand in Taiwan
and executives of the Huapan Manpower Consultant and Management Co.
entered the dormitory under the protection of riot police to
negotiate with the laborers and listen to their complaints.</P>
      <P>The foreign workers raised 16 demands, including lifting the ban
on drinking alcohol in the dormitory, allowing them to use mobile
phones in the dorm, putting up a satellite dish so that they could
watch TV programs from their home country, and allowing them to have
the full overtime pay they deserve.</P>
      <P>The Thai officials and Huapan executives, together with
representatives from the local police precinct and the District
Attorney's Office, held a meeting Monday afternoon at the cultural
bureau of Kaohsiung County, trying to work out solutions to the
problems.</P>
      <P>The manpower management company eventually agreed to 14 of the 16
demands from the foreign laborers, who then agreed to resume working
from Tuesday and allowed sanitation workers to enter the dormitory to
clean up the debris from the riot.</P>
      <P>By 2 p.m. Monday, most of the police sent to the riot scene had
been withdrawn, leaving only a small force to stand guard.</P>
      <P>The riot started Sunday evening at the foreign laborers's
dormitory in Kangshan when management staff tried to stop some Thai
workers from taking alcohol into the living quarters.</P>
      <P>Angry foreign workers who had been unhappy for a long time about
such rigid treatment set fire to a house and cars, and smashed doors
and windows of the manager's office. They even threw stones at the
fire fighters who rushed to the scene to fight the flames.</P>
      <P>The management estimated that the riot caused a NT$10 million
loss to Huapan Co., whose four two-story dormitories provide shelter
to 1,720 foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>One of the complaints by the Thai workers was that they received
only 46 hours of overtime pay for the 100 hours of overtime they
worked each month, without a description from the management about
how much was withheld and for what purposes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kaohsiung County Police were still collecting evidence
in preparation for arrests and prosecution of those who started the
riot on charges of arson, damage to cars and office materials.</P>

    <DATELINE>Johannesburg,  Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As expatriates from Taiwan and China
are interacting more and more often, Taiwan's top envoy to South
Africa said Tuesday such interactions should aim at increasing
goodwill instead of forcing the other side to go against its own
principles and interests.</P>
      <P>Richard Shih made his comments as some Taiwanese expats in South
Africa seem to feel frustrated in the face of a growing and much
larger overseas Chinese community that is supported by an
economically strong motherland.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's expat community in South Africa is estimated to be
8,000-strong, while legal and illegal Chinese immigrants, including
refugees, total 300,000, naturally becoming a focus of Chinese
language media coverage.</P>
      <P>By comparison, Taiwan immigrants appear much "quieter" than their
Chinese counterparts. However, Shih said only mature people would
remain composed and only when one is calm enough will he see a chance
for change.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the strengths of both sides of the Taiwan Strait, Shih
said China is 265 times larger than Taiwan, and its population is 60
times larger. However, according to APEC data, China's two-way trade
of US$850 billion last year was but 2.49 times that of Taiwan, which
stood at US$340 billion, he added.</P>
      <P>China's GDP, totalling US$1.60 trillion last year, was 5.21 times
that of Taiwan, which was US$307 billion. When it comes to per capita
GDP, Taiwan's US$14,000 was 12 times that of China's US$1,200, Shih
told a group of Taiwan expats attending a volunteers' training
session.</P>
      <P>He quoted an article by famous critic Lung Ying-tai as saying
that a big difference between Taiwan and China was their way of life,
as Lung believes Taiwan's way of life will have a positive influence
on China, forcing it to uplift itself to the ranks of more liberal
and democratic countries.</P>
      <P>A Global Visions Monthly article, commenting on a survey of
Taiwan's biggest 700 listed companies, indicated that as Taiwan's
enterprises become institutionally entrenched, they also become more
and more mature, Shih continued.</P>
      <P>He went on to quote Commonwealth magazine as reporting that
Taiwan's businesses have gradually grown from OEM mode to creating
their own brands, another indication of their maturing.</P>
      <P>In a letter to the editor, the Democratic Progressive Party's
former chairman, Lin Yi-hsiung, stressed the importance of good faith
and goodwill if the ruling and opposition parties in Taiwan as well
as the governments on the two sides of the Strait are to seek
rapprochement.</P>
      <P>Shih compared China's rapid economic growth to an adolescent, and
Taiwan's growth to a stable and mature grown-up. He estimated that it
will take China another 20 or 30 years before its economy reaches
Taiwan's current level.</P>
      <P>Since the two sides of the Strait are developing at different
levels, each searching for a new direction, interactions by their
expat communities are unavoidable but should proceed in such as way
as to be mutually beneficial.</P>
      <P>He said the most basic foundations for such interactions are
trust and good faith. "If one side tries to coerce the other to give
up its own principles without building mutual trust first, the
interactions will become meaningless," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT RANKING OFFICIALS VISIT PFP COUNTERPARTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of ranking Kuomintang (KMT)
officials, led by Secretary-General Chan Chuen-po, paid a courtesy
visit Monday to the People First Party (PFP) in an effort to
strengthen bilateral ties ahead of the December city and county chief
elections.</P>
      <P>Both KMT spokeswoman Cheng Lee-wen and PFP spokesman Hsieh
Kung-ping confirmed following the 40-minute meeting that it was held
in a cordial atmosphere and that the two parties reached a tentative
agreement to cooperate in the year-end local elections based on the
principles of "respecting public opinion and making good on promises
through institutionalized mechanisms."</P>
      <P>The principles echo the major direction outlined a few days ago
by KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou regarding a "pan-blue alliance"
cooperation in the coming elections, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that a wide range of issues were touched upon during
the meeting, but added that concrete details are yet to be further
worked out when PFP Secretary-General Chin Chin-sheng has returned
from a visit in China. "Every effort will be done to score victories
in the elections," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Chan paid the visit to the PFP on behalf of KMT Chairman Ma, who
officially took over the baton at the chairman office in the KMT
headquarters earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>Chan relayed Ma's hope for a meeting with PFP Chairman James
Soong to PFP Deputy Secretary-General Liao Tsang-song to forge better
interactions between the two parties based on the exiting common
ground. Soong is currently in the United States and is slated to
return to Taiwan this week.</P>
      <P>Liao also expressed the hope for a better PFP-KMT relationship,
saying that close cooperation will be the centerpiece when it comes
to the future path of the two political allies.</P>
      <P>The main opposition KMT, the PFP and the New Party formed the
"pan-blue alliance" prior to the 2004 presidential race against the
"pan green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and
the Taiwan Solidarity Union. President Chen Shui-bian of the DPP was
re-elected in the fierce race.</P>

      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Monday that the
Executive Yuan Development Fund will appropriate NT$20 billion over
the next five years to boost the development of digital content
industries or creative and cultural industries.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks while presiding over a coordination
meeting aimed at rejuvenating the nation's stagnant movie industry.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that the Executive Yuan has held such a
meeting to accentuate the government's resolve to help promote the
development of digital content industries, including the production
of visual arts products, such as quality movies and television
dramas.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the government is considering emulating South Korea's
successful movie industry development formula by setting up a special
institute to handle fund-raising, talent cultivation and marketing
for movie production.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, Hsieh said, the Executive Yuan Development Fund will
play a "flagship" role in the development of creative and cultural

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) will
step up its supervision of enterprises hiring 100 or more foreign
workers to ensure that the workers are not mistreated, a senior CLA
official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lai Chin-lin, deputy minister of the CLA, made the pledge after
over 100 Thai laborers working on the mass rapid transit railway
project in Kaohsiung City rioted Sunday to protest mistreatment they
are alleged to have received from the manpower management company.</P>
      <P>The riot was triggered when some Thai laborers were prevented
from drinking in their dormitory at Kangshan in Kaohsiung County.
They set fire to a house, smashed the management office and damaged
four cars, causing NT$10 million-worth of losses to the Huapan
Manpower Management Co.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the riot, Lai said the incident not only affected
social order but also damaged Taiwan's global image.</P>
      <P>He said the CLA will invite scholars, experts, officials from the

      <P>Lai also said that in order to prevent similar incidents from
happening again, the CLA will set up a special team to make

      <P>According to statistics compiled by the CLA, there are about 700

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Government Information Office (GIO)
will be able to dole out the money donated to charities for tsunami
relief late this month or early next month, GIO Minister Pasuya Yao
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yao was responding to reports that several months after a charity
campaign initiated by the GIO to collect money to help sponsor
children after last December's tsunami in Southeast Asia, the money
still has yet to reach the hands of charities, which have been
commissioned by the government for tsunami relief.</P>
      <P>Tsai Sung-lin, a national policy adviser to President Chen
Shui-bian, criticized the long-stalled program, believing it
will affect the government's image, the reports also said.</P>
      <P>Yao clarified that all donations will be put into construction
and relief work as planned and will be executed via non-governmental
organizations, and there is absolutely no delay.</P>
      <P>But he also said that the donations collected by the government
or certain enterprises will have to undergo a set of budgetary and
appropriation procedures which may take some time to channel the
money to the NGOs.</P>
      <P>This is not a question of government negligence or efficiency,
Yao said, adding that in fact rigorous monitoring procedures will
ensure that no money donated will be wasted.</P>
      <P>Yao also said that Lin Chia-lung, his predecessor who initiated
the sponsoring tsunami-children campaign, had thought about this
problem. This is why he had an agreement with the NGOs that they
waste no time and work first for disaster relief, according to Yao.</P>
      <P>There may be some mistake because some NGOs have waited too long,
Yao said, adding, however, that the GIO will definitely appropriate
the promised money.</P>
      <P>Lin, who quit the job earlier this year to run for Taichung
mayor, said Monday that the appropriation of the money was stalled
because of procedural questions.</P>
      <P>He said that audit authorities have asked that the donated money

      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh told European business
leaders based in Taiwan that the government's proposed minimum tax
policy will not be retroactive and that all contracts being
implemented or having been signed will not be subject to the new
measure.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with delegates from the European Chamber of
Commerce in Taipei, the premier reassured them that deals that have
been approved for tax benefits will not be affected by the proposed
tax reform package.</P>
      <P>The government proposal has yet to win Legislative Yuan approval

      <P>According to a draft law by the Ministry of Finance, businesses

rate of 20 percent. The local business community has voiced
opposition to the proposed tax rates, which they claim are too high.</P>

    <DATELINE>Bangkok, Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By S.C. Wu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A riot by around 100 Thai laborers working
on the mass rapid transit (MRT) railway project in the southern city
of Kaohsiung will not affect labor cooperation between Taiwan and
Thailand, a Thai labor administrator said Monday.</P>
      <P>Supat Gukun, a Thai Labor and Social Welfare Department division
chief in charge of overseas employment affairs, made the remarks
after the riot was resolved earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Supat said he was pleased to learn that the incident had come to
a satisfactory ending as the disgruntled Thai laborers agreed to
resume working from Tuesday after their Taiwan manpower management
company assented to meet most of their demands for better treatment.</P>
      <P>According to Supat, the Thai labor department has been keeping in
close contact with the Taiwan authorities since it was informed of
the incident that started late Sunday and ended Monday afternoon.</P>
      <P>In the process, Supat said the Thai labor department has asked
the Thai laborers to remain calm and has promised them assistance in
communicating with their Taiwan employer.</P>
      <P>Supat said the incident probably resulted from poor
labor-management communications or misunderstanding. Noting that each
country has different cultures and mores, Supat said Thai workers
should abide by Taiwan law and adapt to Taiwan's work culture and
ethics.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, he said, Taiwanese employers should also gain
a better understanding of Thai culture and lifestyles and refrain
from imposing unreasonable restrictions on Thai workers everyday life
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Supat said he believes the incident was instigated by only a
handful of Thai laborers. "The riot will not affect cooperative ties
between Thai and Taiwan labor authorities," he added.</P>
      <P>The riot started Sunday evening at the foreign laborers'
dormitory in Kangshan, Kaohsiung County, when management staff tried
to stop some Thai workers from taking alcohol into the living
quarters.</P>
      <P>Angry foreign workers, who had been unhappy for a long time about
such rigid treatment, set fire to a house and cars, and smashed doors
and windows of the manager's office. They even threw stones at
firefighters who came to extinguish the blaze.</P>
      <P>Officials from the representative office of Thailand in Taiwan
and executives of the Huapan Manpower Consultant and Management Co.,
together with representatives from the local police precinct and the
district prosecutor's ofice, held a meeting Monday afternoon at the
cultural bureau of Kaohsiung County, trying to work out solutions to
the problems.</P>
      <P>The manpower management company eventually agreed to 14 of the 16
demands from the foreign laborers, who then agreed to resume working
from Tuesday and allowed sanitation workers to enter the dormitory to
clean up the debris from the riot.</P>
      <P>By 2 p.m., most of the police sent to the riot scene had been
withdrawn, leaving only a small force to stand guard.</P>
      <P>The management estimated that the riot caused losses of NT$10
million to Huapan Co., whose four two-story dormitories provide
shelter to 1,720 foreign laborers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In the face of China's rise, which is
threatening regional security, Taiwan should step up cooperation with
other countries in the areas of energy exploration and environmental
protection, a government advisory board recommended Monday.</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council's Advisory Committee said China has
tried to reduce international suspicion about its "peaceful rise" by
adopting a less threatening phrase -- "peaceful development."</P>
      <P>According to the committee, the international community realizes
the fact of China's rise, but "is not sure of" China's intentions or
how to deal with a rising China.</P>
      <P>Except for the United States and Japan, which have adopted a
relatively ambiguous attitude toward China's growing power, many
other countries have opted to enter into closer cooperation with
China, according to the MAC committee.</P>
      <P>It warned people not to underestimate the impact of China's rise
on the international balance of power and on the world's energy needs
as well as ecology.</P>
      <P>It also claimed that the economic effects of China's rise have
been exaggerated.</P>
      <P>The committee suggested that the government pool Taiwan's China
study resources and devote more manpower to researching the mid- and
long-term development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations as a means to
raise Taiwan's international status in the area of China study.</P>
      <P>It said Taiwan could underscore, out of its own experience, the
undemocratic nature of China's rise and its lack of human rights
protection.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should seek reconciliation and dialogue with China as a
major step to ensure peace across the strait, it added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC)
Monday urged the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) not to reduce the
number of foreign laborers working on the city's mass rapid transit
railway project by 800 because it would cause a severe impact to the
project.</P>
      <P>The US$5.6 billion project, under construction since October
2001, is scheduled for completion in October 2007. The railway
network will consist of two lines totaling 42.7 km with 37 stations.</P>
      <P>Fan Chen-po, president of the KRTC, said he is extremely worried
about the government decision, claiming that if the number of foreign
laborers on the project is reduced by 800, it would increase the cost
of the project by 50 percent.</P>
      <P>Fan admitted that there were some problems with labor management
that prompted a riot Sunday by Thai workers at their dormitory in
Kaohsiung County. He said the KRTC and the Huapan Manpower Consultant
and Management Co. -- contracted by the KRTC to provide service to
the foreign laborers -- have agreed to improve treatment of the
foreign workers.</P>
      <P>The KRTC executive pointed out that at present, 70 percent of the
labor force working on the project are domestic workers, including
300 aborigines from Taiwan's mountain tribes.</P>
      <P>However, Fang added, these domestic workers are reluctant to work
overtime and refuse to go 30 meters underground to tackle difficult
jobs for the wages on offer, which is why the project needs cheaper
foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>He urged the CLA to assess the project's need for manpower so
that the scheduled construction progress will not be seriously
affected.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACTION, NOT DISCOURSE, RELEVANT TO TAIWAN'S DEVELOPMENT: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) should
take concrete action instead of recounting its historical ties with
Taiwan to prove its true love for Taiwan, the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) legislative caucus said Monday.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative whip William Lai made the remarks a day after new
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said the KMT should embark upon discourse
about its close historical ties with Taiwan to dispel allegations
that the KMT is an "alien force" that intruded into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The KMT, or Nationalist, government moved its seat to Taiwan in
1949 after it lost control of the Chinese mainland to the Communist
Party of China (CPC) in a bloody civil war, and the party ruled
Taiwan uninterruptedly until it was defeated by the DPP in the 2000
presidential election.</P>
      <P>"The KMT fled to Taiwan with empty hands, but it managed to
accumulated a large stash of ill-gotten assets during its
half-century rule of Taiwan. This is one of the reasons that the KMT
has been seen as an alien force," Lai said.</P>
      <P>In his view, Lai said, the KMT should return its ill-gotten
assets to the people of Taiwan instead of selling them cheaply to
selected pro-KMT business groups.</P>
      <P>Shortly after China passed its anti-secession law targeting
Taiwan in March this year, then-KMT Chairman Lien Chan traveled to
China to forge cooperative ties with the CPC as a counterweight to
the DPP administration in Taiwan, Lai said, adding that under Lien's
leadership, the KMT and its "pan-blue alliance" ally, the People
First Party, have used their slim majority in the Legislative Yuan to
boycott the DPP's policy initiatives at every turn.</P>
      <P>"This scorched-earth strategy toward the DPP administration is
yet another reason that has prompted its critics to label the KMT an
alien force," Lai said.</P>
      <P>He also dismissed as a political irony Ma's citing of the story
of the late Taiwanese painter Liao Chin-ping to embody the KMT's
historical bond with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, Liao donated funds to KMT founder Sun Yat-sen in
1913 when Sun arrived in Taipei on his way into exile in Japan after
the KMT lost a war against then-Chinese President Yuan Shih-kai.</P>
      <P>In appreciation for Liao's donation, Sun gave Liao a bottle of
whisky which was kept by Liao's son after Liao was killed in 1947
when the KMT-led government cracked down ruthlessly on a disturbance
in Taiwan known as the 228 Incident.</P>
      <P>Liao's son gave the liquor to Ma at a ceremony marking the 228
incident this year in Taipei, when he also disclosed the friendship
between his late father and Sun.</P>
      <P>"Liao's tragic death serves as a reminder that the KMT is an
alien force to Taiwan. Liao once lent support to Sun's revolution but
died nevertheless as a result of the KMT's persecution," Lai said.</P>
      <P>To demonstrate its love for Taiwan, Lai said the KMT need not
bother to elaborate its historical bonds with Taiwan as Ma suggested.</P>
      <P>"Actions speak louder than discourse. What the KMT needs to do is
to take concrete action to boost Taiwan's development and consolidate
its survival," Lai added.</P>

Wall Street Journal: Side Effects, Merck
Loss Jolts Drug Giant, Industry

Facing thousands of lawsuits over Vioxx,
Merck had built its argument that its
painkiller Vioxx couldn't have caused the
heart-related death of 59-year-old triathlete
Robert Ernst.In the first suit to go to trial,
a majority of the jury had in effect dispensed
with the science and started a series of 10-2
votes against Merck that would end in a US$253
million verdict against the drug maker. One
crucial document was an email from February
1997 -- two years before Merck started selling
Vioxx -- in which a top company scientist, Alise
Reicin, wrote that "the possibility of increased
CV [cardiovascular] events is of great concern."
Merck maintained that it didn't know of Vioxx's
potential for heart risk until just before it
pulled the drug from the market in September
2004.</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug.  23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday he
looks forward to rational and pragmatic discussion with new
opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou on the long-stalled arms
procurement package and China's ever mounting military threat.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal while presiding over a ceremony marking the
47th anniversary of the "Aug. 23 Battle" on the outlying island of
Kinmen which lies closer to China's southeastern province of Fujian
than to Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>Noting that his administration's plan to procure three advanced
weaponry systems -- eight diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC
III anti-missile batteries and a squadron of 12 anti-submarine
aircraft -- from the United States has long been stuck in the
Legislative Yuan due to opposition parties' "irrational boycott, "
Chen said he earnestly hopes that Ma can demonstrate a different
leadership style from his predecessor's.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, Ma will be willing to engage in candid exchanges of
opinions and rational cooperation with the government based on the
principles of safeguarding national interests and the well-being of
the people," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years, the KMT and its "pan-blue alliance"
ally -- the People First Party -- have used their slim majority in
the legislature to boycott the Chen administration's policy
initiatives at almost every turn.</P>
      <P>Now that the KMT has changed its leadership, Chen said, he is
hopeful that the Ma-led KMT will demonstrate sincerity and efficiency
in dealing with national security and livelihood-related bills and
budgetary appropriations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THAI WORKERS' RIOT A 'OUTRAGEOUS, ISOLATED CASE': CLA OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohisung,  Aug.  23  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
official said Tuesday that Taiwan has 13 years of experience in
managing foreign workers and that Sunday's riot in Kangshan,
Kaohsiung County by Thai workers was an "outrageous isolated case."</P>
      <P>Kuo Fang-yu, director general of the CLA's Employment and
Vocational Training Administration, blamed the manpower management
company that brought in the Thai workers for causing the problem.</P>
      <P>He said Huapan Administration Consultant Co. Ltd. is not among
the companies that have been screened by the CLA. He said he was
surprised to learn that the Kaohisung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC)
would delegate responsibility to such a company to hire and manage
the labor force needed for building the transit system.</P>
      <P>"There has never been any problem when a CLA-approved management
company has brought in foreign laborers," Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Huapan's poor management of the foreign workers has become a
topic in Taiwan, with media digging into more and more stories of
workers being maltreated and labor groups criticizing the company's
practices.</P>
      <P>The International Labor Federation has asked the government to
allow foreign workers to form their own unions to fight for members'
legal rights, while the Taiwan Labor Front has demanded that the CLA
investigate alleged illegal profits made by Huapan and other related
groups.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that with 13 years of experience, the government has a
full set of measures and regulations governing the import,
employment, and living conditions of foreign workers. If any foreign
laborers feel that they are being treated unfairly, there are several
government agency numbers that they can call to file a complaint, he
added.</P>
      <P>In fact, he said, many businesses have done such a good job in
their management of imported workers that many of these workers don't
even want to leave when their contracts expire.</P>
      <P>Against such a backdrop, Kuo said, he was quite surprised to
learn that Huapan may have received kickbacks -- one of the
complaints leading to Sunday's riot.</P>
      <P>The CLA has pledged to launch an investigation into the incident.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CIB PROBING CROSS-BORDER BOGUS PASSPORT SALES RING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB)
said Tuesday that it has been investigating a cross-border
"snake-head" ring that purchases national identification cards from
aboriginal Taiwan citizens and alters them to apply for ROC passports
for sale to mainland Chinese citizens for entrance into Canada or the
United States.</P>
      <P>Officials from the CIB Department of International Affairs said
they suspect that the ring is working in collusion with a travel
agency to illegally apply for ROC passports using the altered ID
cards obtained from aboriginal citizens residing in Hualien or
Taitung in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ring has been running versatile operations, offering various
"products" depending on the amount paid, CIB investigators said.</P>
      <P>The investigators have learned that ring members first purchase
ID cards from the aboriginal citizens at unknown prices. The ring
members then digitally alter the photo on the ID card before applying
for an ROC passport from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The
illegally obtained passports are then sent to Hong Kong or Thailand
where they are sold to mainland Chinese citizens.</P>
      <P>If the aboriginal passport holder goes to the American Institute
in Taiwan for an interview and successfully obtains a U.S. visa, he
will be awarded NT$50,000 (US$1,562.5) by the ring. If such passport
carries a forged photo of the end user, it can be sold for
NT$150,000, according to the investigators.</P>
      <P>Ring members can fetch between NT$600,000 and NT$900,000 for each
mainland Chinese citizen they successfully help enter the United
States, Canada, Japan or an E.U. country, according to the
investigators.</P>
      <P>The CIB authorities said they believe that more than 1,000
aboriginal people from eastern Taiwan have sold their ID cards or
passports to the ring.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  23 (CNA)
(By Lillian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
attaches great importance to cracking down on cross-strait criminal
rings using the national identification cards of aboriginal people in
eastern Taiwan for illegal purposes, a MOFA spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Michel Lu said the ministry is taking several precautionary
measures to deal with the problem, including rigorous verification of
passport holders, actions to combat forged or counterfeit passport
rings, an upgrading of the anti-forgery features of passports, as
well as stepped-up communications with the United States and exchange
of information.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks amid media reports that cross-border
smuggling rings have been obtaining IDs from aboriginal people in
Hualien and Taitung and altering them to apply for ROC passports for
sale to Chinese citizens wanting to illegally enter the United States
or Canada.</P>
      <P>Lu said the ministry has heeded the reports, which cited
investigation agents as saying that more than 1,000 aboriginal people
in Hualien and Taitung might have been involved in selling their IDs
for NT$50,000 each to the scam rings over the years.</P>
      <P>However, Lu said that "the number of aboriginal people involved
in the scam is not as high as the news reports have said."</P>
      <P>Lu said that the ministry understands that criminal rings have
obtained the IDs of more than 20 aboriginal people in Hualian and
Taitung.</P>
      <P>He said that the ministry has contacted the Taipei Office of the
American in Taiwan (AIT), the de facto American embassy in Taiwan in
the absence of formal diplomatic ties between the two countries, and
that the AIT is now turning the case over to investigative
authorities in Taipei.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT WILLING TO DISCUSS FUNDING CHANGE FOR U.S. ARMS PURCHASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense's plan to
include part of the purchase of U.S. arms in its regular budget has
met with approval by the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) legislative
caucus, with a KMT legislator saying Tuesday that his party is now
willing to look at the plan and discuss it within the party's
legislative caucus.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, also the executive director of the party's
Policy Committee, made the remarks one day after Legislative Yuan
President Wang Jin-pyng revealed that one of the three items in the
arms package will be listed under the defense ministry's regular
budget.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that the KMT has always wanted an arms procurement
package that would serve the purpose of defending the nation and one
that was not foisted upon Taiwan by the U.S. Also, the KMT does not
want to see the bill for the weaponry being passed to future
generations to have to pay, he said, adding that in the past, the
party was opposed to the package because the defense ministry listed
the procurement under a special budget.</P>
      <P>The defense ministry's arms procurement package calls for the
purchase of eight diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III
anti-missile batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine
aircraft from the United States at a cost of NT$480 billion (US$15
billion).</P>
      <P>The bill has been held up for two consecutive legislature
sessions because of opposition by the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT
and its ally, the People First Party (PFP), which has said that the
cost of the weaponry is too high and that any payments ought not come
from a special budget.</P>
      <P>However, a lawmaker of the PFP said Tuesday that some KMT and PFP
legislators have not studied the arms procurement package diligently
and have "fallen into the trap" of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Lin Yu-fang made the remarks following media
reports that said Minister of National Defense Lee Jye briefed the
DPP legislative caucus the previous day, saying that the budget for
the six Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile batteries will be funded out of
the regular budget.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the question surrounding the arms procurement
project is not whether it will be paid for by a special or regular
budget. They are both funded by taxpayers' money, he said.</P>
      <P>What matters is whether it is really necessary to buy outdated
military hardware at an inflated price that may or may not meet the
needs of the nation to defend itself, Lin said. Moreover, at issue is
the question of whether the U.S. will offer reciprocal purchase
opportunities for industrial equipment from Taiwan and if buying the
weaponry will touch off an arms race across the Strait, negatively
impacting cross-strait relations, he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  23 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States wants to see a
"strong and confident China" because a weak and insecure China is
potentially much more dangerous, according to U.S. Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice.</P>
      <P>During an interview with The New York Times on Aug. 17, Rice said
the U.S. understands that China is going to be influential in
international politics. It also understands it cannot isolate China,
she said.</P>
      <P>Economically, she said the U.S. expects China's economy to be
rules based, with a currency that "makes sense in terms of a flexible
market-based exchange rate, " as well as an enforcer of intellectual
property rights.</P>
      <P>On the issues of human rights and religious freedom, Rice said
the U.S. was "capable of having reasonable discussions with the
Chinese" and will to continue to press them on those issues.</P>
      <P>Turning to China's military power, Rice said it looks oversized
to many, "including to me." She noted that the Chinese military
modernization looks oversized for its regional interests.</P>
      <P>But she said she was not suggesting China is becoming an
adversary, but that it is something that has to be watched and that
the United States is going to continue to improve its own military
capabilities so that the balance in the Asia-Pacific region is
maintained.</P>
      <P>She acknowledged that there are sometimes "spikes in the
temperature" caused by underlying issues in the U.S.-China
relationship. But on balance, she said it is a good relationship,
with the U.S. benefiting in the war on terrorism and in nuclear
proliferation issues.</P>
      <P>For the U.S., China's Anti-Secession Law regarding Taiwan has
"caused problems for everybody" and its human rights record is "not
defensible on many grounds," she pointed out.</P>
      <P>Rice said she does not see the State Department's role as somehow
minimizing the problems in the complex relationship. "I see the
relationship as having all of these sides."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ke Hung-tu, designer of the last souvenir
sheet issued especially for 18th Asian International Stamp
Exhibition, said Wednesday that he hopes his creation can bring
unexpected joy to philatelists.</P>
      <P>Ke made the remarks during an autograph session to promote the
souvenir sheet he designed -- Taiwan Ocean Life.</P>
      <P>Unlike other stamp designers in the past autograph sessions,
several of which won the honor with their debut creations, Ke is
actually a seasoned stamp designer with 30 sets of stamps now under
his belt.</P>
      <P>Ke said that he has broken with tradition and has used an
oval-shaped stamp to show one part of the ocean off Green Island, and
added the fiery red horny corals and yellow and blue striped royal
empress angelfish, which are often found in the area to display the
freedom and flamboyancy of the waters in the tropics.</P>
      <P>He said that when he designed the stamp he mainly had in mind
Taiwan's ocean scenery and geological landscapes and wanted to
display them in various shades of blue.</P>
      <P>The contents of the stamp mainly comes from a photo by a member
of Academia Sinica, the highest research institute in Taiwan, as well
as the creativity of other pictures.</P>
      <P>Spectators will first look at one corner of Green Island, and
then they will immediately turn to the colorful world of the ocean
floor, where they can see the frolicking fishes and beautiful coral
reefs.</P>
      <P>Ke stressed the importance of "story" in a tiny stamp, hoping to
transport to those who look at the stamp the rich and interesting
material they represent. This and a clear theme as well as a
vivacious picture have all been credited with his success over the
past years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ID CARD RENEWAL TO BE POSTPONED UNTIL AFTER YEAR-END ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Interior Minister Su Jia-chyuan said
Tuesday that identification (ID) card renewal will be postponed until
after the Dec. 3 "three-in-one" elections.</P>
      <P>As to the exact date for the start of ID card renewal, Su said it
has yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of an opinion survey by the Ministry of the
Interior (MOI), Su said 14 cities and counties have suggested that ID
card renewal be started Jan. 1, 2006, while the remaining cities and
counties just recommended that the renewal be kicked off after Dec.
20.</P>
      <P>Su said the interior ministry will make a final decision after a
further evaluation of various conditions.</P>
      <P>The minister made the remarks after presiding over a citation
ceremony for 163 outstanding grassroots administrators,
agencies and volunteers.</P>
      <P>The ministry was originally scheduled to begin issuing new
forgery-proof ID cards July 1. But on May 30, the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) filed for a Council of Grand Justices (CGJ)
ruling on the constitutionality of the existing household
registration law that requires local people to be fingerprinted while
picking up ID cards. The DPP application was a response to mounting
concerns about possible human rights violations.</P>
      <P>In view of the limited time available, the CGJ imposed a
moratorium June 10 on the fingerprinting provision until it metes
out its ruling. The Council of Grand Justices also began
a two-day hearing on the request Wednesday. A ruling is
expected at the end of September.</P>
      <P>Su said the interior ministry will fully respect the CGJ's
ruling. If the council rules that fingerprinting is in violation of
the constitutional spirit or provision, he said the MOI will not
require local citizens to be fingerprinted when they pick up their
new ID cards.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Su said when the CGJ hands down its ruling, local
population offices will be busy with preparations for the Dec. 3
"three-in-one" elections for city mayors/county magistrates,
city/county councilors and township chiefs.</P>
      <P>At city and county government requests, Su said, the interior
ministry has agreed to wait until after the elections to start new ID
cards distribution.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG RAPID TRANSIT'S FOREIGN LABOR IMPORT QUOTA FROZEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  23 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has
temporarily frozen the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp.'s (KRTC) use of
its approved 900-person quota in terms of foreign worker import, Liu
Ko-hsiang, an assistant to the KRTC president, said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The authorities promised that the company will not be allowed to
import any additional foreign laborers before the demands from the
Thai laborers involved in a Sunday riot for better treatment are met,
Liu explained. </P>
      <P>Around 100 Thai laborers working on the metro line project in the
southern city of Kaohsiung set fire to a house and cars, and smashed
doors and windows of an office of the Huapan Manpower Administration
Consultant Co. Ltd. in protest against the company's unfair
treatment.</P>
      <P>The protest ended after Huapan accepted 14 of 16 demands from the
angry foreign workers. </P>
      <P>The KRTC has introduced more than 1,700 foreign laborers after it
applied to import over 2,600 workers from overseas countries
for its construction projects. After the riot, the CLA decided to cut
half of the company's current foreign laborer quota, about
800 people, and at the same time freeze its import of other 900 that
it has not yet introduced into Taiwan because of poor management.</P>
      <P>The Thais had agreed to resume working from Tuesday, but they
changed minds early Tuesday on their way for work after hearing a
rumor which said around 800 Thai workers would be sent back home.</P>
      <P>They eventually started working later in the day after both the
CLA and the KRTC guaranteed no more imports of foreign laborers
before their living situation is improved. </P>
      <P>Kuo Fong-yu, director-general of the CLA Bureau of Employment and
Vocational Training, said that the council will protect the rights of
all Thai laborers working on the Kaohsiung metro lines, except
those who committed arson during the riot, who will be repatriated
following a judicial procedure.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  23 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Alliance of Fairness and Justice on
Tuesday criticized the government for drafting a tax law that will
allow rich business people to enjoy greater tax exemptions and avoid
paying tax on their overseas assets.</P>
      <P>Alliance president Chien Hsi-chieh said the draft law being
discussed at the Cabinet was a sham tax reform proposal that will
benefit only businesses, to the disappointment of the public.</P>
      <P>He focused his criticism on the shortcomings of provisions
governing the minimum tax, including the proposed phase-in measures
and the "faith and protection" principle that allows foreign
investors to keep enjoying tax benefits after the new law comes into
force.</P>
      <P>His group, also known as "pan-purple alliance, " in distinction
from the political "pan-green" camp and the "pan-blue alliance," said
the draft law makes it clear that it will not be able to expand the
nation's tax base as it will encourage rich people to invest abroad
while they continue to enjoy tax privileges at home.</P>
      <P>The alliance also claimed that the proposed reform package fails
to reinstate capital gains tax on the stock market, a signal that it
would be difficult for the government to achieve its professed goals
of reform.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it pointed out that a government plan to lower the
gift and heritage tax rates was a clear indication of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) government's favor of the rich as well as of
its lack of interest in narrowing the gap between the rich and the
poor.</P>
      <P>Chien claimed that the conclusion of this "tax reform show" is
now clear -- that big businesses will be the big winners while
people's hopes for increased social rights and greater fairness and
justice will have been dashed.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By  Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To prevent a repeat of the riot staged
by Thai workers late Sunday in Kaohsiung, a city government official
demanded Tuesday that the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC)
"severely handle" the labor brokerage firm responsible for personnel
management if it is to blame for the incident.</P>
      <P>Lee Cheng-pin, head of the Kaohsiung Mass Transit Bureau, raised
the demand following a municipal meeting. But he fell short of
explaining what moves that the city government might take to that
end.</P>
      <P>Noting that he has clearly requested the KRTC to duly deal with
the matter, Lee stressed that the city government does not want to
see any similar reoccurrences and that the KRTC must effectively
improve its management and step up its inspection after several major
public security incidents occurred in construction sites in the
city's mass rapid transit system.</P>
      <P>Although the overnight riot by more than 100 Thai workers
building the Kaohsiung mass transit system came to an end Monday
after a settlement on better pay terms and living conditions was
reached between the Thai workers and the brokerage company, Lee said
that the KRTC must find out the root cause and punish the brokerage
firm if necessary.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the first foreign worker riot in Taiwan, the
Taiwan International Workers' Association (TIWA) issued a statement
Sunday night, urging the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) to allow
foreign workers to form their own unions to protect their rights and
interests.</P>
      <P>TIWA Secretary-General Ku Yu-ling pointed out that nearly 300,000
migrant workers in Taiwan lack legal protection, as the Labor Union
Law clearly stipulates that only persons with Republic of China
nationality are permitted to act as labor union officials.</P>
      <P>The 16 requests raised by the Thai laborers on work and living
condition improvements, including due and full overtime pay and
better food are basic labor and human rights, Ku said, adding that
the Thai worker protests over such issues has brought an inadequate
government labor policy to public attention. The government must
provide foreign workers with basic rights, she insisted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a draft amendment to the Labor Union Law, pending
legislative approval at present, will scrap the ROC nationality
requirement, a change that CLA officials said will help facilitate
foreign workers put forward their complaints and protect their
rights.</P>

region exceeds the average in the south, CEPD officials noted.</P>
      <P>A Hong Kong-based aviation company has applied with the Civil
Aeronautics Administration to operate charter flights between
Taichung and Hong Kong, helping to boost the prospects for the
airport to be transformed into an international air traffic center in
central Taiwan, the officials said.</P>
      <P>At present, the airport's existing facilities are only available
for domestic routes and some charter flights to Japan, South Korea,
Bali and Phuket. The former military base-turned airport began civil
aviation services in March 2004.</P>

    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  Thailand,  Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By S. C. Wu and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is the largest importer
of Thai workers in the world, with about 94,000 laborers from
Thailand working in Taiwan, according to a report issued Tuesday by
the International Immigrants Foundation.</P>
      <P>As of the end of last year, a total of 148,600 Thai workers were
employed overseas, with the largest number of 94,000 -- 84,000 men
and 12,000 women -- staying in Taiwan, well ahead of the 60,000-odd
Thai workers in Japan, the report said.</P>
      <P>Thai laborers are also the largest migrant worker group in
Taiwan, where there are nearly 300,000 foreign workers. Due to their
poor English abilities compared to those from the Philippines and
Indonesia, most of the Thai workers are in the construction sector in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition to higher pay offered by Taiwan businesses, Thai
workers are attracted to Taiwan by its warm climate, close distance
from home and Buddhist religion, officials of the Thai Ministry of
Labor Affairs said, adding that Thai construction workers can earn an
average monthly salary of US$460 in Taiwan, twice or thrice the level
in Thailand.</P>

      <P>An illegal Chinese immigrant has been
caught serving as a caregiver at major hospitals in Taipei, police
authorities said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Chinese man told police that he smuggled himself into Taiwan
a year ago. He first took odd jobs around Taiwan. In April this year,
he began working as a caregiver at major Taipei hospitals, including
Veterans General Hospital and Yangming Hospital, on a wage of
NT$1,900 per day. He has to pay a 10 percent commission to his
manpower broker.</P>
      <P>According to police, the 30-something man has been caring for
several seriously ill patients for three months through the
arrangement of a local manpower agency.</P>
      <P>Taipei police authorities informed a special task force under the
National Police Administration (NPA) of the case. The "homeland
security" task force was founded by the NPA earlier this year to
track down unaccountable illegal Chinese immigrants.</P>
      <P>The task force checked a temporary caregivers list provided by a
health care cooperative founded with the assistance of the
Cabinet-level Veterans Affairs Commission.</P>
      <P>Police authorities said they discovered that the list included
10 illegal male Chinese immigrants and that all of them are around 30
years of age.</P>
      <P>Implying that those illegal Chinese immigrants might be
intelliegence agents, NPA officials said they have stepped up search
for behind-the-scenes "snake-head" human smuggling rings.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian ordered military, intelligence and
police agencies to intensify tracking down on unaccountable illegal
Chinese immigrants earlier this year after several outrageous
criminal cases involving illegal Chinese immigrants were reported.</P>
      <P>Since the establishment of the "homeland security" task force,
the NPA has directed city and county police offices to step up

Petroleum Corporation, the biggest state-owned company, has agreed to
pay US$4.18 billion to buy a Canadian oil company with substantial

the Middle East, ROC allies in Africa will also be possible
cooperation partners.</P>
      <P>In Central Asia, in addition to a cooperation project with
Kazakhstan, Qatar in the Middle East is also a new target for

    <HEADLINE>AUTHORITIES VOW TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS OF FOREIGN LABORERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Authorities in Taiwan at both the central
and local government levels said Tuesday that the human rights of all
foreign laborers working in Taiwan must be protected and that the
employers' management of foreign work forces must be humane.</P>
      <P>After a riot Sunday by some 100 Thai workers employed by the
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) came to what the authorities
claim was a "happy ending," the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) set an
investigation in motion. A team comprising human rights experts,
scholars, Thai officials and representatives from human rights groups
went to Kaohsiung County to talk to the Thai workers and look into
the causes of the incident.</P>
      <P>The CLA will wait until the team completes its report on the
incident before deciding whether to mete out penalties to the KRTC
and the Huapan Manpower Consultant and Management Co. it contracted
to handle all affairs concerning the foreign laborers working on the
project.</P>
      <P>The KRTC has applied to the labor authorities to employ some
2,600 foreign laborers to help keep the project on schedule, but so
far it has hired only about 1,700, still 900 short of its target.</P>
      <P>As a result of the riot, the CLA announced a temporary freeze on
the KRTC's planned import of 900 more foreign workers. The CLA also
said it would reduce the KRTC's present foreign fork force by half --
about 800 men -- and redistribute them to other construction sites if
the investigative report finds that the Thai laborers were
mistreated.</P>
      <P>The riot at the Thai laborers' dormitories in Kangshan, Kaohsiung
County, occurred Sunday evening when some Thai laborers were
allegedly mistreated with an electric cattle prod for drinking
alcohol in their living quarters. Over 100 fellow workers joined the
protest, setting fire to a house and smashed the management office,
causing NT$10 million in property damage.</P>
      <P>The 1,700 foreign workers living in four crowded two-story
dormitories are known to have strong feelings about the many
draconian restrictions the management has forced on them, including a
ban on smoking and even a ban on the use of mobile phones in the
dorm.</P>
      <P>The incident has made headlines in newspapers around the world
and has attracted world attention to Taiwan's poor treatment of
foreign laborers. One Bangkok newspaper quoted Thai Labor Minister
Somsak Thepsuthin as saying it was the "most serious incident" in 20
years since Thailand started exporting laborers to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Thai laborers returned to work Tuesday after receiving
promises from the management that none of them will be laid off and
sent back to Thailand because of the riot. A day earlier, the
management agreed to 14 of their 16 demands for better treatment.</P>
      <P>The Labor Affairs Bureau under the Kaohsiung city government also
pledged Tuesday that bureau officials will step up inspection on the
treatment of foreign laborers until the KRTC has made all necessary
improvements in response to their complaints.</P>

Iraqi leaders submitted a draft constitution to the National
Assembly just before their self-imposed midnight deadline on Monday,
but disagreement with Sunni leaders and other secular Iraqis left the
document incomplete, with fundamental issues still in dispute. The
Iraqis decided to give themselves three additional days to close the
gaps, despite the requirement in the country's interim constitution
that the document be completed by a deadline, which already had been
extended a week. That left some Iraqis on the 275-member National
Assembly wondering whether they were still in charge, and some Sunni
leaders asserting that the delay was illegal.

Wall Street Journal: Tug of War, On a Busy Inlet, A Dispute
Surfaces Over Energy Policy

In Massachusetts the state is enforcing a controversial state law
passed in the wake of a devastating oil spill here, which requires
ship owners to post steep financial guarantees to insure against
accidents. It levies a two-cent tax on every barrel of oil shipped.
And it forces most tugboat operators carrying oil up the bay to hire
extra "escort" tugs just in case something goes wrong. The Bush
administration sued Massachusetts in U.S. District Court in Boston in
January, seeking to overturn the law and alleging it infringes on the
federal government's role as the regulator of interstate maritime
trade. The Coast Guard refuses to enforce the law, and Massachusetts
agents say they won't go on patrol until the case is settled. The
chaotic situation -- on the water and in the court -- is a small
example of the country's big difficulties in crafting a coherent
energy policy.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>NANTOU COUNTY MAGISTRATE WITHDRAWS FROM DPP TO ASSERT RE-ELECTION BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nantou County Magistrate Lin Tsung-nan quit
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Tuesday and reaffirmed
his commitment to run for a second term as an independent.</P>
      <P>Lin's move added yet another variable to the outcome of the
year-end magistrate election in the central Taiwan county.</P>
      <P>Lin lost to former DPP Legislator Tsai Huang-liang in the
intraparty primary to decide upon a DPP candidate for the election
and DPP heavyweights from President Chen Shui-bian on down had tried
but failed to persuade Lin to give up his re-election bid and reduce
the chances of the party losing as a result of a split vote.</P>
      <P>Lin, a member of the DPP Central Standing Committee (CSC), signed
the words "bye bye" on the attendance book before entering a
conference room where the weekly CSC meeting was to take place. He
bade farewell to the other CSC members at the meeting and then
announced his decision to quit the party.</P>
      <P>Both Vice President Annette Lu and DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang
made last-ditch efforts to talk Lin into changing his mind, but he
remained adamant.</P>
      <P>An emotional Lin noted that he fought for democracy along with
many DPP elders during Taiwan's martial law era.</P>
      <P>"Throughout my 40-year political career, I have worked with many
DPP stalwarts. Even before the DPP was allowed to form, we fought
together for its inception. I treasure our past friendship and
comradeship, but the time has come for me to quit. I have many tasks
to accomplish and I cannot let down my supporters. I must deliver on
my promises to them and thus I have a moral duty to seek
re-election," he said.</P>
      <P>Lin declined to comment on his DPP rival, Tsai Huang-liang,
pointing out that just because he lost the primary does not mean he
will lose the election.</P>
      <P>"I'm confident of my re-election bid and I stake my political
future on the year-end election. If I lose, I will bow out of
politics when my current term in office expires," Lin said.</P>
      <P>He also urged the DPP headquarters to take steps to improve its
primary electoral system to "make it fairer and more just."</P>
      <P>He also firmly denied that he is likely to join the DPP's ally --
the Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>"As a pro-democracy activist during Taiwan's martial law era, I'm
no stranger to fighting on my own and I will definitely run for
re-election as an independent," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Learning of Lin's withdrawal, Tsai said he is not worried about a
possible massive defection of DPP supporters to Lin's camp and
claimed that Lin's staunch supporters mainly come from the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>"Lin is not the first to withdraw from the DPP to run on his own.
Voting records show that DPP supporters traditionally vote for the
party's standard-bearers, not its rebels," Tsai claimed.</P>
      <P>However, Nantou Mayor Lee Tsao-ching, who will represent the
"pan-blue alliance" in the Dec. 3 Nantou County magistrate election,
said Lin's move marks an intraparty division and predicted that it
will discourage voters from supporting the DPP nominee.</P>
      <P>Su, meanwhile, said he felt deep regret over Lin's departure but
added that the DPP will do whatever it can to ensure victory for Tsai
in the year-end election.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.  23 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most Thai laborers in Taiwan hope they can
continue their employment here, despite the riot by some of their
fellow workers last Sunday in southern Taiwan to protest poor
treatment by the management, a Thai official said late Monday.</P>
      <P>Supat Gukun, an official at the Thai representative office in
Taiwan in charge of labor affairs, claimed to reporters that the riot
was started by "a handful" of Thai workers who incited others to
resort to violence.</P>
      <P>He said he is happy that the incident has ended, with no adverse
effect on the labor policies of either Taiwan or Thailand.</P>
      <P>The riot by more than 100 Thai laborers working on the Kaohsiung
rapid transit railway project occurred in their living quarters in
Kangshan, Kaohsiung County, when some Thai workers were allegedly
attacked with an electric cattle prod by Taiwanese management for
drinking in their dormitory. In retaliation, they burned down a
building and smashed the management office, causing an estimated
NT$10 million in damage.</P>
      <P>According to a report released jointly by the International
Organization for Migration, the International Labor Organization and
the U.N. Development Program Tuesday, there are 94,000 Thai workers
in Taiwan -- 82,000 men and 11,000 women -- making Taiwan the largest
export market for Thai labor.</P>
      <P>Labor market analysts say that Taiwan has always been the most
favored choice for Thai laborers seeking work opportunities abroad.
They believe the latest riot will not affect their preference to work
here.</P>
      <P>The main reason why Thai workers find Taiwan so attractive is
that Taiwan offers them higher wages than other countries. They can
earn an average salary of about US$460 -- three or four times the pay
in their home country.</P>
      <P>In addition, Thai workers are used to the climate in Taiwan,
which is similar to that of Thailand. Predominantly Buddhists, Thai
workers also feel comfortable because Buddhism is also popular in
Taiwan. The close distance between Taiwan and Thailand -- only
three-and-a-half hours by plane -- is another favorable factor,
according to the analysts.</P>

opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) Taichung chapter arrived Tuesday in
Xiamen, in China's Fujian Province, ushering in party-level exchanges
with the Communist Party of China (CPC), which defeated the KMT in a
civil war in China and caused the KMT to flee to Taiwan in
1949.</P>
      <P>The four-day visit is a follow-up to a historic visit by KMT
Honorary Chairman Lien Chan to China in late April, where he met with
CPC General Secretary Hu Jintao and agreed with Hu to strengthen ties
between the two sides of Taiwan Strait, despite lacking any
government authority to do so.</P>
      <P>According to Lien, the exchanges will be in three stages, with
the first beginning between KMT cadres in six counties and cities,

Tainan City and Kaohsiung County, and CPC cadres from six Chinese
cities, including Xiamen, Ningbo, Suzhou, Qingdao, Shenzhen and

cities, with the third-stage extending to Taipei City and Kaohsiung

      <P>The delegation's arrival at Xiamen's Gaoqi International Airport
drew coverage by many Chinese media.</P>
      <P>Chen Xioumao, deputy director of the CPC's Xiamen Chapter, who

this was the first step of regular exchanges between the KMT and the
CPC, following the "historic" meeting between Lien and Hu.</P>
      <P>At the Lien-Hu meeting, both sides also promised to promote a
cross-strait peace accord and a common market, as well as a KMT-CPC

    <HEADLINE>ARMS PROCUREMENT AIMS TO BEEF UP DEFENSE, NOT ARMS RACE: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday his
administration's arms procurement plan is not meant as an arms race
with China, but is primarily for beefing up Taiwan's defense
capabilities in the face of China's ever growing military threat.</P>
      <P>"The proposed arms porcurement is not intended to engage in an
arms race with China but to upgrade self-defense capabilities,
therefore safeguarding our hard-won democracy and prosperity, " Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a ceremony on the frontline island of
Kinmen, which lies closer to China's Fujian Province than to Taiwan,
to mark a battle against China 47 years ago.</P>
      <P>The Battle of the Taiwan Strait began with China's shelling of
Kinmen Aug. 23, 1958, in a failed attempt to pound Kinmen into
submission. China lobbed 480,000 shells in a 44-day barrage, leaving
Kinmen pockmarked with craters.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his tribute to those who sacrificed their lives in
that battle, saying he admired their selfless patriotism.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 1958 battle resulted from a combination of
factors, including the Cold War mindset and the historical feud
between Taiwan's then-ruling Kuomintang and the Communist Party of
China, Chen said it is regrettable that Taiwan still faces China's
threat even though the Cold War has ended.</P>
      <P>"The Cold War has ended after 47 years... but despite this,
Taiwan people are still under threat of more than 700 ballistic
missiles deployed by China against Taiwan," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He took the occasion to defend his administration's hefty arms
package, citing China's passage of an anti-secession law in March
that codifies the use of non peaceful means against Taiwan if the
island moves toward formal independence. </P>
      <P>Chen also cited remarks in July by Chinese General Zhu Chenghu,
who said China could use nuclear weapons to retaliate against the
United States if Washington attacked China in any conflict over
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Zhu's remarks further highlighted the potential crisis that
could be sparked by China's fast arms buildup as it is tipping the
cross-strait military balance toward China," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Touching on the long-stalled arms procurement package, Chen said
he looks forward to rational and pragmatic discussion with new
opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou on the issue.</P>
      <P>The package calls for the purchase of eight diesel-electric
submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries and a squadron
of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the United States at a cost
of NT$480 billion (US$15 billion).</P>
      <P>Chen said the package has long been stuck in the Legislative Yuan
due to the opposition parties' "irrational boycott."</P>
      <P>Over the past five years, the KMT and its "pan-blue alliance"
ally -- the People First Party -- have used their slim majority in
the legislature to boycott the Chen administration's policy
initiatives at almost every turn.</P>
      <P>Chen said he earnestly hopes that Ma can demonstrate a different
leadership style from that of his predecessor Lien Chan, who was
never able to accept that he was defeated twice by Chen in
presidential elections.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, Ma will be willing to engage in candid exchanges of
opinions and rational cooperation with the government based on the
principles of safeguarding national interests and the well-being of
the people," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Now that the KMT has changed its leadership, Chen said, he is
hopeful that the Ma-led KMT will demonstrate sincerity and efficiency
in dealing with national security and livelihood-related bills and
budgetary appropriations.</P>
      <P>Chen was accompanied by Defense Minister Lee Jye, Chief of the
General Staff Li Tien-yu and other senior government and military
officials on the visit to Kinmen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP WANTS NEW KMT HEAD TO SHOW HIS HAND ON ARMS PURCHASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislator said Tuesday that the opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou should express his attitude toward the stalled arms
procurement package from the United States.</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-chun, the whip of the DPP's legislative caucus, made
the remarks after Ma said in response to a call by President Chen
Shui-bian for talks on the arms procurement package that there is no
need for him to have such a meeting with Chen on this issue, as the
procurement bill should be discussed in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Ma took the helm of the KMT Aug. 19 from his predecessor Lien
Chan.</P>
      <P>The legislator noted that the bill has been blocked in the
legislature by the opposition for more than a year, due largely to
objections from Lien, who was defeated twice by Chen in presidential
elections.</P>
      <P>Chen said that as Ma might compete in the 2008 presidential
election, the public expects to know about his attitude toward
national security.</P>
      <P>Noting that the cross-Taiwan Strait military balance has been
tilting heavily in China's favor, he urged Ma not to shirk "his
responsibility" on national security.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cho Po-yuan, the whip of the KMT legislative caucus,
claimed that the KMT's stonewalling of the arms purchase budget is
"rational supervision" with the aim of not wasting taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>In addition, Cho went on, the legislature is the main
battleground of opposition parties and it is quite natural in a
democratic society that the arms procurement plan will be decided by
lawmakers rather than leaders of any political party.</P>
      <P>The KMT is most concerned about the welfare of the people and
will not bow to pressure from the United States, Cho claimed.</P>
      <P>Cho said the KMT caucus will listen to a briefing from the
National Defense Ministry on the arms procurement in the next few
days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LABOR AUTHORITIES REACTION TO KAOHSIUNG RIOT CRITICIZED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Aug  22 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A leader of the Kaohsiung Chamber of
Industry criticized the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) decisions in
reaction to Sunday's riot by Thai laborers as "inappropriate and
unfair."</P>
      <P>Li Wei-ying, general-secretary of the chamber, said the CLA has
made an "ill-considered" decision in announcing a freeze on the
planned import of an additional 900 foreign laborers by the Kaohsiung
Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) and a plan to reduce the KRTC's current
foreign labor force by 800 men and redistribute the workers to other
construction sites.</P>
      <P>Li claimed that the CLA's usual practice in dealing with disputes
between foreign laborers and local employers is to mete out "heavy
penalties" to the employers while not allowing them to tell their
side of the story.</P>
      <P>He admitted that the employers have been harsh in their
management of foreign labor forces, but claimed that this is mainly
because of the CLA's strict regulations that subject an employer to a
fine of between NT$60,000 and NT$300,000 if anything goes wrong with
the management.</P>
      <P>The companies with foreign laborers are in a dilemma. If they are
too strict with the foreign workers, they would be accused of human
rights violations, but if they are too lax with them, these foreign
workers "would create a lot of trouble," Li said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign labor brokerages used to wield great power in
deciding whether a foreign labor should be fired and sent home, but
now they and the employers have to prove with concrete evidence that
a foreign laborer has committed three serious offenses before the CLA
will consider deporting that worker.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTRY TO JOIN FIGHT AGAINST CHINA'S `CHARM OFFENSIVE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) will
join the government's fight against what it claims is China's "charm
offensive" targeting Taiwan's farmers by opening its market to Taiwan
fruit, according to Gen. Hu Cheng-pu, chief of the department of
political warfare under the MND.</P>
      <P>Hu told journalists while accompanying President Chen Shui-bian
on a visit to the frontline island of Kinmen Tuesday that his
department was asked by lawmakers of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) to help with the government's efforts in
trying to persuade local farmers that China is not a lucrative market
for Taiwan's agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Noting that the MND has engaged in political warfare against
China for more than five decades, the DPP lawmakers said their
experience will be invaluable for the government in "exposing
Beijing's lies" about offering Taiwan fruit duty-free access to the
Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Hu confirmed news reports that he had visited Council of
Agriculture head Lee Ching-lung and Joseph Wu, chief of the Mainland
Affairs Council, the two Cabinet-level officials spearheading the
government's efforts to woo over the farmers, to learn about the
government's latest strategy on the issue and to see what the MND can
do to help.</P>
      <P>The general said the MND has decided to ask the Youth Daily and
the Voice of Han Radio -- controlled by the armed forces -- to
interview officials responsible for agricultural and China affairs so
that they can air the government's stance on the issue and warn the
public to guard against what the government claims is China's
political scheme behind its overtures to Taiwan farmers.</P>
      <P>As a part of the government, Hu said, the MND cannot sit on its
hands while the country is taking pains to foil Beijing's scheme
aimed at splitting the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing promised to open its market to Taiwan fruit in April as a
gift to former Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, who visited China at
the time.</P>
      <P>The move alarmed the DPP, which counts Taiwan farmers among its
core supporters. The DPP government has since done all it can to warn
farmers of what it claimed Beijing's political motivation behind its
promise.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. WILL NOT LET KMT CHIEF HEDGE ON ARMS PROCUREMENT: LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  23 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. will not let newly inaugurated
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou hedge on the issue
of the government's controversial arms purchase from America, Hsiao
Bi-khim a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,
speculated Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hsiao made her prediction after Ma spurned President Chen
Shui-bian's request Tuesday for a meeting on the NT$480 billion
(US$14.92 billion) budget for the arms purchase, which has been
bogged down in the opposition-controlled legislature for more than a
year. Ma responded by saying it is up to the legislature to deal with the
bill.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said Ma might turn a deaf ear to the president's request
but she claimed he will not be able to escape pressure from the
U.S. which knows quite well that it is the opposition parties, not
least the KMT, that is stonewalling the deal.</P>
      <P>Noting that a group of U.S. congressmen wrote to Ma's predecessor
Lien Chan, urging him to give a greenlight to the budget for the
purchase, Hsiao predicted that the U.S. would not let Ma dodge the
issue, and that officials from the American Institute in Taiwan will
ask for a meeting with the new KMT chief soon seeking answers to this
question.</P>
      <P>As the proposed arms acquirement concerns national security,
Hsiao said, Ma has to face up to it and think about how to deal with
it rather than pass the buck.</P>
      <P>The KMT, under the leadership of Lien, has filibustered the
budget on the grounds that it would be financed with a special
budget, which the opposition claims will become a heavy financial
burden for future administrations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER URGES SPEEDY APPROPRIATION OF TSUNAMI DONATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Wednesday that it is absolutely unacceptable that after nearly eight
months, the donations collected by the government from the Taiwan
people for tsunami relief has still not reached those in need.</P>
      <P>Wang said the long delay in distributing the money to the
charities commissioned by the government to help victims of last
December's tsunami tragedy in South and Southeast Asia has "hurt
Taiwan's international image."</P>
      <P>Taiwan citizens opened their hearts to the tsunami disaster
victims by donating more than NT$400 million (US$12.5 million) during
the Government Information Office-initiated fund-raiser.</P>
      <P>Wang said the GIO should have understood clearly the nation's law
governing fund-raising and appropriation when it initiated the
charity campaign early this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former GIO Minister Lin Chia-lung, who initiated the
fund-raising drive, met with current GIO Minister Pasuya Yao
Wednesday for "face-to-face" discussions concerning the delay in
distributing the funds to the charities.</P>
      <P>The two apparently reached a consensus on the appropriation of
the funds, saying after their brief meeting that the money will be
distributed late this month or early next month at the earliest after
the GIO completes some "paperwork" with the bank in charge of dealing
with the funds.</P>
      <P>The GIO has recently been criticized by the media and several
lawmakers for the long delay in distributing the money.</P>
      <P>Responding to the criticism, Yao clarified Tuesday that all
donations will be put into construction and relief work as planned
and will be executed via non-governmental organizations, adding that
there has been absolutely no delay.</P>
      <P>However, he also said that the collected donations must still
undergo a set of budgetary and appropriation procedures, which means
that it may take some time for the money to be channeled to the NGOs.</P>
      <P>This is not a question of government negligence or inefficiency,
Yao said, adding that in fact, the rigorous monitoring procedures
will ensure that none of the donated money is wasted.</P>

three complaints against the President.

      <P>Lai's remarks came amid reports that Huapan Manpower Consultant
and Management Co., a company in charge of managing foreign laborers
working for the KRTC, probably tried to make up its losses from
paying kickbacks by exploiting the Thai laborers working on building
the Kaohsiung MRT system. The poor treatment allegedly triggered
Sunday's riot in which angry Thai worker who had been unhappy about
rigid management set fire to a house and cars, and smashed doors and
window of the manager's office.</P>
      <P>Lai said the DPP legislative caucus will ask the Ministry of
Justice to investigate the matter to see if any legislators,
officials or other individuals have been lining their pockets as
reported in the media.</P>
      <P>He also said the management of foreign laborers working for the
KRTC has infringed upon human rights and hurt the nation's image,
adding that the DPP legislative caucus expresses the strongest
possible condemnation.</P>
      <P>He also said that the introduction of foreign laborers was a
policy under the previous Kuomintang (KMT) administration and that
the brokerage companies were run by KMT members then.</P>
      <P>On reports that DPP legislators have been involved in receiving
kickbacks, Lai said he has confidence in the ethics of the DPP
lawmakers and expressed the hope that the truth will be uncovered in
the investigation, regardless of who might be involved.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld
said Tuesday that he neither finds the current Chinese-Russian joint
military exercise notable nor sees it as a threat to Taiwan or to
anyone else.</P>
      <P>The secretary made the comments at a joint press conference he
held with Adm. Edmund Giambastiani Jr., vice chairman of the Joint
Chief of Staffs.</P>
      <P>In response to a question regarding whether he is concerned about
the first-ever Chinese-Russian joint military exercise, Rumsfeld said
that the United States is obviously observing the drills.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he added that he doesn't see the joint military
exercise as particularly significant as "nations have exercises all
the time."</P>
      <P>"We do with any number of countries, dozens of different
countries. And we -- NATO countries, do with Russia on various
things, and with India, " he further said, adding that "it is just a
fact that countries get together and engage in various types of
exercises."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Adm. Giambastiani said at the press conference that
the United States monitors all military exercises, including the
ongoing joint Chinese-Russian drills.</P>
      <P>The eight-day military exercise, which began last Thursday,
involves some 10,000 air, sea and land troops. The drills are
designed to test the ability of the two countries's counter-terrorist
and counter-separatist capabilities, according to Russian and Chinese
officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXECUTIVE YUAN TO SUBMIT NEW VERSION OF ARMS PROCUREMENT BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan on Wednesday withdrew
its NT$480 billion (US$15 billion) arms procurement draft bill which
had been bogged down in the Legislative Yuan for the last two
sessions because of opposition from lawmakers of the "pan-blue
alliance."</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Cho Jung-tai said that in response to
lawmakers' demands, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) has
decided to change the proposed manner of funding the three items in
the arms package that the United States has agreed to sell to Taiwan
to help beef up the island's self-defense capabilities.</P>
      <P>The three items in the package -- eight diesel-electric
submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries and a squadron
of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft -- have a total price tag of US$15
billion.</P>
      <P>In the new version of the arms procurement bill, which is
expected to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan next week, the MND
has listed the six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries, costing
NT$100 billion, in its regular budget, instead of proposing that they
be funded by a special budget.</P>
      <P>The move is expected to significantly improve the arms
procurement bill's chances of being passed by the Legislative Yuan as
one of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" lawmakers' main criticisms
of the original bill was the funding of all the items through a
special budget.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) is
working to form a pharmaceutical export strategic alliance as part of
its efforts to help local manufacturers make inroads into overseas
markets, IDB officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ten pharmaceutical companies have expressed a willingness to join
the alliance, which will be aimed at seeking generic drug export and
overseas OEM orders, as well as at trying to gain market share in the
United States and Japan for Taiwan drug makers.</P>
      <P>According to the IDB, the total output of the pharmaceutical
industries in Europe, Japan and the United States accounts for more
than 80 percent of the global total.</P>
      <P>As Japan enacted a new law this April regulating the separation
of production and sale of pharmaceuticals and as the U.S. government
has been encouraging the use of generic drugs, now is the perfect
time for Taiwan pharmaceutical companies to make inroads into these
markets, the IDB officials said.</P>
      <P>The bureau has plans to form three strategic alliances to push
for the export of 10 to 15 kinds of generic drugs. It's expected that
in five years, Taiwan's pharmaceutical exports will increase NT$10
billion (US$3.1 billion) , posting an annual growth rate of over 20
percent.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday that
businesses should not introduce foreign laborers in order to save
money, claiming that this way of thinking is "wrong."</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks in an Executive Yuan floor meeting in the
wake of Sunday's riot by Thai laborers working for the Kaohsiung
Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) . The workers have long been unhappy about
the rigid and unreasonable treatment meted out by their management.</P>
      <P>Hsieh claimed that Taiwan introduced foreign laborers not to save
money but because some major construction projects have failed to
find local workers who are willing to work or because a steady supply
of workers is difficult.</P>
      <P>But at present, a great number of businesses use foreign laborers
because they will work for lower pay. Some employers try to save even
more money through a variety of devices. He described this unfair
treatment as a "wrong mindset."</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that businesses who use foreign laborers
and the Council of Labor Affairs heed this point, and that they treat
the foreign laborers humanely.</P>
      <P>He also admitted that management of foreign laborers may have
been rigid sometimes, but claimed that this is because of problems
with foreign laborers running away from their posts.</P>
      <P>"We will instruct the brokerage companies or employers to
exercise fairness in management," the premier said.</P>
      <P>He said that if work does not need foreign laborers, then
it should be done by local laborers and the employers should not
hire foreign laborers as a money-saving move.</P>
      <P>He also lauded the foreign laborers for the often-dirty and
dangerous work they do.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.
(TSMC) claimed Wednesday that all of its investment projects in
China, including transfer of technology, have been done "completely
in accordance with the government's laws and regulations."</P>
      <P>TSMC, the world's largest made-to-order chip maker, made the
statement in response to media reports that the company is planning
to invest in a handset IC design house in China.</P>
      <P>The design house will be jointly set up by China's heavyweight
home appliance maker TCL Corp. and venture capital firms, with Glenda
Hu -- who recently quit his post as TSMC vice president for marketing
-- in charge of the joint venture, according to the reports.</P>
      <P>In a rare step, TSMC Chairman Morris Chang visited the minister
of economic affairs and then the premier Tuesday to explain his
company's investment plans. The company also took out newspaper
advertisements Wednesday stating that all of its China investments
are completely legal.</P>
      <P>The ads said the company does not plan to build any 12-inch wafer
foundries in China, noting that it was expanding two such plants in
Hsinchu and Tainan.</P>
      <P>The company also pointed out that neither its Emerging Alliance
Fund or its VTAF II Fund have invested in China. "If we are to invest
in China, we will thoroughly follow the laws and regulations of the
government of the Republic of China," it added.</P>
      <P>Institutional investors said TSMC took the unusual step to
explain itself because it's good image as a law-abiding company might
be damaged by the reports, while people might associate TSMC with its
rival, United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) , which was recently
embroiled in alleged illegal investment in China revolving around the
He Jian Technology (Suzhou) Co.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Raymond Burghardt, a former head of the
Taipei office of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , has been
tapped to serve as AIT chairman, reliable sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Burghardt, a retired career diplomat, will fill the vacancy that
has been left vacant by the resignation of Therese Shaheen in April
2004.</P>
      <P>Burghardt's new appointment has yet to be officially confirmed.
He did not return phone calls from reporters.</P>
      <P>Burghardt served as the AIT Taipei office director, or the de
facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan, from 1999 to 2001. He then took over
as U.S. ambassador to Vietnam until last year. He assumed his current
post as a department chief at the East-West Center in Hawaii early
this year.</P>
      <P>Sources said Burghardt will retain his East-West Center post
after assuming the AIT chairmanship.</P>
      <P>The AIT, which has offices in Arlington, Virginia, and in Taiwan,
is a nonprofit, private corporation established in 1979 to handle
U.S.-Taiwan relations in the absence of diplomatic ties. The U.S.
State Department provides a large part of the institute's funding and
guidance.</P>
      <P>Apparently because its function as an intermediary body between
Taiwan and the United States has gradually diminished, the sources
said Burghardt will continue to reside in Hawaii and that the
day-to-day affairs at the AIT headquarters in Arlington will be
handled by Deputy Managing Director Barbara Jane Schrage.</P>
      <P>Before taking up his AIT Taipei post, Burghardt served as
consul-general in Shanghai and as deputy chief of the U.S. embassies
in Manila and Seoul. He has also worked in Beijing, Hong Kong and the
Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa.</P>
      <P>Burghardt ended his Taipei tenure at a time when Taiwan-U.S.
relations were in the best shape for many years. President Chen
Shui-bian decorated him with the Order of Brilliant Star with Grand
Cordon in recognition of his contribution to the promotion of
Taiwan-U.S. relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WORKERS' RIGHTS GROUPS VOICE SUPPORT FOR THAI WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.  24 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three workers' rights groups in Taiwan
voiced their support Wednesday for the Thai laborers who staged a
riot last Sunday in Kaohsiung County, southern Taiwan, to protest
their poor treatment by their employers and a manpower brokerage
company.</P>
      <P>Members of the Taiwan International Workers' Association, the
Workers' Legislative Action Committee, and the Catholic Hope Workers'
Center clashed with police when they tried to enter the office
building of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) to deliver a
statement.</P>
      <P>The groups claimed it is a basic human right to rise up against
oppression and that the riot by Thai workers was a "resistance
against tyranny." Therefore, they said, the CLA should not deport any
of the Thai workers because of their involvement in the riot.</P>
      <P>In their statement to the CLA, the groups urged the council to
trace the real cause of the riot and punish the Kaohsiung Rapid
Transit Corp. and Huapan Manpower Consultant and Management Co. for
their violations of human rights and their "enslavement" of the Thai
laborers.</P>
      <P>The groups also want labor affairs officials in Kaohsiung County
to be penalized because they received the complaints about the
inhumane treatment of Thai laborers more than a year ago but have
done nothing. The complaints include overcrowded living quarters,
poor-quality food, mandatory use of vouchers in lieu of money in the
dormitory area, overtime pay not paid in full and no detailed
explanation of money withheld from their monthly wages.</P>
      <P>The CLA must face squarely the fact that its current policy on
the introduction of foreign labor into Taiwan has resulted in a "new
system of slavery, " the statement said, adding that the CLA should
institute reforms, such as removing the limit on the number of years
a foreign laborer is allowed to stay in Taiwan, lifting the ban on
foreign laborers switching to another employer, and abolishing the
private foreign labor brokerage system.</P>
      <P>The human rights groups also want the CLA to publicize the names
of those who profit from exploitation of foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>Some 1,700 foreign laborers -- mostly Thais -- are employed to
work on greater Kaohsiung's rapid transit railway project. They live
in four two-story dormitories at Kangshan in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>The Sunday riot occurred when a staff member of the management
office allegedly used an electric cattle prod to stop some Thai
workers from drinking in the living quarters. About 100 Thai workers
joined the protest by setting fire to their dormitory and the
management office. The riot caused NT$10 million in property damage.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu offered an
apology Wednesday to the foreign workers affected by the recent riot
in Kaohsiung, saying that it is regrettable that such a thing could
have happened in Taiwan, a nation she described as being committed to
human rights protection.</P>
      <P>Lu, who traveled to the southern port city in her capacity as the
head of a Presidential Office human rights advisory panel to look
into the repercussions of the riot, called for the country to treat
foreign laborers fairly.</P>
      <P>She said the country should treat the foreign laborers, who are
here helping Taiwan with its construction, as kin.</P>
      <P>Lu added that at a time of increasing globalization, when Taiwan
is endeavoring to develop its businesses and industries so they can
link up with the world, the country is becoming increasingly reliant
on foreign nationals working in Taiwan to help bolster national
construction and infrastructure development.</P>
      <P>As to who or which agency is to blame for the incident, Lu said
the police and prosecutors should look into the case
impartially to find out who should be held responsible.</P>
      <P>The riot at a Thai laborers' dormitory in Kangshan, Kaohsiung
County, occurred Sunday evening when some laborers were allegedly
attacked by a Taiwanese manager with an electric cattle prod for
drinking alcohol in their living quarters. Over 100 workers joined
the ensuing protest, setting fire to a house and smashing up the
management office, causing an estimated NT$10 million in property
damage.</P>
      <P>The Thai laborers returned to work Tuesday after receiving
promises from the management that none of them will be laid off and
sent back to Thailand because of the riot. A day earlier, the
management agreed to 14 of their 16 demands for better treatment.</P>
      <P>Thai nationals comprise the largest group of foreign laborers
currently working in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KRTC SHOULD BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR RIOT: LABOR OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC), which
hires Thai laborers for MRT construction work, should bear
responsibility for the riot Sunday, Lai Chin-lin, vice minister of
the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA), said in Kaohsiung Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lai made the remarks when he led an investigation team comprising
human rights experts, scholars, Thai officials and representatives
from human rights groups, to inspect the KRTC.</P>
      <P>Lai said the CLA wants to investigate the responsibility of the
KTRC in the riot because it is the employer of 1,728 foreign
laborers, more than 100 of whom took part in the riot.</P>
      <P>KRTC officials should deal with the issue and report to the
public about the incident, Lai said.</P>
      <P>As for whether the KRTC is involved in the exploitation of the
foreign laborers for its own profits, the CLA will also look into the
issue, Lai said.</P>
      <P>Lai rebutted reports that foreign laborers hired by the KRTC had
come under an agreement between the governments of the two countries
and that no brokerage companies were involved, saying that the
foreign laborers had come to Taiwan via brokerage companies.</P>
      <P>The team is now closely watching if Huapan Manpower Consultant
and Management Co., which is in charge of providing services to the
foreign laborers for the KRTC, is involved in the labor recruiting
process, he added. Reports have said that Huapan might resort to
exploitation of the laborers because it has to make up for losses
incurred by the kickbacks it has to pay to corrupt officials and
lawmakers.</P>
      <P>He said that if Huapan, registered as a life management company
with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, is involved in manpower
brokerage, it will be fined between NT$300,000 (US$9,375) and NT$1.5
million.</P>
      <P>Also, if the KRTC is not paying foreign laborers for overtime
work, it will be fined between NT$60,000 and NT$300,000 in line with
the Labor Standards Law, he added.</P>
      <P>Lai earlier listened to a briefing by the KRTC on the management
of foreign laborers at the KRTC.</P>
      <P>Lai said that on an tour of the foreign laborer center, he found
the place so cramped that after no more than 30 minutes, it gave a
sense of suffocation.</P>
      <P>On the management regulations formulated by the KRTC and Huapan,
Lai also described many of them as unreasonable and unbearable.
The regulations state that "those who jump over walls" will be fined
NT$3,000, gamblers will be fined NT$1,000, and those filing complaints
directly to the Thai mission in Taiwan will be fined NT$1,000.</P>
      <P>Wu Jen-hao, a member of the investigation team and president of
the Taiwan Human Rights Association, said that Huapan is confining or
disciplining the foreign laborers, which he pointed out is not
management.</P>
      <P>Lai demanded that the problem of insufficient restrooms and
cramped living spaces be improved in between three and seven days.
The KRTC has also promised to give some relief to the overcrowded
dormitory situation by the end of September. The 1,700 foreign
workers currently live in four crowded two-story dormitories.</P>
      <P>The KRTC promised to establish a complaint-handling system for
foreign laborers within three days and said the foreign laborers will
be allowed to form their own meals committee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIT MUM ON NEW HEAD REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei office of the American Institute
in Taiwan (AIT) refused to comment Wednesday on reports that one of
its former heads has been tapped to serve as AIT chairman and
managing director.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, Raymond Burghardt, who served as the
AIT Taipei office director -- the de facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan
-- from 1999 to 2001, will be named to head the AIT, the
quasi-official U.S. organization authorized to handle exchanges with
Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Responding to a press inquiry about the reports, a spokesman for
the AIT Taipei office said: "We don't have anything to say."</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) also refrained from
commenting on the reports.</P>
      <P>"We are not in a position to comment on any unconfirmed U.S.
personnel reshuffle reports, " said MOFA spokesman Michel Lu. While
fully respecting U.S. personnel arrangements, Lu said, the MOFA is
hopeful that a new AIT chief will work toward improved Taiwan-U.S.
relations.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, Burghardt, a retired career diplomat,
will fill the vacancy that has been left vacant by the resignation of
Therese Shaheen in April 2004.</P>
      <P>After ending his AIT Taipei office director tenure in 2001,
Burghardt took over as U.S. ambassador to Vietnam until last year. He
assumed his current post as a department chief at the East-West
Center in Hawaii early this year.</P>
      <P>Sources said Burghardt will retain his East-West Center post
after assuming the AIT chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Apparently because its function as an intermediary body between
Taiwan and the United States has gradually diminished, the sources
said Burghardt will continue to reside in Hawaii and that the
day-to-day affairs at the AIT headquarters in Arlington will be
handled by Deputy Managing Director Barbara Schrage.</P>
      <P>Before taking up his AIT Taipei post, Burghardt served as
consul-general in Shanghai and as deputy chief of the U.S. embassies
in Manila and Seoul. He has also worked in Beijing, Hong Kong and the
Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa.</P>
      <P>Burghardt ended his Taipei tenure at a time when Taiwan-U.S.
relations were in the best shape for many years. President Chen
Shui-bian decorated him with the Order of Brilliant Star with Grand
Cordon in recognition of his contribution to the promotion of
Taiwan-U.S. relations.</P>

      <P>A total of 51 young people from around the
world gathered Wednesday at the Ministry of Education (MOE) to share
their travel experiences at the end of a two-week visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>These young people from France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Great
Britain, New Zealand, Australia, the United States and Canada were
chosen by the MOE this year to participate in an in-depth Taiwan
travel program to promote tourism.</P>
      <P>Most of the travelers, aged between 18 and 35, said they were
deeply impressed by Taiwan's beautiful scenery and the hospitality of
its people.</P>
      <P>A young man from France described Taiwan culture as a kind of
mixture of Chinese and Japanese culture and a showcase of Asian
culture. He added that it was fascinating for him to experience the
whole Asian culture in Taiwan in just two weeks.</P>
      <P>Another French youth said he was most impressed by the public
facilities in Taiwan offered to the handicapped, which he said are
insufficient in France.</P>
      <P>The Canadian representatives said they were very much attracted
by Taiwan's mountains and temples and will share their travel
experiences in Taiwan with Canadian university students after
returning home.</P>
      <P>Tal Gory from Australia, who has studied Chinese for two years
and lived in Shanghai for six months last year, said he thought
originally that Taiwan was just a small place and did not know there
is such beautiful scenery and wonderful food here.</P>
      <P>Noting that his Australian classmates studying Chinese all put
China as their top travel and study priority, Gory said he has
discovered the beauty of Taiwan, which he said is also cleaner, in
better order and more hospitable than China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO SIMPLIFY PROCEDURE FOR USING CHARITY FUNDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday that
charity funds should not be blocked by bureaucratic procedures on the
way to benefiting the needy.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made his remarks as criticism was mounting as to why a
Government Information Office-initiated fund for Southeast Asian
tsunami victims has been lying dormant in a bank account without ever
reaching those it was intended for.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said the long delay was
absolutely unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that if the government cannot speedily hand out the
money raised from the public, people naturally will be suspicious as
to where the NT$400 million (US$12.5 million) raised for the tsunami
victims has gone.</P>
      <P>In fact, he claimed, the money is still there and he urged the
media not to "distort the facts, " saying that what is precious about
Taiwan society is that there are a lot of kind and loving people who
are willing to help the less fortunate.</P>
      <P>If there are legal or institutional stumbling blocks to using the
donated funds, then officials must figure out ways of solving the
problem, he said.</P>
      <P>In order to prevent a similar fiasco from happening again, Hsieh
said the government has drafted a new law to govern funds raised for
public good, which will be discussed at a Cabinet meeting later this
month before being sent to the legislature.</P>
      <P>The draft law governs only raising funds for "public good"
purposes and does not cover political or religious donations.</P>
      <P>The proposed law bans government agencies from initiating a
fund-raising activity, an improvement from the current law that was
last amended in 1953 and does not ban the government from doing so.</P>
      <P>Rather, it allows the government to collect donations from
government employees and to handle donations that have been made
voluntarily by non-government employees.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed law, a fund-raising activity can last no more
than a year, and within a month of its conclusion, a report must be
sent to the responsible government office. When the funds have been
used up, another report must also be filed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RED CROSS CHIEF DEFENDS USE OF DONATIONS FOR TSUNAMI RELIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Red Cross Society of the ROC on
Wednesday denied that it has been slow in distributing donations for
tsunami relief, saying that the money has been earmarked for release
over five years.
C. V. Chen, president of the Red Cross Society of the ROC, said that
the society has collected around NT$730 million (US$22.81
million) for relief, and that NT$150 million, 22 percent, had been
spent thus far.</P>
      <P>Chen was responding to allegations made by Lin Cheng-hsiu, a
former chief of the Bureau of Civil Affairs of the Taipei City
Government who leads a team called "Concern for Aceh, Indonesia." Lin 
said that eight months after the disastrous tsunami in South Asia,
the ROC Red Cross Society has shown poor implementation in providing
relief.</P>
      <P>Chen vehemently denied the charges, adding that the society has
cooperated with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent societies to use the money in Indonesia, Sri Lanka and
Myanmar for five-year assistance projects. By then, the money used
will have reached NT$680 million, or about 93 percent of the donated
money.</P>
      <P>Chen did not address the issue of the interest the money would
have made over that time and where it would go.</P>
      <P>The issue of public donations for tsunami relief was put under
the spotlight recently after reports revealed that not one NT dollar
of the NT$400 million donated to a campaign initiated by the
Government Information Office to sponsor children in the
tsunami-affected areas has been distributed to the charity groups it
commissioned to do the relief work.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to point out that a sewage disposal project in
Indonesia, the establishment of a shipbuilding factory and a fishing
boat construction project in Sri Lanka cannot be completed in a short
time.</P>
      <P>The assistance to tsunami-affected areas requires long-term work,
Chen stressed, and "should not be gauged by the speed of spending
money."</P>
      <P>Chen also explained that setting aside 2 percent of the donations
to use as administrative management fees is in line with the law. If
public welfare organizations want to do a good job, they should have
the necessary finances to do charity work responsibly, he said. All
the fees are spent on air tickets and accommodations for relief
workers, as well as communications between the society and the
disaster-affected areas.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the 100-year-old Red Cross Society will not
tolerate unfounded criticism.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that there is absolutely no such thing as the Red
Cross Society's Taipei branch deducting 15 percent of the donations
as a commission, saying that donors receive a receipt for their
donations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education reaffirmed the
government's stance of dissuading people from studying in China, in
spite of Beijing's offer Wednesday of tuition and scholarship
incentives to Taiwan students.</P>
      <P>China's Ministry of Finance announced that starting next
semester, which begins this fall, Taiwan students will only have to
pay the same tuition as their mainland Chinese counterparts.</P>
      <P>Beijing is also offering 7.2 million yuan (US$864,000) in
scholarships to 20 percent of Taiwan students studying in China.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan students have to pay much higher tuition to
study in China.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, Vice Minister of Education Lu Mu-lin repeated the
government's policy of not encouraging students to study in China
because its diplomas and degrees are not accredited.</P>
      <P>Besides, he said, there are no official exchanges between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait. "If something happens to our students
there, it will be very difficult for the government to offer any
help," he added.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in spite of the many incentives being offered by
China, he advised Taiwan students against "the adventure of going to
China." However, the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) took credit
Wednesday for winning the preferential treatment for the people of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung welcomed the Chinese announcement,
saying China was making good on its word to a KMT delegation that
visited Beijing in March.</P>
      <P>The KMT delegation, led by Vice Chairman Chiang Ping-kun, reached
a 12- point consensus with Taiwan Affairs Office Director Chen
Yun-lin that included allowing Taiwan students to pay the same
tuition as mainland Chinese students and offering scholarships to
Taiwan students.</P>
      <P>According to China's statistics, from 1985 to 2000, Chinese
colleges and universities recruited 2,895 undergraduate and 864
graduate students from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Between 2001 and 2004, 2,875 Taiwan students attended Chinese
higher education institutions while 2,766 others sought master's and
Ph.D. degrees. In 2004, the number of Taiwanese students seeking
degrees in China reached a high of 1,777.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARMS PACKAGE SHOULD ENTER DISCUSSION STAGE: LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24 (CNA)
(By sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
said Wednesday he thinks that now is the time for lawmakers to start
screening a long-stalled U.S. weapons procurement package.</P>
      <P>Wang, an opposition Kuomintang (KMT) heavyweight, made the
remarks after the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration
decided earlier in the day to withdraw the special arms procurement
statute and come up with a revised one for legislative approval.</P>
      <P>"It's a goodwill response to opposition parties' demands, " Wang
said, adding that the move may make it easier to get the
opposition-controlled legislature to begin a rational debate on the
long-delayed package.</P>
      <P>For more than a year, the KMT and its "pan-blue alliance" ally --
the People First Party (PFP) -- have used their slim majority in the
legislature to hold up the special NT$480 billion arms procurement
bill, saying that the purchase would spark an arms race with rival
China that could bankrupt Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Included in the package are eight diesel-electric submarines, a
squadron of 12 anti-submarine aircraft and six Patriot PAC III
anti-missile batteries.</P>
      <P>At its weekly meeting Wednesday, the Cabinet approved a new
proposal to finance the arms package, divided between a modified
special budget, and the regular defense allocation.</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said the Ministry of Defense is
still working on the details; however, he said the general direction
was to move the Patriot missile allocation of more than NT$100
billion from the special budget to the regular defense budget.</P>
      <P>Both come from state coffers, but the regular defense budget
carries more rigorous oversight provisions, suggesting the DPP
administration believes that the new transparency will convince the
opposition to drop its long-standing objections to the package.</P>
      <P>"The defense ministry will present a new proposal which will
promote harmony between the government and the opposition, " Cho
quoted Premier Frank Hsieh as saying at Wednesday's Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>Wang said he is pleased to see the DPP administration finally
responding to the opposition camp's call for changing the way the
arms package will be funded. Nevertheless, Wang said he is not sure
whether the Cabinet's revised funding proposal can receive majority
support in the legislature, which will open its new session in
mid-September.</P>
      <P>Responding to the DPP administration's new funding proposal, both
KMT and PFP legislative caucuses said they agreed to let the
legislative defense committee begin substantive screening of the arms
package during the next legislative session.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, they stressed that they would not necessarily
accept all of the DPP-proposed terms.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Lin Yu-fang, who is a co-convener of the
legislative defense committee, said the Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries are still undergoing modifications.</P>
      <P>"Is it too much for Taiwan to purchase six sets at one time?
Moreover, the United States is now developing a high-altitude
intercept system. Is it wise for us to purchase Patriot missiles?
As far as arms procurement is concerned, we must also consider our
financial structure and whether the United States will offer
technological transfers and make reciprocal purchases from Taiwan, "
Lin said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) is
suspected of having falsified documents when it applied to the
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) to import Thai laborers for its
railway project, a senior CLA official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kuo Fang-yu, a CLA department chief in charge of occupational
training, who is a member of the human rights task force formed by
the CLA to investigate the causes of the riot by Thai workers Sunday,
told a news conference that KRTC's application shows that the company
was going to import the Thai laborers itself.</P>
      <P>However, Kuo pointed out, the contract signed between KTRC and
Huapan Manpower Consultant and Management Co. shows that the Thai
laborers were brought in by Huapan.</P>
      <P>This means that KTRC might have falsified the information and
that Huapan -- an illegal company not registered with the CLA --
might have violated regulations of the Employment Services Act by
importing foreign laborers illegally for KRTC, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Lai Chin-lin, deputy minister of the CLA, who spent Tuesday in
Kaohsiung heading the human rights task force that is investigating
the riot, confirmed that Huapan is an illegal broker that imports and
manages foreign laborers for local companies.</P>
      <P>Lai said the task force has asked authorities in Kaohsiung County
to collect more concrete evidence before recommending legal action.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, speculation is rife that some heavyweight legislators
used their pull to help Huapan get the lucrative contract to import
and manage foreign laborers for the MRT construction project and that
these legislators and KRTC have been receiving kickbacks from Huapan.
Some local newspapers are calling these alleged exploiters "blood
suckers."</P>
      <P>Tang Chin-chuan, vice minister of the Department of Justice, told
news media Wednesday that an investigation will begin to find out
whether there is a profiteering racket exploiting foreign laborers.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A reagent that can detect the presence of
the avian flu virus in 50 minutes has been developed in Taiwan,
agriculture official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Soong Hua-chung, director of the Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine under the Council of Agriculture
(COA), said the reagent, developed jointly by the COA Animal Health
Research Institute, the National Chung Hsing University in Taichung
County and his bureau, has successfully made sample tests and is
ready for commercial production.</P>
      <P>The advantage of this new reagent is that it takes only 50
minutes to get results, which is much shorter than with existing
methods; therefore, it is an invaluable weapon in the fight against
the disease, not to mention that it is more accurate, sensitive and
easier to use.</P>
      <P>The two methods available now in detecting the avian flu virus
are to separate the virus, which takes days, or to use the reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction to find the virus, which
takes about four hours.</P>
      <P>Both methods need costly equipment and skilled technicians which
are affordable only by a few big hospitals, Soong said.</P>
      <P>The newly developed reagent can be transported and stored at room

      <P>The Ministry of Justice has ordered an

working on the mass rapid transit (MRT) railway project in Kaohsiung,
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin Ching-tsung, a prosecutor from the Kaohsiung District
Prosecutors' Office, which is responsible for the probe, said his
office will also investigate whether kickbacks are being paid in the
process of hiring foreign laborers or if the workers are being
exploited by labor agents.</P>
      <P>The riot began late Aug. 21 at a foreign laborers' dormitory in
Kangshan, Kaohsiung County, when MRT management tried to stop some
Thai workers from bringing alcohol into the dormitory.</P>
      <P>The Thai workers, already dissatisfied with the management, set
fire to part of the dormitory and the management office, and attacked
policemen and firefighters with stones.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung MRT officials and executives of the Huapan Manpower

    <HEADLINE>MONEY FOR TSUNAMI VICTIMS WILL BE APPROPRIATED AUG. 26: GIO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Government Information Office (GIO)
Minister Pasuya Yao said Wednesday that the first lot of money
donated to tsunami victims in Southeast Asia will be appropriated Aug.
26.</P>
      <P>Yao made the remarks after visiting two non-governmental
organizations -- World Vision Taiwan (WVT) and the Chinese Fund for
Children and Families/Taiwan (better known as CCF/Taiwan) -- which
are responsible for distributing the donated money to the needy.</P>
      <P>A campaign initiated by former GIO Minister Lin Chia-lung to
donate money to tsunami victims collected NT$400 million (US$12.5
million) since January, with several NGOs in Taiwan promising to each
support 3,000 children in tsunami-affected countries.</P>
      <P>However, the GIO has been criticized for the delay in
appropriating the money to the NGOs, with Yao denying the
inefficiency of the government and claiming that the money has to go
through certain appropriation procedures both in government agencies
and the private enterprises that made the donations.</P>
      <P>WVT President Tu Ming-han and CCF/Taiwan Director Chou Hui-shiang
agreed that reports about the delay in money appropriations for so
many months after the disaster occurred in late last year were
mistakes.</P>
      <P>Chou and Tu said their plans to financially support 3,000
tsunami-affected children each have not been affected as claimed by
the reports, and other relief work has never stopped.</P>

      <P>A cargo ship ran aground in waters
off Makung Seaport, Penghu County early Thursday morning, with no
causalities or damages to the ship reported, a Port of Kaohsiung
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The 480-ton freighter "Yenyu," which shuttles between Anping,
Tainan, and the outlying island carrying construction materials
and daily necessities, encountered heavy fog on its way to Makung
Wednesday night and deviated from its set course. The ship ran
aground on a reef during its final approach to Makung, according to
the spokesman.</P>
      <P>Although the strike raised one-third of the ship's hull above the
water's surface, it did not cause any injuries to the eight crew
aboard or damage to the structure of the ship, the spokesman said,
adding that no fuel pollution has been detected so far.</P>
      <P>According to a security guard who witnessed the grounding, poor
visibility was to blame for the accident. He also suggested that the
global positioning system installed onboard the ship might not have
been working properly as the ship was well off its set course.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian waded into a
linguistic debate Thursday by declaring that all of the 23 million on
Taiwan are "the masters of Taiwan, not the guests of Taiwan, or
Taike."</P>
      <P>The term Taike has become the focus of a heated debate in Taiwan
as a group of local pop and rock singers prepare to stage a big
concert that they have named "Taike Rock and Roll."</P>
      <P>Pro-Taiwan independence scholars and experts have denounced the
term as derogatory because it was first used by "mainland Chinese
gangs" many years ago to describe what they thought to be "uncouth
Taiwanese and their culture."</P>
      <P>Others have disagreed, claiming that the meaning of a term
changes with the times and that Taike has now acquired the meaning of
the free-wheeling style of Taiwanese youth, who adore multicultural
values and therefore have adopted the term to describe the spirit of
their new music, which is intrinsically Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>Meeting a group of overseas Taiwanese business leaders, Chen said
that instead of being Taike or the guests of Taiwan, "we are brave
Taiwanese, hard-working Taiwanese, and dignified Taiwanese."</P>
      <P>He urged people to feel proud of being the masters of Taiwan,
which is "the root and mother of all Taiwanese businesspeople."</P>
      <P>"Only when Taiwan exists can Taiwan businesspeople have a future;
only when Taiwan develops can Taiwan businesspeople be protected.
This is apparent not only for the businesspeople, but also for all
the 23 million people of Taiwan," Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN URGES KMT TO ABANDON 'ONE CHINA' MYTHOLOGY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged Taiwan's
largest opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), Thursday to abandon
its "one China" mythology and bravely embrace the mainstream values
of Taiwan identity and the concept of Taiwan above all else.</P>
      <P>Chen, meeting a group of overseas Taiwanese business leaders, put
forward three proposals for KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to consider. Ma
has pledged to rekindle the historical ties between the party and
Taiwan before expounding on the party's ideals for all of China.</P>
      <P>First, Chen said the KMT should abandon its "one China" mythology
entirely if it really wants to relate to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Second, he advised the KMT to give up its tactic of
"ruling-opposition struggle" so that cross-Taiwan Strait peace can
enter a new phase.</P>
      <P>Third, the KMT should squarely face up to its party assets
controversy if it is to do justice to society.</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes Ma keeps these proposals in mind while leading
the KMT onto a "totally new path" toward a united Taiwan that will be
better able to resist China's ambition to annex the island country.</P>
      <P>On a practical level, Chen said national defense and cross-strait
relations are the two most important areas of policy initiatives for
Taiwan that require ruling and opposition cooperation.</P>
      <P>At a time when the military balance is tipping in China's favor
and when China is unrelentingly launching one after another
united-front offensives against Taiwan, ruling and opposition parties
in Taiwan must sit down and discuss a common strategy and pass major
bills, including one that authorizes the government to buy critical
defensive weapons, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>A national consensus is also badly needed to establish a "code of
conduct" for both the ruling and opposition parties to follow when
dealing with China, he added.</P>
      <P>He said he does not know what Ma meant when he said the KMT needs
to "link up with Taiwan before embarking on discussing its China
connection, " but he lauded Ma for promising to "have meaningful
dialogue with all the people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's largest opposition party, Chen warned, if the KMT
does not identify itself with Taiwan, it will create a crisis not
only for the KMT itself, but also for Taiwan society as a whole.</P>
      <P>In the face of China's rapid rise, Chen said Taiwan's real
challenge is not the threat from China, but whether domestic unity
can be established and maintained. "If we don't unite, and instead
create chaos as a result of fighting for partisan interests, we will
be giving China more chances to carry out its divide-and-conquer
strategy against us," he said.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that the transfer of power from one political party
to another is neither the result of armed revolution nor a change of
dynasties.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he added, "Partisan competition is nothing but a
democratic choice inside Taiwan, not a power struggle that is often
seen as a zero-sum game."</P>
      <P>The president said he understands that the KMT, which was formed
more than 100 years ago, has its historical legacy, but its leaders
must show great determination to reform and transform the party into
one that truly dovetails with the sentiments of the majority of
people on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"If the party leadership cannot choose to stand on the right side
of history, its promise to 'link up with Taiwan' will end up being
just empty words," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S PROPAGANDA DRIVE AIMS TO FOOL AMERICANS: FOREIGN MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.  25 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
said Thursday that by hiring four public relations companies in the
United States to improve China's image, Beijing is merely trying to
fool the American people.</P>
      <P>In an interview with Radio Taiwan International, Chen noted that
after Taiwan hired the U.S. PR firm Barbour Griffith &amp; Rogers in
March to lobby the U.S government on behalf of Taiwan's interests,
Beijing copied Taiwan's strategy and signed contracts with four U.S.
PR companies recently, paying these firms large sums of money.</P>
      <P>These four PR companies will launch a propaganda drive in the
United States to improve China's image by fooling the American people
into thinking that China has religious freedom, economic equality and
respect for human rights, Chen said, adding, "All these are China's
weaknesses."</P>
      <P>Taiwan agreed to pay Barbour Griffith &amp; Rogers US$4.5 million for
its lobbing services from 2005 to 2008. The PR firm is said to be in
good terms with the Republican Party and the White House.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister explained that Taiwan needs to make use of
lobbing services because unlike China, Taiwan does not have
diplomatic relations with the United States. He acknowledged that it
remains to be seen how effective the lobbing will be.</P>
      <P>Chen said that with full diplomatic ties between China and the
United States, China's foreign minister can speak to his counterpart
directly on the phone. "The real purpose of China stepping up its
propaganda in the United States is to fool the American people, " he
reiterated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN OFFICIAL IN U.S. IN SEARCH OF NEW 'STAR INDUSTRY'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Dallas, Texas, Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Chang Hui-yen and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The telecommunication sector has the
potential to become the next "star industry" in Taiwan following the
semiconductor and panel display industries, the director of the
Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-yi, who is in the U.S. to attend a board meeting of a
Taiwan-U.S. joint venture in Texas, noted that his U.S. visit is also
aimed at seeking multinational cooperation for Taiwan's future "star
industry."</P>
      <P>Under the "two-trillion, two-star" project initiated by the ROC
government, Taiwan hopes the production value of the semiconductor
and display industries exceeds NT$1 trillion (US$31.15 billion) by
2006 and also wants to promote the digital content and biotechnology
sectors as "star industries."</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the production value of semiconductors in Taiwan
has exceeded NT$1 trillion, and that of the display sector is
expected to reach NT$1 trillion next year, and now he is searching
for the third industry whose production value could also reach NT$1
trillion.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the telecommunication sector may become the
next booming industry, as the island has an excellent wireless
telecommunication environment, with the mobile phone penetration rate
reaching 111 percent.</P>
      <P>With its quick development in wireless broadband networking,
Taiwan has attracted many global telecommunication giants to consider
the island as the best partner in research and development and a good
place to use as a test base.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Texas, Chen has visited several globally
well-known telecommunication companies, and will focus his
fact-finding visit on the biotechnology sector in the next few days.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen also revealed that the U.S.-Taiwan joint venture
-- Sino Swearingen Aircraft Corp. (SSAC) -- will deliver the first of
its orders for SJ30-2 twin engine light business jets by the end of
this year.</P>
      <P>The SSAC, established in 1995 and headquartered in San Antonio,
Texas, has so far received orders for 190 SJ30-2 jets, each worth
US$6 million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT URGES PRESIDENT TO HONOR HIS OATH TO ROC CONSTITUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 25 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In response to President Chen Shui-bian's
three proposals to Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou urging him
to end the party's "one China" mythology, the KMT urged Chen Thursday
to honor his oath to the Constitution of the Republic of China which
implies the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Chen also urges the KMT to quit power struggle in parliament and
to return it's allegedly ill-gotten assets to the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Cheng Li-wen, KMT spokesperson, said since Lien Chan was
chairman, the KMT has done its best to handle the party assets issue,
and "an absolute majority of the party assets" have already been
taken care of.</P>
      <P>She reiterated the party's sincerity and determination in
handling what remains as questionable assets.</P>
      <P>On the president's second proposal, Cheng said the power struggle
in the legislature actually originated from "President Chen's style"
-- a style that has been formed by Chen's not respecting the
Constitution, not respecting the majority in the legislature, and his
penchant for inciting ethnic division.</P>
      <P>"The ethnic strife that has been fanned before and after
President Chen obtained ruling power is a problem that he himself
must face candidly," she said.</P>
      <P>She said Ma does not feel flattered by Chen's advice, which was
conveyed through the media. "If the president continues this mode of
communication, the KMT will refuse to respond," she added.</P>
      <P>Ma himself thanked Chen for making these suggestions, but also
said he will not respond to similar messages in the future that are
forwarded by the media.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In response to the recent coverage
of fake wine in Hualien County, staff from the county's Department of
Health (DOH) brought four bottles of rice wine from the eastern
township of Yuli for laboratory tests Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the media, 18 visitors and a number of aboriginal
seniors suffered from temporary sight loss and other symptoms after
drinking the rice wine offered at different Harvest Festivals in
Hualien, where cases of possible fake wine have started to emerge
since Aug. 13.</P>
      <P>The victims suspected what they had was methanol, a poisonous
liquid used as an antifreeze and known to cause blindness, instead of
ethanol, the common intoxicating element in beverages.</P>
      <P>Liao Chien-chih, a DOH technical specialist in Hualien County,
said the bottles had legitimate labels, but that only a laboratory
test can determine whether the samples are authentic.</P>
      <P>To avoid being victims of the fake wine, consumers should always
go to legal retailers and check if the labels on the bottles are
clear and intact, Liao suggested. He also asked consumers to stay
alert should any of these bottles be sold at an unreasonably low

    <HEADLINE>KMT CONFIRMS LAND SALE TO CONSTRUCTION COMPANY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou confirmed Thursday that the party will soon sign a contract
to sell land occupied by the KMT's National Development Institute
(NDI), the party's school for nurturing future leaders.</P>
      <P>Ma made the announcement when pressed by the media about reports
that the KMT will soon sell a NT$4.3 billion (US$134.37 million) plot
of land to Yuan Lih Construction under the condition that the KMT is
responsible for re-zoning the lots so that they can be used for
housing. Currently the land is zoned for organizational use.</P>
      <P>Ma added that the party has "sufficient reasons" to sell the land
at that price.</P>
      <P>The NDI, located in the Wenshan district of Taipei, is made up of
28 lots totaling 78,541 square meters. The listed value of the land
currently stands at more than NT$5.2 billion (US$185.07 million).</P>
      <P>Ma said that he will ask Chang Tze-cheng, the director of KMT's
Administration and Management Committee, to report on the details of
the sale.</P>
      <P>Ma recently said that he will deal with the issue of the party's
assets based on "the principles of law, justice and fairness" by 2008
to show the party's resolve in reforming itself.</P>
      <P>On what other party assets are to be dealt with and the purpose
of their use, Ma only said that the party will make further
assessments, and "we'll deal with them when the time is ripe."</P>
      <P>He said that the proceeds of the NDI land will first be used for
pensions and layoff payments of party workers.</P>
      <P>Chan Chuen-po, KMT secretary-general, also said Thursday that the
NDI land must be sold, adding, "If we don't sell it now, what are we
going to do if we need money."</P>
      <P>Chan refuted reports that the NDI land will be sold cheaply,
saying that re-zoning the land will require approval from the Urban
Planning Commission of the Taipei City Government, and similar
commission of the Ministry of the Interior, and that the re-zoning is
not a sure thing. "The buyer will have to take this risk," he said.</P>
      <P>Chan said that the land transaction was largely a done deal
before Ma assumed the party chairman Aug. 19, adding that the party
needs money to pay retired party workers and monthly salaries for
party workers.</P>
      <P>Chan also said that "the transaction has been obstructed all
along the way," adding that five open bids had fallen through because
no one dared bid.</P>
      <P>On the lower than expected money offered for the land, Chan said
"If people know you are in dire need of cash, they will certainly not
give a good price; this is how the market works."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
said Thursday that he believes the riot last Sunday in southern
Taiwan by Thai laborers will not affect relations between Taiwan
and Thailand.</P>
      <P>Interviewed by a reporter of Radio Taiwan International, Chen
said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will instruct Taiwan's
representative office in Bangkok to tell the government of Thailand
the whole truth about the incident and what the government of Taiwan
will do to resolve the problems.</P>
      <P>Chen acknowledged the contributions by laborers from southeast
Asian countries, especially those from Thailand, to Taiwan's
important construction projects.</P>
      <P>He expressed the belief that Chen Chu, chairwoman of the Council
of Labor Affairs, will rally all the details of the riot, so that the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs can adequately brief the Thai government
via Taiwan's representative in Bangkok.</P>
      <P>The Aug. 21 riot at the living quarters of 1,700 Thai laborers in
Kangshan, Kaohsiung County, occurred when some 100 Thai workers set
fire to a dormitory building and a management office in protest of
the harsh restrictions placed on them and the poor living conditions.
The incident attracted the attention of news media around the world.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu, in her capacity as head of the Human
Rights Advisory Panel of the Presidential Office, went to Kaohsiung
County personally and apologized to the Thai laborers for their poor
treatment. She urged local police and prosecutors to find those

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyuan said
Thursday that ranking police officers will travel to China next month
to discuss issues on cross-strait cooperation in combating crime.</P>
      <P>Su said that cross-strait cooperation in combating crime is
urgent and he believes that China will also be supportive. If the
meeting takes place as schedule next month, it will be "the first
step toward cross-strait cooperation in combating crime," Su added.</P>
      <P>He said both sides of the Taiwan Strait are still discussing
which person to send to the meeting and the time and venue.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks when he handed over cash rewards to policemen
at Taichung Police Station for helping solve a kidnapping case.</P>
      <P>Su said the case involved criminals on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait. Su was referring to the abduction of a 10-year-old son of
the well-to-do owner of a construction company in Taichung, central
Taiwan Aug. 17. Taichung police rescued the hostage and arrested six
suspects in a morning raid Thursday. The prime suspect, Chuang
Ming-yen, who called the family of the victim in Zhuhai, Guangdong,
and asked for a large random, was also said to have been targeted by
public security officers in Guangdong.</P>
      <P>After kidnapping the boy, Chuang went straight to Guangdong the
next day and called from a Zhuhai hotel, thinking that he would not
be caught for the crime committed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su said criminals might not know that both sides of the Taiwan
Strait have established channels to jointly crack down on crime, if
no political factors are involved.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Pingtung County prosecutors said Thursday that when
investigating abduction cases committed by Chinese criminals, they
unexpectedly found that the criminals had 370 "fake" accounts in
Taiwan's financial institutions.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors believe that some of the accounts are currently
being used for fraud.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng urged
Taiwan students Thursday to understand the real reason behind China's
offer of tuition incentives, noting that Chinese tuition may in fact
not be cheaper than in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tuition at some Chinese universities exceeds 20,000 yuan or
NT$80,000 a semester -- almost double what a Taiwan student pays at a
national university -- so people in Taiwan had better wake up from
the myth of low education costs in China, he said.</P>
      <P>He said he would not claim that the quality of education in
Taiwan is better than in China, but he would like people to "see
clearly" for themselves.</P>
      <P>Tu made the remarks one day after Beijing announced that Taiwan
students can pay the same tuition and boarding fees as their Chinese
counterparts starting next semester, which begins in the fall. Hong
Kong and Macau students are not eligible for the preferential
treatment.</P>
      <P>He did not specify what China's "real purpose" was in making the
announcement, saying "we all know in our mind."</P>
      <P>Media handouts given by ministry officials show the number of
students attending China's higher education institutes rose rapidly
from 1.08 million in 1998 to 4.2 million in 2004, indicating that the
quality of education "varies from school to school in such a wide
range that Taiwanese students studying there may not be able to enjoy

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An aboriginal legislator from the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) on Thursday urged the government to
review its foreign labor policy, following the riot caused by Thai
laborers working on the mass rapid transit (MRT) railway project in
the southern city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Liao Kuo-tung, a convener of the hygiene, environment and social
welfare committee in the legislature, suggested the government employ
more aborigines in large-scale infrastructure construction projects.</P>
      <P>Liao noted that under the country's foreign labor policy, the
introduction of foreign workers is to offset the labor shortage in
lower levels of work on the island.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's unemployment rate has been relatively high in
recent years, but the number of foreign laborers has been increasing
significantly, reflecting the absurd foreign labor policy, Liao said.</P>
      <P>For example, he went on, there are more than 10,000 aborigines
living in Kaohsiung, but the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) has
only employed fewer than 500 aboriginal workers in its construction
programs.</P>
      <P>Liao said he wondered whether the aborigines do not want to take
the job, or if the KRTC just wanted to introduce the foreign workers
at a lower cost.</P>
      <P>Noting that aboriginal workers have contributed significantly to
the island's economic development in the past, Liao expressed the
hope that the government can give them another chance to work for
that goal.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an official of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said
the agency found that the Huapan Manpower Consultant and Management
Co., which is responsible for the management of the Thai laborers, is
to blame for improper management.</P>
      <P>The official noted that the Huapan, which does not deem itself a
labor brokerage firm, did not receive a license from the CLA,
resulting in many problems.</P>
      <P>Following the incident in Kaohsiung, the CLA decided that such
foreign laborers management companies should obtain their permits
from the CLA and should be subject to the country's Employment
Services Act by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>Scientists at the Fisheries Research
Institute under the Council of Agriculture disclosed Thursday that
they have found 15 herbal extracts that can curb marine vibrio
bacteria -- a risk to both salt-water fish and humans.</P>
      <P>The scientists said they have conducted a series of tests using
numerous herbs produced under good manufacturing practice (GMP)
regulations promulgated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, to
see if they are effective against vibriosis, pasteurellosis and
streptococcicosis -- diseases that are common among groupers, cobia
and salt-water shrimps.</P>
      <P>So far, the tests have proved that 15 herbs can effectively
control vibrio bacteria.</P>
      <P>They said that developing herbal medicines to treat fish diseases
is the right approach for the fishing industry because of the need to
reduce the widespread over-use of antibiotics and chemical drugs.</P>
      <P>Some countries have already begun to use herbs to treat animal
diseases. For example, in the United States, extracts of garlic and
onion are being used to prevent parasites growing in salmon and
trout, they pointed out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`EQUAL TREATMENT' KEY TO FOREIGN LABOR MANAGEMENT: FPG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Treating foreign laborers "the same" as
their local counterparts and establishing smooth communication
channels are the keys to foreign laborer management, an official of
the Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsin-tze, an FPG manager at the group's sixth naphtha cracker
in the Mailiao Industrial Zone in Yunlin, southern Taiwan, made the
remarks when he briefed Yunlin Magistrate Lee Chin-yung.</P>
      <P>Lee was inspected the industrial zone out of concern for the
conditions endured by foreign laborers and their management in the
zone in the wake of the riot by Thai laborers working for Kaohsiung
Rapid Transit Corp. Sunday over their grossly inhumane treatment.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that the FPG has eight years of experience in hiring
foreign laborers, and based on its experience, humane management is
paramount, he said.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that Mailiao is quite windy and that working conditions
are too harsh for most local workers. If the government had not
allowed the introduction of foreign laborers to help the construction
of the sixth naphtha cracker, it could not have been completed as
scheduled, he said.</P>
      <P>The contribution of foreign laborers to the sixth naphtha
crackers is enormous, he added.</P>
      <P>Wu claimed that the group manages its foreign laborers fairly,
saying it provides air conditioning in their dormitories, separate
shower rooms, familiar food of high quality, and regular outings.</P>
      <P>Mailiao currently has more than 4,800 foreign workers, with 1,700
Filipinos and 3,100 Thai workers. The FPG respects their customs and
religious beliefs, invites priests to preside over worship for
Filipino workers, and sets up Buddhist altars for Thai laborers, he
said.</P>
      <P>The FPG also explains the details of pay to foreign laborers, in
English to Filipino laborers and in Thai to the Thai workers, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>The Maoliao Industrial Zone only has needs for foreign laborers
when it is undergoing expansion. The foreign laborers stay in the
zone mainly for the 4th stage of expansion work, After its
completion, the foreign laborers will have to return home. It is
expected that all of them will return by the end of next year, he
added.</P>
      <P>Mailiao Industrial Zone saw its peak of foreign laborer
employment in 1998, when the number of foreign laborers employed
reached more than 20,000.</P>

spokesman for the Taipei-based Central Bank of China (CBC) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the CBC show that Taiwan's trade surplus
for the January-July period totaled only US$751 million, much less
than Japan's US$50.35 billion, China's US$50 billion, the US$14.42
billion for South Korea and the US$8.6 billion for Singapore.</P>
      <P>The spokesman pointed out that in July alone, Taiwanese tourists
spent US$924 million abroad, exceeding the nations's trade surplus
for the first seven months of this year.</P>
      <P>As a result, there is simply no room for the new Taiwan dollar to
be revalued against other currencies, he said.</P>
      <P>The exchange rate of the NT dollar dropped 1.3 cents against the
greenback Thursday to close at NT$32.293.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC PROSPECTS WILL IMPROVE THIS YEAR: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 25 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic prospects in the second
half of the year will be better than the past half-year in view of
the nation's sound economic structure, President Chen Shui-bian
predicted Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at the Presidential Office while receiving
a group of representatives from companies that have received awards
for excellence.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan, which depends on foreign trade, has enjoyed a
high trade surplus during previous years, Chen said a slight decrease
in trade surplus in the first half of this year has attracted much
attention from the public.</P>
      <P>He said the decrease in trade surplus was not because of the
decline in exports, but due to the considerable increase in the value
of imports as a result of rising oil prices.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan's economic structure is sound, Chen said
the economy will grow moderately in the second half of the year,
barring drastic changes in the international situation.</P>
      <P>However, he said economic development and even national security
will hinge on obtaining a secure and stable energy supply, as more
than 95 percent of Taiwan's energy is imported.</P>
      <P>Citing a report prepared by the United States about China's
military power, Chen said China's consumption of crude oil and
natural gas only accounts for 26 percent of its total energy, with
its imported oil accounting for only 40 percent of its total
petroleum consumption.</P>
      <P>Despite this, the Chinese government still warned its people that
the shortage of petroleum and natural gas has limited its economic
and social development, Chen added.</P>
      <P>In comparison, Chen said, it is more urgent for Taiwan to review
its energy policy in order to reduce the negative impact of possible
energy price fluctuations.</P>
      <P>In addition to increasing the efficiency of energy available, the
government should offer incentives for prive enterprises to develop
renewable energy sources such as hydro, wind and solar power in order
to make Taiwan a real "green silicon island," Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.N. BID PUBLICITY FOCUSES ON TAIWAN STRAIT PEACE: GIO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Government Information Office (GIO)
said Thursday that an international publicity blitz will be launched
next Monday to drum up support for Taiwan's bid to re-join the United
Nations.</P>
      <P>GIO Minister Pasuya Yao said at a news conference that the
publicity campaign will focus on two themes -- Taiwan's participation
and peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The GIO has designed two posters -- "The U.N. can bring peace in
the Taiwan Strait" and "UNHappy 60th Birthday" -- for advertising in
foreign print media and on billboards, Yao said.</P>
      <P>The "UNHappy 60th Birthday" poster carries a subtitle "Can a
family be happy with one member missing? " to symbolize that the
United Nations is "unhappy" on its 60th birthday because of Taiwan's
expulsion from the world body, Yao explained.</P>
      <P>When the United Nations was founded in 1945, the Republic of
China was one of its founding members. However, the ROC has been shut
out of the body since 1971 when U.N. Resolution No. 2758 gave the
"China" seat to the People's Republic of China at the ROC's expense.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has no way of participating (in the U.N.'s 60th birthday
Sept. 13), even though it has more inhabitants than 140 U.N.
members, " Yao said.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, Taiwan has tried every year to ask the U.N. Steering
Committee, through its diplomatic allies, to place Taiwan's U.N. bid
on the General Assembly agenda. Taiwan has been unsuccessful every
time because of the PRC's obstruction.</P>
      <P>Yao said the two posters will form the backdrop for newspaper and
magazine ads to be debuted in New York, Washington, Tokyo and
Brussels from Aug. 29 and he added his hope that world leaders
attending next month's U.N. General Assembly session will take
notice.</P>
      <P>This year, Yao said, the GIO will cooperate with Time Magazine
for the first time in publishing "coverwrap" ads to promote Taiwan's
U.N. bid. </P>
      <P>Moreover, Yao said, the GIO has produced two 30-second broadcast
ads to be aired on New York's WABC radio station from early September
for two weeks.</P>
      <P>In the "U.N. can bring peace in the Taiwan Strait" poster, the
GIO points out that the founding of the United Nations in 1945 was a
commitment to peace after years of war, referring to World War II.</P>
      <P>"Now China openly threatens Taiwan by passing its anti-secession
law, which sets the conditions for the use of force against Taiwan.
Only the U.N. can act as a forum for maintaining security and
peace," the poster reads.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said earlier
in the day that 14 of the ROC's diplomatic allies have lent support
behind the nation's U.N. bid this year.</P>
      <P>With a view to attracting more international attention to China's
threat to Taiwan, Chen said the ROC's allies have presented two cases
to the U.N. Secretariat this year -- Taiwan's U.N. membership and the
Taiwan Strait peace.</P>
      <P>Chen said the "peace" case calls for the U.N. to take
precautionary measures to prevent any conflict in the Taiwan Strait
for the sake of maintaining regional security and stability.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government is seeking U.S. and Japan support for
this new case in hopes that the U.N. General Assembly will formally
discuss the Taiwan Strait issue during its upcoming meeting.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A convener of the Legislative Yuan's
Defense Committee said Thursday that its counterparts in the Japanese
Diet have agreed to have regular exchanges of visits.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Lee Wen-chung
made the remarks after an eight-member delegation led by him returned
to Taiwan after concluding a four-day visit to Japan.</P>
      <P>The delegation also included DPP legislators Sheng Fa-hui and
Tang Huo-sheng, opposition Kuomintang legislators Ker Chun-hsiung,
Liao Wan-jui and Ting Shou-chung, People First Party Legislator Ku
Chung-lien, and Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislator Ho Min-hao.</P>
      <P>Lee said the delegation met with key members of the Japanese
Lower House Security Committee and the Upper House Foreign and
Defense Affairs Committee and they agreed to have regular annual
meetings to discuss security issues involving the two countries.</P>
      <P>The delegation also met with more than a dozen retired generals
from Japanese think tanks.</P>
      <P>Noting that military exchanges between Taiwan and Japan have been
suspended for some time, Lee said the visit has reopened the door for
mutual exchanges.</P>
      <P>He said earlier that Japan's attitude toward Taiwan has undergone
subtle changes in the face of a rising China.</P>
      <P>Japan has been "soft" toward China in the past and only began to
attach greater importance to security in the Taiwan Strait in the
last two or three years, out of concern that a cross-strait conflict
would cut the lifelines of its foreign trade and oil supply.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT 'WILL NOT CREATE TENSION' WITH CHINA: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 25 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh claimed Thursday that
the government "will not create tension" while seeking rapprochement
with China, a move he said will create a win-win situation for both
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks at a ceremony citing outstanding exporters
and importers. He said that since he became premier, he has been
advocating the concept of rapprochement and symbiosis for domestic
politics and cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>He said he has also emphasized the idea that once you are in
charge, you are not supposed to be a troublemaker -- even if the
government is condemned, government officials must show patience in
order to maintain political stability, he said.</P>
      <P>He added that the government needs to improve on many fronts and
he expressed hope that the public will support a government that
knows how to improve itself.</P>
      <P>The government must not create tension but must instead maintain
peace across the Taiwan Strait so that businesses can prosper in a
stable environment, he added.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the government has offered to lend NT$200 billion
(US$6.19 billion) to the nation's small- and medium-sized businesses,
in addition to encouraging banks to extend loans to them, as part of
the government's program to revive the economy.</P>
      <P>For individuals, the government has set up a NT$300 billion fund
from which first-time home buyers can borrow money at low interest
rates, he added.</P>
      <P>Another way to energize the nation's economy is to encourage the
private sector to create more value-added businesses and brand names,
he said.</P>

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
said Thursday he looks forward to improved relations between Taiwan
and France for mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>"France has been forging closer ties with China in recent years.
I hope Taiwan-France ties can grow at a pace parallel to that of
Chinese-French relations," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The minister made the remarks while presiding over a swearing-in
ceremony for Taiwan's new representative to France, Yang Tzu-pao, and
several other foreign mission chiefs.</P>
      <P>Yang, who has a doctoral degree in civil engineering from a
French national university, has been secretary-general of the
International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) under the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and deputy minister of the Overseas
Chinese Affairs Commission.</P>
      <P>During his ICDF tenure, Chen said, Yang initiated many new
programs and injected new vitality to the fund, which is dedicated to
offering aid and promoting agricultural and technological cooperation
with other developing countries.</P>
      <P>Noting that France is a key member of the European Union, Chen
said he is hopeful that Yang can formulate new strategies to boost
exchanges and cooperation with France.</P>
      <P>Yang, who speaks fluent French and has extensive ties with
France, said Taiwan-France ties are in good shape.
Nevertheless, he added, there is still ample room for improvement.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that Taiwan is France's fourth-largest trading
partner in Asia, Yang said he will do his utmost to push France to
further strengthen cooperative ties with Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's highest
labor affairs official apologized Thursday to the nation for failing
to do a good supervising job, resulting in Sunday's riot by Thai
laborers in protest of their maltreatment by their employers and a
brokerage company.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu, chairwoman of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA), made
the apology when she was addressing a gathering in a village for
foreign laborers in Taoyuan County owned by Golden Brother
International Co., a foreign labor brokerage firm.</P>
      <P>Although she claimed the riot was a "single, isolated incident,"
she admitted the incident has damaged Taiwan's image around the world
in the area of human rights.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has served in her current post for five years, said the
CLA has begun a nationwide review of the treatment of foreign
laborers and will send inspectors all over Taiwan to examine the
living and working environments of foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>"We hope to protect the foreign workers and make sure that
similar incidents do not happen again," she said.</P>
      <P>Chen declined to comment on speculation that there is an illegal
profiteering racket between the employer -- Kaohsiung Rapid Transit
Corp. -- and the brokerage firm Huapan Co., that exploits the Thai
laborers, saying only that local prosecutors are looking into the
allegations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ling Po-chih, chief prosecutor of the Kaohsiung
District Attorney's Office, reported to State Public
Prosecutor-General Wu Ying-chao that his office has finished the

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
the popularly elected head of state in a democracy does not hand-pick
an heir or successor.</P>
      <P>"The issue of a popularly elected president picking an heir does
not exist in democratic politics. In a democracy, the ruling mandate
comes from the people. While I am in office I must fulfill my duty.
I cannot let down our voters," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while meeting with members of a
youth camp organized by the Ketagalan Institute, which he founded in
2003 as an independent educational institution for promoting civic
values through education and policy research.</P>
      <P>Noting that he still has more than two years left in office, Chen
said he will not be remembered as a lame-duck president.</P>
      <P>"Instead, I'll remain active and diligent. I have many visions
and programs to accomplish. I won't let down my supporters, " Chen
said as he assured his young guests of his resolve to push for
Taiwan's further advancement.</P>
      <P>Speculation about the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
candidate for the 2008 presidential election has been rife since the
popular mayor of Taipei, Ma Ying-jeou, decisively won the
chairmanship of the main opposition Kuomintang to emerge as the
party's most likely candidate for the next presidential election.
Chen's remarks were seen as part of his efforts to alleviate pressure
on him to delegate more power to DPP hopefuls ahead of the 2008 race.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Justice Investigation
Bureau (MJIB) said Thursday it has begun probes into three
high-profile scandals that have grabbed media attention.</P>
      <P>The three cases are Sunday's riot by Thai laborers working for
the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit system, a water supply crisis in the
northern county of Taoyuan and a delay in the distribution of

      <P>MJIB officials said the bureau's Kaohsiung office has been

      <P>In the case of the Taoyuan water crisis, the officials said, the
MJIB's Taoyuan office will look into whether anybody should be held
responsible for the excessive land exploitation that resulted in high

source -- and rendered the reservoir's water treatment facilities

      <P>The Central News Agency has learned from a reliable source that
Raymond Burghardt, who served as AIT Taipei office director from 1999

the absence of diplomatic relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>But a State Department official said in response to the reports
that the department has no announcement about Burghardt's new job,

    <HEADLINE>MATSU RESIDENTS CONCERNED ABOUT PLANNED TROOP REDUCTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Residents of Matsu are concerned about a
Ministry of National Defense (MND) plan to cut the number of troops
stationed on the outlying island to less than 5,000 by 2008, local
government sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>The planned cut is part of the MND's second-stage military
restructuring project aimed at establishing an elite deterrent force
in the face of China's threat.</P>
      <P>According to the MND's newly sanctioned restructuring plan, the
total number of military personnel stationed on the three outlying
islands of Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu will be trimmed to about 10,000
by 2008.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Tsao Erh-chung from the Matsu
constituency has on many occasions voiced his opposition to any plan
for major troop cuts on Matsu which lies closer to China's
southeastern province of Fujian than to Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>"Unless China renounces the option of using force against Taiwan,
we should not unilaterally disarm ourselves. Without adequate defense
deployment, Matsu's security will be at stake, " Tsao said at a
Legislative Yuan news conference earlier this week.</P>
      <P>Chen Shu-lien, president of the Matsu Chamber of Commerce, and
several senior executives of the organization paid a visit to
Lienchiang County Magistrate Chen Shui-sheng Thursday to express
their concern about the MND's troops reduction plan.</P>
      <P>"Because of the government's gradual reduction of garrison troops
in Matsu in recent years, Chinese fishing boats have often poached in
waters near Matsu or even come ashore for illegal trading. If the
number of troops is cut further, the security situation will get even
worse," Chen Shu-lien said.</P>
      <P>Worse still, he said, Matsu's economic development will also be
seriously affected if the number of garrison troops is further
trimmed.</P>
      <P>The Matsu island group is under the jurisdiction of the
Lienchiang County Government. It has only a limited number of
civilian residents. For years, its economy has relied heavily on
garrison troops' consumption.</P>
      <P>For security and economic well-being, Chen Shu-lien urged the
county government to push the central government and the MND to
rethink the Matsu troop reduction plan.</P>

      <P>The Presidential Office issued a statement
Friday expressing support for a probe into Sunday's riot by Thai
laborers in protest of maltreatment by their employers and a
brokerage company.</P>
      <P>In the terse statement, the Presidential Office said the incident
involved not only a labor-management dispute and infringements on the
rights of foreign laborers, it has also affected social order and the
national image.</P>
      <P>It noted that the prosecutors have started the investigation,
that both President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu have
attached great importance to the incident and that they support the
probe, believing that the deficiencies should be improved upon and
that the irregularities must be exposed and addressed.</P>
      <P>The statement came amid media reports that Chen Che-nan, a

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Taiwan legislators paid a
visit to a permanent nuclear waste storage facility in Nevada
Thursday in an effort to collect useful tips on Taiwan's handling of
radioactive waste.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by officials from the U.S. Department of Energy, the
lawmakers, headed by Legislator Chiu Yung-jen of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, spent several hours touring the Yucca
Mountain Repository, located about 160 km northwest of Las Vegas, and
being briefed by the facility's authorities.</P>
      <P>According to these authorities, the nuclear waste dump is built
in an area not only far from densely populated cities but also an
area where geological conditions is stable, making it suitable for
storage of hazardous materials.</P>
      <P>So far, they said, the Department of Energy has spent US$8
billion developing the underground dump, which is planned to be fully
completed in 10 years. After it is finished, the Yucca Mountain
Repository will be used to store all nuclear reactors and radioactive
waste that is currently stored in 131 smaller facilities scattered
across America. It is estimated that it will remain safe for 10,000
years.</P>
      <P>Nuclear power plants provide about 20 percent of the electricity
used in the United States.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the visit by the legislators, all members of the
Legislative Yuan's Science and Information Technology Committee, is
aimed at emulating the U.S. experience and working out a policy that
will solve Taiwan's nuclear waste problems once and for all.</P>
      <P>State-run Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) has in recent years
prepared to remove over 97,000 barrels of low-level radioactive waste
from Lanyu, which lies off the southeastern Taiwan coast, as the
lease on its storage site has expired.</P>
      <P>The waste, produced by Taipower's three nuclear power plants over
20 years, is scheduled to be inspected and repacked by the end of
2010.
</P>
      <P>Taipower has contacted authorities from home and abroad for the
treatment and disposal of its nuclear waste over the past several
years, including Russia, North Korea and Taiwan's offshore islet of
Wuchiu.</P>
      <P>After the visit to Yucca Mountain, Chiu and his group proceeded
to the Hoover Dam, also in Nevada, to see whether Taiwan can borrow
any ideas from the dam that can help Taiwan streamline water

      <P>Chen Che-nan issued an angry statement amid media reports that he

      <P>Chen, father of acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai, claimed that
the reports were "unfounded."</P>
      <P>The reports noted that Kaohsiung's mass rapid transit system was
inaugurated in March 2001. As the project requires a large number of
foreign laborers over a long period, brokerage operators had
solicited hard for the chance to share a piece of the pie.</P>
      <P>KRTC Vice Chairman Chen Min-hsien later decided to handle the
matter himself, shutting out other brokerage firms.</P>
      <P>Chen denied media reports that he was involved in the
profiteering racket, claiming that the media did not verify their

      <P>On reports that he went with a brokerage operator to Thailand on

    <HEADLINE>THAI CONGRESSMEN VISIT TAIWAN OVER WORKER RIOT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation from Thailand's House of
Representatives arrived in Taipei Friday to get more information
about the recent riot by around 100 Thai laborers working on the mass
rapid transit (MRT) railway project in the southern city of
Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The parliamentary delegation went to the site of the riot to get
more details about the riot and to give moral support to the Thai
workers.</P>
      <P>During their four-day visit, the Thai congressmen will meet
officials from Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) for more talks about
bilateral laboral affairs.</P>
      <P>The riot began late Aug. 21 at a foreign laborers' dormitory in
Kangshan, Kaohsiung County, when MRT management tried to stop some
Thai workers from bringing alcohol into the dormitory, allegedly
attacking them with an electric cattle prod.</P>
      <P>The Thai workers, already dissatisfied with the grossly inhumane
treatment they were forced to endure at the hands of their Taiwanese
management, set fire to part of the dormitory and the management
office, and attacked police and firefighters with stones.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung MRT officials and executives of the Huapan Manpower
Consultant and Management Co., which is responsible for the
management of the laborers, later agreed to many of the demands of
the Thai workers.</P>
      <P>The riot was covered by several foreign wire services and has
caused great concern on the part of the Thai government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Thai official Nakorn Silapa-Archa, who is chief of
inspector general of Thailand's Ministry of Labor, visited Kuo
Fong-yu, director-general of the CLA's Employment and Vocational
Training Administration earlier Friday. Silapa-Archa arrived in
Taiwan Wednesday to look into the riot.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu offered an apology for the incident
Wednesday and the Ministry of Justice ordered a thorough
investigation of the incident, focusing on whether kickbacks are
being paid in the process of hiring foreign laborers or if the
workers are being exploited by labor agents, as well as whether the
workers were under the control of "Thai gangsters or others."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER ENDORSES EX-OFFICIAL OVER BROKERING OF FOREIGN WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh claimed Friday that a
former deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office had not
used his influence to sway the brokerage of Thai laborers for the
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) during Hsieh's six years as a
Kaohsiung mayor.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who left his mayoral post in his second term to assume the
premiership in February, made the remarks amid reports that Chen
Che-nan was a "high-ranking official" involved in the brokering of
Thai laborers, whose riot Sunday to protest mistreatment by their
employer and a brokerage company brought to light a series of
problems, including infringements on the rights of foreign laborers
and a possible illegal profiteering racket between the KRTC and the
brokerage firm Huapan Co.</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that the NT$190 billion (US$5.93 billion) mass rapid
transit (MRT) system in Kaohsiung requires a great number of foreign
laborers over a long period of time, and that the foreign labor
brokerage operators naturally wanted a piece of the lucrative pie.</P>
      <P>But he claimed Chen had absolutely not used his influence to try
to sway the brokering of the foreign laborers for the MRT system,
adding that if there was any shady practice, it would have come to
light earlier.</P>
      <P>Chen had denied vehemently that he was involved in the
introduction of the Thai laborers working for the MRT system, saying
that if there is any truth in the reports, he is willing to take the
harshest punishment. Chen is the father of acting Kaohsiung Mayor
Chen Chi-mai.</P>
      <P>The premier also claimed that if Chen had used his influence
during his time as Kaohsiung mayor, China Steel would not have won
the bid to supply steel products to the KRTC.</P>
      <P>Hsieh recalled that he came under a lot of pressure in the
construction of the MRT system, saying that 26 Kaohsiung city
councilors had petitioned that a company other than China Steel be
awarded the bid, but he overrode their request because China Steel
offered a bid that was cheaper by NT$20 billion.</P>
      <P>He added that Wang Chung-yu, currently an opposition Kuomintang
legislator and then-chairman of China Steel, would have long ago
blown the whistle if he had taken any kickbacks in the open bidding
process.</P>
      <P>On criticism that he turned a blind eye to the maltreatment of
the Thai workers for the KRTC, he also said that during his term as
mayor, the KRTC had only introduced the first group of 800 Thai
laborers.</P>
      <P>He said he inspected the living quarters of the Thai workers with
city government officials, and found the situation to be
"satisfactory."</P>
      <P>Following this, Thai laborers were banned from Taiwan until this
May, whereupon the KRTC introduced a second group of 900 Thai
workers, by which time their quarters had become overcrowded.</P>
      <P>He said that the Council of Labor Affairs has stationed
inspectors in every city and county to monitor the living environment
of foreign laborers, but the inspectors have failed to fulfill their
duties, for which Council of Labor Affairs Chairwoman Chen Chu has
apologized to the public.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung police raided a fast food
restaurant in Taichung City, central Taiwan Friday, nabbing six
people believed to be members of a cross-Taiwan Strait fraud ring
that has swindled money from Taiwan citizens by sending fraud
messages or kidnapping.</P>
      <P>Investigators with the Kaohsiung Police Department found that the
ring, led by a man surnamed Shih, had six key operators in the ring,
which has extorted at least NT$100 million (US$3.1 million) over the
past year in Taiwan by kidnapping people or by operating a variety of
fraud schemes, including sending fraud messages saying that people's
credit cards had been stolen and that thieves had spent a fortune on
the stolen cards or saying that the card holders have outstanding
debts to pay for.</P>
      <P>The police also found that Shih and his men regularly met at fast
food restaurants in southern and central Taiwan to map out the day's
operations.</P>
      <P>Five of the ring members, including Shih, were apprehended in a
restaurant in Taichung City, while the sixth man was arrested in
Hsihu township, Changhua County.</P>
      <P>Almost all the fraud messages that the ring sent out to Taiwan
victims were from China. The victims were fooled into remitting money

    <HEADLINE>PFP LAWMAKERS PLAN LAW AMENDMENT TO PROTECT FOREIGN LABORERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers of Taiwan's second-largest
opposition party -- the People First Party (PFP) -- plan to push for
an amendment to the law to provide better protection for foreign
laborers' rights by allowing them an appropriate channel to vent
their complaints, the PFP caucus at the legislature said Friday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Sun Ta-chien, deputy convener of the PFP legislative
caucus, told a news conference at the Legislative Yuan that the Thai
laborers who rioted last Sunday in southern Taiwan to protest their
inhumane treatment had been exploited by their employers and
employment brokerage firms in both Taiwan and Thailand.</P>
      <P>Sun said the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) must investigate each
case thoroughly in the future when a foreign laborer is to be laid
off and deported to ascertain that the worker did not receive
inhumane and unfair treatment.</P>
      <P>The PFP legislator also urged Premier Frank Hsieh to punish the
government officials whose negligence resulted in the inhumane
treatment that triggered the Aug. 21 riot in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>Specifically, Sun said, the government should find out within
seven days the identity of who the media have claimed is an
"influential figure" involved in the illegal brokerage of foreign
laborers.</P>
      <P>He urged the premier to make Chen Min-hsien, vice chairman of the
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) -- the employer of the Thai
workers -- suspend a trip abroad and come home to explain how, as a
shareholder owning only 7 percent of the total investment, he is able
to control KRTC, in which public funds account for more than 80
percent of the company's total capital.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the news conference, Legislator Lin Hui-kuan, a
whip of the PFP caucus who is also president of the Chinese
Federation of Labor Unions, said the riot has dented Taiwan's
international image as a nation that champions human rights.</P>
      <P>Lin said that CLA Chairwoman Chen Chu, the highest labor affairs
official, must shoulder her share of the "political responsibility"
for the incident, or the PFP caucus will not rule out the possibility
of blocking the CLA's budget for next year in the new legislative
session that begins in September.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE-RUSSIAN DRILL AIMED AT POSSIBLE CROSS-STRAIT WAR: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A just-concluded Chinese-Russian joint
military exercise was apparently aimed at a possible conflict across
the Taiwan Strait, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks after attending a seminar on legal problems
faced by local small- and medium-sized enterprises.</P>
      <P>Noting that the eight-day Chinese-Russian drills included a naval
blockade, an amphibious beach landing and an invasion by paratroopers
on China's east coast, Wu said the maneuvers were apparently aimed at
preparing for a possible cross-strait war.</P>
      <P>"The unprecedented Chinese-Russian joint military drills embody
the continuously escalating Chinese threat to and suppression of
Taiwan, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>Since Chinese President Hu Jintao took power, Wu said, China has
adopted a "carrot-and-stick" strategy toward Taiwan. While offering
ostensibly attractive terms for Taiwan fruit imports and students
intending to study in China, the Beijing government has on the other
hand stepped up diplomatic suppression and saber-rattling against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Even more frustrating and outrageous is that China's 'carrots'
are largely lip service paid for political purposes, while its
'sticks' mostly come without explanation," Wu said.</P>
      <P>For instance, Wu said, Taiwan has not imposed any restrictions on
fruit exports to China. However, he said, Beijing leaders have
engineered a media hype over its "duty-free and fast-track customs
treatment" in recent weeks to sow discord in Taiwan society and even
alienate local farmers from the Democratic Progressive Party
administration.</P>
      <P>At a time when Taiwan's university education system faces heavy
strain, China announced recently that it will offer scholarships to
Taiwan students who wish to study in China and will charge them the
same tuition fees as Chinese students.</P>
      <P>"I'm afraid that China's 'cajoling strategy' could eventually
have a grave impact on Taiwan's university education system, " Wu
said.</P>
      <P>While China is relentlessly propagating its so-called "one China"
principle around the world, Wu said, Beijing's attempt to treat
Taiwan students as their Chinese counterparts is yet another of its
tricks to substantiate its "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>"In the future, China is likely to treat Taiwan businessmen as
their Chinese counterparts. By then, its current investment
incentives could be canceled. Should that be the case, its impact
could be felt in every Taiwan social quarter. This is an issue we
cannot afford to ignore," Wu warned.</P>
      <P>With the year-end elections for city mayors and county
magistrates approaching, Wu said, China has also stepped up its
"united front" tactics by inviting Taiwan's city and county
governments to organize delegations to visit China for negotiations
on agricultural and technological exchanges.</P>
      <P>Warning that such exchanges could lead to Taiwan to lose its
competitive edge, Wu said he hopes local politicians will refrain
from pursuing personal political interests at the expense of Taiwan's
overall national interests.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has scored a major breakthrough in
animal cloning by successfully cloning a special kind of "economic
animal, " Council of Agriculture (COA) Chairman Lee Chin-lung claimed
Friday in an interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>After years of assiduous efforts, Lee said, the COA has succeeded
in using somatic cells to clone the animal that has both economic and
medicinal value.</P>
      <P>Lee claimed that the COA-developed cloning technology is unique
in the world. However, he would not reveal what animal has been
cloned. He only said that President Chen Shui-bian will formally
"decode the riddle" early next month.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the COA has done all the research itself, but
some of the team members traveled to Britain for training.</P>
      <P>"It took seven to eight years to come to this point at a cost of
less than NT$100 million. Thanks to the correctness of our research
direction, we have made tremendous headway," Lee said proudly.</P>
      <P>Since Scottish scientists at the Roslin Institute created the
much-celebrated "Dolly" sheep in 1996, other scientists have also
succeeded in cloning rabbits, pigs, cattle and horses. But the health
and life spans of the cloned animals remain highly uncertain. South
Korea announced its achievements earlier this month in creating the
world's first cloned dog. U.S. scientists have succeeded in having
cloned wild cats give birth naturally.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan is second to none in the field of animal cloning.
The newly cloned animals are neither dogs nor cats, he said; they are
of great economic value.</P>
      <P>"The cloned animals have survived for a certain period of time.
After several generations of reproduction, they still possess
identical genetic material with the original animal," Lee claimed.</P>
      <P>He further said the cloned animals are edible and safe. They are
not genetically modified and have instead been reproduced from
somatic cells, he added.</P>
      <P>The cloned animals can also be used for medical purposes by
implanting anti-lactoferrin into the animals for mass reproduction.</P>

DPP, told the Central News Agency in an interview that the riot by
Thai workers was not the only case of protest and these foreign
workers had been subjected to exploitation and inhuman treatment for
a long time.</P>
      <P>She said the government must do something about the current labor
system which allows influential figures close to the power center to
profit from importing foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the riot shows that KRTC Vice Chairman Chen
Min-hsien and the manpower management company Huapan Co., as well as
the Kaohsiung City Government, were "obviously at fault."</P>
      <P>As to whether acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai's father, Chen
Che-nan, is involved in the scandal, Lin said the evidence will do
the talking.</P>
      <P>"If the evidence implicates Chen Che-nan, Chen Chi-mai should
also be held responsible, " she said, adding, "For those who deserve
to step down, let their heads roll."</P>
      <P>The DPP legislator said that the entire truth about the riot must
be unearthed, but stressed this situation has nothing to do with any
infighting within the DPP.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT WANTS TRICOLOR FOOD SAFETY ALERT SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A tricolor alert system for food safety is
in the works by the Department of Health (DOH) , a DOH official said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Under the DOH's preliminary plan, the system will work with red,
yellow and green lights to indicate what foods are safe to eat, the
DOH's chief of food sanitation, Chen Lu-hung, said at a news
conference.</P>
      <P>Red-lighted foods are unsafe to eat, such as pork from swine that
have died of disease before being slaughtered, what the Chinese call
"black heart" food. Yellow suggests the food in question is possibly
unsafe, while green mean the food is fine, Chen explained.</P>
      <P>The official noted that the planned system will help assure
consumers of the safety of the foods they buy by providing
professional assessment and examination.</P>
      <P>A team made up of consumers, food industry representatives and
government officials will make the ratings, then release the results
within six to eight hours after concerns over a certain food have
been raised.</P>
      <P>Chen said that a complete plan on the establishment of the system
is expected to be ready in three months before being implemented by
the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The DOH will also try to ensure that consumers can always get
correct information on the ingredients and nutritional value of food
products, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DOH has opened a hotline for those wishing to
inform on people providing unsafe foods. The number is 080-062-5748.</P>

    <HEADLINE>90% OF FARMERS DON'T DEEM CHINA AS PRINCIPAL MARKET: COA POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A majority of Taiwan farmers responding to
a recent survey don't consider China as a principal market for their
produce, Council of Agriculture (COA) Chairman Lee Chin-lung said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The COA conducted the telephone survey on randomly chosen adult
farmers Aug. 4-8 to explore their views on agricultural exports
issues after Beijing leaders engineered a media frenzy over its
"duty-free and fast-track customs treatment" for Taiwan fruit imports
in recent weeks to sow discord in Taiwan society, Lee said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,077 valid replies were collected, with a margin of
error of 2.98 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the survey results, 60.1 percent of the respondents
said they are aware that the government has not imposed any
restrictions on fruit exports to China.</P>
      <P>As to China's unilateral offer of duty-free treatment for 15
kinds of Taiwan fruits, 75.4 percent said the listed items are not
what they most want to export.</P>
      <P>Despite China's zero-tariff offer, 89.5 percent said they are not
prepared to deem China as their principal export market, while the
remaining 10.5 percent gave a positive answer.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 38.4 percent most like to sell their
produce in Taiwan; 21.4 percent said Japan is their most favored
export outlet, followed by the United States, Europe and Canada; 4.4
percent said China is their most preferred export market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 63.7 percent said they don't think China's duty-free
offer would help increase their incomes; 20.3 percent said they think
the offer will contribute to their incomes; and 16 percent did not
answer the question.</P>
      <P>The poll further showed that 52.7 percent would not like to see
the government let local farmers freely discuss fruit trade with
China, but 22.4 percent said the government should adopt a laissez
faire attitude toward fruit exports to China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ETHNIC CHINESE STUDENTS TO BENEFIT FROM DONATIONS TO TAIPEI CITY: MA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that
the money donated to tsunami victims in Southeast Asia will largely
go to ethnic Chinese students in Indonesia and the establishment of
classrooms with computers in tsunami affected areas.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in response to criticism by Taipei City
Councilor Lee Wen-ying that the NT$37 million (US$1.15 million)
collected by the Taipei City Government for tsunami relief in several
Southeast Asian countries has not yet been used.</P>
      <P>Lee blasted Ma for not having convened any meeting on the issue,
not having appropriated any money, and not having chosen the
recipients for the donations, adding that Ma owes the citizens an
apology.</P>
      <P>Ma explained that a medical team sent by the Taipei City
Government to Southeast Asian nations suggested that the money be
prudently used since they do not know into whose hands the money will
go.</P>
      <P>The city government focused on two educational projects after
municipal officials meeting a dozen ethnic Chinese students from
Indonesia June 16. The students expressed the wish to be able to
study in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to an estimate, these students could spend NT$10
million to study in Taiwan from junior high school through
university.</P>
      <P>In addition, the city government will establish classrooms with
computers in the tsunami-affected areas with the rest of the limited
money, Ma added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Pasuya
Yao said the same day at a news conference that it appropriated NT$36
million that day to each of the two non-governmental organizations --
World Vision Taiwan (WVT) and the Chinese Fund for Children and
Families/Taiwan (better known as CCF/Taiwan) -- which are among the
organizations responsible for distributing the donated money to
tsunami-affected people.</P>
      <P>Another NT$48 million will be appropriated to the Buddhist
Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation next week, Yao added.</P>
      <P>A campaign initiated by former GIO Minister Lin Chia-lung to
donate money to tsunami victims has collected NT$400 million since
January, with several NGOs in Taiwan promising to each support 3,000
children in tsunami-affected countries.</P>
      <P>However, the GIO has been criticized for the delay in
appropriating the money to the NGOs, with Yao denying that the
government has been inefficient and claiming that the money has to go
through certain appropriation procedures both in government agencies
and the private enterprises that made the donations.</P>
      <P>At the news conference, Yao thanked Lin for his efforts in
collecting money, saying that relief work is ongoing.</P>
      <P>In contrast to GIO officials' endeavors, Yao stressed that the
Taipei City Government has not yet sent receipts to those who donated
money, not to mention making concrete plans, saying that the money
collected by the Taipei City Government is really "just lying there."</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA MINISTER WILLING TO DISCUSS CHINA'S PANDA GIFT WITH TAIPEI MAYOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Minister Lee
Ching-lung said Friday that he is willing to discuss with Taipei
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou about importing a pair of pandas that Beijing may
offer Taiwan as a gift.</P>
      <P>At an exclusive interview with the Central News Agency, Lee said
the introduction of pandas from China to Taiwan is a conservation and
academic issue, and the COA will not attach any political
preconditions to the possible transfer.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government said after then-opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Lien Chan visited China in late April that it would
offer two pandas as gifts to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is a member of the global village, Lee said
the island should abide by international animal conservation
regulations.</P>
      <P>If the Chinese government officially proposes to send its pandas
to Taiwan, the COA will demand from Beijing a panda export permit
issued by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), Lee said.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has never taken care of pandas, the COA has maintained
a prudent attitude toward the issue, and has invited animal and
conservation experts from within and without the country to form an
evaluation team to study which local organization or zoo has the
capability to take good care of the pandas.</P>
      <P>As soon as Beijing applies to export the pandas to Taiwan, the
evaluation team will begin its work, and if necessary, Taiwan
officials could visit China to better understand the current health
of the pandas.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taipei City has been making a great deal of effort to
secure the right to house the pandas, Lee stressed that he would be
very glad to discuss the issue with Ma.</P>
      <P>Officials from a KMT think tank and the Taipei Zoo left for
Sichuan province, China, Friday to attend a symposium on pandas,
triggering a battle between Taipei and Taichung City over which city
is better suited to house the animals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAICHUNG MAYOR FUMING OVER MAC'S CHINA PERMIT DENIAL TO CITY OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) was
slammed Friday for refusing to allow an animal health official from
Taichung City to visit China to attend a seminar about pandas.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, who is trying hard to have his city win
the right to house the pandas that may be given to Taiwan by China,
said he was baffled by the MAC's decision and can't but wonder
whether the MAC would let any Chinese pandas enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hu said he was especially embarrassed because he asked the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , which was invited by China to the
seminar, to allow Taichung's animal health chief, Wu Lung-tai, to
join its delegation, only to see Wu's application for permission to
visit China denied by the MAC.</P>
      <P>Hu said the KMT initially only relayed Beijing's invitation to
the Taipei City Government, which is also vying for the chance to
house the island's first pandas, but offered Taichung a place on its
delegation only after Hu protested.</P>
      <P>The KMT delegation headed for China Friday evening without Wu,
who was informed by the Taiwan Provincial Government early Friday
that his application for permission to visit China, which is
necessary for senior government officials, was rejected by the MAC
because "the theme of the Chinese seminar doesn't fall within his
authority."</P>
      <P>Hu said the reason is unacceptable and that government officials
of Wu's rank had been allowed to visit China before; the only reason
that Wu was forbidden to go along with the KMT delegation is that the
MAC considers China's offer a Trojan horse aimed at making the people
of Taiwan drop their guard against China.</P>
      <P>If that is the case, the mayor claimed, the MAC has
underestimated the political wisdom of Taiwan people because many
Taiwanese have already seen pandas in various Chinese zoos.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Hu said, the seminar Wu was intending to attend has
nothing to do with China's decision to send a pair of pandas to
Taiwan, and the MAC is being overly cautious.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Shen Chih-hui from the opposition People
First Party, who has announced her candidacy to run for mayor of
Taichung, also criticized the MAC for ignoring Taichung people's hope
to have the pandas in their city.</P>
      <P>Noting that Takung in Taichung is well known for its bamboo,
which is the staple food of pandas, Shen claimed Taichung is an ideal
place to accommodate Chinese pandas, and that the MAC's decision runs
counter to the desire of local people.</P>
      <P>China offered a pair of pandas to Taiwan during former KMT
Chairman Lien Chan's visit to the mainland in April, but Taiwan
authorities frowned on Lien's Chinese trip and are reluctant to
accept the offer on the grounds that it could justify the KMT's
outreach to China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE-RUSSIAN MILITARY DRILL TARGETED TAIWAN: VICE DEFENSE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Defense Minister Tsai Ming-hsien said
Friday the just-concluded Chinese-Russian joint military exercise
were apparently targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the eight-day Chinese-Russian military drill included
a naval blockade, an amphibious beach landing and an invasion by
paratroopers on China's east coast, Tsai said all the skills
demonstrated in the maneuvers were options that China could use
against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We should not have an ostrich mindset to play down the
implications of the unprecedented joint exercise. The Ministry of
National Defense (MND) has consistently closely monitored the
exercise, " Tsai said, adding that he hopes local people can heighten
their psychological defense in the face of China's mounting military
threat.</P>
      <P>Tsai further said he is cautiously optimistic about the
possibility of a long-stalled arms procurement package clearing the
legislative floor during the soon-to-opened legislative session.</P>
      <P>In a goodwill response to opposition parties' demands, Tsai said
in an interview with the Central News Agency that the MND will come
up with a revised arms procurement bill next week for Cabinet
endorsement. The bill will then be referred to the Legislative Yuan
for deliberation and approval at its new session scheduled to open in
September.</P>
      <P>At its weekly meeting Wednesday, the Cabinet approved a new
proposal to finance the arms package, divided between a modified
special budget and the regular defense allocation.</P>
      <P>For more than a year, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang and the People First Party has used its slim majority in
the legislature to hold up the special NT$480 billion arms
procurement bill, saying that the purchase would spark an arms race
with rival China that could bankrupt Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Included in the package are eight diesel-electric submarines, a
squadron of 12 anti-submarine aircraft and six Patriot PAC III
anti-missile batteries.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the six Patriot batteries will be funded by the MND's
regular budget, while the remaining two items will be funded by a
special budget.</P>
      <P>Both come from state coffers, but the regular defense budget
carries more rigorous oversight provisions. By so doing, Tsai said,
the MND hopes opposition parties can stop boycotting the package.</P>

people operating in China to safeguard their rights and benefits.</P>
      <P>KMT Deputy Chairman P.K. Chiang was designated to serve as the

    <HEADLINE>FRUIT EXPORTS TO CHINA RISE SLIGHTLY IN AUGUST: AGRICULTURE CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's fruit exports to China increased
only slightly despite China's much-hyped announcement of duty-free
access to 15 kinds of Taiwan fruits beginning this month, Council of
Agriculture Minister Lee Ching-lung said Friday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Central News Agency, Lee said a total of
80 tons of Taiwan fruits were sold to China in the first 20 days of
August, which is only a little more than the average of 86 tons sold
every month, even before China announced the duty-free treatment, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Noting that China's huge population of poor farmers has been a
political burden to Chinese leaders, Lee said it is doubtful that the
mainland could be a lucrative market for Taiwan's fruit.</P>
      <P>Among the 15 kinds of Taiwan fruits to which China has opened its
market, most are not produced in China and have already been imported
from southeast Asian states. Imports of these fruits from Taiwan will
not have a significant impact on Chinese farmers.</P>
      <P>The other fruits are not grown in great quantities in Taiwan and
only a few Taiwan farmers can enjoy the duty-free access for these
fruits, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Citing as an example, Lee said the staple of Taiwan's fruit
exports is bananas, followed by mangoes and lychees, but mangoes were
listed among the 15 kinds of fruit to be brought into China.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, Lee said, Taiwan's farmers should not have
illusions about China's market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's top envoy in
the United States said Friday that Washington will soon announce the
name of the new chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT).</P>
      <P>David Lee, ROC representative to the United States, made the
remarks at a press conference in Washington.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, one of the reasons the U.S. will make a quick

route to visit Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America next
month.</P>
      <P>The AIT chairmanship vacancy has yet to be filled following the

      <P>Raymond Burghardt, who served as AIT Taipei office director from
1999 to 2001 and as U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, is reported to have
been tipped for the post but this has not been confirmed.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Representative to the United

      <P>David Lee made the comments at a press conference while

    <HEADLINE>CHINA PROTESTS ROC ENVOY'S PARTICIPATION IN 'JOURNEY OF AMBASSADORS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>David Lee, the Republic of China
representative to the United States, said Friday he regrets the
Chinese ambassador's protest over his participation in a "journey of
ambassadors" activity organized by Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).</P>
      <P>Grassley, who concurrently serves as chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, has customarily organized a "journey of
ambassadors" every other year for members of the diplomatic corps in
Washington, D.C. to visit his home state.</P>
      <P>The Chinese embassy lodged a protest with Grassley's office upon
learning that Lee was on the guest list. An embassy staff member
claimed that Taiwan's representative was not qualified to take part
because he is not an ambassador.</P>
      <P>In response, Grassley told the Chinese official that both
Taiwan's representative and the Chinese ambassador to the United
States are his friends and are welcome to take part in the activity.</P>
      <P>The Chinese embassy later informed Grassley's office that in
protest over Lee's invitation, Chinese Ambassador to the United
States Zhou Wenzhong would refuse to go on the trip.</P>
      <P>Annoyed by China's puerile fit of pique, Grassley issued a public
statement at the Senate, contemptuously criticizing Zhou's move as
"childish." Grassley further said that if China likes to think of
itself as a rising great power and wants to be an important member of
the international community, it should follow the basic norms and
principles of international engagements.</P>
      <P>Speaking to Chinese-language media journalists stationed in
Washington Friday, Lee said that because of his busy schedule, he
originally planned to just take part in the first three days of the
"journey of ambassadors."</P>
      <P>"Moved by Grassley's moral courage in criticizing the Chinese
ambassador's protest, I changed my mind and decided to take part in
the whole five-day event," Lee said.</P>
      <P>More than 70 foreign ambassadors stationed in the United States
participated in this year's "journey of ambassadors, " the theme of
which was focused on getting a better understanding of U.S. rural
life.</P>
      <P>"Each night we stayed at the ranch of a different farmer. I was
impressed by the high quality of U.S. farmers," Lee said.</P>
      <P>He said that whenever he gave his namecard to his American hosts,
they tended to ask what the "Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office" stands for.</P>
      <P>"Each time, I felt a bit embarrassed, " Lee said, adding that the
experience has made him feel that the campaign to change the names of
Taiwan's overseas representative offices is necessary.</P>
      <P>Since the United States switched diplomatic recognition from
Taipei to Beijing in 1979, the ROC's representative offices can
neither bear its formal national title nor the word "Taiwan." China
is utterly sensitive toward any move or designation implying a
separate Taiwan identity.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu's proposal to
restructure the nation's administrative districts into "four
provinces and two special administrative regions" does not represent
the Executive Yuan's policy or stance, a senior official said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>"The proposal was only Lu's personal opinion. We respect her
personal views about the administrative districts restructuring
issue, but her opinions do not represent the government's policy or
stance," said Vice Interior Minister Chien Tai-lang.</P>
      <P>Addressing a seminar on administrative districts restructuring
and capital relocation earlier in the day, Lu said she felt compelled
to come up with "audacious and forward-looking" ideas regarding the
theme of the meeting.</P>
      <P>"After years of development, many of Taiwan's existing systems
and institutions require a comprehensive review because they have
become outdated and can no longer cope with the changing political,
social and economic situations," Lu said.</P>
      <P>With improved traffic convenience, for instance, Lu said Taiwan's
administrative districts need not be classified into so many levels
-- from province/special municipalities to counties/provincial
municipalities to county municipalities to townships and villages.</P>
      <P>At present, Lu noted, Taiwan boasts a four-level bureaucratic
hierarchy that comprises the central government, the marginalized
provincial government, two special municipalities, 16 counties and
five provincial municipalities plus many county municipalities,
townships and villages.</P>
      <P>"This bloated hierarchy only increases red tape and dampens
government efficiency," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, she went on, should scrap its special municipalities and
provincial municipalities while instituting two special
administrative regions -- the mountainous special administrative
region and the outlying islands special administrative region -- to
accentuate its determination to better protect the environment.</P>
      <P>Specifically, Lu said, the nation should be restructured into
four provinces -- Taipei, Taichung, Tainan and Taitung -- along with
the mountainous and outlying islands special administrative regions.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, she continued, Taipei's role as the nation's capital
should be reconsidered. With a view to promoting balanced development
in northern and southern Taiwan, Lu said the government should weigh
the possibility of relocating the capital or study the feasibility of
having "two capitals" to narrow the gap between regional
developments.</P>
      <P>According to Article 108 of the Constitution, Lu said
administrative district restructuring needs only legislation and does
not require constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Lu's proposals, Chien said it was the first time he
had heard of such far-reaching restructuring ideas.</P>
      <P>Noting that administrative district restructuring is the Ministry
of the Interior's duty, Chien said the ministry respects Lu's
personal opinions.</P>
      <P>"As the issue involves many complicated problems, including
revisions to various self-governance laws and administrative district
demarcation laws, such a move would need extensive discussion. At the
moment, Lu's proposals do not represent the government's policy or
stance, " he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WAR IN IRAQ GRAVELY AFFECTS TAIWAN-FRANCE TIES: OUTGOING ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
(By Y.S. Luo and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The war in Iraq has had a grave direct
impact on relations between Taiwan and France, the outgoing Republic
of China representative to France said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chiou Jong-nan, a career diplomat who will step down from his
current post as the top Taiwan representative to France in the
absence of formal diplomatic ties at the end of this month, told the
CNA that as French President Jacques Chirac differed with the United
States on the war in Iraq, he had to seek the support of other big
powers in the world.</P>
      <P>Back in 2003, Chiou said, China was a ready choice, as its new
president, Hu Jintao, was eager to expand China's external relations.
In order to cajole China, Chiou said, Chirac did not hesitate to make
unfriendly comments on Taiwan, hurting Taiwan-France relations.</P>
      <P>Chiou took over his current post in November 2002. It marked the
second time that he has served as the de facto ROC ambassador to
France. Ten months after he assumed office, he originally arranged
for the French foreign trade minister to visit Taiwan. As Chinese
President Hu was scheduled to visit France in January 2004 to
celebrate the 40th anniversary of the establishment of China-France
diplomatic ties, France later canceled its minister's Taiwan travel
plan.</P>
      <P>Afterwards, Chirac's criticizing Taiwan's decision to hold a
referendum simultaneously with its 2004 presidential election during
his face-to-face talks with Hu drew backlash in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Because of the changing international political situations, Chiou
said relations between Taiwan and France have been in a low ebb in
the past two years. "I feel sorry and uneasy for this trend, " he
said.</P>
      <P>In his 40.5-year diplomatic career, his tenure as the top ROC
envoy to France totaled nine years.</P>
      <P>He said diplomatic work with countries that do not maintain
formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan relies heavily on person-to-person
relations that require long-term cultivation.</P>
      <P>According to Chiou, Chirac's blunt opposition to democratic
Taiwan's referendum program has also drawn harsh criticism in France.
"I hope both Taiwan and France can forget this unpleasant episode as
soon as possible," he added.</P>
      <P>Chiou further said the new director of the French Ministry of
Foreign Affairs's Asia-Pacific department once told him that Taiwan
and France should enhance mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>Noting that China has continued its "strongarm" diplomatic
offensive against Taiwan, Chiou said Taiwan should not let down its
alert and efforts in forging extensive foreign relations.</P>
      <P>"China's diplomatic work is now run by a new generation of
well-trained professional diplomats. We should devote even more
resources and manpower in diplomatic work," he suggested.</P>
      <P>Chiou's successor, Yang Tzu-pao, is scheduled to arrive in Paris
Sept. 5 to assume his new post. Yang has a doctoral degree from a
French engineering university.</P>
      <P>Chiou's first term as the top envoy to France, running from
November 1990 through January 1997, marked a height in Taiwan-France
relations. After the 1989 Tiananmen massacre in Beijing, the
then-French leftist government known for its emphasis on human rights
actively expanded relations with Taiwan. During the period, France
won contracts to build Taipei's Mucha mass rapid transit line, signed
an aviation rights pact with Taiwan for direct air links and sold
Lafayette-class frigates and Mirage jet fighters to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN INSPECTS SHUEISHAN TUNNEL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian made an inspection
tour of the soon-to-be-completed Shueishan Tunnel Saturday to boost
the morale of all those who are working hard for one of the world's
most challenging road construction projects.</P>
      <P>It was Chen's fifth visit to the tunnel construction site. He was
accompanied by Premier Frank Hsieh, Presidential Office
Secretary-General Yu shyi-kun, Minister of Transportation and
Communications Lin Ling-san and other senior officials. "You have
come a long way and now only a small step short of completing this
challenging project. I admire your perseverance and appreciate your
devotion," Chen told engineers and workers at the construction site.</P>
      <P>The 12.9-kilometer tunnel, the centerpiece of the 34-km Peiyi
freeway project, is also known as a "passage beneath troubled waters"
for its engineering difficulties.</P>
      <P>Construction on the Peiyi freeway, the first east-west freeway to
pass through Mount Snow (Shueishan in Chinese) that spans from
Taipei's Nankang district to Toucheng in the northeastern county of
Iland, began in 1991. After repeated cave-in and groundwater
flooding, construction lagged far behind the schedule.</P>
      <P>Stressing that construction didn't get a major breakthrough until
after his Democratic Progressive Party took power in 2000, Chen said
the completion of the Shueishan tunnel accentuates the significance
of the transition of power between different political parties.</P>
      <P>The Shueishan Tunnel is Asia's longest highway tunnel and the
world's fifth longest. By mid-August, the tunnel's civil engineering
work was 98.8 percent complete, its electric engineering work was 69
percent complete and its traffic control engineering was 53.8 percent
complete. Workers are now work at three shifts with an aim to
complete the project as scheduled at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has spent more than NT$90 billion and
10-plus years building the Peiyi freeway, Premier Hsieh said he hopes
the project can be completed smoothly as schedule.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Hsieh said safety remains the government's top
concern. "We'll respect engineering experts' opinions and will open
the new freeway to traffic only after it passes the most stringent
safety tests," Hsieh added.</P>

      <P>Chen Chu, chairwoman of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA), made
the assurance during an inspection tour of the living quarters of
Thai laborers working for the mass rapid transit system in the

quarters of 1,700 Thai laborers in Kangshan, Kaohsiung County, in
which some 100 Thai workers set fire to a dormitory building and a
management office in protest of the harsh restrictions placed on them
and the poor living conditions. The incident attracted the attention
of news media around the world.</P>
      <P>Chen said the incident was an isolated case. She has apologized
for the incident and has assured the Thai government that Taiwan has
traditionally been kind and humane toward foreign laborers and that
the CLA will make every possible efforts to prevent recurrence of
similar incidents.</P>
      <P>Chen told Thai laborers Saturday that the CLA has long formulated
a mechanism encouraging workers, including foreign laborers, to
report any maltreatment by their employers. Informers can receive a
maximum cash reward of NT$100,000.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the CLA will send inspectors to examine the
living and working environments of foreign laborers around the
country.</P>
      <P>Chen was accompanied by acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai and
Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing on the inspection tour.</P>

Homerun beep baseball team Sunday to congratulate them on winning
this year's World Series for the blind in Houston, Texas.</P>
      <P>Hsieh spent Sunday morning watching members of the team training
at a baseball field at the Riverside Park in Taipei County. He was
impressed to see how the visually impaired players could hit a ball
that emits a beeping sound.</P>
      <P>The team beat the Kansas All-Stars 9-8 July 30. They also won the
championship in 2004 in Columbus, Ohio.</P>
      <P>To experience how the game is played, Hsieh tried twice to hit a
ball while blindfolded, but he failed both times.</P>
      <P>The premier expressed his admiration for the team and praised the
player for overcoming their physical obstacles to capture the highest
honor in two consecutive world events. He presented a red envelope
with cash to the team as a token of his appreciation for the players
to carry on with the sport.</P>
      <P>Beep baseball is adapted from standard softball, with all six
players at bat blindfolded. The ball they try to hit gives off an
audible beep and the base gives off a buzzing sound.</P>
      <P>Each team may use two sighted spotters when playing defense and
all players must be blindfolded when batting. The batting side is
allowed three outs. In order to score, a ball must travel 40 feet or
more to be fair; if it flies more than 180 feet in the air, it is a
home run.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) said
Sunday it opposes asking prospective public servants questions
concerning political parties' positions in national examinations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the minor opposition party denied that Chang
Cheng-hsiu, a commissioner of the Examination Yuan, who has made
controversial statements about the exams, has been trying to promote
TSU ideology in national exams.</P>
      <P>Newspaper reports said people attending a national exam for
lawyers are required to answer questions surrounding President Chen
Shui-bian's address at the TSU anniversary on Aug. 6. They are also
asked to write an article on the topic of "Lawyers' personalities and
national leadership." President Chen is a former lawyer.</P>
      <P>Cheng Chen-lung, TSU secretary-general, said prospective public
employees should be tested on "subjects that they must know, " and
whether a speech by the president should be included in these exams
ought to be judged from this perspective.</P>
      <P>For its part, the TSU opposes any subject that may be suspected
of "containing political considerations," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>One of the questions on the lawyers' exam asked on what occasion
was the president making the address, and the correct answer
apparently was "at a TSU function, " triggering criticism that Chang
was trying to use the national test to promote the green camp's
ideology.</P>
      <P>To this, Cheng responded by saying that Chang is no longer a TSU
member and that he was not responsible for writing the test
questions. He was just the chief commissioner for organizing the
exam, and so the controversy "has nothing to do with the TSU."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 10,000 people turned out at a rally
held in Taichung City, central Taiwan, Sunday to support those
wishing to renounce their membership in the Communist Party of China
(CPC).</P>
      <P>Ever since the Epoch Times publishing on its Web site a
denunciation of the CPC in what it called the "Nine Commentaries, "
Chinese people have increasingly been giving up their membership in
the party, with the number of withdrawals expecting to top four
million soon, said Chen Chang-hui, a spokesman for the Global
Alliance to Say Goodbye to the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) , the
sponsor of Sunday's activity.</P>
      <P>The alliance is a private Washington, D.C.-based organization
established by 91 smaller Chinese groups across America in December
2004.</P>
      <P>Waving banners and shouting slogans, the marchers, who came from
around the island, encouraged more people to help more people give up
their CPC membership and accelerate China's democratization.</P>
      <P>Among the supporters were former Government Information Office
Minister Lin Chia-lung and Huang Kun-hu, chairman of the
pro-independence Friends of Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Lin and Huang said that the nature of Chinese Communism is no
longer applicable in today's world and it is detrimental to human
rights protection, adding that it is meaningful for Chinese people to
denounce Chinese Communism by turning their back on the party.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Rongli, a Chinese dissident and promoter of
Chinese democracy who also appeared at the rally, openly announced
that he quit the Chinese Communist Youth League (CCYL) as a member,
starting from Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen Rongli said that the Chinese Communists have continued to
jeopardize human rights and hinder the progress of democratization in
China, which are not conducive to China's development.</P>
      <P>He stressed that he not only quit the CCYL, a spin-off of the
CPC, as a gesture to oppose the Chinese Communists himself, but he
will also continue to encourage other CCYL members to withdraw from
the party.</P>

      <P>In addition, compensation in civil disputes will be changed from
the current "limited maximum amount" to "compensation amount, "

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to replace Japan in 2006
as the world's largest supplier of laptop computer battery packs,
with the island's manufacturers of the lithium batteries gaining an
increasing share of the world market, market analysts said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has 11 technology companies that produce battery packs for
laptop computers. Together they hold about 40 percent of the world
market, second to Japan's 60 percent.</P>
      <P>The analysts said that with the Taiwanese manufacturers' orders
steadily on the increase, they expect Taiwan's share of the world
market to exceed 50 percent in 2006, replacing Japan as the world's
largest supplier of laptop PC battery packs.</P>
      <P>Of the 11 companies that produce battery packs for laptop
computers, Simplo Technology Co. is the leader with more than 20
percent of the world market. The company expects to receive orders
for 15 million battery packs next year, increasing its world market
share to 25 percent and replacing Japan's Sanyo Corp. as the No. 1
supplier.</P>
      <P>Other leading manufacturers of the battery packs in Taiwan
include Dynapack International Technology Corp., Gallowire Enterprise
Co. and Celxpert Energy Corp.</P>
      <P>The analysts noted that both Simplo and Dynapack are expanding
their facilities to increase production capacities to cope with
increasing demand.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMPANIES FACE FINE FOR POLLUTING IF NO CLEAN-UP AFTER CHEMICAL FIRE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Companies that don't clean up the water
used to put out a chemical fire will soon face stiff fines with the
introduction of amendments to anti-pollution regulations, an
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wang Yue-bin, an EPA official, said the new rule will affect all
petrochemical and mining companies; those who do not install the
pollution-preventing facilities could be fined between NT$60,000
(US$1,860) and NT$600,000 (US$18,600) and, when necessary, have their
permits to dispose of waste water revoked. In a worst case scenario,
the company could even be ordered to close.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendments were prompted by a recent incident in
which a Taichung petrochemical company was accused of polluting a
nearby river after firefighters extinguished a fire that burned
sodium nitrite and other chemicals.</P>
      <P>As the company did not address the issue of the polluted water in
time, the water used by firefighters flowed into the Nanbian River,
turning it yellow. However, the government was unable to prosecute
the company since the chemicals were not toxic.</P>
      <P>To avoid a similar embarrassing situation in the future, the EPA
is changing the regulations so that companies must install
intercepting, collecting and temporary storage facilities for water
used in putting out a fire that burns not only toxic chemicals but
also non-toxic ones.</P>
      <P>Within one hour after an incident that may affect water safety,
companies must inform all potential victims of the situation to
minimize the damage, according to the amended rule.</P>
      <P>The new measures also aim to improve the protection of water
resources for water companies, households, irrigation and
aquaculture.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CENTRAL TAIWAN KEY BATTLEFIELD IN  DECEMBER ELECTIONS FOR DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With fewer than 100 days remaining until
the December "three-in-one" elections, the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) has its eye on wresting control of some key
areas in central Taiwan that are traditionally bastions for
opposition "pan-blue alliance" supporters.</P>
      <P>According to an internal assessment by the DPP, the party's
chances in central cities and counties will be vital to expanding its
power base, and the December elections for city and county chiefs and
councilors as well as town and village heads will be a litmus test
for the political climate in the run-up to the next presidential
election in 2008.</P>
      <P>To that end, the DPP has fielded various appointed government
officials affiliated with the party and with nationwide fame to run
for city mayors and county magistrates in the central region in the
hope of securing larger numbers of votes in the upcoming elections.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang has started an islandwide campaign
tour to drum up support for party candidates, including the hopeful
for mayor of Taichung, Lin Chia-lung, a former director-general of
the Government Information Office, and the aspirant for Taichung
magistrate, Chiu Tai-san, a former vice chairman of the Mainland
Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>The DPP is dead set on regaining power in Taichung city and
county -- a prosperous business and industrial center in central
Taiwan. Taichung is Taiwan's third-largest city after Taipei and
Kaohsiung, while Taichung County is home to many factories and small
businesses.</P>
      <P>Except for Taipei and Kaohsiung cities -- Taiwan's two special
municipalities -- the DPP currently is in power in nine counties and
two cities out of a total of 23 around the country; namely, the
counties of Taipei, Ilan, Nantou, Yunlin, Changhua, Chiayi, Tainan,
Kaohsiung and Pingtung; and in the cities of Chiayi and Tainan.</P>
      <P>As the DPP traditionally enjoys strong public support in southern
Taiwan, the central region thus will be the key battlefield for the
ruling party to expand its power at the local level toward northern
Taiwan, observers said.</P>
      <P>Although Su has begun mobilizing the party machine to campaign
for DPP candidates, observers said that it is still too early to say
that the party is sure to win the elections due to a "Ma frenzy."</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who recently became chairman of the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , is exceptionally popular in the
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT, the People First Party and the New
Party, and among unaffiliated voters.</P>
      <P>As Ma has yet to come up with a strategy to deal with the
December elections, it remains unclear to what extend the popular new
KMT chairman will exercise his influence over voters, observers said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the year-end "three-in-one" elections are set to be
a showdown between the KMT and the DPP and between Ma and Su, both of
whom could be rivals in the 2008 presidential race amid increasingly
bipartisan politics in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, THAILAND LABOR AFFAIRS COOPERATION TO CONTINUE: COUNTY CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and Thailand will continue to
facilitate labor affairs cooperation between the two countries
despite the recent riot by Thai workers in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Yang made the remarks after meeting with Pimpa Chanprasong,
chairwoman of the Thai Congressional Labor Affairs Committee, who is
currently leading a 20-member Thai group in Taiwan mainly to gain
further understanding of the recent labor disputes involving Thai
workers.</P>
      <P>Yang accompanied by Kaohsiung County Government officials met
with Pimpa and her group Sunday to discuss the impact of
the recent riot, in which some 100 Thai workers set fire to a KRTC
dormitory building and a management office in protest of what they
claimed were harsh restrictions placed on them and the poor living
conditions there.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the discussion, Yang apologized to Thailand and the
Thai workers over the recent riot. Describing the incident as an
"isolated case, " Yang said that Taiwan appreciates the Thai
nationals for their help in Taiwan's infrastructure development.</P>
      <P>Yang promised that he will see to it that Taiwan adopts higher
standards in examining labor management to help protect the Thai
laborers' rights and interests.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung County chief also told Pimpa that Taiwan needs the
assistance from the Thai government to find who was behind the Aug.
21 riot and those who are found to be innocent will be spared
punishment.</P>
      <P>For her part, Pimpa also apologized and said she regretted the
Aug. 21 incident, saying that the crux of the problem, which she
found out after arriving in Taiwan, was the labor broker and
management.</P>
      <P>Pimpa, who is representing the Thai government on her current
trip to Taiwan, said that she will have relevant brokerage companies
disciplined after she returns to Thailand.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Pimpa and her group also visited the Kaohsiung
County Police Department, where she demanded that there should be
Thai representatives present at the police station or at the Thai
workers living quarters when Taiwan policemen are investigating the
case so as to protect the Thai nationals' human rights.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Police Department Commissioner Yuan Hsing-i
responded to Pimpa by saying that the case will be handled
impartially without any abuse of rights.</P>
      <P>Yuan stressed that the Kaohsiung police need the help of the Thai
authorities so that the case can be solved as quickly as possible.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA FORUMS TO BE HELD BY OPPOSITION PARTIES LATER THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following visits to China by the Chairman
of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP)
earlier this year, the two parties are planning to separately sponsor
economic and trade forums in China.</P>
      <P>PFP Secretary-General Ching Chin-sheng, who visited Beijing Aug.
22 along with PFP policy center chief Chang Hsien-yao to work out the
details for a forum to be jointly organized by the PFP and the
Communist Party of China (CPC) , said in Taipei Sunday that the
planned forum will open in Shanghai and be attended by PFP Chairman
James Soong in the middle of September.</P>
      <P>Although Ching has not revealed the date of the forum, the Hong
Kong-based Ta Kung Pao newspaper quoted Chang Hsien-yao as saying the
previous day that the forum will be held from Sept. 14 to 16.</P>
      <P>According to Ching, four topics will be discussed at the forum,
including the role of Taiwan businessmen in the economic development
of Taiwan and China, problems surrounding direct transportation
between Taiwan and the mainland, issues brought about by bilateral
agricultural exchanges, and the normalization of bilateral trade.</P>
      <P>Ching said the forum will provide a chance for bilateral leaders
to exchange views on trade and economy in the absence of official
contacts, and more than 60 Chinese academics and 30 to 40 Taiwanese
academics will take part.</P>
      <P>During the forum, the PFP will push for the establishment of
arbitration of commercial disputes between Taiwan and China, Ching
went on.</P>
      <P>Ching said the forum is part of the PFP's efforts to formalize
the consensus reached between PFP Chairman James Soong and CPC
Chairman Hu Jintao during their meeting in Beijing on May 12 and
could be developed into a regular event held every three months.</P>
      <P>The KMT is also working on a forum with the CPC, but no date has
been fixed, nor have topics been selected or who might attend.</P>
      <P>A KMT official said it would be easier to hold the forum in China
because Beijing is willing to host the event; however, it would have
more political impact if it takes place in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The official said the forum will be organized no later than the
end of this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'PAN-BLUE' COOPERATION CENTRAL TO DECEMBER ELECTION VICTORIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chances for "pan-blue alliance" cooperation
in the December "three-in-one" elections are looking better after
ranking officials of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the
People First Party (PFP) met last week to hammer out how to fully
work together.</P>
      <P>The PFP has called for joint electioneering and coalition rule at
the local government level, after KMT Secretary-General Chan Chuan-po
paid a visit to PFP and had a talks with PFP Deputy
Secretary-General Liao Tsang-song, early last week to
relay KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's hope for close inter-party
cooperation in the elections -- the city mayors and county
magistrates elections and those for city and county councilors and
for township and village heads.</P>
      <P>The Chan-Liao meeting marked the first step toward the
mobilization of a set of comprehensive negotiations between the two
parties in light of supporters' high expectations, observers said.</P>
      <P>Joint campaigning to win the elections and create substantial
power-sharing following the elections at the local government level
will help lay a solid foundation for full KMT-PFP cooperation in the
future, PFP aides said, adding that the two parties must deal with
a set mechanism to put forward just one common candidate in
each constituency.</P>
      <P>The two parties hope to forge a "comprehensive cooperation" plan
for across Taiwan, rather than focusing on just various areas, PFP
Organizational Affairs Department Director Huang Pan-kung said during
the Chan-Liao meeting.</P>
      <P>Despite initial bilateral efforts, Ma still faces a host of
difficulties in consolidating the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT, the
PFP and the New Party ahead of the elections, analysts said.</P>
      <P>Although Ma has repeatedly called for fielding joint KMT-PFP
candidates to secure wins in the elections, the PFP has nominated its
own hopefuls in 10 constituencies -- a situation that Ma has to
carefully deal with in conjunction with PFP Chairman James Soong.</P>
      <P>For the time being, the KMT has set its key tone for the election
-- safeguarding power in central Taichung city and county, regaining
power in Taipei county and seizing victories in two or three southern
cities or counties.</P>
      <P>The KMT is particularly keen to win back power in northern Taipei
county, which is Taiwan's largest constituency with a population of
3.5 million, KMT aides said, adding that winning or losing in Taipei
County will have a direct impact on the "pan-blue" chances in the
2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>"If the KMT can win in Taipei county this time after DPP's
16-years rule, it can be viewed as a victory for the
party as a whole," KMT aides said, pointing out that Ma, who assumed
the KMT chairmanship in the middle of this month, cannot afford to
suffer a defeat in the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the results of several public opinion polls showed
that the KMT is gaining greater public backing after former KMT
Chairman Lien Chan visited China in spring this year.</P>
      <P>Some political analysts attributed the KMT's rising popularity to
a shift of supporters away from the PFP to the KMT amid anxiety over
the "pan-blue" desire for a merger among the three parties to battle
against the "green camp" of the DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>Despite the KMT's surge in public support, the 50 percent voter
base enjoyed by the two camps remains little affected in Taiwan's
polarized political spectrum, they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MEDICAL SOCIETY ENCOURAGES WOMEN TO DONATE EGGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As donated eggs fall far short of actual
needs in Taiwan, the Taiwanese Society for Reproductive Medicine
(TSRM) is calling on married couples to think about the concepts of
"sharing eggs" and "exchanging eggs for sperms."</P>
      <P>"Sharing eggs, " TSRM President Liu Chih-hung said, means that a
woman receiving in vitro treatment, who usually could produce eight
to 10 eggs in order to increase her chance of getting pregnant, could
donate the extra eggs to other women who need them.</P>
      <P>As to "exchanging eggs for sperms, " he said TSRM encourages
infertile couples to donate good sperms or eggs for other couples
seeking to become fertile. For instance, he noted, if a couple is
infertile because the husband's sperms are not good enough, the wife,
who is receiving donated sperms to become fertile, can donate her
eggs to other infertile couples.</P>
      <P>Both "egg sharing" and "exchanging eggs for sperms" programs
should be carried out in accordance with the National Health
Administration's principle of "not assigning a certain receiver," Liu
said.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that every year, some 7,000 people in Taiwan are
seeking medical assistance for infertility problem, of whom around
1,000 cannot produce healthy eggs. But only three percent of eggs for
this group are donated, disappointing many other couples seeking to
raise a family.</P>
      <P>Besides "egg sharing" and "exchanging eggs for sperms, " the TSRM
also encourages young women, particularly those aged between 20 and
35, to donate eggs to help infertile couples realize their dreams of
having their own children.</P>
      <P>The TSRM is drafting "standard contracts" for the three programs
of promoting egg donation, which it says will be completed within
a year. The society is planning to reward an egg donor with
NT$50,000-100,000 in "nutrition" subsidy.</P>
      <P>Unlike the NHA, whose draft law on artificial insemination limits
a woman's donation of eggs to only once in a lifetime, the TSRM is
recommending six times throughout a women's life.</P>
      <P>The TSRM bases its suggestion on a Dutch study which shows that a
woman who has donated eggs ten times through her reproductive years
will see a chance of less than one millionth that her offspring will
marry each other.</P>

affect Taiwan in the next few days if it continues gaining strength
and moving in the same direction, they said.</P>
      <P>There is also a chance that the typhoon will lose strength over
the following two days if a high pressure system in the Pacific Ocean
weakens. If this is the case, the meteorologists forecast, the
typhoon will shift to a more northward direction, thus sparing Taiwan
from being directly affected.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the weather bureau forecast that hot summer weather
will continue around the island over the next couple of days, while
eastern Taiwan could see sporadic rains beginning Tuesday as the
outer rim of Typhoon Talim moves closer to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT PEACE FORUM TO BE HELD IN CHINA BEFORE YEAR'S END: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A forum on cross-strait peace, being
organized by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , will be held in China
sometime later this year, Chang Jung-kung, deputy executive director
of the KMT Central Policy Committee, announced Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the announcement one day after a local newspaper
reported that former KMT Chairman Lien Chan, who passed the KMT baton
to Ma Ying-jeou 10 days ago, is planning to set up a foundation to
promote peace between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The report said that Lien has decided to devote his time after
stepping down as KMT chairman to improving Taiwan's ties with China
-- part of his agreement reached with Chinese Communist Party chief
Hu Jintao during their historic meeting in Beijing April 29.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, his office has submitted applications to
relevant government agencies for approval for the establishment of
the Cross-Taiwan Strait Peace Foundation, a brainchild of Lien
envisaged to work as a KMT think-tank.</P>
      <P>There is only one "platform" on which the KMT and the Communist
Party of China can communicate, but that platform needs the support
of several "columns" to make it solid and firm, Chan said, adding
that the Cross-Taiwan Strait Peace Foundation is expected to serve as
one of these supporting columns.</P>
      <P>Chang also disclosed that the NT$300 million (US$9.3 million)
needed for the establishment of the foundation has already been
raised without any problems. He categorically denied news reports
that Lien would ask for a loan of the same amount, in his capacity as
an honorary KMT chairman, from the KMT headquarters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang added, the KMT-initiated cross-strait economic
and trade forum originally planned for August or September of this
year to help accelerate commercial exchanges across the Taiwan Strait
has been postponed due to the absence of consensus on several issues.</P>
      <P>He said that the cross-strait economic and trade forum will be
held as soon as the KMT reaches consensus with the Chinese
authorities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP REMINDS KMT, PFP NOT TO HURT TAIWAN IN CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged the two main opposition
"pan-blue alliance" parties Monday to exercise prudence in their
engagements with China in order not to hurt Taiwan's national
interests.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative whip William Lai made the appeal against the
backdrop of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party
(PFP) rushing to engage in personnel exchanges with the Communist
Party of China (CPC) and joining forces with it to hold various
cross-strait forums.</P>
      <P>Noting that cross-strait exchanges should move "in a goodwill
direction, " Lai said the KMT and the PFP should avoid jeopardizing
Taiwan's survival and sustainable development in their engagements
with the CPC.</P>
      <P>Lai said he frets that the two opposition parties may use their
slim majority in the Legislative Yuan to pressure the government to
accept all the consensuses or conclusions reached at those forums.</P>
      <P>Just last week, Lai said, party executives of the KMT's Taichung
chapter reached a consensus with the CPC's grass-roots units on
promoting cross-strait agricultural exchanges during their China
visit.</P>
      <P>"I'm afraid that Taiwan's advanced agricultural technology and
fine-quality plant seedlings may flow into China through such
exchanges. Should that be the case, the competitive edge of our
farmers and agriculture could be at stake," he said.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, China has stepped up its "united front tactics"
toward Taiwan. He said China has invited a large number of Taiwan's
university students, among others, during this summer vacation to
visit the mainland in the name of academic exchanges.</P>
      <P>In his view, Lai said, Beijing is taking an increasingly hard
line against Taiwan while concealing its intentions from the public.</P>
      <P>"And these strong arm tactics are posing an increasingly grave
challenge to Taiwan," he added.</P>
      <P>Lai further pointed out that China is now using different
strategies at different times. While the "soft strategies" it has
adopted are much softer than before, Lai said, the "hard strategies"
it has adopted are much harder. Worse still, Lai said, the Beijing
government tends to pay lip services to Taiwan opposition figures but
then delay putting them into effect.</P>

      <P>A senior Chinese official in charge of

Kuomintang (KMT) has invited him to participate in a forum to discuss
issues related to the proposed "three links" between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>J.C. Chen, director of the Research Bureau of Taiwan Affairs
Office under the State Council of China, made the confirmation 
while attending a seminar held in Macau on the prospects 
concerning cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The KMT is currently planning to hold a forum in Taipei to allow
ranking officials from the KMT and the Communist Party of China to
discuss issues related to the proposed "three links" -- which refers
to direct shipping, transportation and postal links between the two
sides of the Taiwan strait.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he has received an invitation from the KMT and has
made contact with KMT officials to arrange matters, adding however
that further consultations are needed to work out the details of his
participation in the forum.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that the CPC, KMT and government of
Taiwan can work together to push for the holding of the forum.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, People First Party (PFP) Legislator Ku Chung-lien, who
also attended the seminar, confirmed that PFP Chairman James Soong

      <P>According to the legislator, the forum, which is jointly being

      <P>During the event, four main topics, including the impact of

      <P>The quasi-official Straits Exchange

businessmen operating in China Tuesday, with Premier Frank Hsieh and
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu taking part in the
inaugural ceremony.</P>
      <P>The event will be the second of its kind within a week after the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) inaugurated a similar center last
Friday, spurning speculation that the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and the KMT, driven by fierce political wrangling, are in
high gear to lure support from the many Taiwan businesspeople
operating in China.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Michael You, who concurrently serves as SEF
vice chairman and secretary-general, said that such speculation is
totally unnecessary as the government is fully open to any group
willing to offer service and assistance to China-based Taiwan
businesspeople amid frequent and close cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>However, You stressed that the SEF, the only organization
authorized by the government to deal with cross-strait affairs, is
irreplaceable in this regard thanks to its longstanding
creditability.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY MAKES UP FOR DEMOCRATIC SHORTFALLS: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Monday that
deliberative democracy, which enables people to participate in
policy-making, can make up for the shortfalls of representative
democracy.</P>
      <P>Deliberative democracy refers to any system of political
decisions based on some trade-off of consensus decision-making and
representative democracy. In contrast to the traditional theory of
democracy, which emphasizes voting as its linchpin, deliberative
democracy says that legitimate lawmaking can only come after the
public deliberates on the issues.</P>
      <P>The nation's top leader in the representative institute,
President Wang Jin-pyng of the Legislative Yuan, agreed that through
such channels as citizens' forums, people can express their opinions
about local and national affairs, indicating that Taiwan's democracy
is continually maturing.</P>
      <P>The two national leaders made the remarks at an international
seminar on deliberative democracy that attracted professional NGO
(non-governmental organizations) delegates, scholars and officials
from 20-odd countries including Belgium, Denmark, Japan, South Korea,
Switzerland and the United States.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that in addition to the legislature and local
councils, deliberative democracy and citizens' forums are another
channel for people to participate in the government's decision-making
process.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, the government has held a citizens' forum
on tax reform, a national youth conference and a public forum on
whether Kaohsiung City should set up a cable car system. He noted
that citizens' participation is both a right and an obligation.</P>
      <P>Wang said Taiwan people are having more and more chances to
express themselves, and ethnic groups have engaged in rational and
peaceful dialogues and built mutual trust through NGO forums and
academic platforms.</P>
      <P>As the nation's legislative speaker, Wang said he was delighted
to hear "true and quality voices from the grassroots" that have been
made through deliberative democracy.</P>
      <P>His and Hsieh's remarks pointed to the shortfalls of Taiwan's
"official democracy" and the need to supplement it with deliberative
democracy.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, chairman of Taiwan Thinktank, which co-sponsored
the event, blamed the problems of Taiwan's democracy on
"constitutional defects" and the lack of a democratic culture, as
shown in many people not thinking over a lot of topics and forming
their views based on political and ideological preferences.</P>
      <P>He expected more public views will be incorporated in the
nation's decision-making process to improve the quality of its
democracy.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) has been making spot-checks on factories in Taipei and Tainan
counties since July in a comprehensive crackdown on illegal waste
dumping.</P>
      <P>The EPA is also enlisting the help of experts and scholars in
environmental protection for the inspections, and they are also
offering suggestions to the companies and consulting with them on how
to meet EPA requirements.</P>
      <P>EPA officials said that illegal waste dumping has become far too
prevalent in Taiwan. Among recent major incidents, the illegal
dumping of solvents into the Kaoping River, which affected drinking
water in the greater Kaohsiung area in 2000, was a low point.</P>
      <P>The officials said that although most of the waste dumping is due
to wanton violation of the law, some producers of factory waste do
not properly manage their affairs and their waste is often turned
over to rogue waste disposal companies.</P>
      <P>The EPA crackdown will continue until the end of September. About
100 factories and recycling plants have so far been visited to
measure the efficiency of their production processes, waste
management, disposal facilities maintenance, waste reduction efforts
and recycling.</P>
      <P>The EPA has another 100 factories on its list for inspections.</P>

PHY906 -- and at securing clinical data proving that it is effective
in the treatment of cancer of the rectum and large intestines, said
Lai Chi-ming, a section chief with the National Health Research
Institute (NHRI) under the DOH.</P>
      <P>The clinical study on PHY906 -- proved in animal tests to be
effective in the reduction of chemotherapy side effects and delaying
the growth of cancer cells -- is being jointly sponsored by the NHRI,
the DOH Committee on Chinese Medicine and Pharmacy and PhytoCeutica,
Inc., a U.S.-based bioscience company established by Cheng Yung-chi,
a Yale professor who is also an academician with Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>PHY906's anti-cancer efficacy is particularly strong when it is
used together with five certain chemotherapy applications, Lai said.</P>
      <P>Fifty rectum and large intestines cancer patients will receive
the first and second-phase clinical tests of PHY906 to be conducted
at Taipei Veterans General Hospital shortly, according to Lai.</P>
      <P>The PHY906 clinical research program is meaningful because in the
West, there has been a lack of systematic research on the efficacy of
traditional Chinese anti-cancer medicines, while in the traditional
Chinese medical circles, there has been a lack of clinical testing
with scientific data proving that certain formulas can cure certain
kinds of cancer, said officials from the DOH Committee on Chinese
Medicine and Pharmacy.</P>
      <P>Cheng, also the faculty founder of the U.S.-based biomedical
company Achillion, which is developing a drug to treat the AIDS virus
and hepatitis B, established the Consortium for Globalization of
Chinese Medicine -- an organization that now groups 50 international
research organizations.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Government
Information Office (GIO) Minister Pasuya Yao is currently on a visit
here to study the country's film and TV industry and promote
bilateral exchanges in the sector.</P>
      <P>Yao called on the state-run Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC)
Monday, and chatted with MBC Vice President Shim Jong-in on the MBC's
strategies of producing one of its most popular TV drama series, "Dae
Jang Geum" or "Jewel in the Palace, " which has been very popular
in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan.</P>
      <P>Yao invited Shim, as well as Lee Yeong-ae, the actress who played
the leading role in "Dae Jang Geum, " to visit Taiwan in November for
an unprecedented "three-in-one" award presentation ceremony for
Taiwan's top film award -- the Golden Horse Awards, the Golden
Bell Awards -- Taiwan's highest honor for TV and radio broadcasting
programs and professionals -- and the Taipei TV Festival.</P>
      <P>Sunday, the GIO chief attended a Taiwan film festival in Seoul

plans to allocate NT$20 billion (US$616.4 million) to the development
of the so-called cultural innovation and digital content industries
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yao said that efforts will be made to learn from South Korea and
France to help with Taiwan's movie industry development. The efforts
include subsidizing South Korean film producers who shoot their films

organize movie festivals dedicated to film makers from the two
countries as part of efforts to boost bilateral cultural and industry

Wall Street Journal: Why Oil's Surge Hasn't Damped Global Growth,
Prices, Interest Rates Stay Low, While Property Boom

The near-doubling of oil prices -- to US$70 in the past 24 months
-- has had surprisingly little impact on the pace of global growth,
as other broad economic factors have helped damp the damage inflicted
by previous oil-price shocks. The global real-estate boom and a flood
of cheap goods from Asia have enabled consumers, particularly in the
U.S., to continue spending despite higher energy prices. In contrast
with past episodes, this surge in oil prices stems more from global
economic vigor -- the strong demand for oil from China and the U.S.
-- rather than producers' manipulative tightening of supply or fears
about Middle East conflicts disrupting supply.</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two major opposition parties Monday
severely criticized the "sycophantic culture" within the government
bureaucracy after learning that NT$1.5 million had been spent to
build a bridge just to facilitate President Chen Shui-bian's
inspection of the construction project of a tunnel on the Taipei-Ilan
Freeway.</P>
      <P>Chen, accompanied by Premier Frank Hsieh, inspected the tunnel
project Aug. 27. To avoid his motorcade making a detour, the National
Highway Bureau of the RSEA Engineering Corp. built a steel-supported
bridge, which the opposition claims will soon be torn down at a cost
of NT$15 million.</P>
      <P>Sun Ta-chien, deputy convener of the legislative caucus of the
People First Party (PFP), urged the transportation and communications
committee of the Legislative Yuan to make an in-depth investigation
into the issue.</P>
      <P>He said that if it is proven true that the bridge was built
specifically to facilitate the president's inspection, then the
Presidential Office should pay for the cost of the bridge and the
expense of tearing it down. In addition, the PFP legislative caucus
would propose a drastic reduction of the budget of the Department of
Transportation of Communications (DTC) next year.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chou Hsi-wei, a candidate of the Kuomintang running
for Taipei County magistrate in the year-end election, criticized the
"sycophantic culture" within the government bureaucracy and blamed
DTC officials for wasting taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>Legislator David Huang, deputy convener of the legislative caucus
of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, said if it is true that the bridge
had been built just for the president's inspection, the bureaucratic
system will have to be reformed thoroughly to get rid of the
"sycophantic culture."</P>
      <P>The dispute over the bridge's construction flared Sunday when TV
media, tipped by angry local residents, found the bridge was closed
to traffic after the president's inspection.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT WARNS ROTARIANS OF CHINA'S STRONGARM TACTICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian warned Monday that
China would definitely intensify its suppression against Taiwan in
Rotary International when its clout in the non-government world
organization increases.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with participants in the 2005
Asia-Pacific Regional Rotaract Conference being held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Even though China has more than 700 missiles targeting Taiwan,
Chen said the 23 million Taiwan people will never be daunted.</P>
      <P>"We'll never be demoralized by the 700-plus missiles that China
has aimed at Taiwan. We'll remain unflinching. We'll never forsake
our sacred mission of protecting our homeland," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that China is taking an increasingly hard line against
Taiwan, Chen said China has spared no efforts to squeeze Taiwan's
international presence.</P>
      <P>Rotary International is expanding its ranks in China and has set
up provisional Rotary clubs in Shanghai and Beijing. Chen said that
when Rotary clubs spring up in large numbers in China, Beijing's
leaders will definitely begin to use their new-gained clout to
suppress Taiwan in the Rotary International organization.</P>
      <P>China still imposes restrictions on the establishment of Rotary
clubs, but with its economic policy being increasingly liberalized,
Chen said, the number of Rotary clubs is expected to mushroom in the
years ahead to meet the demand of commercial social functions.</P>
      <P>Given China's consistent strategy of using its ever-growing
economic clout to denigrate Taiwan's international status, Chen said,
Taiwan must be prepared for China's strongarm tactics against
its participation in Rotary International activities.</P>
      <P>"We should stay alert and begin charting response strategies as
soon as possible," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Because of China's diplomatic embargo of Taiwan, Chen said the
annual conference of Rotaract, a Rotary International division with
clubs around the world for people aged 18-30, is one of the few
international occasions on which the Republic of China's national
flag can fly.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his admiration and appreciation for Taiwan
Rotaract members for winning the right to host the 2005 Asia-Pacific
Regional Rotaract Conference. More than 600 Rotaractors and Rotarians
attended the Aug. 26-29 conference.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu called on the
nation's media Monday to help cultivate love and faith and report
more about the bright side of life so that every member of society
will manage to survive all difficulties in life.</P>
      <P>Lu made the comments during a seminar on the media's coverage of
suicides, to which media executives were invited to sign a
self-disciplinary declaration.</P>
      <P>Lu said life is extremely precious, and those choosing to end
their own lives are not only making a grave mistake but also acting
out a tragedy.</P>
      <P>If the media plays up suicide stories, sanctifies them or treats
them as gossip, they are not doing a job that would please a majority
of the people, she added.</P>
      <P>She warned that committing suicide has in recent years become
almost fashionable in Taiwan, posing a great social and psychological
challenge to society.</P>
      <P>"Making our world beautiful and harmonious is our common wish, "
she said, adding that those killing themselves are making a mistake,
but the media would be adding even more mistakes by playing up such
tragedies.</P>
      <P>Lu urged the media to inspire love, faith and goodwill and report
more about the bright side of human nature so that each and every one
in society will live on in spite of any difficulty.</P>
      <P>Media leaders were asked to endorse an eight-point declaration
advising them not to make suicides a lead story, not to use excessive
space to report on suicides, not to detail how a person commits
suicide, and not to carry sensational photos or the wills of the
victims.</P>
      <P>The media was also advised against beautifying or glorifying
suicides, giving simplified explanations about the reasons for such
acts, or exploring such incidents from the perspective of
superstition.</P>
      <P>The electronic media, meanwhile, were advised not to broadcast
suicide stories live.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP ANNOUNCES FORMATION OF TASK FORCE ON FOREIGN WORKERS' HUMAN RIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prompted by a recent riot by Thai workers,
Vice President Annette Lu announced Monday that a task force has been
created to look into the situation surrounding the human rights of
foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>Lu, the chairman of a human rights advisory committee under the
Presidential Office, made the announcement when she met with Pimpa
Chanprasong, chairwoman of the Thai Congressional Labor Affairs
Committee.</P>
      <P>Lu apologized for the inhumane treatment suffered by Thai
laborers working for the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC), who
were protesting harsh management and poor living conditions. She said
hopefully that the "single incident" will not affect friendly
relations between Thailand and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu said the task force will study Taiwan's foreign labor policy
and consult with the Council of Labor Affairs to see if the policy
violates human rights and whether it adheres to international
convention.</P>
      <P>The task force will also call on the Ministry of Justice to learn
about its investigation into the riot and visit private enterprises
that employ foreign laborers, she said.</P>
      <P>The vice president also said that a human rights legal team will
be put together to defend Thai laborers on a pro bono basis, noting
that no one is above the law in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She urged Kaohsiung lawyers who have high sense of justice and
respect human rights to contact her committee to be part of the team
aiding the Thai laborers during questioning.</P>
      <P>She also said that Taiwan and Thailand must work closely to
improve the situation, noting that the media has reported that
brokerage companies and ranking officials from both countries have
been involved in the introduction of Thai workers. Given this, Lu
said that the Thai parliament should also look into possible flaws in
exporting laborers to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pimpa thanked the vice president for her concern for her
compatriots, saying that her government was surprised to hear about
the riot and regretted that such a thing could happen. It also came
as something of a surprise to learn about the conditions that the
Thai laborers had to work under, and she said that the laborers
should be afforded their human rights and not be exploited.</P>
      <P>She also said that Thai representatives should be present when
the Thai laborers are questioned.</P>
      <P>Lu recalled that when she served as Taoyuan magistrate, she
attached much importance to the care of foreign laborers, and that
President Chen Shui-bian was also concerned about foreign laborers
when he was Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>The nation's top labor official, Chen Chu, chairman of the
Council of Labor Affairs, was sentenced to 12 years in prison because
of her dedication to human rights and democracy during the Kaohsiung
Incident in 1979, Lu said, adding that foreign laborers have
contributed a lot to Taiwan's development.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lu asked Pimpa to take care of Taiwan people in
Thailand as well as the human rights of Taiwanese serving terms in
Thai prisons.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN STEPS UP ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN: JUSTICE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin said
Monday that Taiwan has stepped up efforts to combat official
corruption through legislation, crackdowns on shady links between
politics and organized crime and upgrading political transparency.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks in a keynote speech delivered at a regional
meeting of the Transparency International (TI) , a non-governmental
organization (NGO) dedicated to boosting political accountability and
transparency as well as fighting bribery in international business
transactions.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, previous political corruption in Taiwan could
be attributed to a combination of factors, including a lack of the
concept of rule of law.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Shih said, the government has drawn up a
comprehensive basket of measures to wipe out links between politics
and organized crime through legislation to enhance political
transparency and establish clean politics.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is one of the world's major trading powers, Shih said
the government has also added provisions to its anti-corruption
statute in line with the Convention on Combating Bribery in
International Business Transactions initiated by the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's anti-corruption statute, Shih said, local
businessmen are banned from bribing foreign public officials.</P>
      <P>According to the 2004 TI global corruption perceptions index,
Taiwan ranked 35th among the 146 countries around the world subject
to the survey. Among Asian countries, Taiwan only lagged behind
Singapore, Japan and Hong Kong while ranking far ahead of China,
which ended 71st.</P>
      <P>The three-day TI East Asian meeting that began Sunday is being
organized by the TI's Taiwan chapter. In addition to reviewing the
operations of various TI chapters, the participants will focus
discussions on the formulation of indexes to gauge corruptibility,
promotion of anti-corruption education and civic society values, and
mechanisms to prevent corruption in public procurement, as well as
other relevant topics.</P>
      <P>TI Chief Executive David Nussbaum, TI Asian Director Peter Rooke
and many TI members from China, Japan, South Korea, Mongolia and
other countries have traveled to Taipei to attend the meeting.</P>
      <P>It marks the first time Taiwan has hosted a TI activity to
enhance Taiwan's visibility in the global anti-corruption campaign.</P>
      <P>TI, founded in 1993, is the only international NGO devoted to
combating corruption in any form. It works by bringing society,
business and government together in a global coalition. TI-Taiwan is
one of the more-than 85 national chapters around the world.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the organization's efforts to create a collective power
against bribery, TI Chairman Peter Eigen was selected by Reader's
Digest magazine in 2004 as its person of the year in Europe.</P>

      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh and MAC Chairman Joseph Wu will address the

Secretary-General Michael You will preside over the ceremony.</P>
      <P>The center originates from an idea by Chang, who has been very

across China to offer professional and real-time consultations as
well as personal and efficient services on a case-by-case and
cross-region basis.</P>
      <P>The center will be the second of its kind in just a week after

    <HEADLINE>PFP STRUGGLING TO KEEP POWER BASE THROUGH YEAR-END ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 29 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP) ,
considered a powerful upstart party following the 2000 presidential
election, is trying hard to maintain its power base in various key
areas amid dwindling popularity ahead of the December local
elections.</P>
      <P>Although the PFP and the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) have
discussed cooperating in the coming city mayor and county magistrate
elections as well as those for city and county councilors and for
township and village heads, chances seem slim that the two parties
can work out a platform upon which they can fully collaborate, while
a much-reported merger is even further off, according to analysts.</P>
      <P>PFP Deputy Secretary-General Liao Tsang-song and KMT
Secretary-General Chan Chun-po met last week to talk over the issue,
marking an initial effort toward eventual consolidation of the
opposition "pan blue alliance" of the KMT, the PFP and the New Party.
But observers said that a positive result remains remote due to a
lack of substantial progress.</P>
      <P>The PFP has nominated its own candidates for city mayors and
county magistrates in Keelung, Taichung and Chiayi cities and in
Hualien, Changhua, Lienchiang, Yilan and Hsinchu counties, in the
hope of pressuring the KMT to give way on the issue of shared
candidates.</P>
      <P>PFP Vice Chairman Chang Chao-hsiung urged KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou to open his mind and brace for KMT-PFP cooperation based on
mutual respect and leniency. "The KMT is bigger, stronger and richer,
and it should make a concession to the PFP, " he claimed, in a
reference that the KMT should at least allow several PFP nominees to
run in certain areas as joint "pan blue" candidates. </P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Liu Wen-hsiung, who has been nominated by the party
to run for Keeling mayor in northern Taiwan, said that it will be all
"empty talk" if the KMT shows no willingness to do so.</P>
      <P>Should the two parties fail to come up with a joint strategy, the
performance of the "pan blue alliance" in the elections will be much
affected in the face of neck-and-neck competition from the "pan green
camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, Liu said.</P>
      <P>After Ma became KMT chairman in the middle of this month, the KMT
pledged to conduct pre-election negotiations with the PFP based on
the principle of "respecting public opinion and making good on
promises through institutionalized mechanisms."</P>
      <P>Despite the KMT pledge, prospects for KMT-PFP negotiations appear
dim owing to the lack of mutual trust and the PFP's failure to come
up with a key election strategy, analysts said, pointing out that the
PFP hopefuls might have to help themselves if they want to score "pan
blue" representation in the elections.</P>
      <P>PFP officials have proposed joint electioneering and coalition
rule at the local government level as the party's basic tone for
cooperation with the KMT, but all relevant issues must be settled
between Ma and PFP Chairman James Soong, who is in the United States.</P>
      <P>In sharp contrast to rising popularity enjoyed by the KMT after
former Chairman Lien Chan returned from a visit to China in spring
this year, the PFP has seen a rapid decrease in public support in
recent months.</P>
      <P>Watchers have attributed the change to the KMT's leadership role
in the opposition camp thanks to Lien's China visit and to a
charismatic Ma, who is extremely popular among "pan blue" backers and
middle-road voters.</P>
      <P>Apart from these two factors, Soong's meeting with
independence-leaning President Chen Shui-bian in late February also
has widely been viewed as a serious blow to PFP backers, seriously
eroding public support for the party.</P>

doctors claimed Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-hung, president of National Cheng Kung University

Medicine of Kaohsiung Medical University, made the remarks at a

    <HEADLINE>PFP SUPPORTS REGULAR BUDGET, OPPOSES SPECIAL BUDGET FOR ARMS PURCHASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition
People First Party (PFP) said Monday that it supports the Ministry of
National Defense idea of listing one item of an arms procurement
package under the regular annual budget, but will not agree to
listing two other items of the arms procurement project under a
special budget.</P>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Lee Jye called on the PFP
legislative caucus to communicate with them on the change of the
funding for the purchase of three major categories of arms from the
United States, originally listed under a special budget.</P>
      <P>The PFP legislative caucus said it will support six Patriot PAC
III anti-missile batteries being listed under the regular budget at
around NT$130 billion (US$4.06 billion), but will continue to oppose
the listing of eight diesel-electric submarines and a squadron of 12
P-3C anti-submarine aircraft under a special budget for a total of
around NT$330.3 billion.</P>
      <P>Daniel Huang, PFP caucus whip in the legislature, described the
ministry's new version of the arms procurement project as "old wine
in a new bottle" and offering nothing new.</P>
      <P>He said the caucus opposes the financing of the procurement under
a special budget because the government has bloated its funding,
adding that the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the PFP and the
Kuomintang has in the past blocked the arms procurement package via
special budget several times, supposedly "with the support of the
public."</P>
      <P>Sun Ta-chien, another PFP caucus whip in the legislature, also
said the party has conveyed to Lee its wish not to leave debts to
future generations through the special budget and its opposition to
voting on the whole package instead of on each individual item,
saying that the arms procurement project should consider defense
needs, urgency and price.</P>
      <P>He stressed that if the Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries
are listed under the annual budget, the caucus will approve a
screening, although he added that this does not mean the caucus will
accept it all, or be lax in screening.</P>
      <P>Since President Chen Shui-bian has promised to upgrade the
defense budget to 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) , he
suggested to the ministry that it had better put the procurement of
submarines and anti-submarine planes under the regular budget.</P>
      <P>Both Huang and Sun cited Lee's remarks in which he said the
U.S. has sent a message to the ministry expressing concern about the
progress of the arms procurement deal and that the ministry is under
tremendous pressure.</P>
      <P>If the special budget for arms procurement is not passed, the
defense capability will not be upgraded, Lee was quoted as saying,
and he was also pessimistic about raising the national defense budget
to 3 percent of the GDP, saying that "the Executive Yuan will not
necessarily agree to it."</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPERTS GATHER TO FIND WAYS TO IMPROVE TAIWAN'S SPORTS PERFORMANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 29 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Sport experts, scholars and coaches from
around Taiwan attended a forum Monday in Taipei to discuss ways for
the nation to get rid of its sporting weakness.
</P>
      <P>Tsai Chen-wei, chairman of the Republic of China Sports
Federation (ROCSF), said he hopes Taiwan will win at least seven gold
medals in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing after it took two golds
in the Athens event last year, a record in Taiwan's sporting history.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks in his address to the one-day forum, titled
"Taiwan's Project Hope in Sport."</P>
      <P>A wide range of discussions were conducted on three major topics,
including pooling industrial, government and academic power to
produce sports resources, enhancing athletic skills and taking more
part in international sporting events, and increasing the number of
athletes.</P>
      <P>One of the most attractive issues at the event was a project to
set up a national fund for sports development. Kao Chun-hsiung,
president of the Taiwan Society of Sport Management, described the
fund as the best way to use financial resources effectively.</P>
      <P>Kao said that via the fund, money could be more efficiently spent
on sports affairs. He noted that compared with neighboring countries,
such as Japan and South Korea, Taiwan's general sports development
was not enhanced at all, despite it's Olympic success in Athens.</P>
      <P>The forum also saw the participation of Minister of Education Tu
Cheng-shen, who announced the ministry's seven sport policy goals at
the event, including increasing physical exercise in schools,
attaching greater importance to athletes' development, constructing a
sports "damage control mechanism" and building a national sports
university.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW DORMITORIES IN KAOHSIUNG TO ACCOMMODATE 1,000 THAI LABORERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Aug. 29 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two dormitory buildings in the Hsiaokang
District of Kaohsiung City currently being refurbished will soon be
ready for Thai laborers working on greater Kaohsiung's rapid transit
railway project to move into, acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen gave the assurance to news media when he made an inspection
tour of the dormitory area. He said the first group of 150 Thai
workers will be able to move in Tuesday and that the two dormitories
eventually will accommodate a maximum of 1,000 people.</P>
      <P>The acting mayor said that he would spend a night in one of the
rooms to "experience what it feels like to live there."</P>
      <P>The two buildings, owned by the city government, will be leased
to the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) for NT$300,000 per month.
They consist of living quarters, dining rooms, shower rooms,
lavatories and a canteen -- all equipped with air-conditioners.</P>
      <P>Adjacent to the dormitories is a playground with basketball
courts surrounded by trees and bushes.</P>
      <P>Chen said that "satisfaction will be guaranteed" and that the
Thai workers will have a comfortable living environment.</P>
      <P>The 1,700 Thai laborers working on the Kaohsiung rapid transit
railway currently live in four two-story dormitories at Kangshan in
Kaohsiung County. The living quarters are crowded, without
air-conditioning. The poor living conditions and the harsh
restrictions placed on the workers by a brokerage agency triggered a
riot Aug. 21 that caused NT$10 million-worth of property damage.</P>
      <P>As a result of the incident, the authorities have been criticized
severely for subjecting the Thai workers to inhumane treatment. Under
mounting pressure, the Kaohsiung city government and KRTC promised to
improve the living conditions of the laborers until they are totally
satisfied.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S 1ST DETECTOR DOG TRAINING CENTER INAUGURATED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's first detector dog training center
was inaugurated at National Pingtung University of Science and
Technology Monday.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said the university has helped
train 12 teams of detector dogs and handlers over the past two years.</P>
      <P>With the completion of the new training center, COA officials
said, the ranks of detector dogs and their handlers will continue to
expand to contribute to the campaign against animal and plant
smuggling.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began using detector dogs in 2002 when the United States
assisted in training three teams of detector dogs and handlers.</P>
      <P>The teams have since been posted to Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport, Kaohsiung International Airport and the post of Shuitou on
the outlying island of Kinmen, respectively.</P>
      <P>The officials said the dogs have helped uncover more than 20,000
cases of passengers bringing in banned livestock products and farm
produce. The seizures have amounted to 27 metric tons, according to
COA tallies.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that the new training center can train more detector
dogs to contribute more to the protection of our agriculture and
environment, " said Sung Hua-tsung, director of the COA's Bureau of

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT URGES SOUTH KOREAN LAWMAKER TO HELP HIM ATTEND APEC FORUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian expressed hope
Monday that South Korean parliamentarian Lee In-je will help him
attend this year's informal leadership meetings of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Busan.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when receiving Lee at the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The president noted the 2005 APEC summit will be held in South
Korea's second largest city Busan in November. Saying that Taiwan,
Hong Kong and China became APEC members in 1991 due to the assistance
of the South Korean government, he urged the South Korean government
and its leader to use "political wisdom" to help him attend the
summit in his capacity as Taiwan's leader.</P>
      <P>Lee agreed to do his best, saying that if Chen can attend
it will have a positive impact on peace, prosperity and stability in
Asia.</P>
      <P>The president noted that Taiwan-South Korea relations have been
improving over the years, citing as examples the mutual waiving of
visas, the resumption of air links and the establishment of a Taiwan
representative office in Busan.</P>
      <P>Bilateral trade has grown in recent years at a pace of 30 percent
annually, reaching US$16.9 billion in 2004, with South Korea enjoying
a trade surplus of US$6.3 billion, becoming the second-largest
country with which Taiwan suffers from a trade deficit.</P>
      <P>On civilian exchanges, people from both countries made a total of
450,000 visits in 2004, two-thirds of which were Taiwanese visiting
South Korea, while the remaining third were South Koreans visiting
Taiwan, up 60 percent from the previous year.</P>
      <P>In view of the close trade exchanges, Chen said he hopes Lee will
help resume economic ministerial-level consultations between the two
countries and promote the signing of a free trade agreement
(FTA) between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Lee said Chen has a lot of supporters in South Korea, adding that
he and many others in his country have read the South Korean-version
of "Taiwan's Son," written by Chen.</P>
      <P>Lee also said that the signing of an FTA will boost bilateral
economic interests and the progress of substantial relations and he
is willing to promote it.</P>
      <P>APEC is one of the few international organizations that admit
both Taipei and Beijing. Because of Beijing's opposition, the
Republic of China's head of state has been unable to attend previous
APEC annual informal leadership meetings and has instead had to name
a proxy to attend on his behalf.</P>

      <P>A former judge of the Hsinchu District

million (US$523,351)in damages for committing adultery with the

      <P>The defendant, Chang Yu-shu, served at the Hsinchu District
Court as did the plaintiff, Chiu Chao-chih and his
wife, Lei Ya-wen. </P>
      <P>Chang and Lei fell in love with each other when they both
enrolled in a master's program at the National Chiao Tung
University in Hsinchu and had sex in California in 2002.</P>
      <P>Lei gave birth after returning to Taiwan and her husband became
suspicious of the daughter's parentage after finding the baby girl
did not resemble him and the defendant, who frequented his house to
look the baby after returning from California, fueled his suspicion.</P>

he is not the girl's father.</P>
      <P>Both Chang and Lei quit their posts at the court after Chiu
brought a action against Chang and divorced his wife.</P>
      <P>Although the Taipei District Court ordered Chang to pay Chiu
damages, it threw out the criminal charge of adultery against Chang
on the grounds that as it occurred overseas, it did not fall under
the court's jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>Panamanian Foreign Minister Samuel
Lewis Navarro said Monday that the current visit to Panama City by a
Republic of China trade delegation will certainly lead to an increase
in employment opportunities in his country and promote trade and
investment relations between Taiwan and Panama.</P>
      <P>The minister made the comments while attending the opening
ceremony of a workshop held by the delegation for Panamanian
businesses.</P>
      <P>The delegation, consisting of 58 foreign trade officials and
representatives from 42 companies, is currently on a three-day visit
in Panama. It will also visit Argentina, Uruguay, Peru and Mexico

development and creating trade and employment opportunities as well
as improving the living standards of the people, he further said.
"That is why I'm here to attend this ceremony," he added.</P>
      <P>Lewis also refuted media reports about the inconvenience to the
the Panamanian government of receiving ROC President Chen Shui-bian
if he visits Panama in September, saying that he does not know why
the media "makes such fabricated reports."</P>
      <P>"The reports are totally groundless, and my presence at this
ceremony proves that Taiwan and Panama maintain cordial relations, "
the minister continued.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Hou Pin-fu, ROC ambassador to Panama,
said that trade between Taiwan and Panama amounted to US$270 million
in 2004, with Taiwan exporting a total of US$246.7 million worth of
goods to Panama and importing US$23 million worth of products from
the country. Panama is now Taiwan's sixth largest trade partner and
third largest export market in Central and South America, he added.</P>
      <P>Besides Lewis, Panamanian Vice Minister of International Trade
Carmen Gisela Vergara also attended the ceremony.</P>

(By Jeffrey Twu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With Typhoon Talim gaining in strength and
heading directly toward Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB)
issued a sea warning for the typhoon Tuesday morning.</P>
      <P>Packing winds of up to 184 kilometers per hour, Typhoon Talim was
centered 840 kilometers east of Taiwan's southernmost tip of Oluanpi
as of 11: 30 a.m. Tuesday, moving west-northwestward at a speed of 21
kilometers per hour, according to the latest CWB data.</P>
      <P>Since a high pressure system in the Pacific Ocean shows no signs
of weakening, Typhoon Talim is likely to hit Taiwan directly, the CWB
meteorologists said, adding that the bureau will also issue a land
warning for Talim later Tuesday if its current course and speed
remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>The CWB appealed to the public to avoid any seaside activities,
noting that waters along the northeast and southeast coasts of Taiwan
will be affected by the approaching typhoon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, hot weather and afternoon thundershowers are forecast
to continue around the island until Wednesday, when sporadic
downpours are expected as Taiwan comes under the influence of Talim.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SERVICE CENTER FOR 'TAISHANG' LAUNCHED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A center to serve Taiwan businesspeople
operating in China, known locally as "taishang," was launched Tuesday
under the auspices of the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF).</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh, SEF Chairman Chang Chun-hsiung, SEF Vice
Chairman and Secretary-General You Ying-lung, and Mainland Affairs
Council Chairman Joseph Wu jointly presided over a plague-unveiling
ceremony for the service center.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the inauguration of the service center is a "historic
step" toward demonstrating the government's determination to take
care of the interests of taishang.</P>
      <P>It is the first official center to serve Taiwan businesspeople
based in China, the premier added.</P>
      <P>He also said that since Chang took over the helm of the SEF in
June, he has learned in depth the needs of taishang and has several
times spoken with them about the importance of increasing staff for
the SEF and upgrading service quality at the quasi-official
institution.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the Executive Yuan has appropriated NT$100
million (US$3.07 million) for the SEF despite the central
government's decreased budget for next year, hoping that this will
make more resources available to serve Taiwan businesspeople
operating in China.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman Chang, speaking on the same occasion, said that it
is hoped the opening of the service center will make the public feel
that the government is taking substantive steps to take care of the
interests of the people.</P>
      <P>He said the service center plans to work closely with Taiwanese
associations in China to provide them with professional and real-time
service, including emergency assistance services, assistance in
dealing with trade disputes, and business information services, to
name a few. 
</P>
      <P>The center is the second of its kind to be established in just
one week after the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) inaugurated a
similar center last Friday.</P>
      <P>The KMT caucus in the legislature said that the party is happy to
see the inauguration of the service center, although it was hastily
launched and its effectiveness is questionable.</P>
      <P>Cho Po-yuan, a KMT whip in the legislature, said that a
communications platform between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
has yet to established and that the government's promise to cater to
China-based Taiwan businesspeople may be more symbolic than
substantive.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chang said that he is happy to see more taishang
service centers being launched, but he added that if the service has
too many political ends, then the quality of service might be
negatively affected, which he said would result in the center not
obtaining the support of the taishang.</P>
      <P>He denied that the SEF is simply following in the footsteps of
the KMT by establishing the center, saying that the SEF broached the
idea of such a service center when it convened a provisional director
and supervisor meeting Aug. 11. Afterwards, he heard that the KMT was
planning a similar center.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The convener of the "908 Campaign for the
Republic of Taiwan" was kept from entering the Kuomintang (KMT)
headquarters Tuesday when he tried to deliver an invitation to KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to attend a flag hoisting ceremony on Sept. 8.</P>
      <P>Wang Hsien-chi said he was delivering the invitation in the hopes
that the KMT leader, who has pledged "to connect the KMT's history to
that of Taiwan, " will stand along with Taiwan's mainstream public
opinion and support his cause to build a new nation called the
Republic of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang said that it is wrong for Ma to try to "connect to Taiwan
before connecting to China." Rather, he said he would advise Ma to
"connect to the people of Taiwan first and join in building the
Republic of Taiwan before making friends with China."</P>
      <P>He also suggested that the KMT donate one-thousandth of the NT$4
billion obtained from selling a piece of KMT real estate toward his
campaign.</P>
      <P>Wang was not invited into the KMT office to communicate his
ideas. Hsieh Wen-huang of the KMT Policy Committee greeted Wang at
the door, telling him that the KMT respects his ideology but does not
agree with his Taiwan independence position.</P>
      <P>Wang said his campaign is a reflection of grass-roots voices that
should not have been stopped at the KMT entrance.</P>
      <P>He urged Ma to be a co-sponsor of the Sept. 8 activity which aims
to highlight "the memorial day of Taiwan independence." Ma should
realize that the sovereignty of Taiwan belongs to the people of
Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>Ma is not expected to respond directly to Wang's invitation as
Hsieh has already made clear the party's position.</P>

Belgium said Monday in Brussels.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, Taiwan's representative to the European Union

their longtime service as missionaries in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The event, organized by the Taiwan Representative Office in

    <HEADLINE>KMT, TSU LAWMAKERS SUPPORT CABINET'S MINIMUM TAX PROPOSAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lai Shyh-bao
and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Legislator David Huang voiced their
support Tuesday for the government's minimum tax proposal that is
expected to be approved in a Cabinet meeting Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Under the Cabinet proposal, which has to win Legislative Yuan
approval to become policy, the minimum tax rates will be 10 percent
for businesses and 20 percent for individuals.</P>
      <P>However, companies whose investment plans were approved before
the new measure goes into effect will not be bound by the new rate if
the new investment project starts within one year and is completed
within three years of the new rule. These companies will continue to
enjoy a five-year tax exemption as part of the government's
incentives to encourage business investment.</P>
      <P>Lai said some people might think that a 20 percent minimum
personal income tax rate is too high, but compared with other
advanced countries, the rate is quite low.</P>
      <P>He said he will support the Executive Yuan proposal and hopes
that the Cabinet will "persist to the end" in the face of possible
pressure from the private sector.</P>
      <P>Huang, who is also the minor opposition party's legislative
caucus deputy convener, said he supports the Cabinet's policy
initiative to push for a minimum tax system and to make it a fair
one.</P>
      <P>Huang suggested that once the new rule has been implemented, the
government's increased revenue should go to balancing the budget and
financing more social welfare programs.</P>
      <P>He advised the government not to count small- and medium-sized
business owners as "rich people, " whose earnings are subject to the
20 percent minimum income tax rate.</P>
      <P>The government has set a threshold of NT$2 million for small- and
medium- sized enterprise owners, a standard that Huang said is too
low and should be raised. He did not suggest a number.</P>
      <P>Christina Liu, a lawmaker of the People First Party, said there
is still room for discussion with regard to the "trust and
protection" clause in the tax reform proposal guaranteeing a
five-year tax holiday for business investors.</P>
      <P>The legislature should also debate whether the tax base should be
expanded, she said. If the tax base is to be enlarged, then tax rates
can be lowered, she added.</P>
      <P>For instance, Liu said, the tax base for collecting business
income tax includes the stock transaction tax; if the government is
to levy capital gains tax on businesses, should they be exempted from
paying the stock transaction tax?</P>
      <P>The government should also try to solve the problem of the unfair
tax burden for people with the same earnings but who are taxed
differently, she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER HOPES LOCAL GASOLINE PRICES WON'T BE HIKED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With crude oil prices hitting new record
highs in recent days, Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that he hopes
domestic gasoline prices won't be hiked despite the situation.</P>
      <P>However, he added that as free market forces largely determine
prices, the most the government can do now is to monitor the
situation closely.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Hsieh noted he has instructed the Ministry of
Economic Affairs not to adjust prices based on the simple formula of
the price of a barrel of oil, which has hit US$70 in recent days. He
said that any gasoline price adjustments should take all factors into
consideration, including amount of oil stocks, contracts, and
sustainability.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks in reply to questions by reporters
about whether the state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. will hike
gasoline prices amid rising crude oil prices.</P>
      <P>Hsieh cited a foreign wire report Tuesday as saying that oil
prices are expected to fall to US$67 per barrel as the United States
has moved to release oil from stockpile. Nevertheless, Hsieh urged
the public to try to reduce gas consumption and to conserve energy,
saying that this is "good for the world and good for Taiwan."</P>

      <P>Most of the people in Taiwan do not feel
happy, with many of them hoping for a better economy and media
self-discipline, according to the results of a recent survey released
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the survey by the local monthly Common Health,
nearly 25 percent of the Taiwan people have problems sleeping, while
43 percent get vexed easily, and 73 percent complain about social
injustice in terms of fame and fortune. More than 50 percent are
pessimistic or feel uncertain about the future.</P>
      <P>Less than 20 precent believe that the existing social welfare
system is sufficient to help them get through their difficulties,
while only 33 percent know where to look for help when they are in
trouble, according to the survey.</P>

injustice, while 22 percent acknowledge that they do not lead a good

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) is
playing a waiting game on whether to raise fuel prices in the face of
a recent spike in international crude oil prices that topped US$70 a
barrel a couple of days ago, Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>On Monday, futures jumped to a record US$70.80 a barrel in Asian
trading because of fears that Hurricane Katrina, that swept over the
Gulf of Mexico and into the states of Louisiana and Mississippi --
major oil refining and offshore drilling areas -- would damage
facilities and bottleneck production output.</P>
      <P>Ho said that it is uncertain if oil prices will remain at their
current high levels seen in concert with Katrina hitting the U.S.,
adding that the state-run oil corporation has made no move to raise
domestic fuel prices.</P>
      <P>Hurricane Katrina has left a million without power and killed at
least 55, with the death toll expected to climb.</P>
      <P>Ho also said the ministry is waiting for the CPC to make an
assessment of the situation before commenting on the possibility of
higher costs at the gas pumps.</P>
      <P>The CPC raised wholesale gasoline prices by 7.64 percent Aug. 3,
when international oil prices stood at around US$61 to US$62 a
barrel. If oil hovers at US$70 a barrel for the remainder of the
year, Ho said, the CPC will face a loss of NT$20 billion (US$612.74
million) . This would eat up all the corporation's profits for the
first half of the year, Ho added.</P>
      <P>Raising domestic prices will be a matter of how long the CPC is
willing to absorb losses, she said, noting that the corporation is
striving to maintain normal operations.</P>

      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that he
has asked Minister-without-Portfolio Lin Sheng-feng to head a
seven-member team to investigate the controversy surrounding the
construction of a makeshift bridge on the Taipei-Ilan Expressway that
has been criticized as symbolizing "sycophantic culture" within the
government.</P>
      <P>Hsieh is under mounting pressure to clarify the situation after
media reports revealed that construction of the steel bridge joined
to one end of the Snow Mountain Tunnel was completed within two days
of President Chen Shui-bian's Aug. 27 inspection at a cost of NT$1.5
million, and that it would cost another NT$15 million to tear the
bridge down.</P>
      <P>Queried by reporters about the controversy at a news conference,
the premier said that a report submitted by the Department of
Transportation and Communications gives a different version of the
story from that of the media.</P>
      <P>He added that since he is not in a position to say which version
of the story is correct, he has decided to send a team of experts to
investigate the matter.</P>
      <P>According to the premier, the team will include four civil
engineers and two university professors. They are on their way to the
Snow Mountain Tunnel to investigate whether it was necessary for the
RSEA Engineering Corp. to build the bridge.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that if it is proven that the construction of the
bridge was done purely to "flatter the president, " then those held
responsible must be punished. Otherwise, he added, the media has a
lot to answer for.</P>

Chen "read" voraciously by hiring some of his classmates to read

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE BUDGET CHANGES 'A GRUELING DECISION': DEFENSE MINISTER LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of National Lee Jye said Tuesday
it has been a "grueling" experience for him to decide to use the
regular budget to purchase badly needed Patriot III anti-missile
batteries from the United States.</P>
      <P>He warned that the decision, which has yet to win Legislative
Yuan approval, will exclude a total of 53 new investment projects
that his ministry had planned for fiscal 2006, thus delaying the
implementation of a pivotal ministry program to raise the armed
forces' combat capability.</P>
      <P>The opposition parties' obstinate resistance was behind Lee's
painful decision to remove the purchase of the anti-missile weaponry
from a special budget bill that still includes funds for the other
two big-ticket items -- submarines and anti-submarine aircraft.</P>
      <P>The initial special budget, totalling NT$610.8 billion, has been
lowered to NT$480 billion to placate the "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang, the People First Party (PFP) and the New Party. With the
latest changes, NT$340 billion remains in the special budget to buy
submarines and anti-submarine aircraft, according to the minister.</P>
      <P>The budget for the anti-missile batteries, totalling around
NT$140 billion, will be evened out over the next six to eight years
in the ministry's annual budgets, official sources said. An assistant
to defense critic Lin Yu-fang, a PFP lawmaker, would not comment on
this on the grounds that his office has not seen the budget details
for the ministry.</P>
      <P>Lee told the media on the eve of Reporters' Day, which falls on
Sept. 1, that if he had decided to move one more of the two remaining
items to the regular budget, Taiwan's armed forces would not be able
to carry out any new projects in the next eight years; if all three
items were to be financed by the regular budget, the same thing would
be true over the next 10 years, "causing irreversible damage to our
national defence."</P>
      <P>He said the biggest threat that Communist China poses to Taiwan
is "missile attacks plus a submarine blockade, " which is also the
most economic and effective way for China to conquer Taiwan. The
three new weapons that his ministry has been asking the legislature
to help acquire are exactly aimed at ensuring that Taiwan will not be
paralyzed by China's missile attacks or sealed off by a submarine
blockade, he said.</P>
      <P>He cited U.S. and Japanese concerns about China's rising military
power to try to convince his fellow countrymen that China's growing
military threats, backed by its rising economic strength, are real
and that his ministry's decision to purchase the three defensive
weapons was made through "very strict" assessments and evaluations.</P>
      <P>The defense ministry managed to cut NT$21.8 billion from the
budget from land procurements, back-up parts and components,
infrastructure building, telecommunications equipment, maintenance of
transport vehicles and other transportation costs. More substantive
cuts come from cancelling a project to cooperate with foreign
countries in building new navy ships worth NT$71.93 million and
another project to install a telecom system for the Patriot III
package, valued at NT$50 million.</P>
      <P>The ministry has also moved NT$19.82 billion in "domestic
payments" from the special budget to the regular budget, bringing the
total cuts to the special budget to US$135.6 billion, so that it now
stands at NT$475.2 billion.</P>
      <P>Even with that figure, the Legislative Yuan would not bother to
put the special budget bill through the Procedure Committee, Lee
said. For the sake of "political harmony and the overall interests of
the country, " Lee said his ministry has taken the initiative to move
the budget for purchasing Patriot III batteries to the regular budget
in a gesture of sincerity and goodwill.</P>
      <P>The move has apparently improved the atmosphere in
ruling-opposition relations, as can be seen from the opposition's
willingness to talk with the Ministry of National Defense, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The PFP is still not happy that the government will use a special
budget to buy submarines and anti-sub aircraft. However, Lee noted
that there has been progress from the previous impasse at the
legislature. He said his personal future is not important as long as
the opposition is willing to discuss the budget at the legislature.</P>
      <P>He pledged that once the budget has passed the legislature,
"there will absolutely be no scandals" involving the arms procurement
and the ministry will "very carefully" use the arms in defense of the
nation.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan gives up its efforts to boost its defense capability,
it will "end up in a dead end" as China has never renounced the
option of a military takeover of Taiwan, Lee said.</P>
      <P>"Boosting our defense capability is aimed at keeping the
cross-Taiwan Strait military imbalance from worsening and protecting
our hard-won democratic achievements and economic prosperity, " he
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER URGES ASSESSMENT ON ENGLISH PROFICIENCY INCENTIVE PROGRAM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh instructed government
agencies Tuesday to "cautiously assess" the ramifications of a
program to encourage public functionaries to study English.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks after the Central Personnel
Administration (CPA) announced recently that English proficiency test
institutes for civil servants will be increased to eight from the
current one from Sept. 1 and that civil servants getting good grades
in tests administered by the eight institutes be given preference in
promotion. </P>
      <P>Those who have passed the test will be awarded between two and
seven points according to their score, the CPA said. As a civil
service "big merit" is worth only 1.8 points, the English test has
thus become a short cut for civil servants seeking promotion.</P>
      <P>The premier noted that to upgrade the English proficiency of
civil servants overall by 2008 was a policy set during the term of
his predecessor, Yu Shyi-kun, and that the goal remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that upgrading English proficiency will help people
get in touch with the world and enhance national competitiveness.</P>
      <P>He instructed all government agencies to formulate their own
promotion and incentive guidelines based on the consideration of
their own operations and service targets and to encourage civil
servants to take on-the-job training and upgrade service quality.</P>
      <P>He said the government agencies have to cautiously assess the
impact brought by the English learning incentive program on the
promotion of civil servants so as to avoid "unnecessary trouble for
the people."</P>
      <P>CPA Deputy Director-General Lee Jo-i had said that although
passing an English proficiency test will be a boost to promotion, it
is not the only criterion, pointing out that under current
regulations, other factors affecting promotion include academic and
career background, training, potential and leadership.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai
ordered a sweeping probe Tuesday into Kaohsiung-based companies that
employ more than 100 foreign workers in the wake of the Thai labor
riot that occurred more than a week ago.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference following a municipal meeting, Chen
said that all Kaohsiung-registered companies with more than 100
foreign laborers must be checked, adding that the Kaohsiung plant of
the Formosa Plastics Group also will be inspected, although its
4,800-odd foreign workers now work in its Mailiao plant in Yunlin
County.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government has set up a task force to
investigate the riot that occurred late Aug. 21 and the ad hoc group
will complete a report on the incident within a week, Chen said,
adding that the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) -- which employs
the workers -- will be told to reshuffle its board members if the
company is found to be responsible for the riot.</P>
      <P>The KRTC has also been instructed to step up public security
inspections of the city's mass transit system construction sites to
fend off re-occurrences of the rioting.</P>
      <P>Chen also claimed that he will not shun any responsibility if the
city government has to shoulder administrative responsibility.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the city government has fined the KRTC
NT$300,000 for violating the Employment Services Act due to its poor
management of foreign workers. The KRTC was fined a further mere
NT$20,000 for unreasonable and overdue overtime pay for the Thai
workers building the Kaohsiung mass transit system, hundreds of whom
rioted to demand better working and living conditions.</P>

      <P>Passengers will be entitled to a full
refund of train ticket prices in the event of delays lasting more
than 80 minutes from mid-September, Taiwan Railway Administration
(TRA) Deputy Director-General Chen Feng-nan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the promise at a news conference held by Legislator
George Hsieh of the opposition People First Party after trains plying
the Western Railway were hit with serious delays during the rush hour
that morning, generating a chorus of complaints from commuters.</P>
      <P>The delays were caused by a construction incident on the railway
between Hsichih in Taipei County and Chitu in Keelung City, northern
Taiwan when the Reconstruction Bureau of the Taiwan Railway (RBTR)
was working on an elevated rail project.</P>
      <P>The incident led to the Hsichih-Chitu line being severed for
nearly three hours, affecting 56 commuter trains.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that he urged the TRA and the RBTR to address the
problem of frequent train delays two weeks ago and he
found it "hard to believe" that the same mistake happened again so
quickly. </P>
      <P>According to TRA statistics, more than 2,400 passengers suffered
from train delays lasting over one hour and 20 minutes in July.</P>

Hurricane Katrina pounded the Gulf Coast with devastating force

    <HEADLINE>TYPHOON MAY LEAVE TAOYUAN COUNTY WITHOUT TAP WATER AGAIN: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taoyuan County, Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taoyuan County residents, troubled
by tap water stoppages in the past two years whenever a typhoon
strikes northern Taiwan, may be out of running water yet again for up
to eight days as a result of Typhoon Talim's forthcoming onslaught, a
senior government official warned Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Water Resources Agency Director-General Chen Shen-hsien said that
if turbidity in Shihmen reservoir reaches 60,000 degrees because of
the heavy rain brought by the typhoon, the Taiwan Water Corp. may be
forced to stop its water supply to Taoyuan County for six to eight
days.</P>
      <P>Chen accompanied Vice Economics Minister Ho He-hsiung on an
inspection tour of the reservoir -- the source of tap water for
Taoyuan County. The management at the reservoir was instructed to
open the dam floodgates at 2 p.m. Tuesday to adjust the water level
in preparation for expected heavy rainfall from Typhoon Talim.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an executive of the water company urged residents in
Taoyuan County to store enough water for one week so as to avoid an
expected repetition of the nightmare of days without running water.</P>
      <P>The Central Water Bureau issued a land warning for northern and
eastern Taiwan at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday against Typhoon Talim. The eye of
the typhoon was located 660 km east of Oluanpi, Taiwan's southernmost
tip. With maximum center winds of up to 191 kph, Talim's 250 km
radius was moving west-northwest toward Taiwan at 21 kph.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER DEFENDS BOT DECISION FOR KAOHSIUNG MRT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh defended Tuesday the
decision to adopt the "build, operate and transfer" (BOT) mode for
building Kaohsiung's mass rapid transit (MRT) system, saying it is no
more prone to corruption than any other system and pointing out that
many corruption cases occurred during the 60 years of Kuomintang
(KMT) rule that did not involve BOT projects.</P>
      <P>He was responding to media criticism that the cost of building
Kaohsiung's MRT is too expensive, a criticism that was triggered by a
riot by Thai workers last week in protest over their inhumane
treatment by their Taiwanese employers.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said it cost Taipei City NT$440 billion to build its 88 km
MRT. By comparison, he said, Kaohsiung will be spending a total of
NT$180 billion to build a 42-km system.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the labor riot should not have been used as an excuse
to imply that the BOT mode for the project is wrong.</P>
      <P>Tsai Yu-chen, a TV critic, claimed that the Kaohsiung city
government is paying a "whopping" NT$150.8 billion, or 83.2 percent
of the total price for building the MRT system, and yet is not in
charge of building it.</P>
      <P>She said the city government has allowed a minority investor,
Chairman Chen Min-hsien of Southeast Cement Corp., to control the use
of the huge construction fund, which she claimed led to the riot and
revealed poor management on the part of the company that hired the
workers and negligence of duty by responsible government agencies.</P>
      <P>Tsai also claimed that the people have reason to worry about the
construction quality of the MRT and the safety of the trains if the
system is operated by who she claimed is "such a questionable
businessman."</P>

    <HEADLINE>RISING OIL PRICES WILL IMPACT TAIWAN ECONOMY: ECONOMIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Soaring oil prices are expected to have a
big impact on Taiwan's economy, prompting shrinkage in exports this
year, an economist predicted Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yang Chia-yen, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, said that if crude oil prices average US$55 per barrel this
year, it will subtract NT$20.55 billion from Taiwan's gross domestic
product and drag down investment, leading to an annual reduction of
0.16 percentage points in exports but an annual import increase of
0.21 percentage points.</P>
      <P>He estimated falls in outbound shipments of NT$11.11 billion,
with increases in inbound shipments at NT$13.73 billion, on an
average import oil price of US$55 per barrel -- a 49 percent growth
over the 2004 average.</P>
      <P>A recovering U.S. economy and voracious demand for crude oil from
China and India have made a reduction in global oil consumption
impossible, he said, adding that high oil prices will also make it
very difficult for the government to improve upon a 4 percent
economic growth rate this year, as oil prices exceeded US$70 per
barrel for the first time Monday on the world market.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, China consumes 6.9 million barrels of oil per
day, second only to the U.S.' 20.9 million barrels. China's oil
import is expected to grow to 2.9 million barrels per day.</P>
      <P>Citing information provided by the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development, Yang pointed out that the world's
daily oil consumption this year is expected to increase from the
current level of 82.5 million barrels to 84.28 million barrels.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the new Taiwan dollar continued a losing streak that
has lasted for more than a week, with the local currency finishing at
32.657 against the U.S. dollar Tuesday on the Taipei foreign currency
exchange market, down by NT$0.167 from Monday's close.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that world oil prices keep setting fresh highs,
it remains too early to talk about inflation in the short term,
economists said, adding that the effect for the time being has mainly
been a "psychological impact."</P>
      <P>They forecast that the Taiwan currency will further slide to 32.8
against the greenback amid new oil price highs, but added that the
situation should be observed for at least three months before talking
about inflation.</P>
      <P>A cheaper local currency means that imported product prices will
surge, but this is only a small segment of overall wholesale prices
and will have only limited impact on consumer product prices as a
whole, they said, adding that the central bank may seek to help boost
Taiwan's exports through currency devaluation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has instructed
that ceremonies welcoming him during inspection tours be simplified,
an official of the Presidential Office said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-tsung, director-general of the Department of Public
Affairs, made the remarks after reports that Hsinchu air base
officials canceled leave for servicemen and instead made them
practice songs and drills to welcome the president.</P>
      <P>The president had originally planned to visit the base Tuesday to
record a tape of a message to be delivered for the Sept. 3
Servicemen's Day. But after reports said some military officers had
to give up their leave to practice songs in the welcoming ceremony,
he called off the trip.</P>
      <P>The reports cited an air force spokesman as saying that the base
was honored to receive the president on the eve of Servicemen's Day.
The spokesman said the base followed the strict protocol of a host
and denied media claims that the leave-canceling was an example of
"sycophantic culture." He added that servicemen who had their leave
canceled will have it made up later.</P>
      <P>The president expressed concern about the "rights" of the
servicemen being affected because of his visit and instructed his
aides to have prior communications in arranging future itineraries to
avoid similar incidents from happening again, Chen Wen-tsung said.</P>
      <P>The president attaches more importance to substance than
formality, and has often thought that a lot of protocols should be
scrapped. This, the aide said, is why it is no longer necessary for
high-ranking officials to show up at the airport when the president
or vice president leave for overseas trips and when they return.</P>

      <P>In a statement presented by the Executive Yuan to the Legislative

his administration will continue its policy of developing the economy
and carrying out reforms by pressing ahead with 10 major projects and
the 2008 National Development Program.</P>
      <P>The statement said Taiwan has come a long way in terms of its
competitiveness in recent years.</P>
      <P>Citing a competitiveness report compiled by the Lausanne-based
International Institute for Management Development, the statement
said Taiwan had moved up from 17th place among 60 economies covered

in Asia behind only Singapore.</P>
      <P>In a competitiveness index authored by the Geneva-based World

10th spot in 2000 to 4th in 2005, and was listed as the best in Asia
for three consecutive years.</P>
      <P>In order to cushion the impact of the country's membership of the
World Trade Organization and the international trend of
globalization, the premier said in the statement that his
administration will promote economic and trade exchanges with China
with the purpose of setting up a labor-division framework with China.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said his administration will continue its efforts to resume
dialogue and set up an inter-action framework with China to ensure
peaceful development across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In order to build up mutual trust between the various domestic
political parties, he said his administration will continue its
pursuit of political stability through negotiation and dialogue with
the opposition, as instructed by President Chen Shui-bian.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Facing fierce competition from China,
Taiwan's sagging textile industry is trying to polish up its image by
staging two international events in the next two months, industry
sources said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The first is the 2005 Taipei Innovative Textile Application Show
(TITAS) , which is slated to open Sept. 29 and last until Oct. 1 in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>The show is inviting leading manufacturers locally and from
overseas to exhibit fibers, yarns and fabrics, and to introduce new
products employing nanotechnology, with bamboo charcoal and many more
new materials.</P>
      <P>The other will be the Textile International Forum and Exhibition
2005, which will be held in Taipei from Oct. 12-14.</P>
      <P>Contrary to the TITAS, which targets buyers and manufacturers,
the forum is expected to bring together textile-related
industrialists, officials and academics to exchanges views in 18
seminars and panel discussions, hopefully giving the world a better
understanding of the country's textile industry.</P>
      <P>The two events are vital to the revival of the textile industry,
which has seen many small- and middle-sized textile factories forced
to downsize or close in the face of China's competition, while the
end of a global quota system this year will unleash an era of
complete open worldwide competition, according to industry sources.</P>
      <P>In order to reinvigorate the once-flourishing industry, the
sources said, the government should intervene to push the
reorganization of the industry and the consultation of the up- and
middle-stream factories that are in disarray after the relocation of
many textile factories to China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BRACES FOR TYPHOON TALIM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is bracing for strong winds and
torrential rainfall as Typhoon Talim heads directly toward the
island, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Talim, the 13th typhoon reported in the Pacific area this year,
has a radius of 250 kilometers and a "solid" structure. It is
forecast to make landfall in eastern Taiwan, probably between the
counties of Ilan and Hualien, sometime between Wednesday afternoon
and Thursday morning, CWB meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>Packing winds of up to 184 kph, Typhoon Talim was located some
370 kilometers east-southeast of Hualien, moving in a west-northwest
direction toward the island at a speed of 21 kph as of 9 a.m.
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Cabinet meeting Wednesday morning, Premier Frank
Hsieh directed all relevant government agencies to take precautionary
steps to deal with the approaching typhoon, saying that "past
mistakes should not be repeated."</P>
      <P>Hsieh was referring to the prolonged water supply problem in
Taoyuan County, northern Taiwan, following landslides and flash
floods triggered by two typhoons in July and August.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the weather bureau called for the public to be on
heightened alert against possible landslides and flash floods in
mountainous areas and sudden rises in sea-water levels in low-lying
coastal areas.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau also said that a "red alert" has been issued
for offshore areas, including Green Island, Orchid Island, Penghu,
Kinmen and waters around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Environmental Protection Administration called
for the public to store sufficient amounts of water at home in case
of water shortages caused by any failures in reservoir operations.</P>
      <P>With eastern and northeastern Taiwan expected to come under the
influence of Typhoon Talim by nightfall Wednesday, the local
governments of Ilan, Hualien, Taipei, Miaoli and Changhua counties,
as well as Taichung City have announced that schools and some public
offices will be closed beginning noon Wednesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER WANTS CLEAR LINE DRAWN BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG IN RIOT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 31 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday that it
is necessary to review the reasons behind the recent riot by Thai
laborers working for the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp., but he also
insisted that the actions of a few Thai laborers damaging property
and burning vehicles are still unlawful.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks while commenting during a floor
meeting of the Executive Yuan on the Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers
protesting poor living conditions and treatment by management.</P>
      <P>Noting that there are multi-level questions in the incident,
Hsieh said that there have "indeed been errors and negligence in the
treatment of Thai laborers on a human rights level, and an
improvement should be made in this regard."</P>
      <P>However, he added that, on the legal level, if the government
cannot deal with such unlawful acts as drinking alcohol in company
living quarters, burning vehicles, and creating public disturbances,
then there is no public authority.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the Ministry of Justice will deal with
the matter according to the law quickly so as to draw a clear line
between right and wrong.</P>
      <P>On the incident's impact on Taiwan's image, Hsieh said that the
riot was an isolated case. Noting that there are around 300,000
foreign laborers in Taiwan and around 15,000 in Kaohsiung alone, the
premier said that "one must not say that Taiwan is a country without
human rights just because of this isolated incident."</P>

    <HEADLINE>OFFICIAL NEGOTIATIONS NEEDED FOR OPENING OF CROSS-STRAIT FLIGHTS: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Official negotiations between Taiwan and
China are definitely required for the opening of cross-Taiwan Strait
charter flights, Mainland China Affairs (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The opening of regular cross-strait charter flights, even if only
for weekends, would be difficult if only advocated by private sector
individuals and without official negotiations across the strait, Wu
stressed.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a recent suggestion by Kuo Tai-chiang, chairman of
Taiwan's Council for Industrial and Commercial Development, that
Taiwan and China open direct cargo/passenger charter flights between
Taipei and Shanghai on weekends for six months on a trial basis, Wu
said that such flights can only be implemented after officials from
the two sides reach a consensus on the matter.</P>
      <P>Kuo suggested that the two sides open cargo/passenger charter
flights between Taipei and Shanghai on a trial basis to allow Taiwan
businesspeople operating on the Chinese mainland to return to their
Taiwan homes on weekends.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that it could be decided after the six-month trial basis
whether the Taipei-Shanghai weekend charter flight services should
continue or should even be expanded to become regular cross-strait
charter flights.</P>
      <P>The business tycoon also cited the results of a recent Gallop
Poll as indicating that 70 percent of the Taiwan public believe that
regular cross-strait cargo/passenger charter flights should be
launched.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, most of the respondents think that
ideology is the major obstacle preventing cross-strait charter flight
services from being implemented.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 70 percent of the Taiwan public agree
that authorities from the two sides of the strait should resume
official negotiations on the matter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTRY BUDGET UP NT$7.2 BILLION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense's (MND's)
annual budget is projected at NT$265.7 billion for next year, marking
an increase of NT$7.2 billion from the 2005 level, according to the
central government's 2006 budget bill unveiled Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet referred its 2006 budget bill to the Legislative Yuan
earlier in the day for deliberation and approval.</P>
      <P>MND officials said the increase in the ministry's budget for 2006
will mainly finance the planned procurement of six Patriot PAC III
anti-missile batteries from the United States.</P>
      <P>The Patriot anti-missile batteries are one of the three weaponry
items included in the MND's long-stalled arms procurement package.
The two other big-ticket items are eight diesel-electric submarines
and a squadron of 12 anti-submarine aircraft.</P>
      <P>For more than a year, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang and the People First Party has used its slim majority in
the legislature to hold up the special NT$480 billion budget bill for
the three-item arms procurement package, claiming that the purchase
would spark an arms race with rival China that could bankrupt Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With an aim to placate opposition parties' boycott, the MND
finally decided to adopt a new funding approach by dividing between a
modified special budget and the regular defense allocation.</P>
      <P>While the six Patriot batteries will be funded by the MND's
regular budget, the remaining two items will be funded by a special
budget estimated at NT$340 billion.</P>
      <P>Both come from state coffers, but the regular defense budget
carries more rigorous oversight provisions. By so doing, MND
officials said, they are hopeful that opposition parties can approve
the package as early as possible.</P>
      <P>According to the MND's 2006 budget plan, the ministry's
confidential budget will amount to NT$48.2 billion, up NT$6.5 billion
from the 2005 level. Its missile unit's funds for arsenal renewal
will also increase by more than NT$300 million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT DEMANDS INVESTIGATION REPORTS ON KAOHSIUNG RIOT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 31 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Investigations into the Aug. 21 riot of
Thai laborers working for the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC)
has begun, and the government requires the investigative reports to
be published quickly to clearly define those who should be held
responsible, Executive Yuan spokesman Cho Jung-tai said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cho said the Cabinet will assign Minister-Without-Portfolio Hsu
Chi-hsiung to decide whether the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
should take responsibility.</P>
      <P>He also cited Premier Frank Hsieh's remarks in a floor meeting of
the Executive Yuan that the human rights violations of foreign
laborers has already been investigated by the CLA and a private
task force.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have already begun investigating whether the riots
were triggered by improper management or kickbacks, while local
governments are looking into whether the contract between the
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) and its foreign laborers is
"reasonable."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the task force headed by CLA Deputy Minister Lai
Chin-lin gave a report on its finding to the Executive Yuan, in which
it suggests that in the future employers of foreign laborers should
face criminal charges if they exercise improper management.</P>
      <P>Lai's task force also includes scholars, experts and
representatives of Buddhist and human rights groups, as well as
Deputy Director of the Thailand Trade and Economic Office in
Taipei Manopchai Vongphakdi.</P>
      <P>The report said that the riot by around 100 Thai laborers working
for the KRTC was mainly due to the basic rights of foreign laborers
being infringed upon, their working conditions not protected,
improper management by the employers and poor living environment.</P>
      <P>The report suggests that the CLA revise the employment services
law to stipulate that employers who exercise improper management
resulting in the freedom, lives and property of foreign laborers
being threatened or infringed upon will face criminal charges.</P>
      <P>It also suggests that employers should report to local
authorities for approval on the working rules and management
regulations for foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>The report also asks the Executive Yuan to address the problem of
increasing the full-time staff for foreign laborer management so that
the management of foreign laborers in local governments can move in a
healthy direction.</P>
      <P>On the responsibility of the central and local governments, the
report says that the labor departments in the Kaohsiung city and
county governments both failed to act either before or after the
riot, resulting in controversy on who should be in charge of foreign
laborer management.</P>
      <P>Both Kaohsiung city and county governments should take
responsibility and the CLA must also be responsible for failing in
its duty of supervision, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Lai said that the report does not stand for the stance of the CLA
and that the CLA will use the report as the basis for improvement of
the foreign laborer system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXECUTIVE YUAN PASSES NEW VERSION OF ARMS PROCUREMENT BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan approved Wednesday a new
NT$340 billion (US$10.46 billion) arms procurement draft bill
submitted by the Ministry of National Defense to replace a previous
one that has been continuously stonewalled by the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh appealed to the Legislative Yuan to pass the
new arms procurement draft bill as quickly as possible, stressing
that the country cannot afford to procrastinate on efforts to beef up
its defense capabilities any longer.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Cho Jung-tai said that in response to
lawmakers' demands and under pressure from home and abroad, the
Defense Ministry changed the proposed manner of funding the three
items in an arms package that the United States has agreed to sell to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The three items in the package -- eight diesel-electric
submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries and a squadron
of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft -- have a total price tag of
NT$480 billion (US$14.77 billion).</P>
      <P>In the new version of the arms procurement bill, which is
expected to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan in a few days, the
Defense Ministry lists the six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries, costing some NT$130 billion (US$4 billion), in its regular
budget, while the eight diesel-electric submarines and the squadron
of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft are listed under a special budget
for a total of around NT$340 billion.</P>
      <P>Cho said that listing the NT$130 billion budget for the six
Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries under the regular budget means
that it will have a crowd-out effect in other Cabinet budget plans
next year. To help offset this effect, he said, the premier said at
Wednesday's meeting that an extra budget of NT$3.5 billion will be
allocated to the ministry in the next fiscal year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cho noted, the special funding of NT$340 billion will
be executed over 15 years, through methods including borrowing from
banking institutions and selling off public-run company shares or
state-owned land.</P>

      <P>The Congressional Research Service's "Conventional Arms Transfers

United Arab Emirates (UAE) led the pack of developing nations by
importing US$3.6 billion-worth of conventional arms, surpassing Saudi
Arabia, which imported arms worth US$3.2 billion.</P>
      <P>China was the third-largest importer of conventional arms last

      <P>For the period of 2001-2004, Taiwan's imports of conventional
arms dropped to the sixth in ranking at a value of US$3.9 billion,
contrasted with China's US$8.8 billion, which was second only to
Saudi Arabia that took delivery of US$19 billion-worth of arms.</P>
      <P>During those four years, UAE was the third-largest importer of
conventional arms at a value of US$6.8 billion, followed by India

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan International Workers'
Association and several other human rights groups formed a support
group Wednesday with the aim of providing legal assistance to the
Thai laborers who were involved in the Aug. 21 riot.</P>
      <P>The groups noted that the riot by around 100 Thai laborers
working for the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) to protest
against inhumane management and poor living conditions has aroused
public attention to the dire human rights violations suffered by some
foreign laborers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung prosecutors have already looked into the riot and have
interviewed those they claim were the ringleaders who led the riot,
the groups said, adding that this is why they decided to form a
support group that can speak up for them before the Ministry of
Justice.</P>
      <P>They said that many Thai laborers have been unfairly treated by
their employers and have no other recourse but to fight back. For
this reason, they said, the workers should not be held criminally
responsible.</P>
      <P>They also expressed hope that President Chen Shui-bian will give
the Thai laborers amnesty.</P>
      <P>Liao Yuan-hao, convener of the legal assistance support group,
said the group will have lawyers and translators assist the foreign
laborers and that they will accompany the laborers during the
litigation process.</P>
      <P>The groups also urged prosecutors to acquit the Thai
laborers for "reasonable defense."</P>
      <P>In addition, the Legal Aid Foundation said it will act on behalf

    <HEADLINE>NT$240 MILLION BUDGET INCREASE FOR CONTROL YUAN WITHOUT MEMBERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Sept.  31 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Control Yuan, the nation's highest
watchdog body, has been without members since Feb. 1 because the
legislature has refused to approve the nominations submitted by
President Chen Shui-bian, but this has not stopped the Executive Yuan
from proposing a massive NT$240 million increase for the Control
Yuan's fiscal 2006 budget.</P>
      <P>According to the central government's overall budget submitted to
the Legislative Yuan for approval, the Control Yuan's share amounted
to NT$2.26 billion, an increase of NT$240 million over fiscal 2005.</P>
      <P>The proposed budget covers all normal expenditures of the Control
Yuan, including salaries for 24 members and staff, administrative
expenses and allowances for members to make inspection tours abroad.</P>
      <P>However, the prospects appear dim of the Democratic Progressive
Party-led government breaking the deadlock unless the president
agrees to submit a new list of nominees matching the expectations of
the legislature.</P>
      <P>Chen first submitted the names of his nominees in January for the
previous legislature's approval, but the opposition legislators
refused to approve them, maintaining that most of the nominees were
not up to the expectations of the public.</P>
      <P>In February, the two major opposition parties -- the Kuomintang
and the People First Party -- which hold a small majority in the new
legislature, asked Chen to submit a new list of nominees on the
grounds that his original list to the previous legislature was
invalid in the new legislature, but he resubmitted the same list,
which the opposition legislators refused to endorse.</P>
      <P>The president indicated earlier this week that if it is necessary
for him to submit the names of the nominees to the Legislative Yuan
again, he will send exactly the same name list as the one he
submitted early this year.</P>
      <P>With the Legislative Yuan opening its next session Sept. 13, it
is expected that the legislative caucuses of the opposition parties
are unlikely to reverse their positions and give the nod to the
nominations.</P>
      <P>According to the Constitution, the Control Yuan has the powers of
impeachment, censure and audit, and may take corrective measures
against government organizations. Its members may also accept
people's petitions with regard to central and local government
performance.</P>
      <P>At present, over 9,000 petitions have accumulated in the offices
of the Control Yuan.</P>

      <P>For 2004, India topped Saudi Arabia and China to become the No. 1
country in the value of arms transfer agreements among developing
nations, concluding $5.7 billion in such agreements. Saudi Arabia
ranked second with $2.9 billion and China ranked third with $2.2
billion. Taiwan ranked eighth with US$0.6 billion.</P>
      <P>In 2004, the value of all arms transfer agreements worldwide was
US$37 billion, the highest total for worldwide arms transfer
agreements, in real terms, for any year since 2000.</P>
      <P>Last year, the United States was the leader in arms transfer
agreements, making US$12.4 billion-worth, or 33.5% of all such

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese fishing vessel, the "Chung
Yi No. 318," has been held by Somali rebel militiamen since Aug. 13
for allegedly fishing illegally in Somali waters, the Kaohsiung
Fishermen's Association confirmed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the association said that the rebels are
demanding US$90,000 in ransom for the release of the deep-sea tuna
long-liner, although the captain paid application fees for fishing
rights as required by local authorities.</P>
      <P>The 100-ton fishing vessel has 20 crew members from Taiwan,
China, Indonesia and the Philippines. They were arrested when they
were trying to steer the ship into a Somali port.</P>
      <P>Attempts to negotiate with the Somali rebel militia for the
vessel's release are difficult because Taiwan has no diplomatic
relations with Somalia.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Fishermen's Association said it is seeking help
from human rights organizations in the United States through the
Council of Agriculture and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to obtain
the release of the "Chung Yi No. 318."</P>
      <P>Somalia, with the longest coastline in Africa, is surrounded by
waters ideal for tuna fishing. The country has been troubled by
factional fighting since the overthrow of military ruler Mohamed Siad
Barre in 1991.</P>
      <P>Since there is no one particular political entity that controls
Somali waters, each coastal region has self-promoted militia, led by
a faction leader, which controls its own area.</P>
      <P>Foreign fishing vessels operating in Somali waters are at risk of
being boarded by militia and having their boats seized. In March
1999, Somali gunmen hijacked a Taiwanese fishing vessel off Somalia's
east coast, taking 30 Taiwanese crew members hostage.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday he
was moved when he came to learn that two Taiwan tailors had defeated
their peers from many Western countries to capture the top honors in
a recent global contest of master tailors.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with Chen Yung- jen, the gold
medalist of the Golden Thread Awards, and Wu Ping-nan, the silver
medalist of the Golden Needle Awards, at the Presidential Office to
express his admiration for their professional achievements.</P>
      <P>The Golden Thread Awards and the Golden Needle Awards are part of
the events of the biennial World Congress of Master Tailors. The
Golden Thread Awards honor outstanding women's suit tailors while the
Golden Needle Awards commend brilliant men's suit tailors.</P>
      <P>President Chen said it was a moving and glorious moment when the
Republic of China's national flag was raised amid the magnificent
melody of the ROC national anthem at the conference hall of the 31st
World Congress of Master Tailors in Berlin Aug. 9 after Chen Yung-jen
and Wu Ping-nan received their medals.</P>
      <P>Because of China's strongarm diplomatic embargo against Taiwan,
it has not been easy for the ROC's national flag and anthem to be
featured at international occasions.</P>
      <P>"You have brought great honor to our country, " Chen told his
guests, both of whom are in their early 30s. "I admire your creative
talent and skilled workmanship."</P>
      <P>Thanks to concerted efforts of Taiwan tailors and the ROC's
overseas representative offices, Chen said, Taiwan has won the right
to host the next World Congress of Master Tailors in 2007. Taiwan
will be the second Asian country ever to host such a world event
after South Korea.</P>
      <P>Chen also took the occasion to thank the
Taiwan team's marvelous performance at the recent World University
Games held in Turkey, in which Taiwan athletes won six gold, two
silver and four bronze medals.</P>
      <P>"Among the 130-plus participating countries, Taiwan ranked ninth
in terms of medal count. It was the best rating Taiwan has ever
achieved in a world sports event. The top seven medal winning
countries were all big sports powers. The host, Turkey, ranked
eighth," Chen said, adding that he was proud of Taiwan athletes'

    <HEADLINE>CABINET APPROVES DRAFT BILL ON MINIMUM TAX</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet approved a draft bill on
minimum tax system Wednesday, a move which forms part of the
government's tax reform.</P>
      <P>Minister of Finance Lin Chuan said the new system will focus on
people who did not have to pay taxes or pay only an unreasonably
small amount of income tax under current investment initiatives, and
is designed to ensure that wealthy taxpayers do not use loopholes to
escape paying taxes.</P>
      <P>Lin stressed that the new system will only involve 0.2 percent of
the country's taxpayers.</P>
      <P>According to the draft, which will be sent to the legislature for
approval, businesses with an annual income more than NT$2 million and
above will be subject to a minimum tax rate of 10 percent; otherwise,
they will be subject to the current income tax rates, while
individuals with an annual income more than NT$8 million will be
subject to aminimum tax rate of 20 percent; otherwise, they will be
subject to the current income tax rates.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet also sets up a "trust and protection" clause in the
tax reform proposal, in which the industries obtaining the tax-free
permission in advance from the government will enjoy a five-year
tax-free privilege in their corporate income as long as the new
projects will be started within one year and be completed within
three years after the new regulations take effect.</P>
      <P>Minister of Finance Lin Chuan estimated that once the new
regulations go into effect, the tax income for the government is
expected to increase by NT$10 billion (US$5 million) in the first
year, with more increases in the future.</P>
      <P>The implementation of minimum tax rates will be the first step of
the government's tax reform, and will be prioritized by the Cabinet
in the next session of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh has said that Taiwan's tax burden is
relatively low as compared with other countries, with the average
personal income tax reaching only 13.6 percent in 2004, much lower
than the average of 27 percent registered by countries of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'SYCOPHANT' JIBE UNCALLED FOR AND SHOWS LACK OF CIVILITY: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh called on the public
Wednesday to show civility and wait until all the facts are in before
branding engineers or soldiers who are doing their duties
"sycophants."</P>
      <P>Hsieh was responding to media criticisms about a makeshift bridge
on the Taipei-Ilan Expressway and about Hsinchu Air Force Base troops
practicing songs and dances in preparation for a visit -- now
canceled -- by President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The bridge outside the Hsuehshan Tunnel on the expressway,
costing NT$1.5 million, was reportedly built in a hurry for Chen and
other government officials who were going to visit the tunnel on Aug.
27. The media has coined it "the sycophants' bridge" and many suspect
that the bridge has no other use. It has been estimated that the cost
of tearing the bridge down will be as high as NT$15 million.</P>
      <P>Media exposure of the soldiers' song and dance rehearsals led to
Chen cancelling his visit, scheduled for Tuesday, during which he was
supposed to have taped a speech to be aired on Soldiers' Day on Sept.
3.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, a former lawyer, said he is not an expert in engineering,
so he sent a team of people to determine if the makeshift bridge was
needed for the construction of the tunnel or if, in fact, the media
is right.</P>
      <P>"So why is everyone jumping to conclusions and claiming that the
bridge was constructed to toady up to the president? Worse still,
people have come up with such names as 'a culture of sycophants, '
'sycophant troops' and 'sycophant country.' What are they basing
these on?" he asked.</P>
      <P>"If [the bridge] was indeed a waste, useless or something used
purely to flatter somebody, then criticisms would be justified, " he
said. "Otherwise, some civility should be shown here."</P>
      <P>Troops were in high spirits when they were preparing for the
presidential visit, but now they feel frustrated and even depressed
after being ridiculed by the media, Hsieh claimed.</P>
      <P>"If these sorts of criticisms are not nipped in the bud, people
will be labeled sycophants for giving their superiors a flower or a
cake, and then people will be wary of each other, resulting in
alienation," he said.</P>
      <P>He accused critics of being part of a political smear campaign
aimed at stripping the government of its authority and making it look
incompetent.</P>
      <P>Political struggles should not sink to the level of
dehumanization, he said, adding, "It's pointless to go against human
nature. " He called on the media not to take things to the extreme.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan is to make real progress and become a civilized
country, its citizens must learn how to respect professionalism,
evidence, each other and talk reason, instead of simply satirizing
issues or individuals, the premier said.</P>

      <P>The Consumers' Foundation checked paper
napkin samples in Taipei from 18 chain outlets of restaurants, coffee
shops and convenience stores and found that they all contained
fluorescent penetran -- a whitening agent that may endanger human
health, a spokesman for the foundation said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Among the chain stores are noted names like Starbucks and
McDonalds.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said its experts conducted tests using ultraviolet
light and found that all the napkins tested showed florescent
reaction.</P>
      <P>He said that the tests also showed that the napkins from
Starbucks and McDonalds contained "migratory fluorescent substances,"
an even bigger hazard to consumers if absorbed into the body.</P>
      <P>The spokesman warned that these migratory fluorescent substances
could cause skin allergies and even cancer. He suggested that
consumers try to avoid using these napkins whenever possible.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MANY TAIWAN PEOPLE EQUATE JOURNALISTS TO PAPARAZZI: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>

perceptions of journalists, with more than 50 percent of salaried
people responding to a recent online survey equating them to
"paparrazi" or "cultural bullies," pollsters said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Internet Job Bank 1111 conducted the survey Aug. 20-30 to explore
local salaried people's perceptions of journalists as part of its
Sept. 1 Journalists' Day celebrations. A total of 1,122 valid samples
were collected, with a margin of error of 2.9 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 39.84 percent said they considered
journalists as "paparrazi"; 13.9 percent said they thought
journalists had "a highly stressful job"; and 13.37 percent said they
perceived reporters as "cultural bullies."</P>
      <P>Asked whether they had ever intended to pursue a journalistic
career, 75.4 percent said no, and 24.6 percent said they once had
such an idea.</P>
      <P>As to problems with local media, 53.48 percent cited media
outlets' fascination with violence and sensational news as the most
serious; 41.18 percent said they felt that voyeurism is rampant; and
33.16 percent said they thought that "political interference" is
serious.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 40.37 percent said local journalists should enhance
professionalism; 27.81 percent said they should improve ethical and
moral standards; 13.1 percent said they should upgrade their
investigative reporting capability and detect problems in the dark

    <HEADLINE>BAR ASSOCIATION UNHAPPY OVER CONTROVERSIAL QUESTIONS ON BAR EXAM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If some questions on exams for civil
servants are politically charged, the test will be nothing more than
a test for examinees' political orientation, the Taiwan Bar
Association said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The association said in a statement that it regrets that the
government's bar exam had a question on it about President Chen
Shui-bian's speech to the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) in the
Chinese-language section that also required examinees to write a
short article on "how the skills of a lawyer could be applied to
running the country."</P>
      <P>President Chen, who used to be lawyer before entering politics,
is often criticised or praised for the way he tends to deal with
situations in the same manner a lawyer would.</P>
      <P>The association said government examinations, which are used in
Taiwan to recruit government employees or qualify professionals,
should steer clear of political issues and should not force examinees
to tip their political hand.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the association said, examinees should never be
asked to comment on politician's remarks or deeds in such a way that
their political stance will be revealed.</P>
      <P>In order to be fair to the examinees in the bar exam, the
association recommended that the Examination Yuan, which administers
the bar exam, assess the examinees' writings regardless of the
test-takers' political views, and give all examinees full marks in
the reading comprehension section for Chinese language as long as
they put something down in that section.</P>
      <P>The fairness of the exam, which took place on Aug. 26, was called
into question after the United Daily News published complaints on
Saturday from people who had taken the test.</P>
      <P>The newspaper said Chang Cheng-hsiu, the official who presided
over the bar exam, owes his post as a member of the Examination Yuan
to the TSU, a political ally of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party.</P>
      <P>An editorial in Wednesday's China Times called the controversial
question "political product placement" and urged the Examination Yuan
to invalidate the Chinese language reading proficiency section.</P>
      <P>The newspaper also took a jab at the TSU for being reckless in
naming a controversial figure like Chang to the Examination Yuan, and
urged President Chen to end any form of nepotism in political circles
by stopping rewarding people who shamelessly fawn over him.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Much of Gulf Coast Is
Crippled; Death Toll Rises After Hurricane

Water broke through two levees in New Orleans o n Tuesday and
virtually submerged and isolated the city, causing incalculable
destruction and rendering it uninhabitable for weeks to come. As
rising water and widespread de vastation hobbled rescue and recovery
efforts, the authorities could only guess at the death toll in New
Orleans and across the Gulf Coast. In Mississippi alone, officials
raised the official count of the dead to at least 100.

Wall Street Journal: Storm Leaves Gulf Coast Devastated; New
Orleans Fights Floods after Breaks in Levees

Amid wreckage and flooding that strenched undreds of miles,
residents of shattered New Orleans and devastated cities along the
Gulf Coast began to grapple with the death and damage wrought by
Hurricane Katrina. While many areas w ere beginning to assess
damages, New Orleans faced a worsening crisis Tuesday night, with at
least two of its protective levees broken and waters from Lake
Pontchartrain pouring into the city. Though hundreds of trapped
residents were rescued from their flooded homes, many were believed
to remain marooned.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PRESIDENT MAY VISIT U.S. IN OCTOBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If all goes well, former President Lee
Teng-hui will visit the United States in early October, sources close
to Lee said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Lee's close aides are currently in the
United States to flesh out details of his itinerary.</P>
      <P>The sources said a pro-Taiwan U.S. state governor, who forged a
cordial friendship with Lee during Lee's 12-year presidency, is
assisting in arranging Lee's planned U.S. visit. Lee plans to visit
Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and New York, the sources said, adding
that Lee most looks forward to making his mark by visiting the U.S.
capital.</P>
      <P>If the travel plan is realized, it will be Lee's first trip to
the United States since his retirement in May 2000. Lee, an outspoken
critic of China's threat to Taiwan and an ardent advocate of Taiwan's
separate identity from that of China, has had difficulties visiting
countries that do not maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan even after
his retirement.</P>
      <P>In addition to meeting with Taiwan expatriates, the sources said,
Lee will also meet with U.S. politicians, including congressional
leaders.</P>
      <P>The sources said Lee may also visit his alma mater, Cornell
University, during his planned U.S. visit which may last for two
weeks. Lee made a rare visit to Cornell University in 1995 which drew
a strong backlash from China as Beijing leaders regarded the trip as a
move to promote formal Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Lee's itinerary will be finalized after
his aides' return from the United States in the coming days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARMS PURCHASE TO BE STRATEGIC DETERRENT: VICE DEFENSE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 31 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The proposed purchase of Patriot missiles,
submarines and anti-submarine aircraft from the United States will
serve as a deterrent against possible Chinese military adventurism
against Taiwan, Vice Minister of National Defense Tsai Ming-hsien
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Tokyo-based newspaper Asahi Shimbun,
Tsai said the proposed purchase of the Patriot missile batteries, at
NT$140 billion (US$4.27 billion) , was given the go-ahead by the
Cabinet Wednesday to be included in the ministry's regular budget.</P>
      <P>The vice minister said that China, with obvious superiority over
Taiwan in its numbers of missiles and submarines, is not amenable to
peaceful settlement of its disputes with Taiwan unless Taiwan can
strengthen its defense against these missiles and submarines.</P>
      <P>With the acquisition of the Patriot system, submarines and
anti-submarine aircraft, Taiwan will be able to foil China's attempts
to cordon off Taiwan at sea or invade Taiwan, giving Taiwan valuable
time to respond effectively.</P>
      <P>Noting that the arms purchase proposal had been rejected by the
opposition-controlled legislature many times when it was included in
a special budget, the vice minister said he hopes the opposition will
reverse its stance now that part of the purchase is included in the
regular budget, warning that stability across the Taiwan Strait will
be in danger if the military imbalance between Taiwan and China is
not addressed by the arms purchase.</P>
