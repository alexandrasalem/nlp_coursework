    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN STILL HAS ROOM TO EXPAND RELATIONS WITH OTHER NATIONS: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Abu  Dhabi,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By S.J. Taai and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan can expand its diplomatic
horizons, regardless of obstacles put in its way by China, ROC
President Chen Shui-bian said Friday in Abu Dhabi.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while meeting with reporters to
talk about Taiwan's current diplomatic difficulties and its relations
with the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</P>
      <P>Chen, at the head of a group of high-ranking officials and
business leaders, arrived in the UAE capital earlier in the day for a
29-hour transit stop on his way back to Taiwan after a 13-day visit
to the ROC's diplomatic allies in Central America and the Caribbean.</P>
      <P>Noting that he was deeply touched that ROC national flags were
flying upon his arrival at the international airport of the UAE, a
country which is not the ROC's diplomatic ally, the president said
that he wanted to thank the Arabian nation.</P>
      <P>"I was really moved to see ROC national flags flying over the
airport, particularly given that China has never stopped trying to
prevent Taiwan from joining the international community and
strengthening its relations with other countries," Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to the president, although Beijing protested strongly
to the UAE about his stopover, the protest was ignored since the UAE
has what he said are its own principles and methods to deal with the
matter.</P>
      <P>"Some say that this is a very significant breakthrough in
relations between Taiwan and the UAE... I'll treasure this," he said.</P>
      <P>Talking about his successful transit visit to the capital of the
UAE given Taiwan's diplomatic difficulties, Chen said, "This is not
an Arabian Nights' story, but shows that Taiwan still has room to
develop its relations with other countries."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan still can act in various places around the world as there
are many issues that the island can raise and discuss with other
nations, " he also said. "Taiwan can start down the road to success
only if it makes a concerted effort."</P>
      <P>The president also said that his transit stop in Abu Dhabi is "a
very important visit" as many high-ranking ROC officials who were
accompanying him, including Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
and Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen, were to hold bilateral
talks with their UAE counterparts on the strengthening of economic,
trade and investment cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Chen also rebutted media reports that said that he had lied when
he said he was going to stop over in San Francisco; adding, however,
"Even if it was a lie, it was one of goodwill."</P>
      <P>Reporters were told that the president planned to fly to San
Francisco rather than Abu Dhabi for a stopover on his way back to
Taiwan Oct. 1.</P>
      <P>Claiming that he did not lie to the media or to the public, the
president said that he hopes that the media can understand that as a
head of state, he was not able to confirm any information when
matters related to his transit stopover in a country with no
diplomatic relations with Taiwan were still being arranged.</P>
      <P>The president also said that he does not care about the reports
because what he did was in the nation's interest, and that achieving
a diplomatic goal is most important.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET TO FORM SPECIAL TASK FORCE TO ADDRESS HIGH-SPEED RAIL ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Saturday the
Cabinet will set up a special task force to help tackle a host of
problems involved in the nation's first high-speed railway
construction project.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks amid rising concerns about whether the
nation's long-awaited high-speed railway will open next October as
scheduled.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that the high-speed rail system construction
project has encountered many problems, including financing,
technology as well as legal rights and liabilities incurred by Taiwan
High-Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) in the course of construction, Hsieh
said he feels the need to form a special task force to make an
overall evaluation and work out response measures.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, the high-speed rail task force will comprise
transportation and financial management experts as well as
consultants familiar with Japanese affaris. THSRC reportedly has had
rifts with Japan-based Taiwan Shinkansen Consortium (TSC) , the main
contractor of the Taiwan high-speed railway's mechanical and
electrical system and the supplier of train carriages.</P>
      <P>In addition to helping address any crisis that THSRC may face,
Hsieh said the team will also cope with variables that may arise in
the future.</P>
      <P>The multimillion-dollar railway system is Taiwan's first
infrastructure project being built under the build-operate-transfer
(BOT) model in which private investors build the system and will
return control of the project to the government after a specified
period of operations.</P>
      <P>The 345-km high-speed railway linking Taipei in the north and
Kaohsiung in the south will form the backbone of western Taiwan's
mass rapid transportation network. Travel time between Taipei and
Kaohsiung is expected to be cut to 90 minutes after the railway is
inaugurated at the end of October, 2006.</P>
      <P>The high-speed railway will connect eight metropolitan areas
between Taiwan's two largest cities and will be able to transport at
least 300,000 passengers daily when it becomes fully operational.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has urged people to
stay alert during strong Typhoon Longwang, Premier Frank Hsieh said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said President Chen called him last night from Abu Dhabi,
the capital of the United Arab Emirates, where he was on a transit
stop on his way back home after an official trip to Central America
and the Caribbean.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a land alert for the
typhoon early Saturday, predicting the whole of Taiwan could expect
strong winds and heavy rain, with Hualien and Ilan in the eastern
part of the island facing the worst of the storm.</P>
      <P>The bureau forecast that the mountainous areas in Hualien and
Ilan would receive rainfall between 600 mm to 800 mm, while those in
Kaohsiung and Pingtung in southern should receive between 500 mm to
700 mm. </P>
      <P>Taipei City is estimated to receive rainfall between 250 mm to
450 mm.</P>
      <P>The center of Typhoon Longwang was located at 22.7 degrees north
latitude and 125.6 degrees east longitude at 1 p.m. Saturday -- about
430 kilometers east-southeast of the eastern Taiwan city of Hualien.</P>
      <P>With a radius of 200 km, the typhoon was moving west-northwest at
25 kilometers per hour, packing center winds of 184 kph and gusts of
up to 227 kph. It is estimated to reach the seas around 70 kilometers
west-southwest of Hualien by 11:00 a.m. Sunday, according to the CWB
forecast.</P>

    <TEXT>Manila Bulletin: GMA to
thwart power grab

President Arroyo yesterday vowed to crush fresh
attempts at a power grab as she bewailed the revival
of the impeachment battle against her in the Senate in
the guise of legislative hearings.

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: Cory hacienda deal
scrapped 

IN an unprecedented decision, the Department of
Agrarian Reform yesterday canceled the 16-year-old
stock distribution option agreement of Hacienda
Luisita, paving the way for the distribution to
farmers of the nearly 5,000-hectare agricultural
estate of the family of former President Corazon
Aquino.

The Philippine Star: GMA hits Senate 'kangaroo
court'

President Arroyo virtually declared war on the
Senate yesterday, branding it a kangaroo court trying
to destabilize her administration by abusing its
investigative powers purportedly to unmask corruption.

The Manila Times: Bunye: Drilon in 'Plan B'

Senate President Franklin Drilon said Friday he
was sincere in helping President Arroyo survive her

    <HEADLINE>RULING ON KOIZUMI'S YASUKUNI VISITS WELCOME, BUT MORE NEEDED: LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Japanese high court's ruling that Japanese
Primer Minister Junichiro Koizumi's visits to the Yasukuni Shrine for
WWII dead are unconstitutional was welcome news, said aboriginal
Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei who is fighting to have Taiwanese
soldiers' names removed from the controversial shrine, but that the
court's decision to reject compensation claims was unfortunate.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin made the remarks at the Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport upon her return from Japan.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin made a short stop in Osaka to hear the verdict from the
Osaka High Court on the case after a visit to the headquarters of the
United Nations in New York to protest against Japanese atrocities
against Taiwan's aboriginal people during its colonial rule of the
island from 1895 to 1945.</P>
      <P>The Osaka High Court ruled on Friday that Koizumi's visits to the
Yasukuni Shrine violate an article of the Japanese Constitution
calling for the separation of political affairs from religion.</P>
      <P>However, the court turned down the compensation request of 10,000
yen (US$88) by each of the 188 plaintiffs, which included Kao Chin
and families of those Taiwanese aboriginal people who died fighting
for the Japanese army during WWII.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin sued the Japanese government in 2003 on the grounds that
the Taiwanese aboriginal soldiers were forced to fight for the
Japanese army, and worse yet, their memories were enshrined at the
Yasukuni Shrine together with those who persecuted them, along with
various Japanese war criminals.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker had demanded that the Japanese government remove the
tablets of the dead Taiwan aboriginal soldiers from the shrine.</P>
      <P>The plaintiffs alleged that Koizumi's visits to the Yasukuni
Shrine were unconstitutional and caused serious psychological pain to
them, demanding compensation of 10,000 yen each.</P>
      <P>The court rejected the compensation demand, finding that legally,
the interests of the plaintiffs were not harmed.</P>
      <P>This was the second ruling following the one made by the Kukuoka
District Court in April last year that said the prime minister's
Yasukuni visits violated the constitution.</P>
      <P>Noting that she and fellow aboriginal people all heard the "voice
of justice" from the Osaka High Court, Kao Chin said although the
voice was weak, it represented a blow to militaristic politicians.</P>
      <P>However, the lawmaker noted that the Japanese government still
refused to apologize and pay a token amount of compensation for its
aggression and atrocities committed in the past against its
neighbors, and she will keep working with her people to fight for
their cause.</P>

      <P>Packing sustained winds of 184 kilometers
per hour, Typhoon Longwang is expected to make a direct hit on the
center of Taiwan and Premier Frank Hsieh has directed residents of
the island to brace for the worst.</P>
      <P>Hsieh reminded residents to stock up on drinking water and
candles and for those living in areas prone to mudslides or flooding
to seek higher ground or be prepared.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is hit by an average of 3.5 typhoons each year.</P>
      <P>Hsieh inspected the Taipei-based Central Disaster Prevention and
Relief Center with Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyuan and
Minister of Agriculture Lee Chin-lung on Saturday after the facility
was activated to prepare for the strong typhoon.</P>
      <P>Similar disaster prevention and relief centers in counties and
cities around Taiwan also have swung into action. </P>
      <P>Talking about a possible surge in vegetable prices after the
typhoon, Hsieh said that price hikes come about only because of

      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian on Friday urged all political parties in Taiwan to
cooperate with each other to help protect the nation's security and
diplomatic interests.</P>
      <P>The president made the appeal while criticizing those who have

about Taiwan's diplomatic difficulties and its relations with the

      <P>Chen, heading a delegation consisting of high-ranking officials

Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America and the Caribbean.</P>
      <P>Claiming that if the "one China" principle and the "1992
consensus, " which have not been accepted by Taiwan, become the law
of Taiwan, they will also become a Taiwan-version of the
Anti-Secession Law enacted by China in March of this year, the
president said that although the political parties in Taiwan are
allowed to hold different views about internal affairs and public
policies, they must stand together in their determinations to defend
the nation's security and diplomatic interests.</P>
      <P>In response to questions raised regarding whether he has sent
representatives to Beijing to express his wishes to resume
cross-strait dialogue, Chen said that the cross-strait relationship
is not Taiwan's only option and that the public should not pay too
much heed to it.</P>
      <P>Touching on pressure by China on Taiwan in the international
community and Beijing's attempt to lure the island's diplomatic
allies to severe their ties with Taipei, Chen warned that Taiwan
people should not continue to have illusions about mainland China's
huge market as such illusions will bring nothing to the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLITICAL INFIGHTING HURTING TAIWAN: PREMIER HSIEH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Political infighting is hurting the country
and Taiwan must develop a new governing mechanism based on
inter-party cooperation to ensure political stability and sustainable
national development, Premier Frank Hsieh said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the appeal in a speech delivered at the closing
ceremony of a seminar on pluralistic society, political
reconciliation and consensus democracy.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has so far not found a way out of its domestic
political impasse, Hsieh said the nation most needs to cultivate a
culture centered on reconciliation and mutualism and develop a
coalition government or a new ruling mechanism based on inter-party
cooperation.</P>
      <P>"With our society and culture becoming ever more open, diverse
and pluralistic, we need a reconciliatory mechanism which should be
an asset, not a liability," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years, Hsieh said major domestic political
parties have been embroiled in a war of attrition, with the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First
Party using their slim majority in the legislature to boycott the
Democratic Progressive Party administration's policy initiatives at
nearly every turn.</P>
      <P>"So far, we have not found a way out of this, and the way things
are going it seems that Taiwan is on the decline, " Hsieh lamented,
adding that Taiwan's political arena will stabilize only if it can
develop a coalition government mechanism or a framework for
inter-party cooperation based on mutualism.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, inter-party reconciliation and cooperation
should be based on four principles -- equality, ground rules, a
reasonable distribution of resources and basic mutual trust.</P>
      <P>Hsieh pointed out that ideological confrontation and conflict of
interests have been the greatest obstacles to inter-party
reconciliation and cooperation. For instance, bills related to
taxation reform, cancellation of income tax exemptions for military
servicemen and public elementary and junior high school teachers and
a minimum tax system have been stonewalled in the legislature because
of opposition from vested interests.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ruling party may lose power one day and an
opposition party may come to power, Hsieh said the establishment of a
viable, efficient governing mechanism is very important.</P>
      <P>While crafting a "good governance" system, Hsieh said it is
imperative to maintain neutrality in judicial and educational systems
as well as within the police and media.</P>
      <P>Hsieh further said political parties and social groups should
adopt a win-win mentality or a mutualistic spirit in dealing with
each other instead of attempting to destroy each other.</P>
      <P>"During my tenure as mayor of Kaohsiung, my approval rating rose
from 28 percent to 82 percent over a period of six years. Whenever my
approval rating rose, the approval rating of the Kaohsiung City
Council went up too, and vice versa," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WANTS RECONCILIATION AND NOT CONFRONTATION WITH CHINA: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government is willing
to cooperate with China through consultations at any time to improve
cross-Taiwan Strait ties, a high-ranking official of the
Cabinet-level Mainland affairs Council (MAC) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairman Joseph Wu made the remarks at a forum on peace and
development on the two sides of Taiwan Strait organized by the
Ketagalan Institute, an academy founded by President Chen Shui-bian
in 2003 to cultivate future leaders of the country.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that the biggest problems in cross-strait affairs are
the lack of political consensus within Taiwan and the lack of
understanding of the island by China.</P>
      <P>"China still harbors a great deal of hostility toward Taiwan, and
is making many barriers in cross-strait negotiations," Wu went on.</P>
      <P>Noting that there are potential risks in China, such as the
increasing gap between the rich and the poor, Wu said that the
Chinese authorities may tighten controls on the media and may misuse
nationalism.</P>
      <P>As a result, internal conflicts in China may cause anti-Taiwanese
sentiments on the mainland, bringing serious negative impacts to
Taiwanese entrepreneurs at a time when they have made investments
worth more than NT$100 billion (US$3 billion) on the mainland, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan business people make a total of three million visits to
China annually, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>Despite China's barriers to consultations and negotiations, the
ROC government still insists on its principle of "goodwill
reconciliation, active cooperation and lasting peace" in dealing with
China.</P>
      <P>The government on Taiwan is encouraging more Chinese people to
visit Taiwan to better understand the island, as evidenced by the
implementation of the "mini three links" between Taiwan's outlaying
islands and some Chinese ports, allowing Chinese people to visit
Taiwan for sightseeing tours, the opening of cross-strait charter
flight services for Taiwanese businessmen to return home for the
Chinese New Year holiday, allowing Chinese journalists to be
stationed on Taiwan, as well as frequent educational and cultural
exchanges between the two sides, Wu said.</P>
      <P>"We are hoping to sow the seeds of democracy in China through the
series of opening measures," Wu went on.</P>
      <P>In response to the concern expressed by the students of the
Ketagalan Institute over the frequent visits by Taiwan's opposition
lawmakers to China, Wu claimed that the visits are good if they are
made for the benefit of the country.</P>
      <P>However, Wu said some politicians are visiting China or other
countries criticizing the leaders of Taiwan, and these people and
such visits should be held up to public scrutiny.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRODUCTION IN SOUTHERN TAIWAN SCIENCE PARK MAY TOP NT$300 BILLION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan, southern Taiwan, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The production value in the
Southern Taiwan Science Park is expected to reach NT$300 billion
(US$9.04 billion) by the end of this year, Southern Taiwan Science
Park Administration Director-General Dai Chien said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Dai noted that since the establishment of the park in 1998, its
production has almost doubled annually, with the value reaching
NT$259 billion last year.</P>
      <P>In only the first eight months of this year, the production value
in the park totaled NT$208 billion, Dai said, adding that the number
of employees in the park tops 40,000.</P>
      <P>The optoelectronics industry has become the backbone of the park.</P>
      <P>According to Dai, the park administration has approved the
investments of 48 optoelectronics enterprises in the science park,
including domestic optoelectronics giants such as Chi Mei Group and
companies from the United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>With the complete supplier chain in the optoelectronics industry,
the production value of the industry is expected to reach NT$200
billion by the end of this year, becoming the largest optoelectronics
bloc on the island.</P>
      <P>In addition, Dai went on, the Southern Taiwan Science Park has
created many records in the country, such as being the science park
with fastest growth rate in production value, the largest with most
complete planning, the best integration among TFT-LCD manufacturers,
producing the largest size TFT-TVs in Taiwan, and the park with the
largest number of eight-inch and 12-inch wafer manufacturers.</P>
      <P>The Southern Taiwan Science Park can be considered the largest
optoelectronics bloc in the world, Dai noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP 'YOUNG TURKS' PUSH FOR 'NEW DPP MOVEMENT'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of reform-minded thirty-something
politicians in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) are
planning to launch a "new DPP movement" to push the party to
resurrect its core values through soul-searching and innovation.</P>
      <P>Luo Wen-chia, a core member of the group who is running for
Taipei County magistrate, said Saturday during a campaign rally that
a spate of recent negative news events, including controversies
surrounding the Kaohsiung rapid transit system construction project,
have prompted him and several young like-minded DPP members to call
for intraparty self-reflection.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP grew from an opposition movement against the
Kuomintang's corrupt authoritarian rule, Luo said the DPP should
never forget its core values of "freedom, democracy, fairness and
justice" and should make every possible effort to realize them now
that it is in power.</P>
      <P>"The DPP has been known for its courage to accept criticism, make
self-examinations and pursue reform and innovation. We have still
three years to go in power. We must adjust our priority goals with
more emphasis given to promoting fairness and social justice, " said
Luo, who once served as a legislator and chairman of the Hakka
Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>The results of a string of opinion polls show that the DPP's
approval rating has been on the decline after the Aug. 21 riot by
Thai laborers working for the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit system to
protest what they perceived as unreasonable treatment from their
Taiwan management, Luo lamented.</P>
      <P>In his view, Luo said, the incident has tarnished the DPP's image
as a reform-centric ruling party.</P>
      <P>"Crisis usually implies changes and opportunities. When we come
under social criticism, it's time for us to make self-examinations, "
Luo said.</P>
      <P>Claiming that senior DPP officials have tried to shift the blame
instead of soul-searching, Luo said he and former DPP Legislator Tuan
Yi-kang and several other thirty-something DPP aspirants decided to
launch a "new DPP movement" to press for a resurrection of the
party's core values and live up to public expectations.</P>
      <P>Luo said the proposal will be put forth for discussion at the
party's national congress to be held later this month. The DPP
congress was originally scheduled for Sunday but was postponed
indefinitely due to the approach of Typhoon Longwang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN TOURS UAE SCENIC SPOTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Abu Dhabi,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By S.J. Tsai and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian telephoned
Premier Frank Hsieh from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) again
Saturday to call for contingency preparations as Typhoon Longwang is
forecast to make a direct hit on the center of Taiwan Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived in the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi from the Caribbean
nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines Friday for a one-day transit
visit en route back to Taiwan after a five-nation diplomatic tour to
Central America and the Caribbean.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General James Huang, who is
accompanied Chen on his current tour, said Chen first called Hsieh
Friday night and gave Hsieh another phone call Saturday morning while
touring Al Ain, the UAE's second biggest city located some 160
kilometers away from Abu Dhabi.</P>
      <P>"President Chen is concerned about pre-typhoon contingency
preparations, " Huang said, adding that Chen has also asked Vice
President Annette Lu by phone to visit the Central Disaster
Prevention and Relief Center to convey his regards to all emergency
relief staff there.</P>
      <P>Chen toured the Abu Dhabi downtown districts Saturday morning in
the company of UAE officials. Accompanied by the UAE tourism
minister, Chen traveled to Al Ain by helicopter to tour an old royal
palace.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Chen will also travel to Dubai, the most
prosperous city in the UAE.</P>
      <P>Chen and his entourage are scheduled to return to Taipei Sunday.
Asked whether the schedule will be affected by Typhoon Longwang,
Huang said it's up to China Airlines (CAL) to decide whether the
flight scheduled should be adjusted because of the storm.</P>
      <P>During an informal meeting with Taiwan reporters covering his
current journey earlier in the day, President Chen said his transit
stop in Abu Dhabi is an utterly significant event as many members of
his entourage, including Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh and
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen, would hold talks with their
UAE counterparts on the strengthening of economic, trade and
investment cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Chen also said he was truly moved to see ROC national flags
flying over the Abu Dhabi International Airport upon his arrival,
particularly given that China has spared not efforts to block
Taiwan's international presence.</P>
      <P>Sheikh Hamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a younger brother of UAE
President Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zahed Al Nahayan, greeted Chen upon his
arrival in the oil-rich Middle East country Friday.</P>
      <P>The UAE gave President Chen a red-carpet welcome. All of Chen's
entourage and reporters were given courtesy treatment. Sheikh Hamed
Bin Zayed Al Nahyan hosted a dinner at the hotel where Chen stays in
honor of Chen and his entourage.</P>
      <P>The UAE diplomatically recognizes Beijing, but has maintained
friendly substantive ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen made a low-profile visit to the UAE in April this
year, and Sheikh Hamed Bin Zayed, who is in charge of UAE economic
affairs, visited Taiwan in June during which time he met with
President Chen.</P>
      <P>President Chen was originally scheduled to make a transit stop in
San Francisco, but dropped the plan and flew directly from St.
Vincent and the Grenadines to Abu Dhabi.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S REPUTATION TO BE AT STAKE IF HIGH-SPEED RAIL FAILS: HSIEH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh on Saturday defended his
decision to bail out cash-strapped Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp.
(THSRC) , saying that Taiwan's international reputation will be at
stake if the nation's first high-speed railway can not be completed.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks while taping a TV talk show to be
broadcast on Chinese Television System Sunday.</P>
      <P>Opposition lawmakers have slammed Hsieh for the government's
decision to help source investments for the high-speed railway
project.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said in the taped TV talk show that the government must
step in keep the project running because if the THSRC collapses, the
government would have to be forced to buy the project out with over
NT$300 billion according to the BOT (build-operate-transfer)
contract.</P>
      <P>As the project is already 87 percent complete, Hsieh said the
government is choosing the lesser of the two evils by helping to bail
the THSRC out of its financial straits.</P>
      <P>Hsieh further said he didn't meet with THSRC Chairwoman Nita Ing
last week as media reports claimed.</P>
      <P>The premier claimed that he decided to have two
government-related foundations -- the China Aviation Development Fund
(CADF) and the China Technical Consultant Inc. (CTCI) -- invest in
the high-speed rail project -- only after he read all relevant data
and information.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 345-km high-speed railway linking Taipei in the
north and Kaohsiung in the south will form the backbone of western
Taiwan's mass rapid transportation network, Hsieh said if the project
cannot be completed smoothly, western Taiwan's development would be
affected and the people's confidence would also be dented.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Hsieh said, Taiwan's international reputation and
credibility would be at stake.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the Cabinet will set up a special task force to
strengthen supervision of the high-speed railway project.</P>
      <P>"We'll definitely ask THSRC's original shareholders to assume
responsibilities for completing the project, " Hsieh said. The
multimillion-dollar railway system is Taiwan's first infrastructure
project being built under the BOT formula in which private investors
build the system and will return control of the project to the
government after a specified period of operations.</P>
      <P>THSRC issued a press statement late Friday, saying that its last
fund-raising move before the system's scheduled inauguration next
October has been completed, with the CADF investing NT$4.5 billion
and the CTCI investing NT$3 billion.</P>
      <P>With the new funds, the THSRC's paid-in capital has increased to
NT$104.5 billion. The THSRC press release said a bank consortium will
lift its freeze on a NT$60 billion loan to the company following the
CADF and CTCI investments. As a result, it said the company will have
enough funds to ensure a smooth completion of the project.</P>
      <P>According to THSRC tallies, the company's founders (or original
shareholders) will hold a 28.52 percent stake; the government and
state-owned enterprises will jointly control a 11.89 percent stake;
foreign institutional investors will hold a 3.34 percent stake; other
institutional shareholders, including the CADF and the CTCI, will
control a 41.25 percent stake; and individual investors will have a
15 percent stake.</P>
      <P>The high-speed railway will connect eight metropolitan areas
between Taiwan's two largest cities and will be able to transport at
least 300,000 passengers daily when it becomes fully operational.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that the high-speed rail system construction
project has encountered many problems, including financing,
technology as well as legal rights and liabilities incurred by THSRC
in the course of construction, Hsieh said Saturday he feels the need
to form a special task force to make an overall evaluation and work
out response measures.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, the high-speed rail task force will comprise
transportation and financial management experts as well as
consultants familiar with Japanese affairs. THSRC reportedly has had
rifts with Japan-based Taiwan Shinkansen Consortium (TSC) , the main
contractor of the Taiwan high-speed railway's mechanical and
electrical system and the supplier of train carriages.</P>
      <P>In addition to helping address any crisis that THSRC may face,
Hsieh said the team will also cope with variables that may arise in
the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>17 THAI WORKERS MAY BE INDICTED FOR AUG. 21 RIOT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police authorities have asked the
Kaohsiung Prosecutor's Office to determine whether 17 Thai workers
should be indicted for their roles in the Aug. 21 riot at a foreign
laborers living quarter in southern Taiwan, sources said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County police said they have completed probes into the
rare mass violent case and discovered that 17 Thai laborers working
for the Kaohsiung City mass rapid transit system should be held
responsible for either obstructing performance of public duties,
endangering public safety or theft in the case.</P>
      <P>Six of the 17 alleged "masterminds" fled into hiding Sept. 30,
police said, adding that they have launched a manhunt.</P>
      <P>One of the accused, identified as Mueangjan Phon, was alleged to
have stolen about 600,000 bahts and NT$750,000 in cash from a safe at
Huapan Co.'s office at the Thai laborers' living quarters in the
southern county of Kaohsiung after the Aug. 21 riot, police said.</P>
      <P>Over 100 Thai workers rioted against what they called "unfair and
unjust" management in Kaohsiung County's Kangshan township by burning
houses, cars and facilities, and attacking police Aug. 21 night.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations showed that the incident occurred when
several Thai workers returned to their dormitory with liquor and
cigarettes, which were banned from the premises. When they were
prevented from entering the dormitory, they vented their anger by
burning houses, breaking glasses and throwing stones at the
management staff, some of whom were beaten up.</P>
      <P>The incident has tarnished Taiwan's image and led to the
resignations of acting Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chi-mai and Council
of Labor Affairs Chairwoman Chen Chu to assume political
responsibility.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S MOTHERBOARD MANUFACTURERS DIVERSIFY TO STAY COMPETITIVEBy Maubo ChangCNA Staff Writer</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Motherboard manufacturing used to be the
goose that laid the golden egg for Taiwan's electronics
manufacturers, but market saturation and differing consumer demands
has sent companies scrambling to diversify their product lines to
stay competitive.</P>
      <P>Taiwan once turned out more than 90 percent of the world's
motherboards, but has seen its output grow by only a single digit in
recent years, and local manufacturers are trying to diversify their
products to keep afloat. The percentage of revenue coming from
motherboards has dipped to less than 50 percent of major local
producers' overall incomes.</P>
      <P>IDC, a global provider of market intelligence and advisory
services for the information technology and telecommunications
industries, has forecast a 10 percent global growth in the personal
computer market this year, with an output of 195 million units,
including 130 million desktop computers, 58 million notebooks, and 64
million servers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to take the lion's share of this in light of
its huge production capacity and well-developed supply chain.</P>
      <P>However, fierce competition among manufacturers has driven down
profits significantly, and ASUS, the giant motherboard manufacturer,
has vowed to hunker down and fight hard against all competitors from
low to high-end products. It is also keeping an eye on the inroads
made by Honhai, which used to make motherboards only for well-known
brands.</P>
      <P>ASUS traditionally concentrated on the high-end market, which
presented the opportunity to make bigger profits, rather than fight
for a broad market share, but company Chairman Shih Chung-tang found
that the policy of bypassing the low-end market was taking its toll
on his company's revenues and decided to expand its market share.</P>
      <P>Citing Intel and Samsung as examples, Shih said he believes only
by leading other competitors and dominating the market can a company
survive in a business environment where profits have been cut to a
trickle.</P>
      <P>Therefore, ASUS is diversifying its products in the hope of
getting toeholds in what is commonly referred to in Chinese as "3C":
computers, communications and consumer electronics.</P>
      <P>ASUS, which already leads all competitors in the output of
motherboards, graphic cards and optical disk players, is now
aggressively expanding its capacity to manufacture notebook
computers, servers, broadband equipment, wireless broadband
communications, and mobile phones.</P>
      <P>As a result, revenues from the sale of motherboards now account
for only about 30 percent of ASUS's overall income.</P>
      <P>In response to ASUS's expansion, Giga-Byte Technology, which is
devoted to developing its own brands, decided to shift the production
of its motherboards to Honhai to cut the costs of production and make
up for its shortfalls in output capacity.</P>
      <P>As to its notebook computer business, Giga-Byte decided to spin
this unit off by setting up another company called Vimgate Network
Technology Co. and farmed out its production to other large
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Micro-Star International, which used to manufacture motherboards
for other brands, is now developing its own MEGA brand of MP3 PMPs,
notebooks and other consumer electronic devices. The company is
expected to turn out 1.5 million MP3 players, and 300,000 to 400,000
notebooks this year, which would represent a significant growth over
the previous year.</P>
      <P>EGS, which is also a contracted motherboard manufacturer, is
helping its clients, mainly middle- and small-sized computer
manufacturers, to diversify their products. The company has won
orders from Walmart in the United States and Haier in China, and is
cooperating with Lenovo in producing servers.</P>
      <P>As the world's production of motherboards is increasingly
concentrate in a few giant producers, and the profit margins are
small, many manufacturers that lack sufficient economies of scale
have to change or alter their products or face the possibility of
being swallowed up by bigger producers.</P>
      <P>Even those who have tried to survive by diversifying their
products may still suffer big losses with the new lines. Infinity,
which ventured into the manufacture of ACPs, is one of only a few
success stories. Their new products have increased its profits in the
first half of this year 4.5 times and are expected to account for 70
percent of its whole-year revenues this year.</P>
      <P>Another motherboard manufacturer, SOYO, which was renamed Wonten
Technology Co. after being taken over by new management, has also
turned the corner after it began to produce hyper-linkers and won
orders from AMP, which is a subsidy of hyper-linker giant TYCO.</P>

Senate President Franklin Drilon yesterday appealed for calm and

President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo or to topple her through
unconstitutional means."

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: Cory-Drilon plot bared 

IT is a plot supposedly calling for President Macapagal-Arroyo to
be ousted in a coup d'etat and no less than former President Corazon
Aquino and Senate President Franklin Drilon are allegedly behind it.

    <DATELINE>Bali,  Indonesia,  Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian made an unexpected stopover Sunday on the Indonesian resort
island of Bali following one-day stop in the United Arab Emirates on
his way back from a 12-day diplomatic tour of Central America and the
Caribbean.</P>
      <P>Chen's plane, which had been scheduled to land at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan at 9: 40 a.m.
Sunday, made the detour due to the closure of the airport because of
Typhoon Longwang which made landfall in Taiwan Sunday morning.</P>
      <P>Chen and his entourage were greeted by ROC Representative to
Jakarta Lin Yung-lo and a group of Taiwan expatriates after his plane
touched down at the airport in Tuban, Bali at 10 a.m. local time.</P>
      <P>The president's arrival came one day after a series of bomb
blasts ripped through three crowded restaurants on the resort island,
killing at least 32 people. The blasts are widely believed to be the
work of terrorists.</P>
      <P>After being greeted at the airport, Chen was whisked away to a
nearby hotel for rest. Journalists accompanying the president on his
trip were warned not to leave their hotel rooms because of the
uncertain situation following the bomb blasts.</P>
      <P>Chen's unscheduled stop in Bali comes on the heels of an
unannounced stopover in the United Arab Emirates' capital of Abu
Dhabi following his five-nation visit to Central America and the
Caribbean.</P>
      <P>The president's plane departed Abu Dhabi at 8 p.m. Saturday for
Taiwan but then turned southward toward Bali over the city of
Bangkok, Thailand when it ran into heavy turbulence.</P>
      <P>The president's deputy chief of staff, James Huang, who is a
member of his entourage, didn't explain why Bali was chosen as the
stopover destination, only saying that "it was a decision made after
careful consideration."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in Taipei, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman
Michel Lu thanked Indonesian authorities for allowing the president
to take refuge in Bali from the typhoon despite the absence of formal
diplomatic ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Chen is expected to stay in Bali for eight hours before heading
back to Taiwan. His plane is scheduled to arrive at CKS Airport at 11
p.m. Sunday night.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP MISSED GOOD CHANCE TO FORM COALITION GOVERNMENT: KMT OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The executive director of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Central Policy Committee said Sunday that the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) missed a good opportunity to form
a coalition government late last year when the "pan-blue alliance" of
the KMT, People First Party (PFP) and New Party won a majority of
legislative seats.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan was responding to Premier Frank Hsieh's comments
Saturday that Taiwan might have to establish a mechanism for forming
a coalition government as there has been no way out of the current
political impasse. The Cabinet's major bills, including those for
special budgets for critical weaponry and flood control, have been
stalled in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's spokesman, Cho Jung-tai, explained that Hsieh was hoping
the opposition parties would initiate a no-confidence motion to
dissolve the Legislative Yuan so that after elections, the majority
party, or a grand coalition of parties, could form a government by
nominating the premier who would be appointed by the president.</P>
      <P>Tseng said the DPP's minority rule has proved a failure. "The
country's Constitution says we are a dual-heads-of-government
country" whose government should be formed by the majority party or
parties in the legislature.</P>
      <P>"Instead of doing so, the DPP insisted on having a minority
government, causing itself the current embarrassment," he added.</P>
      <P>He said the ruling party should take the responsibility for the
difficulties it has encountered, not the opposition parties, adding
that "it makes no sense at all to ask the opposition to initiate a
no-confidence motion against the premier" and that "the biggest
problem for the DPP is that it must abide by the Constitution."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Longwang barreled through Taiwan
Sunday morning, killing one person and injuring 36 others as well as
cutting electricity to some 740,000 households.</P>
      <P>The center of the strong typhoon, packing gusts of up to 60
meters per second, made landfall in Hualien, eastern Taiwan at about
5 a.m. Sunday. It moved off the island near Chiayi in western Taiwan
at about 10 a.m., according to the Central Weather Bureau.</P>
      <P>Hualien, which bore the brunt of the storm, recorded gusts of
64.9 meters per second, or 230 kilometers per hour -- a record high
in 45 years in Taiwan. Thirty-four people in the eastern county were
injured, with one person later dying of his wounds. Over 200 power
line poles and one pylon were knocked down in the storm, leaving
140,000 households in the county without power.</P>
      <P>The streets of Hualien City were littered with fallen trees and
broken branches and debris from falling billboards and other
structures Sunday morning. </P>
      <P>Among the 750,000 households which suffered a power outage in the
typhoon, 430,000 saw their power restored by Sunday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Longwang also brought heavy downpours, with some mountainous
areas seeing up 708 millimeters of rainfall in just 14 hours from
midnight Saturday.</P>
      <P>Because of the Central Mountain Range, the typhoon lost strength
as it moved across the island, being downgraded to a medium typhoon
by Sunday afternoon.</P>
      <P>As of 2 p.m. Sunday, the center of Longwang was located 50 km
north of the Penghu island, moving westward at a speed of 14 km per
hour. Taiwan proper is expected to be free of the typhoon's influence
by midnight Sunday.</P>
      <P>Because of the typhoon, the island's airports were closed to all
domestic and international flights until 3 p.m. Sunday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP MAKES COMPROMISE PROPOSAL REGARDING NCC MEMBER SELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a bid to break an impasse over the naming
of National Communications Commission (NCC) members, the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) made a concession Sunday by
proposing that a "review group" for recommending NCC members be
formed in accordance with the percentage of seats in the legislature
held by each political party.</P>
      <P>William C.T. Lai, secretary-general of the DPP legislative
caucus, said the ad hoc "review group" is a Kuomintang (KMT) idea for
selecting members of the Control, Examination and Judicial Yuans.</P>
      <P>Since his proposal is based on the KMT idea, Lai said the KMT and
its "pan-blue alliance" allies -- the People First Party (PFP) and
the New Party -- have no reason to oppose it.</P>
      <P>If the idea works, the nominees recommended by the multi-party
"review group" would be selected by the premier for approval by the
Legislative Yuan, Lai said.</P>
      <P>As the DPP has made a concession over the long-stalled NCC member
selection, it hopes the opposition "pan-blue alliance" will
reciprocate by giving up the KMT's intention of keeping the
Broadcasting Corporation of China in its control.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT Central Policy
Committee, said the KMT legislative caucus would not accept Lai's
proposal as the party still thinks appointing NCC members according
to the "parties' proportional representation system" is the best
idea.</P>
      <P>Both the KMT and PFP fear the government will try to "meddle" in
the NCC's operations if its membership does not reflect the strength
of each of the parties in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Sun Ta-chien, deputy convener of the PFP legislative caucus, said
the opposition actually has been forced to adopt "the most stringent
rules" to stop the government from interfering in NCC operations
because the DPP government "has set too many examples of
anti-democratic practices."</P>
      <P>As an alternative, Sun said the opposition's version of the NCC
composition rules clearly excludes anyone from becoming a member who
has in the previous year held a public office, a party job, or even
merely run for an elected office on a party ticket.</P>
      <P>He said that if the DPP cannot put forth a better proposal than
the "review committee, " a show-down vote in the legislature over the
NCC organic bill will be unavoidable.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union, a minority party in the "pan-green
camp" with the DPP, opposes both the "pan-blue alliance's" party
representation idea and the DPP's "review committee" idea, saying
both ideas harbinger "legislative intrusion in executive branch
power" and would create constitutional chaos.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOP WATER MANAGER OPTS AGAINST OPENING OF PINGLIN INTERCHANGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Water Co. Chairman Hsu Hsiang-kun
said Monday that from the pure water conservation perspective, he
would opt against the opening of an interchange linking the village
of Pinglin in Taipei County with the Peiyi Freeway.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Hsu said he would
suggest that the administration not give the green light to the
opening of the Pinglin interchange if the country is resolute in
protecting a good water catchment area and the nearby natural
environment.</P>
      <P>Hsu made the remarks in response to a question from opposition
Kuomintang Legislator Lai Shyh-bao regarding whether it would be
better for the environment that the Pinglin interchange not be
opened. The interchange would make it easy for visitors to access by
car Pinglin, a quiet village at the center of the catchment area of
the Feitsuei Reservoir -- the major reservoir supplying running water
to Taipei City and Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The issue of whether the Pinglin interchange should be opened has
been the heart of political tug of war which has escalated from the
local level to the national level over the past several months as
opening the interchange would obviously boost Pingling's tourist
numbers and consequently promote commercial development there,
inevitably leading to pollution of the reservoir.</P>
      <P>Because of Pinglin's location in a catchment area, its commercial
development is severely restricted -- to the great displeasure of
many of its residents who hope the interchange linking the village
and the Peiyi Freeway will boost the local economy.</P>
      <P>Their desire has won the sympathy of Chen Din-nan, a former
justice minister who quit his post earlier this year to run in the
year-end election for the magistracy of Yilan County which is where
the Peiyi Freeway ends.</P>
      <P>Chen wrote to Minister of Transportation and Communications Lin
Ling-san and Environmental Protection Administration Minister Chang
Kow-lung, asking them to open the interchange to facilitate the
development of Yilan and Pinglin.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications decided Sept.
16 to allow a maximum of 4,000 vehicles to use the interchange
through Pinglin per day, but the move only prompted traffic jams
because too many vehicles wanted to use the interchange.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Monday lauded
Taiwan's small and medium-sized enterprises for their outstanding
performance, saying they are a foundation for helping Taiwan compete
with other countries in the "knowledge economy" of the 21st century.</P>
      <P>Chen, who returned Sunday from a 13-day visit to Taiwan's
diplomatic allies in Central America and the Caribbean, made the
comments while addressing the opening of Taiwan's first national
small and medium-sized enterprises development conference, which is
being held at the International Conference Center in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The two-day conference, which has been organized by the Ministry
of Economic Affairs, is aimed at helping the island's SMEs to respond
effectively to the challenges posed by the changing international
economic environment.</P>
      <P>Saying that Taiwan's SMEs are dynamic and innovative and can
quickly adapt to changing situations, the president noted that
according to the government's "Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises
White Paper 2005, " the island has more than 1.164 million SMEs,
employing some 7.55 million people and generating total gross revenue
of more than NT$9.35 trillion.</P>
      <P>"This shows that SMEs are not only a foundation for the island's
economic development, but also one of the most important forces in
terms of social stability and job creation," he further said.</P>
      <P>As the growth of the knowledge economy and globalization are
major economic trends, Taiwan's SMEs should cluster together and
promote innovation, Chen continued, promising that the government
will continue to pour more resources into helping boost the SMEs'
global competitiveness and developing the island's economy.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's economy is filled with creativity, dynamism and
competitiveness, the president said that "although we cannot be
complacement about this, it doesn't hurt to give ourselves some
applause and encouragement."</P>
      <P>Noting that the strength of Taiwan's SMEs helped shield the
island to a large extent from the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the
president said that in order to maintain Taiwan's international
competitveness, the island must continue to work to promote the
superiority and dynamism of its small and medium-sized enterprises.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LABOR COUNCIL TO RELAX RESTRICTIONS ON IMPORT OF CAREGIVERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Medical authorities will professionally
assess whether long-term medical care is needed to warrant the
employment of a foreign caregiver in an attempt to loosen
restrictions on who can import labor, the head of the Council of
Labor Affairs (CLA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>CLA Chairman Lee Ying-yuan also said that the council will scrap
the Barthel index used to determine whether a local family can hire a
foreign caregiver. The Barthel index assesses the degree of
disability in a particular individual. From now on, certificates
issued by medical authorities will be the main criterion.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he has already contacted the Department of Health
(DOH) and that medical authorities will make the decision on who will
require long-term care.</P>
      <P>As for which medical sector will have the final say, and whether
doctors, nurses and social workers will form an assessment team to
decide on the matter, this will be left for the DOH to conclude, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, he said, the new review system will be put into place
as soon as possible to remedy the situation of people with seriously
ill family members having to cajole doctors into fudging medical
reports so that they can qualify to employ a foreign caregiver.</P>
      <P>Lee also said that the CLA will provide training to local people
wishing to be caregivers and advertise for local workers when the
need arises. The council is also studying the feasibility of
subsidizing locals wishing to hire Taiwanese to work as caregivers,
he added, with social welfare authorities acting as middlemen between
the local people and employers.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, if no local people come forward within two weeks
of an advertised position, then the CLA will open the vacancies to
foreign caregivers, Lee added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S FOUNDRY INDUSTRY REMAINS STRONG DESPITE GLOBAL COMPETITIONBy S.C. ChangCNA Staff Reporter</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.
(TMSC) and United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC), the world's leading
contract chip makers, will remain strong and competitive in spite of
rising competition from such ambitious foreign competitors as Grace
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (GSMC) and Semiconductor
Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC) of China, Chartered
Semiconductor (CS) of Singapore, Samsung Electronics of South Korea,
and IBM of the United States.</P>
      <P>Analysts say the key to Taiwan's foundry strength is the two
leading companies' technological leadership and financial strength
that have helped them maintain their edge in the highly competitive
market.</P>
      <P>Huang Chun-hsun, a research fellow at Industrial Technology
Research Institute, said the biggest asset for TSMC and UMC is their
accumulation of technological know-how and investor capital. Each of
them has some NT$100 billion (US$3 billion) in cash, far surpassing
that of their key competitors. And they have managed to keep
manufacturing processes at least one generation ahead of their
rivals, meaning that the two foundries are basically in a secure
position in the world market, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>TSMC and UMC faced threats from GSMC and SMIC which, with the
help of the Chinese government and their foreign partners, have been
rapidly expanding their production capabilities and chipping away at
the market shares of the Taiwan makers. Still, TSMC and UMC's joint
market share in 2005 is forecast to remain at about 70 percent, with
TSMC keeping the top spot.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foundry giants are facing unusual pressure for their
fourth quarter revenues because of the low-price strategy adopted by
SMIC and CS as the recovery of the global semiconductor industry has
been slower than expected and heavyweight IC designing houses have
been unable to bring down their inventory levels, triggering market
worries that IC designers will reduce their orders to manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Both TSMC and UMC have worked aggressively to maintain their
competitive edge by upgrading their technology. In this regard, TSMC
announced in Dec. 2004 that it was using the industry-leading Nexsys
90 nanometer process in volume production for such leading companies
as Altera Corp. and Qualcomm Inc., the only foundry process to
feature copper interconnect, low-k dielectrics, and 12-inch wafer
production.</P>
      <P>In April this year, TSMC unveiled another latest semiconductor
manufacturing process -- the 65 nm Nexsys Technology for SoC Design
-- at a symposium attended by over 400 of the industry's leading
companies, and said its first wafers to be produced by this process
are expected in December 2005. The new technology allows designers to
build logic devices with double the density of the company's industry
leading 90 nm technology, enabling market movers across the IC
industry to save significant costs.</P>
      <P>UMC, for its part, also announced its leadership in the 90
nanometer manufacturing process, an achievement that has won it big
orders from such IC designing firms as TI, ATi, nVidia, and Qualcomm.
In late August, UMC said it had reached a "milestone" of having
shipped over 100,000 customer wafers using the 90-nm process
technology, becoming a leader in terms of the total number of 90-nm
wafers shipped as well as in revenue generated from 90-nm sales.</P>
      <P>As TSMC enjoys high satisfaction from such key IC designing
houses as TI, ATi, nVidia, Microsoft, Freescale, Sony and Altera, it
is quite unlikely that it will lose major orders to UMC, market
analysts said.</P>
      <P>TSMC's prowess was proved when it received the 2005 Outstanding
Nanotech Award, the first in Taiwan's history, on Sept. 21. It was
honored for its successful production of fully functional 90-nm
devices using immersion lithography tools and its development of
65-nanometer technology.</P>
      <P>TSMC Senior Vice President for R&amp;D S.Y. Chiang, when receiving
the award on behalf of his company, repeated TSMC's vision to be the
"most advanced, innovative and largest provider of foundry services
and in partnership with its customers." He estimated that in 2006,
TSMC's 90-nm orders could top NT$50 billion (US$1.5 billion).</P>
      <P>TSMC and UMC's technological lead was further proved when nVidia
withdrew all its orders from IBM, which launched an aggressive
campaign to wrestle orders from the two Taiwan manufacturers in 2003,
and directed them all back to TSMC and UMC. TSMC has started volume
production of nVidia's orders in the third quarter of this year using
the 90-nm process, and UMC is set to start volume production of
nVidia orders in the first quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>TSMC's R&amp;D efforts are producing another likely result for 2006
and beyond: merging IC process technology with microelectromechanical
systems (MEMS) , a platform whose market value researchers estimate
will grow from US$8 billion this year to US$14 billion by 2009.</P>
      <P>According to an Electronic Engineering Times report, if TSMC
succeeds in integrating the IC and MEMS design processes, it will be
a major step forward for MEMS designers. The company's larger
resources would not only improve economies of scale, but also bring a
standard infrastructure to the table, the EE Times noted.</P>
      <P>Analysts said Taiwan foundries can also use their technological
and capital resources in a marketing strategy that would "scare away"
potential rivals. For example, they can wage a price war over a
certain customer or a specific manufacturing process, or even over a
production capacity project.</P>
      <P>And they will be able to do so because their capital base is
sound enough for them to generate cash that will be used to acquire
new equipment and invest in R&amp;D, boosting their production capacity
and competitiveness. As a TSMC official told CNA, his company will
begin 65 nm production by the end of this year, and start volume
production next year, again as a global leader.</P>
      <P>To be sure, competition for attracting investment and developing
new technologies will continue in the high-tech industry, and TSMC
and UMC will never run short of aspiring competitors in the foundry
industry. The two's operations will be affected by old and new rivals
in the market. Long-term prospects for the two leading companies look
good as they are likely to maintain their technological and financial
edges over competitors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ONLY WINNERS IN FRUIT EXPORTS TO CHINA ARE COUNTERFEITERS: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Monday said that
the only winners in Taiwan's fruit exports that are not supervised by
the government to China are those who are now profiting from Taiwan's
name while selling " counterfeit" produce on the mainland.</P>
      <P>The president asked farmers to trust that the administration has
their best interests at heart and to support the government's stand
on Taiwan fruit exports to China.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a training workshop for officials in farmers and
fishermen's associations, Chen said that since certain Taiwan fruits
have been allowed duty-free treatment by China, copycats have been
spotted on the market in the mainland under the guise of "grown in
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The president said that after the initial fascination by the
public in China for Taiwan-grown fruits and the local advocacy of the
move to export by some opposition parties and special interest
groups, the only ones who are reaping long-term benefits are the
Chinese counterfeiters -- not Taiwan farmers.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the counterfeiting issue, which is cause for a
major trade dispute, cannot be sorted out simply by opposition
politicians or a few private farmers' representatives, adding that
domestic farmers should listen to the government and support its
stance on Taiwan fruit exports to China.</P>
      <P>The government's stance is that Taiwan does not oppose local
farmers exporting fruit to China, Chen said, but that officials from
the two sides should first talk on matters regarding the shipments,
including tariff tables, quarantine regulations and customs
inspections.</P>
      <P>The government feels that these exports should be conducted in an
orderly and transparent manner so that the farmers' maximum long-term
interests can be ensured, Chen argued.</P>
      <P>Quoting a recent media report from Beijing that said that 90
percent of " Taiwan fruit" currently found on Beijing store shelves
are "counterfeit, " Chen wondered how opposition politicians and the
few private farmers' representatives would be able to handle this
kind of trade dispute.</P>
      <P>China began to allowed duty-free imports of fruits from Taiwan in
early August as a response to former Taiwan opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan's high-profile visit to China in spring. Chen said
this was a move by China to give the impression internationally that
it is apeace-loving country on the one hand and to lure Taiwan's
opposition politicians and civic groups into the Chinese fold on the
other.</P>
      <P>Without the government's supervision and assistance, Taiwan
farmers have begun to ship their fruits to the mainland, Chen said.
Now that their fruits have been hijacked by those profiting from
Taiwan's name while selling non-Taiwan-grown produce, where should
the farmers who trusted the opposition turn to now?</P>
      <P>Chen urged farmers to stop this risky way of selling, asking that
they cooperate with the government to boost Taiwan's fruits exports
to other places beyond China, such as Japan, Singapore, Europe and
the United States, markets where people observe the rule of law.</P>

    <TEXT>The Straits
Times: Suicide bombers behind Bali blasts.

The bombings in Bali were the deadly work 
of three suicide bombers who calmly walked into 
restaurants at a peak weekend dinner hour, police
said yesterday.

Wearing backpacks, they detonated their
explosives amid crowds of revellers, sparking
horrific scenes of carnage.

The Lianhe Zaobao: Indonesia President: Bali
bombings may be work of suicide bombers.

Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono

    <HEADLINE>KMT DENIES IT WILL 'CONDITIONALLY' AGREE WITH ARMS PURCHASE BUDGET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus
denied a newspaper report Monday that their party will
"conditionally" refer the Executive Yuan's budget bill for a U.S.
arms purchase to a committee of the Legislative Yuan for review.</P>
      <P>KMT caucus whip Tseng Yung-chuan said the United Daily News
report is baseless.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the deputy chief of the KMT caucus, Legislator Pan
Wei-kang, said she has not been informed of any changes to the KMT's
approach to the budget bill, a matter that should be taken up by the
caucus rather than KMT authorities.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Shuai Hua-ming, who is named by the United Daily
News as a member of a panel that recommended the party to give a
"conditional" green light to the budget bill at the end of this year,
said the idea disclosed by the newspaper "is quite good."</P>
      <P>However, the KMT's political ally in the legislature, the People
First Party (PFP), which is firmly against the budget bill, reacted
angrily to the report.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Sun Ta-chien said at a news conference Monday that
the report vindicates his party's long-standing fear that the KMT
could betray its followers and the PFP by softening its opposition to
the budget.</P>
      <P>Noting that the KMT administration accumulated NT$2 trillion
(US$60.18 billion) in government debt in its nearly five decades of
rule up to 2000, Sun said the debt has grown to nearly NT$5 trillion
(US$150.31 billion) under the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration in just five years, and his party will never agree to
the arms purchase.</P>
      <P>The DPP government plans to purchase eight diesel-electric
submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six
Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries from the United States.</P>
      <P>There has been speculation that the KMT had softened its
opposition to the bill under pressure from the U.S. government and in
consideration of the fact that the Ministry of National Defense
agreed in September to list the financing for the Patriot
anti-missile batteries in the regular budget, causing the proposed
special budget in the bill to drop to NT$340 billion.</P>
      <P>Sun reiterated his party's line against the purchase of the
Patriot anti-missile batteries, claiming that the purchase has
already been rejected in a referendum held in conjunction with the
2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Also, Sun said his party opposed the purchase of 12 P3-C
anti-submarine airplanes and eight submarines through a special
budget, which will be financed mainly by government loans.</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Hsieh Kung-ping said the party would regret the
news, if it were true, that the KMT has backpedaled on its opposition
to the arms purchase budget bill.</P>
      <P>If the KMT believes the public does not want to see the budget
killed, the spokesman said, "The Kuomintang should come out in favor
of the budget now rather than reverse its stance after the year-end
elections so that the public can make its voice known through the
ballot box."</P>
      <P>Ironically, the PFP spokesman's views were shared by its
political rival, the DPP.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whip William Lai dared the KMT to ask its
members in the Rules Committee of the Legislative Yuan to let the
budget be referred to the Defense Committee for review immediately if
the party feels that the people wish to see the budget approved.</P>
      <P>"Defense issues are above partisan interests, and the KMT should
deal with these with the public interest in mind rather than being
hold hostage by the PFP," Lai said.</P>
      <P>The KMT and PFP command a slim majority in the legislature and
have joined hands in the Rules Committee to block the budget bill 30
times in the last two years.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News said in a story Monday that the KMT under
newly elected chairman Ma Ying-jeou is mulling softening its
opposition to parry the DPP's criticism that it opposes the arms
purchase budget simply because it is an opposition party.</P>
      <P>Under the KMT's plan, the paper said, it should favor the
purchase of anti-submarine aircraft and submarines as long as they
are financed by the Defense Ministry's regular budget, but not the
purchase of Patriot missiles before the Executive Yuan comes up with
explanations to bypass the referendum result. However, the paper
said, the KMT cannot afford to part ways with the PFP now when it
still needs the latter's cooperation in the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the paper said, the KMT is planning to modify its
approach to the budget after the year-end elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT'S POSITION ON CONTROL YUAN ISSUE NOT CHANGED: KMT OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) has never wavered
from wanting President Chen Shui-bian to renominate members of the
Control Yuan, the KMT Central Policy Coordination Committee chief
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yuang-chuan, also a legislator, noted that the alliance did
not even consider spending time looking over the list to approve only
half the names nominated for the country's supreme watchdog body, and
leaving the rest to be dealt with by the next president in 2008.</P>
      <P>Tseng made the remarks after a Monday news report said that the
KMT has mapped out two proposals as part of its efforts to find ways
out of the Constitutional deadlock that has since Feb. 1 stopped the
function of the Control Yuan in supervising government operations.</P>
      <P>Before the Control Yuan underwent its regular personnel
change-over Feb. 1, President Chen presented a list of nominations
for the new president, vice president and 27 members of the
institution for the approval of the opposition-controlled Legislative
Yuan in line with the Constitution. However, the legislature has
declined to screen the list and has instead asked the president to
come up with a new list by claiming that most of the nominees are not
up to the expectations of the public.</P>
      <P>Chen stuck to his guns, insisting that such a request infringes
upon his power of nomination, which is enshrined in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Tseng stated that to ensure the Control Yuan's independence, both
the KMT and PFP suggested last week the formation of a
"recommendation" panel based on the proportions of political parties
in the legislature, and that the president should make his
nominations from a list of the panel-recommended persons.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" believes that such a process would ensure
a highly political consensus on the nominations, Tseng said, adding
that the KMT caucus in the Legislative Yuan will also push for an
amendment to the law to lift the ceiling of the number of legislators
in approving the Control Yuan nominees from 50 percent to two-thirds
of the 225 legislative seats.</P>

      <P>Google's listing of Taiwan as a "province of

popular search engine in protest.</P>
      <P>At a news conference, TSU legislators Huang Shih-cho, Tseng

China's pressure. Taiwan is not a province of China, they claimed,

      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
said Monday that a meeting between the Legislative and the Executive
Yuans could be one of the options to solve the impasse in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks amid reports that the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , out of the concern that numerous bills are
being stonewalled in the legislature because of constant bickering
between the ruling and opposition parties, had suggested that Wang
and Premier Frank Hsieh invite the legislative caucus whips across
the party spectrum to meet.</P>
      <P>The DPP said that the consultations will be of a "political
nature" to decide on which bills should be handled in this session,
the reports said.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he doesn't know if the proposal will help solve
the current impasse, but he said that if Hsieh is present at the
consultations, maybe it will be helpful to learn the DPP's stance.</P>
      <P>He said that as the president of the Legislative Yuan, he should
provide more occasions for the heads of rival parties to sit down and
talk.</P>
      <P>He also said that he will invite legislative caucuses to discuss
the proposed national communications commission (NCC) bill Tuesday,
and if there is still no result after one or two meetings, then a
vote will be unavoidable.</P>
      <P>At stake is the composition of the commission; the opposition
parties want the NCC to be comprised of members in proportion to the
number of seats each party holds in the legislature, while the DPP
insists that political parties should keep their hands off and let
experts and scholars serve on the commission, so that media freedoms
will not be affected.</P>

      <P>Speaking at the opening of a conference called to help the

      <P>Coast Guard Administration (CGA) Minister
Shi Hwei-yow vowed Monday to display Republic of China sovereignty
over the oil and gas reserves in the East China Sea by periodically
sending patrol vessels to the area, where China and Japan are locked
in a dispute over the exploitation of resources.</P>
      <P>Shi made the pledge while answering questions from lawmakers of
the main opposition Kuomintang and the People First Party Party
during an interpellation session, who expressed deep concern over
Taiwan's role amid the festering China-Japan dispute over East China
Sea oil exploration.</P>
      <P>Stating that the gas and oil reserves in the East China sea are
under ROC sovereignty, Shi said that the dispute should be resolved
through diplomatic means and promised that the CGA will dispatch

Taiwan offshore islands and two Chinese ports have played different
roles for the two sides, with passenger transport services being the
major function for Taiwan and product shipments being the main
function for China, according to government statistics.</P>
      <P>Since the direct trade and shipping links were opened between the
Taiwan-held islands of Kinmen and Matsu and the Fujian ports of
Xiamen and Mawei in January 2001, ships using the route have made a
total of 15,000 port calls at Matsu and Kinmen, with 44.3 percent
being Taiwanese vessels and 54.5 percent being Chinese ships,
according to the tallies compiled by the Cabinet-level Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>During the same period, more than 951,000 passengers traveled via
the "mini links" route, with 94 percent of them being Taiwanese,
while 2.3 million metric tons of products were handled at the Kinmen
and Matsu ports, with 2.298 million metric tons -- mainly gravel and
construction materials -- coming from China. The remaining 1 percent
of China-bound products were Kinmen-produced liquor and sugar.</P>
      <P>Over half of the visitors from China entering Kinmen and Matsu
via the "mini links" came for academic, religious or business
purposes, while the other half came for reunions with their Taiwanese
spouses or family members or for tourism.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan World Trade Center in Bangkok
opened Monday in the Thai capital, the 38th of its kind run by the
semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Center (TAITRA)
overseas.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening, TAITRA Secretary-General Chao Yung-chuan
called it a significant move that will help Taiwan businesses further
explore the Thai market based on the existing booming exchanges and
jockey for good positions in the markets of the Association for
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>Thailand's keen efforts to develop its electronics, automobile,
telecommunications and biochemical industries provide Taiwan with an
extraordinary chance to further strengthen its role in two-way
cooperation and exercise greater leverage among the ASEAN member
states, Chao said.</P>
      <P>According to Chao, Taiwan hopes to completes market deployment in
ASEAN member states through setting up world trade centers in
Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand to take advantage of the rise of an
ASEAN common market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the third-largest foreign investor in Thailand behind
the United States and Japan, TAITRA statistics show. Taiwan channeled
nearly US$6 billion in investment into Thailand last year, pushing
its total investment capital up to US$11.2 billion. There are more
than 3,000 Taiwan companies in Thailand.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also is the principal foreign investor in Vietnam, the
second-largest in Indonesia and Cambodia, the fifth-largest in
Malaysia and the sixth-largest in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Peter Cheng, representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Thailand, praised Thailand's increasing leadership role
within ASEAN and voiced his belief that the Taiwan world trade center
in Bangkok will help attract greater Taiwan investment in Thailand.</P>
      <P>Thai dignitaries, including Satit Sirrangkamannont,
secretary-general of Thailand's foreign trade and investment
promotion board, Thira Tayangno, an executive with the Bangkok Bank,

      <P>Two civic groups dedicated to improving the
nation' s media culture suggested that a mechanism be set up for
citizens and consumers to have a voice in the National Communications
Commission (NCC), which has been bogged down in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Media Watch-Taiwan and Campaign for Media Reform said a "citizens
council" made up of representatives from civic groups should have a
say when the NCC reviews an application for a license to operate a
new media or for renewing a license. In such cases, the council's
views must be considered by the NCC, the two groups said. The council
can also help the NCC answer complaints from citizens and consumers.</P>
      <P>Members of the council could come from consumer, media watch,
human rights, community and less privileged groups, said Media
Watch-Taiwan and Campaign for Media Reform.</P>
      <P>They said including such a council in the NCC would help it carry
out its missions of maintaining market order, inducing fair
competition, protecting consumer interests and promoting
multi-cultural values while avoiding inappropriate political and
business interference.</P>
      <P>As to the members of the NCC itself -- the cause of a deadlock in
the legislature -- the two groups recommended two solutions.</P>
      <P>First, keep one seat for a consumers' representative who would
sit with other professionals with humanities, education, telecom,
information, mass communications, legal and economic backgrounds. A
gender balance should also be considered for these "regular"
professional members.</P>
      <P>Second, the ceiling for partisan representatives in the NCC
should be lowered from one-half to one-quarter of the total
membership so that political controversies can be minimized.</P>
      <P>The two groups were joined by such cable news stations as TVBS
and Eastern Multimedia Group in calling for a "revolving door"
provision in the NCC organic law that would ban members from
participating in activities promoting the interests of political
parties or candidates.</P>
      <P>Members would also be banned from accepting donations from
political parties or leading research projects for the government,
political parties or candidates. They would not be able to work for
any media and within three years after leaving the NCC, they would
not be allowed to work as a board member or supervisor for a
profit-making entity the nature of whose main business is related to
the member's job at the NCC.</P>
      <P>Media Watch-Taiwan and Campaign for Media Reform said they made
the suggestions in the hope that ruling and opposition politicians
will put the public interest ahead of their partisan interests and
adopt a resolution to the impasse as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Academics also urged the "pan-blue" and "pan-green" political
elite to look at the "fundamentals of legislation, " respect
grassroots' views and talk with each other in a rational manner to
build an institution that will operate for the benefit of all.</P>
      <P>Liao Yuan-hao, professor of law at National Chengchi University,
said the "pan-blue alliance's" insistence on naming NCC members
according to the percentage of seats each party holds at the
legislature contradicts the NCC's prime goal of de-politicization.</P>
      <P>Liao suggested that one way out of the deadlock would be to have
a rule on the qualifications and criteria for candidates and
obligations of successful candidates who will be appointed by the
premier to be NCC members.</P>
      <P>Lai Hsiang-wei, assistant professor of mass communications at
Chinese Culture University, said that instead of arguing about how to
select NCC members, lawmakers should think about elevating the NCC's
status to the level of the U.S. FCC -- the Federal Communications
Commission is at the Grand Justice level in Taiwan, much higher than
the currently defined Cabinet level. An FCC-level NCC would be "truly
supra-partisan and independent, " he noted.</P>
      <P>With regard to appointing truly independent and competent NCC
members, Lai suggested that the government nominate twice the number
of candidates, half of whom would be eliminated by public polls, a
process that he said would remove "political hitmen" from the list to
be finally appointed to the NCC.</P>
      <P>Other scholars noted that a "screening and recommending
committee" could be formed by the legislature in accordance with
party proportional representation that would be charged with
selecting NCC members through secret ballot.</P>
      <P>Under such a proposal, the committee members should be experts
from the telecom and other professional industries, who will select
NCC members from a list of candidates, no more than a quarter of whom
could belong to one political party. The committee would eliminate
half of the candidates on the list put forward by the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>In view of the lack of trust among Taiwan's politicians, senior
journalist Yang Hsien-hung suggested that NCC members be decided on
by a draw. "Only those chosen by heaven can stop quarrels in the
human world," he said.</P>
      <P>Yang also suggested that NCC membership be a non-paying job with
a six-month term, during which members must not participate in any
political activity.</P>
      <P>Some others proposed the jury model used in the U.S. for
selecting NCC members, as candidates can be vetoed by either side.</P>
      <P>As the selection of members is the focus of partisan fighting,
academics suggested that more attention be paid to building a
sustainable institution by making it fair, objective and responsible.</P>
      <P>For that purpose, they said, another rule can be made to define a
procedure that must be followed by NCC members in making major
decisions, a procedure that would include cautious, neutral and
transparent public hearings. If the NCC fails to follow such a
strictly defined procedure, its decisions could be declared null and
void by a court, they added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC HEAD LASHES OUT AT OPPOSITION-PROPOSED CROSS-STRAIT BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition-proposed cross-Taiwan Strait
peace promotion bill would bypass the executive arm and plunge the
nation's democracy into difficulties, Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council Chairman Joseph Wu claimed Monday.</P>
      <P>The nation's top China policy charter made the remarks when he
received Georg Jarzembowski, chairman of a pro-Taiwan group in the
European Parliament.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that the first article of the bill proposed by the
opposition People First Party has the so-called "'92 consensus" as
its premise, an issue on which he said there is no clear agreement in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For the opposition, the "'92 consensus" means a tacit agreement
on different interpretations as to the meaning of "one China" reached
in the wake of a cross-strait meeting in Hong Kong 1992, which paved
the way for the first high-ranking meeting across the Taiwan Strait
in nearly five decades the following year.</P>
      <P>Wu said that for China, the consensus means the fleshing out of
its cherished "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>If the bill were to be passed, Taiwan politics would be thrown
into chaos immediately, he claimed, adding that the country would
then be in a very unfavorable situation faced with strong military
pressure from China.</P>
      <P>In addition, a cross-strait consultation committee would be set
up under the proposed peace promotion bill that would enjoy enormous
executive power, thus pushing the executive branch aside, Wu said.</P>
      <P>If the executive branch will not accept its resolution, it is
likely to be turned over to the judicial authorities, which Wu said
would destroy the spirit of the checks and balances mechanism between
the executive and legislative branches under the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Jarzembowski for his part expressed his vehement opposition to
the military threat posed to Taiwan by China and his opposition to
the lifting of a 16-year-old European Union arms embargo on China.</P>
      <P>He also said he was baffled to learn that Taiwan's opposition
parties have continuously obstructed the review of a major arms
procurement package from the United States, and that the
E.U. is concerned about Taiwan's defense security.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that political parties in democratic countries may
bicker over differences on domestic issues, but claimed they are in
unison when it comes to national security or foreign affairs issues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'PAN-GREEN CAMP' AGREES ON SINGLE CANDIDATE FOR KEELUNG MAYOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Wang Tuoh of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) announced Monday his decision to
bow out of the race for the Keelung mayorship and asked his
supporters to back Chen Chien-ming, the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) candidate for the post in the year-end election.</P>
      <P>Wang, a veteran lawmaker from the Keelung constituency, made the
announcement in the company of DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang and TSU
Chairman Su Chin-chiang.</P>
      <P>Wang said he would immediately stop all campaign activities and
would throw his support behind Chen's bid for the mayorship of the
northern port city.</P>
      <P>Wang's withdrawal marked a major breakthrough in the "pan-green
camp's" efforts to integrate its forces to back a single ticket for
Keelung and several other hotly contested cities and counties ahead
of the Dec. 3 "three-in-one" elections.</P>
      <P>"I have decided to quit the race in the hope that the 'pan-green
camp' of the DPP and the TSU can win the Keelung mayoral election
through unity and consolidation," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Wang's withdrawal, opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Legislator Liao Feng-teh, who concurrently heads the KMT's
organizational development department, said it remains to be seen
whether Wang's supporters will be willing to switch their support to
the TSU candidate.</P>
      <P>Liao said he believes Wang's decision to bow out was made mainly
because his support rating is low.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the results of a string of public opinion polls
show that Wang's support rating has been hovering at around 10
percent, Liao said his withdrawal from the competition was
understandable.</P>
      <P>With Wang's withdrawal, the Keelung mayoral election will be a
three-way race, with the TSU's Chen and People First Party (PFP)
standard-bearer Liu Wen-hsiung challenging incumbent Mayor Hsu
Tsai-li, a KMT stalwart.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the PFP are close allies commonly known as the
"pan-blue alliance, " but Liao said it is regrettable that the two
parties cannot come to terms on fielding a single ticket in the
upcoming Keelung mayoral election.</P>
      <P>Besides Keelung, Liao said, the KMT and the PFP will also have to
fight on their own in the races for three other constituencies --
Taichung City, Hualien County and Miaoli County.</P>
      <P>Eight years ago, DPP candidate Lee Chin-yung won the Keelung
mayorship because the "pan-blue alliance" fielded two hopefuls. Four
years later, Lee losthis re-election bid as the "pan-blue alliance"
managed to field a single ticket.</P>
      <P>Political analysts said it remains unclear whether TSU's Chen can
win the year-ened election following Wang's withdrawal. In their
views, Chen's grassroots support is not solid because he moved his
domicile to Keelung only several months ago. Other variables include
whether Wang's supporters would be willing to back Chen and whether
the "pan-blue alliance" can strike a last-ditch deal to field asingle
candidate.</P>
      <P>Previous elections showed that "pan-blue alliance" supporters
outnumbered "pan-green camp" loyalists in Keelung City.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's highest administrative court
reversed a high court decision Monday by ruling that the Taipei city
government does not have to return a disputed NT$10.8 billion it
allegedly owed to the Bureau of National Health Insurance.</P>
      <P>The bureau had sued the city government for owing the amount
between 2000 to 2002 and won a high court decision in its favor.</P>
      <P>The city government appealed, arguing that subsidies for health
care insurance should be charged on the basis of where the insured
live, not based on the addresses of the companies that employ them.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwan firms are headquartered in Taipei, but their
employees may not work in the capital city, and the local governments
are obligated to pay for the medical bills of its residents.</P>
      <P>Shuai Yu-ling, director of the city's Labor Bureau, thanked the
administrative court for handing down a fair verdict, which is final.</P>
      <P>She said the verdict exempted the city from the alleged duty of
paying for non-residents' medical bills.</P>
      <P>Health Minister Hou Sheng-mao said he was "flabbergasted" by the
court reversal but said he will respect the rule of law. He said that
if his department cannot appeal, he may request a constitutional
interpretation by the Council of Grand Justices.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIGH-SPEED RAIL TASK FORCE TO REINFORCE SUPERVISION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet's high-speed rail task force
held its first meeting Monday, with Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp.
(THSRC) Chairwoman Nita Ing delivering a report on the project's
current state.</P>
      <P>The task force was formed amid rising concerns that the nation's
first high-speed railway is not coming on line as smoothly as
scheduled.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh serves as convener of the special task force
and Vice Premier Wu Rong-i as its deputy convener. It comprises
officials from the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, the
Council for Economic Planning and Development, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the Public
Construction Commission, the Council of Labor Affairs and other
relevant government agencies.</P>
      <P>The task force's main functions include supervision of progress
in the high-speed railway construction, crisis management, crafting a
comprehensive supervisory mechanism and land development in the
vicinity of various high-speed rail stations.</P>
      <P>During Monday's meeting, Ing told the task force members that the
project is 86 percent complete and that THSRC negotiations with its
core mechanical and electrical system contractor -- the Japan-based
Taiwan Shinkansen Consortium -- will resume soon.</P>
      <P>After Ing's report, Hsieh said the THSRC should recruit more
government and state enterprises representatives as its board members
in proportion to their investment in the company. He also asked the
THSRC's three independent directors -- Lin Chen-kuo, Hu Ting-wu and
Lin Wen-yuan -- to exercise their functions and strengthen
supervision of the company's operations.</P>
      <P>The administration has come under fire recently for the its
decision to help source investments for the high-speed railway
project.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, Hsieh defended his decision to bail out
cash-strapped THSRC, saying that Taiwan's international reputation
will be at stake if the nation's first high-speed railway cannot be
completed.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the government must step in to keep the project
running because if the THSRC collapses, the government be forced to
buy the project out for over NT$300 billion, according to the BOT
(build-operate-transfer) contract.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he decided to have two government-related foundations
-- the China Aviation Development Fund (CADF) and the China Technical
Consultant Inc. (CTCI) -- invest in the high-speed rail project only
after he read all relevant data and information.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 345-km railway linking Taipei in the north and
Kaohsiung in the south will form the backbone of western Taiwan's
mass rapid transportation network, Hsieh said that if the project
cannot be completed smoothly, western Taiwan's development will be
affected and the people's confidence will be dented.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the high-speed rail task force will strengthen
supervision of the project and ask THSRC's original shareholders to
assume responsibility for completing the project.</P>
      <P>The multimillion-dollar railway system is Taiwan's first
infrastructure project being built under the BOT formula, in which
private investors build the system and return control of the project
to the government after a specified period of operations.</P>
      <P>THSRC issued a press statement late Friday saying that its last
fund-raising move before the system's scheduled inauguration next
October has been completed, with the CADF investing NT$4.5 billion
and the CTCI investing NT$3 billion.</P>
      <P>With the new funds, the THSRC's paid-in capital has increased to
NT$104.5 billion. The THSRC press release said a bank consortium will
lift its freeze on a NT$60 billion loan to the company following the
CADF and CTCI investments. As a result, it said the company will have
enough funds to ensure completion of the project.</P>
      <P>According to THSRC tallies, the company's founders (or original
shareholders) will hold a 28.52 percent stake; the government and
state-owned enterprises will jointly control an 11.89 percent stake;
foreign institutional investors will hold a 3.34 percent stake; other
institutional shareholders, including the CADF and the CTCI, will
control a 41.25 percent stake; and individual investors will have a
15 percent stake.</P>
      <P>The high-speed railway will connect eight metropolitan areas
between Taiwan's two largest cities and will be able to transport at
least 300,000 passengers daily when it becomes fully operational.</P>

Wall Street Journal: Lowering the Wall,
China Irks U.S. as It Uses Trade
To Embellish Newfound Clout

Since March, Beijing has opened free-trade
talks with South Korea, Pakistan, Australia and
Iceland. In November, it inked deals with 
Thailand, Malaysia and eight other Southeast 
Asian countries. Even though China's government 
still controls large swaths of the country's 
economy, it has sealed or is seeking free-trade 
pacts with 25 countries -- up from zero two years
ago. Having created a credible army and a boomin
g economy, China is positioning itself as a
leader of global trade and investment, rivaling
the U.S. in one of its traditional spheres of
influence. As a result, China's market clout is
making it a rallying point for countries looking
for a counterweight to the world's lone
superpower. All this is raising alarms within

    <HEADLINE>NEW IDEAS TO BE RAISED IN SUPPORT OF NEW DPP MOVEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A leader of the New Tide faction of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has said that he will
continue to pour new ideas into the party reforms that he requested
last week.</P>
      <P>Tuan Yi-kang, convener of the New Tide faction, and Luo Wen-jia,
a member of the DPP's Justice League faction and the party's
candidate in the year-end Taipei County magistrate election, who said
they are worried about the corruption and loss of ideals and
capabilities of their own party that they claimed seems impotent in
running the government and the nation, launched last week a New DPP
movement in a bid to save the party.</P>
      <P>The movement immediately encountered severe criticism within the
DPP. Some party members even questioned Luo's motive in launching
such a campaign, saying that he might use the movement to help him
win the election.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that they are not surprised to face such criticism
from members of their own party, Tuan and Luo, however, made a
statement Monday to express their determination of never giving up
their idea to push for reform of the DPP.</P>
      <P>In the statement, the two young DPP heavyweights said that they
hope those who have questioned and criticized their reform ideas
within the party can also "listen calmly to other voices."</P>
      <P>Admitting that the movement they launched is certainly related to
the year-end elections as Luo is a DPP candidate and Tuan is helping
other DPP candidates to run their campaigns, they also said that the
DPP has disappointed its supporters and voters' expectations, adding
that "we have strong feelings about that."</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that they have no intention of avoiding the
responsibility that the DPP has to face since they have more
opportunities than others to participate in the party's
decision-making processes and to share more of the party's glory,
they said they should be responsible for the quality of the DPP's
governance and not allowed to only protect themselves without doing
something for the party.</P>
      <P>They further said that the increasing gap between rich and poor
on the island is a fact, adding that the DPP should push with more
sincerity and better plans for those policies that are in line with
social justice and fairness as well as the public's expectations.</P>
      <P>Claiming that they will never give up any chance to help
re-establish the people's confidence in the government even though
the ruling party only has a limited time to do so, they said that
"currently, we only hope those who still want to support the DPP can
first and honestly face the crisis and difficulties of the ruling
party and then help revive the party."</P>
      <P>Tuan said while responding to media questions that there are no
big differences between the reforms that he and Luo have suggested
and those of the other DPP members who have criticized their reform
proposals, adding that "we and the other DPP members only differ over
priorities and emphasis regarding party affairs."</P>
      <P>Tuan also said that he and Luo would like to have further
discussions with other DPP members on their reform ideas within the
framework of the party.</P>

transfer of some of its pilots to the Taiwanese carrier, according to
recent reports in various French-language and German-language
newspapers in Switzerland.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, the Swiss airline is expected to
dissolve its SAAB-2000 fleet during the coming winter, which is
expected to lead the airline to lay off some of its pilots.</P>
      <P>A spokesman of the carrier also said that the conditions set by
CAL for the 60 pilots it needs are suitable for those pilots working
for Crossair, a Swiss airline which was merged with Swiss
International Air Lines' forerunner, Swiss Air, a few years ago.</P>
      <P>Swiss Air, which was one of world's leading airlines, was merged
later on during a recession in the world airlines sector by Swiss

      <P>CAL apparently wants 40 pilots to serve its B-747 fleet and 20

    <TEXT>
      <P>Council of Labor Affairs Minister Lee
Ying-yuan said Tuesday the newly launched labor pension fund will not
be invested in the stock market until a bill governing the fund's
supervisory board has been passed by the legislature.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan in response to
Premier Frank Hsieh's hope to establish a mechanism for hiring
financial experts to buy blue chip stocks with government-controlled
funds to boost their lackluster performance.</P>
      <P>Not only the labor pension fund, but also all other funds such as
the life insurance fund, should be invested in the stock market,
Hsieh said, noting that most of Taiwan's public funds make only 3
percent to 4 percent in annual profits, compared to 9 percent to 10
percent by those of other countries.</P>
      <P>He said it is wrong to invest Taiwan's funds in foreign markets
because it indicates a lack of confidence in Taiwan, so he suggested
making it normal to invest part of the government-controlled funds in
the local capital market.</P>
      <P>Lee said the new pension system, launched in July, is increasing
between NT$200 million and NT$300 million each day and that can be
used only to buy bank certificates of term deposits.</P>

      <P>Lee urged the Legislative Yuan to pass the bill for the fund's

    <HEADLINE>NTD-RENMINBI CURRENCY EXCHANGE SERVICES BEGIN ON KINMEN, MATSU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Taiwan dollar-renminbi currency exchange
services officially opened Tuesday on a trial basis on the outlying
islands of Kinmen and Matsu, with travelers using the "mini three
links" swarming to buy the mainland currency at Kinmen's Shueitou
Port.</P>
      <P>Six financial institutions in Kinmen and Matsu have been granted
permission by the government to offer the currency exchange service.
They include the branch offices of two government-run banks in Kinmen
-- the Bank of Taiwan and the Land Bank of Taiwan -- and the Kinmen
County Credit Union.</P>
      <P>In the first hour after the new service began, more than 110,000
renminbi (US$13,590) was purchased at an exchange rate of NT$4.199 to
one renminbi, according to bank officials. </P>
      <P>A Taiwanese businessman operating in China said that he is happy
to see the opening of the official currency exchange service because
before he had to risk losses when buying the Chinese currency on the
black market.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng said the move was a good
one and suggested that everyone be entitled to use the NTD-RMB
conversion service.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh announced last month that the NTD-RMB
conversion program would begin, underscoring that it would only be
opened in Kinmen and Matsu conditionally -- only local residents of
Kinmen and Matsu; Taiwan residents who can travel between the
offshore islands and China's Fujian province under the "mini three
links" regulations; and Chinese citizens who are allowed to visit
Kinmen and Matsu will be allowed to convert NT dollars into the
Chinese currency or vice versa at legal banking institutions on the
two Taiwan-held islands.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said a ceiling of 20,000 renminbi per transaction would
also be set.</P>
      <P>In a bid to help facilitate private exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait, the Ministry of Finance announced Feb. 28, 2004 that Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER LAMBASTES KMT LAWMAKER FOR CALLING HIM 'EVIL LAWYER'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh lashed out at Kuomintang
Legislator Wu Den-yih for making ad hominem arguments against him at
the Legislative Yuan Tuesday, after Wu called the premier an "evil
lawyer."</P>
      <P>"You can ask questions, but you cannot stage a character
assassination. You must abide by the law, so how can you say that I
am evil? " Hsieh asked Wu after Wu accused him of being an "evil
lawyer most of the time."</P>
      <P>The war of words erupted when Wu, a former mayor of Kaohsiung who
was beaten in an election and replaced by Hsieh, questioned Hsieh
about the appropriateness of demanding two government-controlled
foundations to chip in NT$7.5 billion to help the Taiwan High Speed
Rail Corp. (THSRC) tide over its financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>Wu said that instead of letting THSRC Chairperson Nita Ing find
the money herself, the government demanded that the China Aviation
Development Foundation and China Technical Consultant, Inc. (CTCI
Foundation) come to the rescue, which resulted in Ing "dragging the
government down with her as she went down a well."</P>
      <P>And yet, Wu continued, the premier had the audacity to compare
his actions to the rescue of well-digger Liu Ching-teh, who was
buried alive for 26 hours several days ago.</P>
      <P>At that point, Hsieh tried to answer but was interrupted by Wu,
who asked the speaker of the legislature to prevent Hsieh from
replying.</P>
      <P>Wu then quoted lawyer Chen Chang-wen as questioning the
justification of the government to move so large an amount of money
into the high-speed rail project, claiming that Chen is a righteous
lawyer and "you're most of the time an evil lawyer."</P>
      <P>After protesting Wu's character assassination, Hsieh fired back
saying, "When an evil man looks at a righteous man, the righteous man
becomes evil in his eyes; when a righteous man looks at an evil man,
the evil man remains so."</P>
      <P>In reply to independent Legislator Li Ao's allegation that he was
"shouldering the responsibility for President Chen Shui-bian, " Hsieh
said it was his duty to "take full responsibility as premier."</P>
      <P>Li said he suspected that Hsieh has been the scapegoat for many
of the scandals that should be blamed on the president, and the
high-speed rail fiasco is but one of them.</P>
      <P>Li said under the current circumstances, Hsieh has two options:
step down, or "rise up against" his boss, which Li claimed would
greatly benefit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Later, Hsieh told reporters that he was taking questions from the
legislative floor because it was his constitutional duty, but
standing there to be insulted by lawmakers was not. He added that
personal attacks are "not permitted by the law."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARTIST ENVISIONS LINK WITH MAINLAND VIA BEAMS OF LIGHT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An artist will bridge the frontline island
of Matsu and mainland China with beams of light on Saturday to
celebrate Taiwan's Double Ten National Day.</P>
      <P>Hsia Hsueh-li a professor at National Taiwan University of Arts,
said the program, initiated by him and sponsored by the local
government to mark the national day, consists of two parts.</P>
      <P>In the first part, Hsia said, he will install 36 searchlights on
Chingpi, a small scenic fishing village in Peigan, Matsu, and project
the high-intensity beams of light toward the sky over Fujian province
across the narrow strait from Matsu.</P>
      <P>The searchlights will be turned on at 8: 08 p.m. on Oct. 8 and
project at an angle of 56 degree into the air for eight minutes.</P>
      <P>The professor said the 36 searchlights represent the 36 islands
constituting Matsu, also known as Lienchiang County. The 56 degree
angle symbolizes the 56 years after 1949 when Taiwan and the mainland
were ruled by separate governments.</P>
      <P>The second part of the program will take place on Dec. 31, the
eve of the new year.</P>
      <P>In addition to the 36 searchlights projecting from Matsu toward
the mainland, Hsia said he hopes the Chinese authorities will project
searchlights in the same number at the same angle from Fujian toward
Matsu to form a bridge of light.</P>
      <P>The light bridge would mark the determination of the two sides of
the Strait to forsake war and to march toward peace together, Hsia
claimed.</P>
      <P>The professor said the idea came to him when he visited Matsu to
conduct a class last week. His local students told him that the
frontline island is suffering from economic recession because the
Ministry of National Defense has cut the number of soldiers posted
there and will withdraw them altogether in two years.</P>
      <P>Local businessmen are trying to survive by developing tourism but
the island's two airports are often closed in the winter because of
heavy clouds, which scare away tourists, the students complained.</P>
      <P>Hsia said the clouds, which often cover the islands, gave him the
idea of using the searchlights, which will reflect from the clouds.</P>
      <P>With the support of the local government, Hsia said he will
approach the Fujian authorities in the hope that they will cooperate
with him in the art performance.</P>
      <P>If they refuse, Hsia said, the Lienchiang County Government will
try to install searchlights in Fujian themselves.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition "pan-blue alliance" lawmakers of
the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) used their slim
majority in the Legislative Yuan to block the Executive Yuan's arms
procurement package from being put on the legislative agenda for the
31st time Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The package contains three big-ticket items, including eight
diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.</P>
      <P>Also blocked were confirmation of President Chen Shui-bian's
nominations for Control Yuan members and two bills drafted by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its " pan-green" camp
ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , concerning ill-gotten
political party assets.</P>
      <P>But the Procedure Committee put the draft National Communications
Commission (NCC) bill on the top of the agenda of the legislature's
next meeting.</P>
      <P>The controversial NCC may soon face a vote as a mandatory
four-month consultation period among various parties has expired.</P>
      <P>At stake is the composition of the commission; the opposition
parties want the NCC to be comprised of members in proportion to the
number of seats each party holds in the legislature, while the DPP
insists that political parties should keep their hands off and let
experts and scholars serve on the commission, so that media freedoms
will not be affected.</P>
      <P>Several "pan-blue alliance"-initiated bills were put on the
agenda.</P>
      <P>These include the cross-strait peace promotion bill, condemnation
of Premier Frank Hsieh, the 319 "truth investigation commission," the
draft Central Election Commission organic law and draft amendment to
the court organic law.</P>
      <P>A draft anti-aggression peace bill proposed by the legislative

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of local animal and environmental
protection organizations will celebrate the Oct. 4 World Animal Day
by opening a film festival on Oct. 14 showcasing movies and
documentaries on animals to remind people to respect all forms of
animal life.</P>
      <P>The free 21 movies and documentaries will open in Taipei Oct. 14
and then travel to Taichung Nov. 1-3 and Kaohsiung Nov. 5-12. Detailed
information is available at www.east.org.tw/animal-movie/index.htm.</P>
      <P>According to the president of one of the organizers, Chu
Cheng-hung from the Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan (EAST) ,
the films will help people to think over the close relationships
between human beings and other animals.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the most direct contact most people with animals
are "eating their flesh, drinking their blood and wearing their furs,
"Chu added.</P>
      <P>Around 300 million chickens are slaughtered and cooked each year
in Taiwan, with that number being a small portion of the 46 billion
chickens killed worldwide, EAST executive member Chen Yu-min said,
noting that chickens are the second-most eaten animal by humans,
behind fish.</P>
      <P>World Animal Day was started in 1931 at a convention of
ecologists in Florence, Italy as a way of highlighting the plight of
endangered species. Since then it has grown to encompass all kinds of
animal life and has been widely celebrated in many countries around
the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BNHI TO SEEK CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION ON HEALTH SUBSIDY DISPUTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Bureau of National Health Insurance
(BNHI) will request a constitutional interpretation in connection
with a health care subsidy dispute with the Taipei city government, a
bureau official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to BNHI Vice President Chou Li-fang, the bureau will
file its petition with the Council of Grand Justices after it
receives the written judgment from the country's highest
administrative court on the dispute.</P>
      <P>The bureau had unsuccessfully sued the city government for
NT$10.8 billion (US$324.42 million) in National Health Insurance
subsidies it claimed was owed by the city government.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Administrative Court ruled a day earlier that the
city government owes nothing, supporting the city government's
argument that the subsidies should be charged on the basis of where
the insured register their residence, not based on the addresses of
the companies that employ them.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwan firms are headquartered in Taipei, but their
employees may not live in the capital city, and the local governments
are therefore obligated to pay for the medical bills of their
residents.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the case during an interpellation session in the
Legislative Yuan, Premier Frank Hsieh claimed the administrative
court ruling will "turn the entire nation upside down."</P>
      <P>Hsieh pointed out that many companies such as the Chinese
Petroleum Corp. and Formosa Plastics Corp. pay their business taxes
to the Taipei city government because they are headquartered in the
city, although their polluting factories are located elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the Cabinet might mark down the ratio of tax revenues
to be allocated to Taipei City in order to fill the financial
shortfall in the National Health Insurance program.</P>
      <P>In response, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou claimed it would be
"completely unlawful" for the Cabinet to do so, because health
insurance subsidies and tax revenue allocation are two different
issues.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Ma added, the Cabinet is in no position to deduct the
amount, since the administrative court has determined that the city
government does not owe the BNHI the amount in question.</P>
      <P>On the BNHI's decision to request a constitutional
interpretation, Ma said he believes the ruling by the administrative
court is correct because it is based on a previous interpretation by
the Council of Grand Justices on a similar issue.</P>

      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) sent a
letter to its Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), Tuesday, expressing sympathy for
the devastation caused by Typhoon Longwang in Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>The SEF said it was deeply concerned about the reports of heavy

      <P>Longwang, the 19th typhoon this year, hit Taiwan last weekend,
causing two deaths and injuring 53 people before moving across the
strait to make landfall in Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>According to wire service reports, at least 15 people there died
in flooding caused by torrential rain brought by the typhoon. The
typhoon also forced 537,000 residents to evacuate from Fujian and

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian hailed Tuesday
Taiwan's success in developing into a knowledge economy and called
for joint efforts to create high quality "made in Taiwan" brands.</P>
      <P>Chen made the call in a ceremony marking the start of "Branding
Taiwan Month, " in which he presented valuation certificates to
Taiwan's top 10 companies in 2005.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Chen encouraged Taiwan companies to
pursue value-added transformation at a time when the country is
facing huge economic challenges following a grave recession in recent
years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan must break into the world market competitively with its
own distinguished brand names to sustain its economy, Chen said,
adding that "made in Taiwan" now means high quality, rather than the
synonym for cheap products the phrase represented in the past.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his strong belief that Taiwan enterprises will
achieve the goal as they are flexible, adaptable and strong in
innovation, design and creation.</P>
      <P>"Keeping roots in Taiwan, exploring the global market" will be
the government's No. 1 economic agenda, and creating own-brand names
is the approach, he said.</P>
      <P>The president also unveiled a list of the Taiwan's top 10
companies in the ceremony in line with the "Branding Taiwan Month" --
a series of activities jointly being organized by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) and the semi-official Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>Trend Micro (US$1.077 billion) , Asus (US$882 million) , Acer
(US$759 million), BenQ (US$354 million), Masterkong (US$317 million),
Maxxis (US$264 million) , Giant (US$253 million) , Synnex (US$239
million), Zyxel (US$236 million) and D-link (US$225 million) are the
top 10 companies creating the largest brand name values, in that
order.</P>
      <P>The combined value of these 10 companies is around US$4.606
billion for 2005, a rise of 11.5 percent over the previous year's
level.</P>
      <P>The leading three companies have maintained their ranking for two
consecutive years, with Trend Micro's brand name value exceeding the
US$1 billion level for the first time, a 14 percent increase over its
2004 level.</P>
      <P>BenQ registered the largest increase of 27 percent in its brand
name value, organizers said, attributing BenQ's growth to its
acquisition of Siemens cell phone operation and predicting that the
company will further prosper due to the booming business prospects of
third-generation mobile phones.</P>
      <P>Synnex recorded the second-largest growth of 20 percent, thanks
to its foreign market deployment and improved post-sales services
during last year, organizers said.</P>

      <P>The United States and China are the
destinations most favored by Taiwan students wishing to pursue
advanced studies, according to the results of an online survey
released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by Career.com.tw, found that the United
States was the top choice at 43.7 percent, followed by China at 15.4
percent and Britain at 15.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Despite the government's refusal to recognize academic
qualifications issued by Chinese colleges and universities, 63
percent of those polled said that this will not affect their
willingness to study there.</P>
      <P>The survey also found Peking University to be the most popular,
with 38 percent of the respondents saying they would like to study
there, followed by Tsinghua University at 14 percent and Fudan
University at 9.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey found that employment considerations are the biggest
drive for pursuing studies in China, with business administration the
top choice.</P>
      <P>Also, because the universities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
excel in their own distinctive ways, China, which excels in the
humanities, international relations and Chinese medicine, also
attracts a lot of Taiwanese students.</P>
      <P>The survey found that Taiwanese students are curious about
studying in China, although in comparison with other countries, the
channels for studying there are not very open. This, according to the
website, is why many inquire about studying in China but few actually
go.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Auditor-General Su Chen-ping said Tuesday
that six "major flaws" have been found in the construction of
Kaohsiung's mass rapid transit system, a finding that will be
referred to the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>However, no-one will handle the case at the Control Yuan, as its
members that President Chen Shui-bian has tried to appoint have been
rejected by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the first problem with the MRT is that the
"build-operate-transfer" (BOT) model adopted to build the system has
not been effective in attracting private investment.</P>
      <P>The second problem is that Siemens AG, one of the shareholders,
has not invested the amount set by the investor selection committee,
while its conditions for its collection of royalty fees are "not
reasonable," Su claimed.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, the government has incurred losses as a result of the
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) failing to implement provisions
regarding the adjustment of building costs in accordance with the
contract.</P>
      <P>The fourth flaw is KRTC's failure to monitor and manage the
engineering consultant firms contracted to build the system,
resulting in their lack of care and inadequate manpower.</P>
      <P>The fifth is failing to check if all building fees have been paid
on time as there have been reports of delays in payment.</P>
      <P>The sixth is failing to test drive in accordance with the
schedule, while even schedule setting and monitoring are a problem.</P>
      <P>Su made his statements in reply to opposition People First Party
Legislator Chang Hsien-yao's question about the government's budget
for the project.</P>
      <P>He said the six defects were found during an investigation into
the city's budget for the BOT project from March to April this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
expressed deep regret Tuesday over the death of a Chinese sports
official who succumbed to a heart attack Oct. 2 although doctors in a
hospital in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, tried to save his life in a
surgery that lasted 20 hours.</P>
      <P>Li Liyan, a researcher of the state-run China Institute of Sports
Science, was in Taiwan as a guest of the Taipei Physical Education
College. He suffered a heart attack Sept. 29 while he was having
dinner and was immediately rushed to the Kaohsiung Medical College
Hospital.</P>
      <P> According to an SEF spokesman, the SEF activated its emergency
mechanism shortly afterward, seeking authorization from the Mainland
Affairs Council under the Cabinet to notify related Chinese
government agencies while making arrangements for Li's family to come
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Li's wife and two daughters were granted visas that same day and
arrived in Taiwan Sept. 30. However, Li died two days later.</P>
      <P>His wife and daughters left Taiwan for China Tuesday with his

    <HEADLINE>TAITUNG COUNTY MAGISTRATE ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR DEPUTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a last-minute upset as registration for
the year-end city and county head elections closed Tuesday, Taitung
County Magistrate Hsu Chin-yuan did not register for re-election but
instead threw his weight behind his deputy, Liu Chao-hao.</P>
      <P>Liu, a member of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,
could only run as an independent because he only threw his gauntlet
into the ring at the last minute.</P>
      <P>Liu's rival, Wu Chun-li, though caught off-guard, said he would
"take the news in his stride."</P>
      <P>Hsu, who earlier served notice that he would run for re-election,
was rumored to want to bow out and that his deputy could replace him
Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsu invited around 40 or 50 core supporters, including aboriginal
legislators Lin Chun-teh and Lin Cheng-er and opposition Kuomintang
and People First Party elected officials to a luncheon Tuesday
afternoon in which he announced that Liu would run for county
magistrate, stunning all on hand.</P>
      <P>Liu, 38, was a lawyer, a Kaohsiung District Court judge and a
Taitung District Court Judge before serving as Hsu's deputy.</P>
      <P>Although Liu has no election experience, he has prepared himself
fo the post, Hsu said, adding that he has observed Liu for four years
and has found him to have ability and integrity. He also claimed that
the decision will encourage young people in Taitung to care about
public affairs.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that he will retire Dec. 20 and stressed that he will
not run again, adding that he has seen too much of the vicissitude in
politics. Hsu was originally a member of the Kuomintang but has not
received much support from the party and was forced to leave to run
on his own. He said he was tired after fighting with the KMT over the
past two decades and that he wanted to "close the chapter with the
party."</P>
      <P>Hsu withdrew from the KMT to run for legislator and county
magistrate. He supported James Soong, who ran as an independent in
the 2000 presidential election, because of his friendship with Soong.
In the legislative elections in late 2004, he switched support to the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP'S) candidate, who later
lost, in order to win central government support for expansion work
of the South Bend Highway and Fukang Harbor.</P>
      <P>He went out of his way to pave the way for Liu and went to great
lengths to remove the hurdles set up by the DPP and the KMT.</P>
      <P>He created the impression that he would run for re-election to
prevent the KMT from recruiting Legislator Huang Chien-ting, who won
in the 2004 legislative election, and the DPP from recruiting another
candidate.</P>
      <P>After making sure that Wu will represent the KMT, he then
announced that Liu will run.</P>
      <P>According to supporters, Hsu feels it will be best for Liu to run
against Wu, who is still mired in a graft lawsuit. Otherwise, he
might have to face the more seasoned Huang in the next
county magistrate election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER THREATENS TO FREEZE BUDGET AS DOUBLE-DIPPING CONTINUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
lawmaker threatened to propose a freeze on NT$123.6 billion in
government budget Tuesday if it continues to turn a blind eye to what
she claimed is double-dipping that costs tax payers at least NT$80
billion a year.</P>
      <P>Lai Hsing-yuan was referring to retired government employees who
find other jobs at government-funded non-profit organizations,
getting two salaries at the expense of the less privileged and in
violation of the law as well as a Legislative Yuan resolution.</P>
      <P>She claimed that at least 58 retired officials are working at
such government-funded organizations as the Institute for Information
Industry and Taiwan Grains and Feeds Development Foundation, getting
paid between NT$100,000 and NT$300,000 a month while receiving their
pensions from the government at the same time.</P>
      <P>Many of Taiwan's government retirees get a pay check for their
monthly pension, in addition to enjoying 18 percent interest on part
of their pension, a privilege that has long been criticised.</P>
      <P>Lai said for these 58 retired officials alone, the government is
"wasting" NT$80 million a year, a cruel injustice to the middle-aged
and elderly people who account for one-fifth of the nation's
unemployed.</P>
      <P>She said that if the government does not do something about it
soon, she will ask the legislature to cancel the NT$123.6 billion
budget for the 143 non-profit organizations.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) agreed that the law bans government employees and political
appointees from taking two paychecks after leaving government posts,
but said that according to reports by the non-profit groups, there
have been no violations of the law.</P>
      <P>According to the law, it said, government retirees hired by
non-profit organizations over half of whose operation fees comes from
government budget must not get their original retirement pension,
including the 18 percent "preferential" interest.</P>
      <P>The government retirees in question include former teachers and
soldiers whose pensions are provided by the Ministry of Education and
the Ministry of National Defense, although there are some exceptions,
according to the DGBAS.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'TAIWAN FIRST' CRUCIAL TO RE-ELECTION: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
the concepts of "Taiwan first" and "Taiwanese identity" that he
promoted during his 2004 presidential campaign were the most crucial
aspects to his re-election.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a meeting with Georg Jarzembowski, the leader of
a pro-Taiwan group in the European Parliament, Chen said the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was able to win the support of
more than half of the voters in the election because it was standing
on the side of the majority opinion in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Unlike the past, when the rest of the world confused Taiwan with
China, the international community has been better able to
differentiate Taiwan from China over the past five years since the
DPP came to power, Chen claimed.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the DPP is different from the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) in that it believes
Taiwan must renounce the idea of "one China."</P>
      <P>While visits to China by then-KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP
Chairman James Soong in April and May were unhelpful to boosting the
two parties' campaigns in the May 14 National Assembly election,
public support for the DPP has not been affected despite the
obstruction by opposition parties of government policies, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen reiterated his opinion that the so-called "1992 consensus"
claimed by the KMT and PFP is totally non-existent.</P>
      <P>Although Lien and Soong claim that the "1992 consensus" means
Taiwan and China are each allowed to maintain their own
interpretations of the meaning of "one China, " Beijing insists the
"1992 consensus" means that the two sides both agree on "one China, "
according to Chen.</P>
      <P>He accused Beijing of attempting to divide Taiwan and isolating
the government of Taiwan by inviting Lien and Soong to visit China
but refusing to start dialogue with the DPP government.</P>
      <P>The president said he has not visited China because he refuses to
accept the "one China" precondition set by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chen said it would mean recognizing Taiwan as part of China and
as a local government of China if he were to accept the precondition,
which he claimed is unacceptable to the 23 million people of Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP EXPECTS TO WIN ELECTIONS IN 13 COUNTIES/CITIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) , which has entered candidates in 19 out of 23 counties and
cities for the year-end election of local government chiefs, said it
expects to win in 13 counties and cities.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang told a news conference at the
end of the registration of candidates Tuesday that his party is
expected to achieve the goal set by President Chen Shui-bian to
control more than a half of the 23 city or county halls up for grabs.</P>
      <P>Among the 13 constituencies considered by the DPP as shoo-ins are
the counties of Ilan, Taipei, Miaoli, Nantou, Changhua, Yunlin,
Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Pingdong and Penghu, and the cities of
Chiayi and Tainan.</P>
      <P>Lee said the DPP candidates are also fighting in the counties of
Hualien, Taoyuan, Hsinchu and Taichung, and in the cities of Hsinchu
and Taichung.</P>
      <P>Lee said his party is facing fierce competition from the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in the elections, especially in Ilan
County, Taipei County and Chiayi City, which the DPP considers
must-wins.</P>
      <P>However, he said, his party is optimistic about victory in the
three areas in light of the fact that Ilan County has been ruled by
the DPP for 24 years, not to mention that DPP candidate Chen Ding-nan
has served as magistrate of that county before being named as
minister of justice and is respected nationwide.</P>
      <P>Chiayi City in central Taiwan will be a difficult fight for the
KMT, which has never won an election there, Lee went on.</P>
      <P>In Taipei County, the KMT followers might outnumber DPP
supporters, but DPP candidate Lo Wen-chia has so far avoided
confrontation between the two political blocs.</P>
      <P>Instead, Lee said, Lo is trying hard to win over voters with his
clean image and his Hakka origins. The Hakka account for a
significant part of the population of Taipei County.</P>
      <P>In southern Taiwan, which is the DPP's power base, the party
enjoys steady support despite KMT attempts to win over farmers there
by advocating exports of farm produce to China, according to Lee. Lee
said his party will canvass voters for its candidates around the
island, touting the achievements of the DPP administration over the
last five years.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: When a President Is Not
Spoiling for a Fight

In naming Harriet E. Miers to the Supreme Court, President Bush
revealed that he has no appetite for an all-out ideological fight. By
settling on a loyalist with no experience as as a judge and little
substantive record on abortion, affirmative action, relion and other
socially divisive issues, President Bush shied away from a direct
confrontation with liberals and in effect asked his base on the right
to trust him on this one.

Wall Street Journal: Bush's New Supreme Court Pick: A Loyal Aide
With Scanty Record

In nominating White House Counsel Harriet Miers for Supreme Court
justice, President Bush chose a candidate more likely to delight his
business backers than his conservative base: a longtime loyal aide
with little in her past to excite Republicans of offer Democrats a
target. President Bush has sought a nominee who can help put his mark
on the Supreme Court without kicking off an ideological battle. If
successful, the move would help a weakened White House avoid a
debilitating political fight.</TEXT>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh gave Taiwan Power Co.
(Taipower) several directives Wednesday, instructing the state-run
key power supplier to lower its overheads and electricity generation
costs so as to help alleviate the pressure for power rate hikes.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he wants Taipower to lower its power plants'
installation capacity rate from the current 20 percent of reserve
margin to 16 percent, a move which he said could save the company
some NT$40 billion (US$1.2 billion).</P>
      <P>The premier also suggested that Taipower adjust its co-generation
payment structure on its purchases of electricity from private power
generators to further cut costs. The buying rates should be
calculated based on fuel variety instead of on kilowat hours, he
said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Hsieh said, Taipower should also seek to improve or
overhaul its power distribution systems nationwide to reduce
unnecessary waste in power consumption.</P>
      <P>The premier also urged members of the general public to do their
best to try to conserve energy, saying that electricity is money.</P>
      <P>Hsieh saw to it that commodity taxes on three types of oil
products were cut in late September to avoid price increases at gas

    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking Republic of China official in
charge of the nation's expatriate affairs warned Wednesday that
Taiwan should pay more heed to the strategy that Beijing has worked
out to attract overseas Chinese and Taiwanese and to further
diplomatically suppress Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang Fu-mei, minister of the Overseas Chinese Commission (OCC)
under the Executive Yuan, made the warning while reporting the
commission's administrative work to the Foreign Affairs and Overseas
Chinese Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Noting that China has upgraded the level of its strategy in
dealing with matters related to overseas Chinese and Taiwanese in
order to "further block Taiwan's room for survival in the
international community, " the minister said that Beijing has also
used its "united front" propaganda combined with economic development
issues to actively try to get control over the educational resources
of overseas Chinese and Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>Beijing has also tried to drum up overseas Chinese and Taiwanese'
support by attracting them to invest in China and to expand its
influence over them, she also said, adding that it has also used
pro-China media abroad to distort Taiwan's image.</P>
      <P>"We must closely watch this and be on alert against it, " Chang
stressed.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that the Chinese leadership has not only attached
great importance to its overseas "united front policy, " but has also
made decisions to gradually apply the policy in the traditional
overseas and Chinese communities, adding that by penetrating into
various overseas Chinese and Taiwanese groups, China is trying to
expand its sphere of influence.</P>
      <P>According to the minister, China has also decided to set up 100
Confucius Institutes in various countries around the world to serve
as its overseas base camps to promote the Chinese language and
Chinese culture as well as to cooperate with the United States to
develop a set of online Chinese-language learning materials in an
attempt "to gradually monopolize the entire market of
Chinese-language education."</P>
      <P>Talking about the future direction of her commission's
administrative work, Chang promised that the commission will continue
to work on consolidating overseas Chinese and Taiwanese communities
and to help promote freedom, democracy, human rights and peaceful
ideas.</P>
      <P>"We will also hold various activities to strengthen our work
relating to overseas Chinese and Taiwanese education as well as to
help the Global Alliance for Democracy and Peace to promote freedom,
democracy, human rights and peace in order to maintain Taiwan's
superiority in this regard, " she further said, adding that "the
commission will also help overseas Chinese to develop their
businesses and encourage them to invest in Taiwan."</P>

(By Wu Hsieh-chang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An investigative committee under Thailand's
Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs said Wednesday it has discovered
evidence showing that three ministry officials were involved in a
labor brokerage fee scandal regarding the employment of Thai workers
for Taiwan's mass rapid transit system project in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Three Thai labor brokerage companies -- namely Sincere
International, PT United and BSB Co. -- were also found to have
overcharged Thai laborers they sent to the southern Taiwan port city
to work on the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) project,
according to the committee.</P>
      <P>The investigations, initiated by Thai Labor Affairs Minister
Somsak Thepsuthin after some 100 Thai workers rioted in Kaohsiung in
August to protest what they claimed was "unfair and unjust"
management by a Kaohsiung-based labor firm, found that three Thai
labor affairs officials were involved in the brokerage fees
overcharging, committee members said.</P>
      <P>The investigators, who have traveled to Taiwan to talk with the
Thai laborers, discovered that the three Thai firms charged each
Kaohsiung-bound Thai worker 150,000 baht (US$3,750) in brokerage fees
instead of the officially-allowed 95,000 baht.</P>
      <P>The committee will report these firms to the ministry shortly.
The firms could have their business operation licenses revoked and be
forced to repay the money they made in overcharging the Thai
laborers, according to the committee.</P>

      <P>Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyuan said
Wednesday that a population policy guideline will be established by

      <P>Su made the remarks at a Health, Environment and Social Welfare

      <P>Legislator Ho Tsai-feng of the opposition Kuomintang said that
the population is declining and aging, with the number of elderly now
accounting for nearly 10 percent of the total population.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwanese women do not want to have children, and foreign
spouses of Taiwanese men are "contributing to the birth rate in
Taiwan, " Ho said, without explaining the relevance of her statement.</P>
      <P>Su said the government is revising its population policy
guidelines and that they should be established by the end of
December. After that, the government will formulate a population
policy white paper, mapping out the suitable population, the
upgrading of what he described as "population quality" and its
distribution around the country.

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS URGE FINE INCREASE TO PREVENT CHINESE ABSCONDING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) , said Wednesday that the government should increase fines to
prevent Chinese tourists from absconding while in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The legislators made the remarks at a Transportation and
Communications Committee meeting in the legislature, where
officials from the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and
the Mainland Affairs Council were invited to report on Taiwan's
planned full opening to Chinese tourists and other complementary
measures.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau Director-General Hsu Wen-sheng said that
currently, Taiwan travel agencies have to post NT$1 million
(US$30,300) bonds when arranging for Chinese tourists to come to
Taiwan and that after the full opening, the bonds will be raised to
NT$2 million.</P>
      <P>If one Chinese tourist absconds, then NT$100,000 from the bond
will be confiscated and the government will also discuss with Chinese
travel agencies in an effort to persuade them to pay an additional
NT$80,000 for the estimated expenses of sheltering and repatriating
each absconding tourist who is caught.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Kun-tse said the fines should be increased,
adding that since the partial opening to Chinese tourists in 2002,
Chinese have made 62,952 visits. Eighty-five Chinese tourists have
absconded and 36 of them remain at large, Lee said.</P>
      <P>If the government is planning for full opening, the number of
absconding cases is expected to increase, he said.</P>
      <P>"Fines should be dramatically raised in view of national security
and social stability," Lee said.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator David Huang expressed doubt that the immigration
authorities will be able to verify the identities of Chinese
tourists. This and the past absconding of Chinese tourists have given
rise to misgivings and the feeling that bonds should be further
increased, he added.</P>
      <P>Huang also said that Tourism Bureau should not target only
Chinese tourists for its "doubling tourist arrivals by 2008"
campaign, and should try to attract more tourists from Japan and
South Korea.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsao Erh-chang of the opposition Kuomintang said that
if Taiwan does not fully open to Chinese tourists, the campaign will
be nothing but a slogan.</P>
      <P>"Full opening to Chinese tourists is the last resort to
reinvigorate the economy," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first opened its doors to Chinese citizens with permanent
foreign residency or Chinese students studying abroad Jan. 1, 2002.</P>
      <P>The government later allowed Chinese who have traveled overseas
for business or pleasure to come to Taiwan, along with those who have
resided in Hong Kong or Macau for more than four years and have work
permits there.</P>
      <P>The government announced in June that it plans to fully open
Taiwan to Chinese tourists, adding that the complementary measures
have been mapped out and that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
should consult on the matter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PEACEFUL TAIWAN STRAIT SAID IN RUSSIA'S INTERESTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Moscow,  Oct.  5 (CNA)
(By Chang Hung-kuang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A peaceful Taiwan Strait is not only
beneficial to people on either side of the strait, it is also in
Russia's best interests, visiting Taiwan-Russia Association President
Chang Chun-hsiung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Substantive bilateral engagement between Taiwan and Russia will
not be affected by the joint military drills conducted by Russia and
China recently, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In fact, he added, the Taiwan-Russia Association will continue to
promote substantive bilateral ties between the two countries, despite
China passing its Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan and its holding
joint military drills with Russia.</P>
      <P>The signing of business contracts worth an estimated US$375
million during the visit to Russia by the Taiwan-Russia Association
delegation over the past week is a concrete move telling the Russians
that maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait is also in the
interests of Russia, Chang continued.</P>
      <P>The contracts include one between Chinese Petroleum Corp. and the
Russian Institute of International Relations on a joint crude oil
exploration project; Taiwan Fertilizer Corp.'s purchase of urea
(carbamide) from Russia; and Ho Tung Chemical Co.'s procurement of
crude oil, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>Chang, a former premier and currently a legislator of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, said that in addition to continuing to
promote the holding of the Taiwan-Russian Cooperation Forum, his
association has also made efforts to increase Taiwan's procurement
from Russia.</P>
      <P>Such procurement, began with US$40 million in 2002, increased to
US$250 million in 2003 and hit a record high of US$375 million this
year, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between Taiwan and Russia stood at US$1.6 billion
in 2003, a figure that rose remarkably to nearly US$3 billion in
2004, up 90 percent over the year-earlier level. Chang said.</P>
      <P>He attributed the noticeable increase -- which he claimed was an
eye-opener for the Russian authorities -- to strenuous efforts by the
representative offices of the two countries and to the Taiwan-Russia
Association.</P>
      <P>Chang and his 20-member Taiwan trade delegation, which arrived in
Moscow early last week to promote bilateral exchanges and cooperation
in energy resources research, trade, economic development and
financial reform between Russia and Taiwan, departed Moscow Tuesday
for home via South Korea.</P>

      <P>Health officials of the Taipei city
government seized seven boxes of imported beef from New Zealand
Wednesday that contains endosulfan -- an organochlorine insecticide
harmful to human health.</P>
      <P>The contaminated beef is part of 77 boxes of New Zealand beef
imported by three Taiwanese trade companies in September, each box
weighing 25 kg. The health officials traced seven of the eight boxes
that entered Taipei, leaving one box unaccounted for. Employees at
the import company that bought the beef from New Zealand claimed they
had "probably" consumed the beef themselves.</P>
      <P>The Taipei health officials took the action after being notified
by the Department of Health (DOH) that tests conducted in South Korea
found that the endosulfan level in New Zealand beef reached 0.5 ppm,
much higher than the allowed limit of 0.1 ppm in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DOH contacted the New Zealand government, which found that
all the contaminated beef was supplied by the AFFCO meat company,
which sprayed its cattle with endosulfan to get rid of cattle ticks,
causing the insecticide to be absorbed by the beasts.</P>
      <P>The New Zealand government also informed the DOH of the three
Taiwanese companies that imported the 77 boxes of beef from AFFCO in
September.</P>
      <P>The DOH called on health authorities in Taiwan's cities and
counties to help trace the imported beef and urged meat stores to
notify their local health authorities if they see any meat product
marked with the number: 470309023629.</P>

      <P>Ho said at the Legislative Yuan that he will not take home a

      <P>He made the remarks after he was accused by opposition Kuomintang

excessively extra pay from Chunghwa Telecom by having the company's
board of directors pass a resolution in September making Ho Chunghwa
Telecom's CEO in addition to chairman.</P>

percent share of Chunghwa Telecom's pretax profits annually as a CEO

Legislator Huang Wei-che on why the Chunghwa Telecom board of

well, Ho claimed the decision was made in line with U.S.
regulations, since Chunghwa Telecom is now a U.S.-listed company.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONSUMERS' FOUNDATION WANTS MORE REGULATION OF GROUPER FISH SAFETY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Consumers' Foundation demanded Wednesday
that the government make an overall inspection of aquaculturists and
regulate more rigorously the issuing of safety certification for
fish.</P>
      <P>The foundation made the appeal one day after an urgent
announcement by the Fisheries Administration under the Council of
Agriculture that a sample of groupers with safety certification being
sold on the market had been found to contain malachite green.</P>
      <P>The possible carcinogenic substance is a synthetic dye used to
color silk, wool and leather. It is also an effective medication for
the control of various external parasites of freshwater and marine
fish. In animal tests, it has been shown to be harmful to the liver.</P>
      <P>Fishery officials said the groupers in question were tracked down
to an aquacultural pond in Fangliao, Pingtung County, where the owner
claimed that he had asked another aquaculturist to provide him with
smaller groupers as requested by buyers, so that some fish that had
not been inspected were mixed with the certified fish from his pond.</P>
      <P>Consumers' Foundation Chairman Lee Fang-ao said that the fact
that traces of malachite green were found shows that the practice has
not yet been rooted out, despite claims to the contrary.</P>
      <P>The government needs to make an across-the-board inspection of
aquaculturalists, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Foundation official Wu Chia-cheng said the government should fund

insurance of safety certificates, while a third independent party

      <P>Meanwhile, a supermarket chain store where the problematic
groupers were found voiced displeasure over the government's lax
inspection of the fish.</P>

contaminated.</P>
      <P>She noted that Carrefour had no intention of selling the
expensive fish at first, but at the request of the Fisheries
Administration, started to sell the fish Sept. 22 after the
administration banned and later resumed the sale of the fish,
promising that their safety was assured.</P>
      <P>As consumers were not keen on the fish, the shop sold less than
100 of them and stopped selling them Sept. 28.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong first blew the whistle on Taiwan groupers in late

    <HEADLINE>NO INFORMATION ON CHANGES IN U.S. ARMS DEAL: DEFENSE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Lee Jye said Wednesday that
the government has not received any information indicating that the
United States might change its arms deal with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee was responding to a Japan Times report in which William J.
Fallon, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, is said to have urged
Taiwan to forgo high-tech offensive weapons, including the
diesel-electric submarines that Washington offered to sell Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Fallon instead encouraged Taiwan to acquire more defensive
weapons such as defensive missiles, mines and helicopters, according
to the report.</P>
      <P>Lee speculated to lawmakers during a National Defense Committee
session at the Legislative Yuan that the United States is worried
that hi-tech weapons it sells to Taiwan would be obtained by China
after Taiwan unifies with China.</P>
      <P>Washington also fears Taiwan might lack the resolve to defend
itself in light of the delay in the passage of the budget for its
NT$480 billion arms procurement package from the United States,
according to Lee.</P>
      <P>He said such fear is unwarranted because Taiwan has purchased
armaments such as long-range early warning radar and Kidd-class
destroyers from the United States, although the procurement of the
submarines, anti-submarine aircraft and anti-missile systems is still
pending legislative approval.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A reform alliance of 66 civic groups urged
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Wednesday to address
the opposition's "lack of trust" in a government-proposed national
communications commission (NCC).</P>
      <P>The Citizen Participating in Media Reform Alliance also called
for the establishment of a professional and citizen's participation
mechanism in the proposed NCC as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Alliance members were commenting on the most controversial part
of a proposed NCC bill -- the composition of the commission -- during
a discussion in a seminar held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) want
the NCC to be comprised of members in proportion to the number of
seats each party holds in the legislature, while the DPP insists that
political parties should keep their hands off and let experts and
scholars serve on the commission, so that media freedoms will not be
affected by political party interests.</P>
      <P>The alliance said that if the lineup of the commission follows
the version of the Executive Yuan, then the Legislative Yuan could
monitor them, but if the proportional representation model is
observed, no-one will be able to monitor the NCC members.</P>
      <P>To address the opposition's lack of trust in the ruling party,
the alliance suggested procedural legislation to ensure that the NCC
members are named in an objective manner, that the legislation also
stipulates that NCC members follow public hearing procedures and that
professional and civic groups participate in such hearings.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu claimed that proportional
representation in the NCC "will not be a problem" because political
forces will not interfere if citizens participate in the hearings.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Yung-ping admitted that the opposition version is
far from perfect, but claimed it would stop the ruling party from
dominating the commission members.</P>

    <HEADLINE>70 DPP LEGISLATORS ISSUE STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF NEW DPP MOVEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Seventy legislators of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) declared their support Wednesday for a new
DPP movement to revive the party's core values amid public criticism
that the DPP is becoming corrupt faster than the Kuomintang it
replaced as the ruling party in 2000.</P>
      <P>The idea of a new DPP movement was first raised last weekend by
Tuan Yi-kang, convener of the New Tide faction of the party, and Luo
Wen-jia, a member of the DPP's Justice League faction and the
party's candidate in the year-end Taipei County magistrate election.
However, old guards of the DPP immediately jumped on them, saying
that their motives are election-minded.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Wen-chung issued a statement in support of the
new DPP movement. Of the 89 DPP legislators in the 225-seat
legislature, 70 have signed the statement, which calls on the party
to reflect upon itself and "enter a rebirth."</P>
      <P>Lee appeared with four of his sponsors at a news conference
Wednesday. They said their support for the new DPP movement has
nothing to do with the year-end elections, and that the DPP must heed
the voices of the public and insist on being a party that takes care
of the less privileged and maintains the principles of equality and
justice.</P>
      <P>The statement said that the DPP cannot always blame objective
factors for the problems it has encountered as the ruling party, and
that the party should re-examine itself and respond to the complaints
from different corners of society and to the expectations of DPP
supporters.</P>
      <P>The statement also urged the government to take swift action to
pinpoint those responsible for alleged corruption in a number of
scandals, including the Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers working on the
Kaohsiung rapid transit project in protest of the inhumane treatment
by their employers and management.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BRAND NAMES VITAL TO COMPANY SUCCESS: ACER FOUNDER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Creating a brand name is the key to a
company's success, and Taiwan's small businesses should adopt the
strategy to pursue value-added transformation and secure sustainable
growth, Stan Shih, former chairman of the Acer Group, said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shih, "godfather" of Taiwan's PC industry and founder of Acer
Inc., which is Taiwan's largest computer company, issued the call at
a forum jointly organized by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the
Taiwan External Trade Development Council -- one of the activities
for the "Branding Taiwan Month" that kicked off a day earlier and
will run through October.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that small businesses are usually more flexible in
establishing their own brand names, Shih urged Taiwan companies to
enhance their presence and upgrade their image in the global market
through brand forging.</P>
      <P>"I believe that Taiwan's small businesses are capable of doing so
because they are flexible and adaptable, " he said, claiming that
"one year will be enough to engage in such a task."</P>
      <P>However, product competitiveness and business management are the
two major factors that will decide the fate of a new trade name, he
said, suggesting that Taiwan companies sharpen their business
management to accomplish the goal.</P>
      <P>The secret for a business to succeed resides in jockeying for an
advantageous position in the market and Taiwan enterprises should
rethink their roles as contractors, because "Taiwan brands build
Taiwan image," he concluded.</P>
      <P>Acer was proclaimed Monday the third-biggest of Taiwan's top 10
brand names, with its brand name value estimated at US$759 million
and behind Trend Micro with US$1.077 billion and Asus with US$882
million. Acer computers are popular at home, in Europe and in Latin
America.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SHRINKING TRADE SURPLUS TEMPORARY: ECONOMICS MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's imports have grown faster than the
country's exports so far this year and a shrinkage in the trade
surplus as a result is just a short-term phenomenon, Minister of
Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ho made the remarks during an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan while answering question from opposition Kuomintang
lawmaker Lee Jih-chu, who voiced grave concern over Taiwan's
decreasing trade surplus and asked whether it might persist over the
long term.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Taiwan has posted continued declines in
outbound shipments over the past four years, ranking the country the
second from the bottom out of 10 Asian countries in terms of export
growth rates.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's losing momentum in exports is not merely a temporary
effect; rather, than it is an unavoidable trend due to dwindling
competitiveness that in turn has driven away foreign investment,
which Lee argued is a serious problem. She urged Ho to respond to the
issue quickly and adequately.</P>
      <P>Ho asserted that Taiwan's trade surplus shrinkage will narrow in
the future after imported machinery facilities for IC and TFT-LCD
production begin contributing to the domestic economy and soaring oil
prices have stabilized.</P>
      <P>The economics minister also pointed to Taiwan companies'
relocations overseas as a leading factor that has led to lagging
exports. For instance, she said, Taiwan's notebook computer makers
have all moved to China in search of cheaper production costs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan recorded a combined trade surplus of US$1.17 billion for
the first eight months of this year, a 79 percent plunge compared to
the previous year's level, government statistics show. It has been
estimated that the country's full-year trade surplus will not exceed
US$2 billion for 2005.</P>

      <P>An independent candidate
running for Pingtung County magistrate is being investigated by local

      <P>The public prosecutors searched the campaign office of Sung
Li-hua and 74 other locations and found that since July, Sung's camp
has given away more than 400 gifts at large parties through
lot-drawings, including 229 bicycles, 70 electric fans, nine TV sets,
10 DVD players, seven microwave ovens, four refrigerators, two

townships of Pingtung County to boost Sung's chances of being
elected.</P>
      <P>Chuang Jung-sung, one of the prosecutors, disclosed that the
prosecutors' office confiscated 47 gift items from registered voters'

detailed instructions reminding staff members that all evidence about

takes place.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SUPPORTS JUDICIAL PROBES INTO KRTC SCANDAL: AIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian wholeheartedly
supports judicial investigations into suspected racketeering in the
hiring of Thai laborers to work for the Kaohsiung rapid transit
system construction project, the president's chief of staff said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun made the remarks after President Chen accepted
earlier in the day the resignations of two of his advisers over their
alleged involvement in the suspected profiteering scandal.</P>
      <P>"Chen Che-nan, a national policy adviser to President Chen, and
Chen Min-hsien, a Presidential Office adviser, tendered their
resignations early this morning, " Yu said, adding that one
resignation was faxed to the Presidential Office and the other was
forwarded by a messenger.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, President Chen swiftly approved the two
advisers' resignations because he thought that the cases should be
handled with the "strictest ethical standards." He further said the
president didn't meet with either of the two advisers before signing
off on their resignations.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan, who once served as a Presidential Office deputy
secretary-general, and Chen Min-hsien, who used to be vice chairman
of the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) , are suspected of
involvement in an illegal profiteering racket between the employer --
KRTC -- and a labor brokerage firm that has exploited Thai laborers.</P>
      <P>The alleged racketeering surfaced after a group of Thai laborers
working on the Kaohsiung rapid transit construction project rioted on
Aug. 21 in protest what they perceived as unfair and unjust treatment
by their management. Law enforcement authorities have been
investigating the cause of the riot and all possible irregularities
involved in the employment and management of the Thai workers.</P>
      <P>"The advisers' resignations indicate their respect for
prosecutorial investigations, " Yu said, adding that President Chen
himself also fully supports judicial investigations into the case.</P>
      <P>Yu further said it is hoped that judicial authorities can get to
the bottom of the case as soon as possible. "President Chen will
definitely respect the verdicts of the court," he added.</P>
      <P>As to opposition lawmakers' call that Premier Frank Hsieh, who
launched the Kaohsiung MRT construction project during his tenure as
mayor of Kaohsiung, should take a leave of absence to facilitate
judicial probes into his role in the case, Yu said since Hsieh has
given a detailed account to clarify wild speculations surrounding the
case, lawmakers and other social quarters as well should respect his
explanations.</P>
      <P>"We believe judicial authorities will investigate the case in a
fair and impartial manner," Yu said.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of the KRTC scandal, the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP) approval rating has shown signs of decline,
prompting a group of 70 party legislators to sign a statement of
intent to reform and reinvigorate the party.</P>
      <P>Yu said every political party in a democratic country should make
self-reflections and self-improvements constantly because people can
use their votes to decide which party should be in power or be
ousted.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the DPP is the most democratic and most active in
self-reflection, Yu said the DPP will definitely be able to weather
its current challenges and emerge even stronger through its internal
soul-searching and self-examination mechanism.</P>
      <P>Yu also denied that the KRTC labor scandal has tarnished the
DPP's clean image, claiming that the DPP has never wavered from its
reform-centric platform or its commitment to clean politics,
transparency and accountability.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2ND PHASE OF FINANCIAL REFORM FREE OF FAVORITISM: PRESIDENTIAL AIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The second phase of financial reform is by
no means favoring a few domestic large financial groups as claimed by
opposition parties, President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"President Chen disagrees in no uncertain terms with opposition
criticism that the nation's ongoing second phase of financial reform
favors a few private financial groups at the expense of overall
public interests, " Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun
said.</P>
      <P>Acting on President Chen's directive, Yu said, Vice Premier Wu
Rong-i, Finance Minister Lin Chuan, Council for Economic Planning and
Development Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng and Financial Supervisory
Commission Chairman Kung Jao-sheng will co-host a news conference
Thursday afternoon to expound on the significance of the second phase
of financial reform.</P>
      <P>Yu said President Chen's resolve to carry out the second-phase
financial reform will not be sullied by unfounded criticism.</P>
      <P>In his view, Yu said critics of the financial reform are mostly
narrow-minded and short-sighted pundits and politicians.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is obligated to open its financial market to foreign
investors in line with its World Trade Organization entry, Yu said
more foreign banks will set up branches in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"If local banks fail to merge or integrate to generate economies
of scale, they will eventually go bankrupt amid ever more intense
foreign competition, " Yu said. Noting that major goals of the second
phase of financial reform are to encourage local banks and financial
institutions to merge so as to expand their market shares, Yu said
the privatization of state-owned banks is by no means aimed at giving
favors to private business groups as claimed by detractors.</P>
      <P>"The privatization is instead aimed at improving operational
efficiency and upgrading their global competitiveness," Yu explained.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, U.S.-based Citibank's return on investment (ROI)
reaches an average of 34 percent, while all Taiwan banks' average ROI
is a mere 8 percent.</P>
      <P>"Given this figure, how can our banks compete with their foreign
counterparts if the government fails to take active steps to
encourage mergers and restructuring," Yu said.</P>
      <P>When he took over as premier Feb. 1, 2002, Yu recalled that
Taiwan banks had a record-high non-performing loan (NPL) rate.</P>
      <P>"Thanks to our successful first phase of financial reform, the
NPL rate has been lowered substantially and most local banks now no
longer face financial crises," Yu said, adding that he believes that
the second phase of financial reform will further enhance local
banks' global competitiveness so long as the reform goals can be
realized.</P>
      <P>Major reform goals include halving the number of state-owned
banks from 16 to eight and halving the number of local financial
holding groups, Yu said, adding that the goals were one of the
conclusions reached at a cross-party national economic conference on
Aug. 26, 2001.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO STUDY NT DOLLAR-RENMINBI EXCHANGE TRIAL: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan-China currency exchange services that
began Monday on Kinmen and Matsu islands on a trial basis have gained
warm public response and the government will further study the issue
to better service the people, Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh issued the instruction during a weekly Cabinet meeting, in
which relevant government agencies, such as the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) and the Central Bank of China, were required to conduct
an assessment which will serve as a foundation for future government
policy-making after the current trial period has ended.</P>
      <P>The government will move ahead with the service and gauge the
possibility of establishing a currency settlement system between the
new Taiwan dollar and the renminbi, the premier said.</P>
      <P>The new Taiwan dollar-renminbi exchange services began Monday on
the outlying Kinmen and Matsu islands, from where China-bound
passengers, mainly Taiwan businessmen and tourists, can use their
direct shipping links to Xiamen and Fuzhou in China's Fujian province
-- popularly called the "mini three links" that were opened in
January, 2001.</P>
      <P>Transactions were sluggish on the first day due to a bypassing
typhoon, but trading worth more than 700,000 renminbi was made on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan passengers highly praised the service, saying that the
measure helps them save a lot of trouble in exchanging renminbi and
provides them with a legal channel to get rid of fake Chinese
currency despite the fact that the exchange rate is a little higher
on Kinmen and Matsu than on Chinese black markets.</P>
      <P>In the past, Taiwan visitors had to approach local tourist
agencies on Kinmen and Matsu or black markets in China to exchange
new Taiwan dollars to renminbi -- a practice that made many of them
suffer monetary losses when taking in fake notes.</P>

now be turned over to Taiwan because the Republic of China government
has guaranteed it will not use the death penalty.</P>
      <P>The Lausanne-based Federal Tribunal ruled last year that Taiwan
should be given access to the bank documents, but later upheld an
appeal from the family of former Taiwan arms dealer Andrew Wang that
previous assurances from Taiwan that it would not invoke the death
penalty against Wang were non-binding and had to be improved.</P>
      <P>ROC Premier Frank Hsieh has gave new assurances Aug. 26 and the
court was satisfied that they were binding, enabling the transfer of
the documents, a Swiss federal tribunal judgment said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has charged Wang with murder, corruption, money laundering
and fraud. The "no death penalty" guarantee covers members of his
family, even though they are not charged with the same crimes.</P>
      <P>The case concerns allegations that the French firm Elf Aquitaine
used kickbacks in the early 1990s to persuade French authorities to
approve the sale of six Lafayette-class frigates to Taiwan, and to
encourage Taiwan to buy the warships in a deal worth US$2.8 billion.</P>
      <P>Wang was an agent in Taiwan for Thomson-CSF, the French firm that
sold six Lafayette frigates to Taiwan for US$2.8 billion. He fled
Taiwan following the death of an ROC Navy captain, Yin Ching-feng,
who was widely believed to have been murdered when he was about to
blow the whistle on colleagues for allegedly taking kickbacks in the
Lafayette deal.</P>
      <P>The ships had all been delivered to Taiwan by the mid-1990s, and
both Switzerland and Liechtenstein have frozen funds in Wang's and
his son's accounts allegedly linked to the case.</P>
      <P>The investigations began when Taiwanese authorities concluded
from the inflated price that the deal constituted a serious case of
international corruption.</P>
      <P>France, Liechtenstein and Taiwan, investigating whether the case
had violated their laws, asked the Swiss authorities to hand over the
bank documents to facilitate their investigations.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, some US$500 million remains frozen in
46 accounts with different banks in Switzerland as part of a Swiss
investigation into alleged money laundering linked to the Lafayette
case. Authorities in neighboring Liechtenstein have frozen around
US$27 million as part of their own investigations, the reports said.</P>
      <P>With the Swiss supreme court ruling, the biggest obstacle to
Taiwan's access to Swiss bank files has been removed. As to when the
documents can be transferred to Taiwan's judicial authorities, it's
up to a final decision by the Swiss Federal Commission.</P>
      <P>The Federal Commission is not expected to make a negative
decision against the document handover, but it remains unclear when
the commission will handle the case.</P>
      <P>A Swiss official said the soon-to-be-realized first-ever judicial
exchange will mark a significant development in relations between
Taiwan and Switzerland.</P>

      <P>Ruling and opposition parties were in unison
in applauding Shih Ming-teh, former chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , and his advocacy of ethnic harmony,
inter-party reconciliation and cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks at the launch of the "Shih Ming-teh Chair"
at National Taiwan University's Political Science Department.</P>
      <P>In addition to President Chen Shui-bian, DPP Chairman Su
Tseng-chang, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou,
Legislative Yuan President and former KMT Vice Chairman Wang
Jin-pyng, and New Party Chairman Yok Mu-ming were on hand to greet
Shih.</P>
      <P>"The Shih Ming-teh Chair" plans to promote a series of research
programs and lectures centered on the themes of ethnic harmony,
political reconciliation and cross-strait peace each year and present
scholarships.</P>
      <P>Su lauded Shih for being a brave and humorous man with a rich
life, calling him a prophet. He recalled Shih being involved in the
Kaohsiung Incident in his younger days as a dissident, and his term
as DPP chairman during which he promoted reconciliation to avoid
inter-party bickering.</P>
      <P>Both Ma and Wang said that Shih's ideals can help Taiwan overcome
its difficulties.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the most admirable personality trait of Shih is his
consistency. He said that the public trusts Shih when he promotes
ethnic harmony, partisan reconciliation and cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>"Although it is uncertain whether these ideal can be fulfilled,
at least we should try to realize them," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taiwan's problems are not economic or
diplomatic, and that if there were some improvement in ethnic
harmony, partisan reconciliation and cross-strait peace on the
island, Taiwan wouldn't have fallen behind South Korea in national
development in such a short time.</P>
      <P>Regarding the president's proposal that Shih coordinate a meeting
between ruling and opposition party leaders, Ma said that inter-party
reconciliation will not be easy given the fact that the perceptions
on various issues is so far apart among the various parties.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that Shih, who was imprisoned for 25 years in the days
of KMT authoritarian rule, chose tolerance and forgiveness toward his
political enemies after being freed. Moreover, when his party was
finally leading the nation, he did not shy away from criticizing the
ruling party if he felt it was warranted.</P>
      <P>Shih is truly a man who pursues and dedicates himself to
democratic ideals, Wang added.</P>
      <P>For his part, Yok said that Shih has a broad vision and
a romantic nature, traits that have aided him in pursuing his goals.</P>

      <P>Taipei has requested Washington to grant
former ROC President Lee Teng-hui due diplomatic courtesy during his
visit to the United States next week, ROC Representative to the
United States David Ta-wei Lee said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee said he has sent a letter to the U.S. Department of State and
has also held talks with Department of State officials to ask the
U.S. government to facilitate the former president's immigration and
customs clearance and provide him with security.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government is expected to reply to Taiwan's request very
soon, Lee said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) is
planning to offer subsidies to encourage Taiwan households that need
long-term caregivers to hire local people, a CLA official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The CLA may offer NT$5,000 a month to each household hiring a
Taiwanese caregiver for 12 consecutive months as an incentive, said
Kuo Fang-yu, director-general of the CLA Employment and Vocational
Training Administration.</P>
      <P>Several social activist groups have expressed concern that the
CLA was considering lowering the threshold for hiring foreign
nationals as household caregivers by Taiwan health care institutions
or families that have elderly, babies or patients with chronic
diseases. The liberalized policy, the activists said, will impede the
development of Taiwan's own caregiving system, which has burgeoned
only in recent years.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that the activists need not worry, adding that the
government has been working to help Taiwan nationals in a
three-pronged approach via health, social and labor affairs to work
as household caregivers and is building a human resources network for
this.</P>
      <P>At a news conference held at the Legislative Yuan, Wu Yu-chin,
secretary-general of the Taiwan Elderly Welfare Promotion Alliance,
lashed out at the CLA's plans to further relax restrictions on
foreign caregiver employment in Taiwan, saying that the policy is
tantamount to a hard slap across the face to the country's burgeoning
caregiving industry.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-fang, secretary-general of the Taiwan Household
Caregivers Association, questioned the meaning of the vocational
training provided by the Employment and Vocational Training
Administration to Taiwanese residents to make them trained
caregivers.</P>
      <P>Can the CLA provide job opportunities as well to these people?
Chen asked.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Shih Ming-teh on Thursday urged political
leaders to show wisdom by leading the people in the right direction
and giving them faith in their leadership.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks at a ceremony to announce the opening of
the "Shih Ming-teh Chair" at National Taiwan University's Department
of Political Science.</P>
      <P>Shih said that political leaders should have the wisdom to point
out a direction, adding that if the DPP only wants to cling to power
forever and the opposition parties only seek to return to power, then
they will be locked into a single goal, which is not a direction.</P>
      <P>Shih, who was twice sentenced to life in prison on charges of
sedition and jailed for 25 years before being freed, also said that
political leaders should stand their ground on their respective
directions.</P>
      <P>Political leaders should also have a discerning eye to put the
right men in the right positions, and that they should also have
leadership charisma to give faith to the people, Shih said.</P>
      <P>The "Shih Ming-teh Chair" will promote a series of lectures along
with research programs centered on the themes of "ethnic harmony,
political reconciliation and cross-Taiwan Strait peace" each year and

      <P>David Laitin, a Stanford University professor who specializes in
ethnic issues, has been invited to speak in the academic series.</P>
      <P>Frederik Willem de Klerk, former president of South Africa, has

Klerk was awarded the Nobel peace prize along with Nelson Mandela in

compulsory Chinese classes by the end of 2007.</P>
      <P>The Education Ministry hopes that all high schools across the

    <HEADLINE>KMT WANTS GOVERNMENT TO SUSPEND SECOND PHASE OF FINANCIAL REFORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Thursday urged the government to suspend the second
phase of its financial reform plan, saying that the government needs
to clear public suspicions that the plan is favoring specific large
financial groups in the name of privatization.</P>
      <P>At a news conference in the Legislative Yuan, Pan Wei-kang, a
whip of the KMT legislative caucus, said that Presidential Office
Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun should have explained Wednesday how the
government intends to cope with Taiwan's deteriorating economic
climate, instead of just declaring that President Chen Shui-bian is
determined to implement the second phase of financial reform.</P>
      <P>Noting that the president had asked Yu rather than Premier Frank
Hsieh to make the announcement, KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao wondered
if there was something wrong with the relationship between the
president and the premier.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lai Ching-te, a whip of the legislative caucus of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), defended the financial
reform plan, saying that the aim of the plan is to increase the
competitiveness of Taiwan's banks in the global market.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the five largest banks in Taiwan have a
collective market share of only 38 percent. However, the market share
for the five largest banks in Hong Kong is 78 percent; in South
Korea, the share is 89 percent.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the legislature's Finance Committee, the debate
on the financial reform plan turned into loud quarrels between DPP
and KMT legislators, with the opposition side questioning whether the
president has the right to intervene in the Cabinet's domain and
cause confusion in the nation's constitutional system.</P>
      <P>The second phase of financial reform, announced by the president
last year, aims to halve the number of state-owned banks to six and
cut the number of financial holding companies by half to seven
through mergers.</P>
      <P>The plan requires the joint assets of any three banks to exceed
10 percent of the total value of Taiwan's banking sector. It also
plans to let at least one bank be run by a foreign financial
institution.</P>
      <P>The government has insisted that the reforms are necessary
because Taiwan has too many small banks, which have a high percentage
of bad debts and lack the ability to compete in the global market.</P>

(By H. C. Wu and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thai women generally marry Taiwan men as a
way to work legally in the country, not out of love, sources familiar
with the matter said Thursday.</P>
      <P>So far, over 12,000 women from Thailand have entered Taiwan
through marriages of convenience to obtain permanent residence and
get a job, according to a source at a Taiwan expatriates association
in Bangkok.</P>
      <P>Taiwan men and Thai women form the second-largest number of
marriages of convenience in Taiwan, behind only Taiwan husbands and
Chinese wives, the source said, adding that many Thai women first
divorce their Thai spouses at home to marry again in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>These "fake Thai brides" usually make money in Taiwan by giving
Thai-style massages, but many do other things to try to earn enough
to repay their brokers, who charge them about US$7,500 to bring them
into Taiwan, the source said. That amount is roughly equal to 3.5
years' income for the average Thai in Thailand.</P>
      <P>Bangkok municipal officials said that they pay attention to
relevant developments and vigorously screen marriage registrations by
Thai women and foreigners. Currently, such marriage registration
numbers have dropped to about 10 per month from more than 200 in the
past, they noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT HOPES TO REDUCE FREQUENCY OF ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
the Dec. 3 "three-in-one" elections are an important landmark in the
government's efforts to reduce the frequency of elections in the
country.</P>
      <P>Making the comment in the latest issue of his online newsletter,
Chen noted that the government has long been studying the feasibility
of combining the existing elections in such a way that central-level
elections could be held at the same time and local-level elections be
held separately at the same time.</P>
      <P>The government's decision to hold the elections for city and
county chiefs, city and county councilors, as well as township and
village heads at the same time is a major step toward that goal, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that elections have been held almost every year
in Taiwan since 2000, which he said has been very tiresome both to
himself and to the public.</P>
      <P>On public concern that combining the elections might complicate
law-enforcement authorities' efforts to crack down on vote-buying,
Chen said he does not think there is a correlation between the two
matters.</P>
      <P>Chen said it is the government's job to make all necessary
preparations beforehand to eliminate corrupt practices to build up an
election culture that is not tainted by money or violence.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that democracy is not all about elections and that
whether a country is democratic or not does not depend on how many
elections it holds.</P>
      <P>Repeated elections will only damage the unity of the people and
increase their confrontation, Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to the president, elections should be a process of
seeking majority consensus, and everyone should accept the results
after the elections are over.</P>
      <P>If elections are held too frequently, the losers will have a hard
time recovering from the bad feeling of defeat, which is unfavorable
to political stability and the development of the country, the
president said.</P>

      <P>Sakenu, a Paiwan tribesman who writes novels in his free time as

leading to the quiet mountainous village.</P>
      <P>"The Sage Hunter" was shown at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN INVESTMENT FEVER IN CHINA SUBSIDING: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign investment fever in China might have
subsided, as the figure for foreign direct investment (FDI) there has
posted the first-ever decrease, according to a report issued
Thursday.</P>
      <P>FDI in China totaled US$37.99 billion in the first eight months
of this year, a decline of 3.02 percent year on year and the first
such fall since 1999 -- an indication that suggests foreign
investment fever in China might have calmed, according to the report
by Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research researcher Ku
Ying-hua, which appeared in an electronic newspaper run by the
Investment Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>During the same period, Taiwan investment in China also dwindled
by 18.3 percent to US$3.593 billion in value for 853 investment plans
-- an annual drop of 42 percent, the report said.</P>
      <P>Ku ascribed Taiwan's sliding investment in China to the effects
of China's efforts to cool down its overheated economy and to a
fading investment pattern, given that almost all Taiwan businesses
suitable for relocation have already moved out of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The foreign investment rush in China over the past few years was
mainly a result of China's much-anticipated entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) , Ku said, pointing out that the fever was
set to be on the wane after China joined the WTO at the end of 2001.</P>
      <P>Before 2000, foreign companies focused their investment on
export-oriented processing businesses, but such investment has become
increasingly unprofitable due to rising labor costs in China and its
WTO entry, which Ku pointed out allows foreign traders to directly
purchase in China at lower prices thanks to reduced customs duties.</P>

together to celebrate the creation of the special academic forum to
promote ethnic harmony, political reconciliation and cross-strait
peace, " Chen said, adding he is hopeful that Shih will help set the
stage for him to "savor the coffee of amity" with two opposition
heavyweights -- Ma and People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong.</P>
      <P>Shih, a political dissident-turned politician who was jailed for
25 years during the KMT administration, once served as DPP chairman
but quit the party a couple of years ago due to different political
views with DPP leadership.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's ethnic strains lie in the "2-28 Incident"
and the 38-year martial law era under the KMT's authoritarian rule,
Chen said ethnic harmony holds the key to Taiwan's efforts to become
a "normal" and consolidated country.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, all the contradictions and animosity among
different ethnic groups will be eased if the historical truth can be
clarified and established.</P>
      <P>Touching on political reconciliation, Chen ascribed the present
domestic political impasse mainly to the absence of an effective
mechanism to resolve deadlocked issues.</P>
      <P>In 1994, Taiwan revised the Constitution to pave the way for the
first direct presidential election in 1996. In 1997, another round of
constitutional amendments canceled the Legislative Yuan's right to
approve the presidential nomination of the premier, leading the
constitutional system to tilt toward a presidential system.</P>
      <P>Under the present constitutional system, Chen said, the president
is authorized to appoint a premier and the whole Cabinet without the
consent of the legislature. On the other hand, he said, the
Constitution does not prescribe that the majority party in the
legislature can form a Cabinet.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, a political deadlock tends to happen when
the president's party fails to control a majority in the legislature.
We are right now mired in such a predicament," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that both the ruling and opposition parties are obliged to
promote sustainable national development and the people's well-being,
Chen said he aspires to cooperate with the opposition in crafting a
viable constitutional system that fits Taiwan's needs and political
reality.</P>
      <P>To show the sincerity of his desire for political reconciliation,
Chen offered to deliver a report to the legislature on a long-stalled
arms procurement package to seek support for all relevant bills.</P>
      <P>Claiming that "investment in national defense is tantamount to
investment in peace, " Chen said Taiwan must beef up its defense
capability to ensure lasting cross-Taiwan Strait peace.</P>
      <P>"I am willing to personally deliver a report to the legislature
on the arms deal," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, Chen said, the opposition-controlled legislature can
then pass bills related to the plan to procure three big-ticket
weaponry items from the United States.</P>
      <P>For more than a year, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
KMT and PFP has used its slim majority in the legislature to
stonewall two bills regarding the robust arms procurement package for
various reasons, including political bickering with the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, fear of sparking a cross-strait arms
race and aversion to squeezing funds for other national development
plans.</P>
      <P>Listed in the procurement package are eight diesel-electric
submarines, six Patriot PAC-III anti-missile batteries and a squadron
of 12 anti-submarine P-3C aircraft.</P>

      <P>It is up to the Legislative Yuan to decide
if and when it will invite President Chen Shui-bian to brief the
legislature, Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Thursday.</P>
      <P>If Chen opts to visit the Legislative Yuan and address the
legislators, he should emulate his U.S. counterpart in delivering a
state of the nation speech in the Legislative Yuan at the beginning
of the first session of each year by common consent of a majority of
the legislators, as stipulated in the Constitution, Wang pointed out.</P>
      <P>Chen said earlier in the day that he is willing to expound on his
administration's long-stalled arms procurement package in the
Legislative Yuan in an attempt to win opposition support for all
relevant bills.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Chen's offer, Wang said that should the president
be allowed to address the legislature, his speech should be a state
of the nation address encompassing all major issues of the country
rather than only the arms procurement bill.</P>
      <P>Besides, Wang added, it is a matter to be decided by the
legislators themselves, not the president.</P>
      <P>Wang said he will see to it that arrangements are made if the
legislators agree to invite Chen to make a legislative address.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
proposed last year that the Legislative Yuan invite Chen to address

    <HEADLINE>WORLD FIRST: TAIWAN DRONE FLIES THROUGH TYPHOON LONGWANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A pilotless plane launched by Taiwan flew
through the eye of Typhoon Longwang last weekend to obtain
information about the typhoon at first hand -- the first time such an
undertaking has been successfully carried out anywhere in the world,
the National Science Council (NSC) under the Cabinet said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The research project, codenamed "Aerosonde, " has been going on
for seven years with the participation of the Department of
Atmospheric Sciences of National Taiwan University, the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB) and the Chungshan Institute of Science and
Technology under the auspices of the NSC. It came to fruition Oct.
1-2 when Typhoon Longwang was approaching Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the NSC, a few hours after a test flight over the
southernmost tip of Taiwan, the drone headed directly toward
Longwang. It flew into the eye of the typhoon and hovered around the
center for nearly an hour.</P>
      <P>At 3,000 meters, the plane recorded the speed of the center winds
at 52 meters per second, almost exactly the same as the speed
recorded by the CWB at sea level. It also recorded a drastic change
in atmospheric temperature from 20 degrees Celsius at 1,500 meters to
24 degrees C at about 500 meters.</P>
      <P>While the plane was leaving the radius of the typhoon, its
equipment detected a maximum wind speed of 70 meters per second at
3,000 meters -- comparable to 252 kph. However, just as the drone was
about to get out of the storm's radius, its engine stalled and it
plunged from 4,300 meters into the sea.</P>
      <P>The NSC said scientists will continue to use drones to gather
information about atmospheric changes so that correct warnings can be
issued in time to minimize losses during typhoons or in the rainy
season.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Fisheries Administration under the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) will hold a seminar Friday
to find ways to scrutinize the safety of Taiwan's aquaculture produce
following a series of incidents that have impacted the industry, a
COA spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The seminar will focus discussions on wiping out the use of
chemical residues and pollutants in fishery products in order to
revive the glory of the industry, which has been seriously affected
after the discovery of banned substances found in fishery exports to
the European Union and Japan a few years ago, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Recently, several batches of groupers for sale in the domestic
market were also detected to contain malachite green -- a synthetic
carcinogenic dye used illegally by unscrupulous fishpond operators as
an antibacterial, he added.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries Administration hopes to establish a set of criteria
on limiting chemical use and avoiding pollution in Taiwan's fishery
produce through discussions with local aquaculturalists and experts
in the seminar to better protect consumers and secure Taiwan's food
safety, he said.</P>
      <P>As one of the world's major fish suppliers, Taiwan must
effectively step up its food safety controls and management to meet
high international standards and to ensure that the domestic industry
can enjoy sustainable growth, he stressed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu expressed support
Thursday for the "new DPP movement" that 70 legislators of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) endorsed the day before aimed at
calling on the DPP to reflect upon itself and "enter a period of
rebirth."</P>
      <P>Lu said that the "new DPP movement" coincides with her open
appeal to the country two months ago for political reforms and
rejuvenation to help Taiwan meet the severe challenges it faces in
the 21st Century.</P>
      <P>The vice president added that not only should the DPP change and
reform, the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) should also do the same.
</P>
      <P>Seventy DPP legislators declared their support Wednesday for the
"new DPP movement" to revive the party's core values amid public
criticism that the DPP is becoming corrupt even faster than the KMT
it replaced as the ruling party in 2000.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Wen-chung, one of the initiators of the movement,
said the DPP must heed the voices of the public and insist on being a
party that takes care of the less privileged and maintains the
principles of equality and justice.</P>
      <P>When asked Thursday by reporters if President Chen Shui-bian, a
former DPP chairman, will be unhappy with the initiation of the
movement, Lu answered: "Absolutely not, " adding that "it is our
common ideal."</P>
      <P>In response to the initiation of the movement, former DPP
Chairman Shih Ming-teh expressed admiration for the sponsoring DPP
legislators, describing the move as a "good political phenomenon."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MINISTER DEFENDS 'NO DEATH PENALTY' VOW IN LAFAYETTE KICKBACK CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin defended
Premier Frank Hsieh's "no death penalty" guarantee in handling a
kickback case involving Taiwan's purchase of six Lafayette-class
frigates from France in the early 1990s.</P>
      <P>"The premier's promise will help upgrade our national image but
will not affect judicial independence, " Shih said while attending a
seminar on the campaign against vote-buying ahead of the year-end
"three-in-one" elections.</P>
      <P>Shih's clarification came a day after Switzerland's supreme court
ruled that bank documents relating to the Lafayette kickback case
should be turned over to the Taiwan authorities because the Republic
of China government has guaranteed that it will not invoke the death
penalty against Andrew Wang, a key suspect in the scandal.</P>
      <P>Hsieh gave the "no death penalty" assurances Aug. 26 and the
Swiss court was satisfied, enabling the transfer of the documents, a
Swiss federal tribunal judgment said.</P>
      <P>The Swiss court's ruling immediately drew a backlash from some
opposition Taiwan lawmakers, who claimed that Hsieh has infringed
upon judicial power and undermined Taiwan's sovereignty and
international image by making such an assurance.</P>
      <P>In response, Shih said such criticisms are unjustified because
the premier made a comprehensive evaluation before signing the
assurance.</P>
      <P>"The assurance is mainly related to prosecutorial power and has
nothing to do with judges' independent exercise of their power," Shih
claimed.</P>
      <P>Describing the Lafayette kickback case as very complicated, Shih
said the collection of Swiss bank files is expected to offer valuable
and useful clues to the truth.</P>
      <P>"The kickback case involves a large sum of money. If we can
retrieve the cash, it would benefit our national coffers," Lin
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Switzerland has long abolished the death penalty. Many other
advanced countries are also moving in that direction and Shih said he
believes that Hsieh's "no death penalty" vow will not tarnish
Taiwan's international image.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said Hsieh carefully
weighed national interests and due process of law before making his
decision.</P>
      <P>The premier signed the judicical aid pact with Switzerland mainly
because he believes the move will facilitate the investigation into
the corruption case and the retrieval of the kickbacks, estimated at
more than NT$10 billion, Cho said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Cho said, Hsieh conducted extensive consultations with
law enforcement authorities before making the move.</P>
      <P>"The decision neither violates due process of law nor basic human
rights principles," Cho added.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Lee Ching-hua said the
government should have Wang extradited back to Taiwan to serve as a
suspect-turned-prosecution-witness to facilitate the probe into
whether any Taiwan politicians or military officials obtained illegal
kickbacks from the Lafayette deal.</P>
      <P>The case concerns allegations that the French firm Elf Aquitaine
used kickbacks in the early 1990s to persuade the French authorities
to approve the sale of six Lafayette-class frigates to Taiwan, and to
encourage Taiwan to buy the warships in a deal worth US$2.8 billion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has charged Wang with murder, corruption, money laundering
and fraud. He was an agent in Taiwan for Thomson-CSF, the French
company that sold the frigates to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang fled Taiwan following the death of ROC Navy Captain Yin
Ching-feng, who was widely believed to have been murdered when he was
about to blow the whistle on colleagues for allegedly taking
kickbacks in the deal.</P>
      <P>The ships had all been delivered to Taiwan by the mid-1990s, and
both Switzerland and Liechtenstein have frozen funds in Wang's and
his son's accounts that are allegedly linked to the case.</P>
      <P>The investigations began when the Taiwanese authorities concluded
from the inflated price that the deal constituted a serious case of
international corruption.</P>
      <P>France, Liechtenstein and Taiwan, investigating whether the case
had violated their laws, asked the Swiss authorities to hand over the
bank documents to facilitate their investigations.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, some US$500 million remains frozen in
46 accounts with different banks in Switzerland as part of a Swiss
investigation into alleged money laundering linked to the case.
Authorities in neighboring Liechtenstein have frozen around US$27
million as part of their own investigations, the reports said.</P>
      <P>With the Swiss supreme court ruling, the biggest obstacle to
Taiwan's access to Swiss bank files has been removed. As to when the
documents can be transferred to Taiwan's judicial authorities, that
is up to a final decision by the Swiss Federal Commission.</P>
      <P>The Federal Commission is not expected to make a negative
decision against the document handover, but it remained unclear when
the commission will handle the case.</P>
      <P>A Swiss official said the judicial exchange, the first of its
kind, will mark a significant development in relations between Taiwan
and Switzerland.</P>

      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
Thursday dismissed as "phony" President Chen Shui-bian's proposal for
reconciliation between the opposition and the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Responding to Chen's call in a speech for an end to domestic
political bickering, PFP spokesman Hsieh Kung-ping said it is phony
for the president to mention reconciliation after he unilaterally
scrapped the conclusions reached at a meeting he had with PFP
Chairman James Soong in February, thereby ruining the opportunity for
reconciliation.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that in meeting with the president, Soong resisted
mounting pressure and risked being "misunderstood by the public."
However, he added, barely a few months later, the president not only
trashed the pledges he made in his agreement with Soong, but also
made "false accusations" about Soong meeting with a ranking Chinese
official in secret in the United States.</P>
      <P>The PFP spokesman criticized the president for lacking the
courage to apologize to Soong, saying that Chen is not sincere in
seeking reconciliation.</P>
      <P>On Chen's willingness to go to the Legislative Yuan to discuss a
controversial arms procurement plan, Hsieh said the plan was already
voted down in a referendum held alongside the presidential election
in March last year and that the president should respect the
conclusion reached in a democratic manner.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Wu Rong-i said Thursday the
government will keep close tabs on the implementation of the second
phase of financial reform to prevent any irregularities or favoritism.</P>
      <P>Wu made the pledge at a news conference aimed at allaying public
misgivings that the reforms might favor specific large financial
conglomerates in the name of privatization.</P>
      <P>Also present at the news conference were Finance Minister Lin
Chuan, Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairman
Hu Sheng-cheng and Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman
Kung Jao-sheng.</P>
      <P>Wu said the government will oversee every step of the
privatization of state-owned banks and mergers among them to prevent
any private financial conglomerate from gaining unfair or illegal
favors in the reform process.</P>
      <P>The second phase of financial reforms, announced by the president
last year, aims to halve the number of state-owned banks to six and
cut the number of financial holding companies by half to seven
through mergers.</P>
      <P>The plan requires the joint assets of any three banks to exceed
10 percent of the total value of Taiwan's banking sector. It also
plans to let at least one bank be run by a foreign financial
institution.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, CEPD Chairman Hu said he is
confident that the goal of halving the number of state-owned banks
will be realized by the end of this year as scheduled, despite a
setback in selling off the Medium Business Bank of Taiwan earlier
this year.</P>
      <P>He said it is hoped that success in halving the number of
state-owned banks will encourage private financial holding companies
to accelerate mergers among themselves so as to realize the goal of
halving their number to seven by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, FSC Chairman said local banks and financial
institutions must merge or integrate to generate economy of scale if
they are to survive the ever-intensifying global competition.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Google Inc. international affairs
spokesman said Thursday that the company only received a letter of
concern from Taiwan authorities a day earlier complaining about
Google Maps service's reference to Taiwan as a "province of China."</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that Google Inc., headquartered in Silicon
Valley, California, was unaware of Taiwan's ire prior to receiving
the letter. He referred to Google's reference to Taiwan as a province
of China as being in line with international naming conventions based
on the United Nations ISO country codes.</P>
      <P>He told the CNA that Google has since begun looking into the
matter.</P>
      <P>The spokesman, however, denied accusations that Google would go
to any lengths to get into China's online market, including
describing Taiwan in a way that would not draw the ire of Beijing,
saying that it is impossible for Google to use misleading information
on its Maps services.</P>
      <P>He added that the Google Maps' Taiwan section is purely aimed at
providing users with data such as business locations and driving
directions and that the Taiwan map has nothing to do with China.</P>
      <P>Reports from Taiwan said that Taiwan authorities and legislators
are up in the arms over the Google Maps description of Taiwan as a
province of China. Reports said that Taiwan's liaison offices in the
United States have been asked since Sept. 19 to convey Taiwan's
concern and indignation to Google Inc. about the matter, but the
requests have "all fallen on deaf ears."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's complaint is not the first that Google Maps has
received. Last year, South Koreans protested Google's use of the name
"Sea of Japan" to describe the sea between Japan and South Korea,
instead of the name "East China Sea." Following the protests, Google
decided to use both names on its maps in a bid to calm protests.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SETS GOAL OF ATTRACTING 3.2 MILLION FOREIGN TOURISTS IN 2005</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has set the target of
attracting at least 3.2 million tourists from abroad this year under
the "doubling tourist arrivals by 2008" goal announced in 2002,
Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Hsieh said that
Taiwan saw 2.9 million tourist arrivals from abraod last year and
that the figure is expected to grow by 300,000 this year to reach 3.2
million.</P>
      <P>He noted that foreign tourist arrivals are also expected to grow
by double-digit percentages annually in the years leading up to 2008.</P>
      <P>Should this be realized as planned, the goal of doubling tourist
arrivals to 5 million will be achieved by 2008, he added.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks in response to concerns expressed by
Legislator Tsai Chi-chang from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party about whether the goal of doubling tourist arrivals can be
achieved by 2008 as related costs in Taiwan have risen while the
administration's efficiency has declined.</P>
      <P>Reviewing the balance sheets of major government-run tourist
attractions nationwide, Tsai said that most have been breaking even
at best. He suggested that the government lease the tourist
attraction operations to private operators.</P>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and Communications Lin Ling-san said
that he has not been very satisfied with what Taiwan has done in
running advertisements abroad to attract tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee Chin-lung, minister of the Council of Agriculture, said that
as far as he knows, many officially-owned tourist attractions are
already being operated by private operators under contract. He
reminded the public that in the process of further promoting tourism,
the issue of over-development should be considered so as to prevent
the natural environment from being compromised.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACTING KAOHSIUNG MAYOR TO CONVENE TEAM TO LOOK INTO MRT PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Acting Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh Chu-lan announced
Friday the formation of a five-member team to look into the
controversial mass rapid transit (MRT) construction project in the
southern port city.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the announcement in a press conference one day after
reports cited ranking government officials as saying that President
Chen Shui-bian has asked Yeh to form a team to look into the matter.</P>
      <P>The team will see whether any of the Kaohsiung mayors who have
served since 1990, including current opposition Kuomintang Legislator
Wu Den-yih and Premier Frank Hsieh, should take administrative
responsibility for the MRT construction project, and whether a
former Presidential Office adviser and a Kaohsiung Rapid Transit
Corp. (KRTC) official were involved in profiteering in the project,
the reports also said.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that the team will be convened by herself and that the
members are two vice mayors -- Tang Chin-chuan who is specializes in
legal affairs, and engineering specialist Cheng Wen-lung -- as well
as Kaohsiung city government Secretary-General Hao Chien-sheng and
Department of Government Ethics Director Huang Sheng-yi.</P>
      <P>The team will complete its investigation report by Oct. 20 and
then report to the general public, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>She said that although judicial authorities have begun
investigations, there are still misgivings among members of the
public, and President Chen is concerned about the matter and is in
support of the formation of the team.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that the team will look into whether there have been any
kickbacks or racketeering involved in the MRT construction project,
and that former mayors, government and KRTC officials will all
be targets of investigation.</P>
      <P>"The team will seek the truth and make a clear account so as to
assuage any misgivings the public might have," she said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Fang Lai-chin, director of the Bureau of Labor Affairs 
under the city government, has tendered his resignation, Yeh said,
adding that she has approved the resignation.</P>
      <P>Fang was recently questioned by prosecutors and released on a
NT$200,000 bail (US$6,020) for his alleged involvement in the MRT 
construction project.</P>
      <P>Two key figures in the controversial MRT construction project --
Chen Che-nan and Chen Min-hsien -- also tendered their resignations
earlier this month.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan, who once served as a Presidential Office deputy
secretary-general, and Chen Min-hsien, who used to be vice chairman
of the KRTC, are suspected of involvement in an illegal profiteering
racket involving the employer -- the KRTC -- and a labor brokerage
firm that has exploited Thai laborers.</P>
      <P>The alleged racketeering scandal surfaced after a group of Thai
laborers working on the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit construction
project rioted on Aug. 21 in protest against what they perceived as
unfair and unjust treatment by management. Law enforcement
authorities have been investigating the cause of the riot and all
possible irregularities involved in the employment and management of
the Thai workers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS OF RULING PARTY RALLY AGAINST OPPOSITION-INITIATED BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of 50 lawmakers of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) rallied Friday in front of the
Legislative Yuan to show their determination to block a bill
initiated by the opposition People First Party (PFP) to promote peace
with China.</P>
      <P>Legislator William Lai, the whip of DPP legislative caucus, said
the so-called cross-strait peace-promotion bill is "seeking false
peace while in fact surrendering to China."</P>
      <P>He said that while Taiwan should unite to face up to China's
threat, especially in the face of Beijing's enactment earlier this
year of its so-called Anti-Secession Law giving Beijing the "legal"
option of taking Taiwan by force, the PFP and its political ally the
Kuomintang (KMT) have in fact been trying to supplicate to China by
coming up with the peace-promotion bill.</P>
      <P>Lai led his caucus members in chanting "false peace, actual
surrender," saying that his party will fight tooth and nail to thwart
it, despite being a minority party in the legislature.</P>
      <P>The two opposition parties, which between them command a slim
majority in the legislature, are expected to try to steamroller the
bill through the legislature next week as the imperative four-month
period of political negotiations among the political parties has
expired.</P>
      <P>The last attempt to put the bill to a vote was disrupted by the
DPP Sept. 27 when DPP lawmakers occupied the podium and paralyzed the
legislative session.</P>
      <P>The bill has triggered controversy because it would give the
legislature the power to open transportation links and to form a free
trade zone with China, which the DPP claims should be under the
authority of the executive branch.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER PLEDGES TO CONTINUE FINANCIAL REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh pledged Friday that the
government will continue its efforts to reform the country's
financial system, despite public differences over the reforms.</P>
      <P>Speaking during an interpellation session at the Legislative
Yuan, Hsieh pointed out that the reforms are based on a consensus
reached during the economic development conference in 2001 and that
the first phase of the reforms has successfully lowered the
non-performing loan ratio of domestic banks from 8 percent to 2
percent.</P>
      <P>Although some are opposed to the second phase of reforms, which
involves the privatization of state-owned banks and mergers between
banks, they must continue for the sake of the country's development,
Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He said it is out of date for the government to operate banks,
noting that none of the banks in the United States or Japan are owned
by the government.</P>
      <P>Also, it was a mistake that the government did not encourage
earlier mergers of domestic banks, he said.</P>
      <P>According to the premier, the number of banks in Taiwan is too
high compared with other countries and the situation has undermined
the competitiveness of domestic banks and has reduced their profit
margins.</P>
      <P>In the second phase of reforms, the government plans to halve the
number of state-owned banks to six by the end of this year and hopes
to have at least three domestic banks increase their market shares to
more than 10 percent.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government aims to cut the number of financial
holding companies by half to seven by the end of next year. It also
plans to allow at least one bank to be run by a foreign investor.</P>
      <P>However, some lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang have
accused the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government of
favoring certain pro-DPP financial conglomerates in the privatization
process of state-owned banks and have demanded that the reforms be
postponed.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Wu Rong-i promised a day earlier that the government
will oversee every step of the privatization and mergers to prevent
any private financial conglomerate from gaining unfair or illegal
favors in the reform process.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The service industry will be made another
major column, along with the high-tech sector, propping up Taiwan's
sustainable economic growth, Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday.</P>
      <P>Developing the service sector will be one of the pivotal
directions for national development in years to come, Hsieh said in
his address delivered during a ceremony marking the establishment of
the Association of Service Industry Development, Taiwan.</P>
      <P>By 2008, he said, production in the service sector is expected to
constitute 71 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP)
or higher, compared to the current level of 68 percent.</P>
      <P>The service industry basically encompasses every sector and
serves every member of society, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, he added, finding ways to expand the scale
and prowess of the service industry and sharpen its international
competitiveness has become one of the most urgent and imperative
tasks for the administration.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Taiwan can no longer rely on exports of low-end
labor-intensive products "like umbrellas" to sustain its economy
forward.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also cannot rely solely on the high-tech industry as the
only foreign exchange earner, since the industry hires fewer workers
in general than other sectors, Hsieh said. This, he added, is why
many industrially advanced countries suffer high unemployment.</P>
      <P>For the best solution, he said, Taiwan should continue to develop
its high-tech industry on one hand while striving to develop the
service industry on the other, which will provide huge numbers of
jobs and help arrest rising unemployment.</P>
      <P>Hsieh offered his congratulations upon the establishment of the
Association of Service Industry Development, Taiwan, which is poised
to serve as an arm in Taiwan's service industry development and also
as abridge between the government and the private sector.</P>
      <P>The premier said the association should feel free to contact the
administration and perhaps maintain a regular meeting system with the
government for better communications.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said in an interview with Japan's Sankei Shimbun published
Friday that he will continue to push for party reforms to create
favorable conditions for the party's return to power in the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>On the year-end "three-in-one" elections, Ma said the party will
not endorse anyone found to be involved in corrupt "black gold"
politics in the race.</P>
      <P>He also touched on the controversial party assets issue, saying
that the assets will be handled in a transparent manner and that the
issue will be dealt with overall by 2008.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait relations, Ma said both sides of the Taiwan
Strait should put aside the issue of sovereignty and develop economic
exchanges, saying that both sides should focus on economic exchanges
to expand substantive cross-strait relations based on the conclusion
reached between former KMT Chairman Lien Chan and his Chinese
counterpart Hu Jintao in late April in China.</P>
      <P>He also said the establishment of a confidence-building mechanism
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is an urgent task.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan cannot ignore the 700 missiles deployed by China
against Taiwan, Ma said arms procurements will not help solve
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Ma said he believes that cross-strait relations are strained
because China thinks the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration wants to change the status quo.</P>
      <P>On economic exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, Ma noted that
Taiwan exported around US$40 billion to China last year, which is
greater than its total exports to Japan, the United States and
Europe. He predicted that the close cross-strait economic exchanges
will not change.</P>
      <P>On whether it will be possible for him to visit China, he said
this will hinge on necessity and conditions but he did not rule out

      <P>Too much sulfur dioxide can also cause asthma, difficulty in
breathing, vomiting and diarrhea.</P>
      <P>There is no law regulating the tolerance of sulfur dioxide in
chopsticks, and four of the 10 samples tested positive for sulfur
dioxide had up to 200 ppm, which is much less than the 4,000 ppm
found in some dried day lily flowers.</P>
      <P>Also, the foundation said, one of the 37 samples was found to
have more than 100 ppm lead, which was rubbed off on the chopsticks
from the paint on the plastic bag used to wrap them.</P>
      <P>Four of the samples were found to have residue of fluorescent
brightening agent, a carcinogen, which is used to make the chopsticks
look brighter, the foundation said.</P>
      <P>Eighteen of the 37 chopsticks did not reveal the manufacturers'
name and address, even though this is required by law, said the
foundation.</P>
      <P>The foundation suggested that the public should use their own
chopsticks when eating out or dip the disposable chopsticks in hot
water for a few second before using them, as the sulfur dioxide
residue dissolves in hot water.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT PEACE-PROMOTION BILL UNHELPFUL TO PEACE: FOUNDATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A private group promoting peace urged the
country's two main opposition parties Friday to stop their plan to
steamroller a cross-strait peace-promotion bill through the
legislature.</P>
      <P>According to Chien Hsi-chieh, a leader of the Peacetime
Foundation of Taiwan, the bill is unhelpful to peace and will
intensify confrontation between the ruling and opposition parties
because of a lack of consensus on the legislation.</P>
      <P>Chien expressed his disapproval of the "special cross-strait
peace consultation committee" that the bill stipulates will be formed
by representatives of various political parties, calling such a
committee an anti-democratic organization designed merely for
partisan interests.</P>
      <P>The bill would also give the legislature the power to open
transportation links and to form a free trade zone with China, which
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) claims should be under
the authority of the executive branch.</P>
      <P>The opposition People First Party and Kuomintang, which together
control a slim majority in the legislature, are expected to make a
second attempt to put the bill to a vote next week after their last
attempt was disrupted by the DPP Sept. 27.</P>
      <P>A group of 50 DPP lawmakers rallied Friday in front of the
Legislative Yuan to show their determination to block the bill.</P>

      <P>An Indian software company said Friday it

cut their research and development (R&amp;D) costs through
establishing ODCs in Bangalore.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, the practice will also enable Taiwan to use
Bangalore's rich software development resources to design highly

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's decision to form a
five-member team led by acting Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh Chu-lan to
investigate possible profiteering in the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit
project met strong criticism from opposition parties Friday.</P>
      <P>The criticism followed Yeh's announcement that the team's members
include two vice mayors -- Tang Chin-chuan, who specializes in legal
affairs, and engineering specialist Cheng Wen-lung -- as well as
Kaohsiung City Government Secretary-General Hao Chien-sheng and
Department of Government Ethics Director Huang Sheng-yi.</P>
      <P>The team will present a report in two weeks after probing whether
the two former mayors of Kaohsiung -- incumbent opposition Kuomintang
Legislator Wu Den-yih and Premier Frank Hsieh -- and former acting
Mayor Chen Chi-mai, as well as officials of the Kaohsiung Rapid
Transit Corp., were involved in profiteering from the project.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the new development, Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said that as the acting mayor of
Kaohsiung, Yeh's power to investigate is very limited compared to
that of public prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that the focus should be on the ongoing judicial

      <P>Chang Hsien-yao, a legislator of the opposition People First

    <HEADLINE>KMT-PFP COOPERATION IN DECEMBER ELECTIONS LEAPS AHEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cooperation between the two "pan blue
alliance" parties, the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and its ally,
the People First Party (PFP) , in December's city and county chief
elections have leapt ahead after the PFP withdrew its candidates in
several constituencies.</P>
      <P>Although the PFP had pledged that it would field candidates in
every constituency regardless of KMT rivals' presence, three PFP
hopefuls -- Hsieh Chang-chieh in Changhua County, Cheng Mei-lan in
Illan County and Chiu Ching-chun in Hsinchu County -- announced
Tuesday they were quitting the race to avoid a split in the alliance.</P>
      <P>"Pan blue" supporters fear that such a split would leave the "pan
green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) with too great an advantage in the
elections, which are widely seen as a prelude to the next
presidential election in 2008.</P>
      <P>Hsieh bowed out of the Changhua County magistrate election on his
own volition, while Cheng and Chiu did so under PFP Chairman James
Soong's instruction in a last-minute effort before the deadline for
registration for the election, to ensure that KMT candidates would
beat "pan green" rivals in these areas.</P>
      <P>PFP Secretary-General Chin Ching-sheng expressed hope that the
party's self-sacrifice for the sake of overall interests will not be
met by disappointment and called on the KMT to show sincerity in
bilateral collaboration by compromising in Keelung City and Miaoli
County in favor of PFP candidates.</P>
      <P>The PFP is keen to initiate a new pattern of cooperation between
the two parties through the Dec. 3 election, Chin said.</P>
      <P>Dismissing mounting skepticism that the KMT is reluctant to give
way to any PFP aspirant, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said the KMT has
given up the idea of putting forth a candidate in Lienchiang County
(Matsu Island), where incumbent magistrate Chen Hsueh-sheng is a PFP
member.</P>
      <P>The KMT respects Chen's re-election willingness and claimed that
his party does not mean to "take it all," he added.</P>
      <P>However, the hurdles have not all been removed for
across-the-board KMT-PFP cooperation in the elections, as the two
parties also have failed to present a single candidate in Taichung
City, Hualien County, Keelung City and Miaoli County.</P>
      <P>KMT Organization Development Commission head Liao Feng-teh said
the party will do its best to maintain power in eight local
governments and that chances are favorable in Miaoli County, Taitung
County, Yilan County and Chiayi City.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the PFP can consider setting up joint campaign teams
and forming ruling coalitions if elected, he suggested.</P>
      <P>The elections will serve as a litmus paper to test the water for
Ma, who assumed the KMT chairmanship in August amid fervent
expectations from supporters that he could win back power in 2008.</P>
      <P>At present, the two "pan blue alliance" parties have not fared
well in putting forth a common candidate in 11 cities and counties
out of the total of 23. A total of 77 aspirants have registered to
run in the elections with each side vying to seize at least half of
the seats.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ruling DPP has tried hard to set the tune for the
elections as "purely regional" to counter the opposition's gambit of
making the race a "polarized duel" at a time when the ruling party is
ridden with various alleged corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>Critical to the elections will be the two camps' performances in
central cities and counties, and either side will be viewed as
victorious if it beats the other in the central region, due to the
fact that the "pan blue alliance" enjoys an advantage in northern
Taiwan while the "pan green camp" enjoys firm backing in southern
Taiwan, observers said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CIVIC GROUP LAUNCHES ARMS PURCHASE FUND DRIVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A civic group announced Friday that it will
launch a fundraising drive in which it hopes to persuade 1 million
people to each donate NT$100 (US$3) to help pay for the nation's arms
purchases from the United States.</P>
      <P>North Society executives made the announcement as a government
arms procurement package was blocked for the 31st time in the
Legislative Yuan this week because of obstruction by the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party.
</P>
      <P>The executives claimed that the drive will "help fund"
the arms purchase, cement national defense and highlight the Taiwan
people's determination to defend the country.</P>
      <P>According to them, it will also "whip up patriotism" and
apply pressure on the "pan-blue alliance, " which has used its slim
majority in the legislature to stonewall the government's proposed
arms procurement package for more than one year.</P>
      <P>The package includes three big-ticket items of weapons of eight
diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine
aircraft and six Patriot PAC-III anti-missile batteries.</P>
      <P>North Society President Wu Shu-ming criticized the "pan-blue
alliance" for boycotting the arms procurement package, saying that
"their deliberate obstruction will bring downfall to the nation."</P>
      <P>Wu claimed that his drive will raise the awareness that everyone
is responsible for the nation's defense, adding that the drive will
not only raise NT$100 million, but will be a manifestation of
Taiwan's identity.</P>
      <P>Society Vice President Yang Chi-wen noted that civic groups
marched late last month to express their aspirations to strengthen
national defense and claimed that President Chen Shui-bian has
continued to show goodwill toward the opposition parties, but the
"pan-blue alliance" has stuck to its guns.</P>
      <P>He was referring to a Sept. 25 march by an estimated 50,000
local people, mostly from pro-independence groups, to support the arms
procurement package.</P>
      <P>Society Secretary-General Yang Wen-chia said the legislature has
"turned into" an arena of political bickering that has hindered the
passage of the package and that his group has resorted to the
fundraising drive to drive home its voice.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) decided Friday to mobilize all its
members to show up for next Tuesday's legislative session when two
controversial bills are expected to be put to a vote by the
opposition parties.</P>
      <P>The caucus will demand thorough discussions on a bill governing
the formation of the National Communications Commission (NCC) before
it is put to a vote, and if the caucus fails to vote down the bill,
it will seek to have the legislature reconsider the bill some other
time or request a constitutional interpretation by the Council of
Grand Justices, according to Chao Yung-ching, the caucus convener.</P>
      <P>As for an opposition cross-Taiwan Strait peace-promotion bill,
the DPP will argue with the opposition parties on the basis of "sound
reason" and will not provoke physical clashes with opposition
lawmakers, he said.</P>
      <P>His remarks appeared somewhat at odds, however, with the ideas of
a group of female DPP legislators, who prepared for violent clashes
by borrowing protective gear from the police beforehand in order to
protect themselves in the chaos and violence they are sure will mar
Tuesday's proceedings.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers occupied the podium and paralyzed the legislative
session amid scenes of violence when their rivals from the opposition
Kuomintang and People First Party were attempting to take advantage
of their slim majority to steamroller the two bills through the
legislature Sept. 27.</P>
      <P>The DPP disagrees with the KMT and PFP on the composition of the
NCC. While the two opposition parties want the NCC to be comprised of
members in proportion to the number of seats each party holds in the
legislature, the DPP insists that political parties should keep their
hands off and let experts and scholars serve on the commission.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DPP is opposed to the cross-strait peace-promotion
bill because it would give the legislature the power to open
transportation links and to form a free trade zone with China, which
the party claims should be under the authority of the executive
branch.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's trade surplus for 2005 has been
estimated to reach a level between US$3 billion and US$2.6 billion --
a 23-year low, a government official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-chung, head of the Department of Statistics under the
Ministry of Finance, made the evaluation based on tallies released
earlier the same day by the ministry showing that Taiwan exports and
imports in September totaled US$16.2 billion and US$15.49 billion,
respectively, marking a monthly trade surplus of US$710 million and
bringing the total trade surplus for the first nine months to US$1.94
billion.</P>
      <P>Hsu forecast that the trade surplus for 2005 will hit around
US$2.6 billion and possibly as high as US$3 billion, helped by
booming outbound shipments in the fourth quarter. Even so, the
full-year figure for this year will be the lowest since 1982, when
the figure stood at US$3.3 billion, he pointed out.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is not really
prepared for inter-party reconciliation, Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), claimed Friday, even though the
president expressed his willingness Thursday to have a reconciliation
meeting over coffee with leaders of opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on the president's overture of reconciliation,
Ma said that honesty and trustworthiness are pivotal to ethnic
harmony, political reconciliation and cross-Taiwan Strait peace, and
that a man of integrity would need to put action behind his words.</P>
      <P>"So far, I don't see that President Chen is prepared for
reconciliation," he added.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman, who is also Taipei mayor, said the current
gridlock between the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the
opposition on a number of issues cannot be blamed on any single
party. However, he continued, the party that controls more resources
and is thus in a better position to resolve problems must shoulder a
greater share of the responsibility.</P>
      <P>In order to have inter-party reconciliation, a political leader's
words must count, and he "should not manipulate power and be
insincere from the very beginning," he said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he is willing to sit down for coffee with the
president and talk about reconciliation, Ma said that sipping coffee
together is really unnecessary, because people can feel if
reconciliation is being strived for as a reflection of good
government policy implementation.</P>

      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh warned Friday that the

parties plan to push through the legislature next week would put the
status quo across the Taiwan Strait in peril.</P>

      <P>As all these involve the exercise of public authority, Chen said
they should be addressed by officials from both sides or
officially-designated groups or units.</P>
      <P>Noting that his administration has commissioned appropriate
bodies to negotiate with China on the three issues, Chen said Beijing
is not entitled to unilaterally name Taiwan organizations to conduct
the talks.</P>
      <P>Asked whether negotiations have gotten underway or have made any
progress, Chen said the two sides have been in touch.</P>
      <P>Senior Chinese officials in charge of tourism affairs could visit
Taiwan in the near future, Chen said, adding that if that happens, he
would extend a warm welcome to them.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, Chen said, the two sides can have more contacts, more
dialogue and more consultations.</P>
      <P>Chen said the opening of direct cross-strait charter flights
during the Lunar Chinese New Year holiday earlier this year indicated
that with sincerity, the two sides could achieve a breakthrough in
their contacts.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, Chen said, China's passage of its Anti-Secession Law
targeting Taiwan shortly after the conclusion of the unprecedented
non-stop, two-way cross-strait charter flights in February cast a
shadow over bilateral engagements.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Chen reiterated that he will never waver from
his basic principle of "reconciliation without flinching" in dealing
with cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>"We want to hold a firm stance without becoming confrontational,"
he said, adding that reconciliation is by no means surrender or
compromise on Taiwan's sovereign status.</P>

      <P>Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Taiwan's
largest IT manufacturer, which also boasts the title of No. 1
electronics manufacturer worldwide, recorded a revenue of NT$68.16
billion (US$2.05 billion) for September, setting a single month
record for any listed company in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai, which makes a wide range of electronic products both
under its own trade name Foxconn and for such companies as Apple,
Cisco, Dell, Nokia and Sony, released statistics Friday for its
September performance, showing NT$68.16 billion in revenue for the
month, which represents an increase of 34.16 percent over August and
a growth of 65.4 percent compared with September last year.</P>
      <P>For the first nine months of this year, Hon Hai's revenues
totaled NT$440.7 billion, representing an increase of 59.32 percent
over the same period of 2004 and surpassing its entire revenue of
NT$421.67 billion for last year.</P>
      <P>Executives of Hon Hai attributed the brilliant performance to the
correct policy adopted by Terry Gou two years ago. Gou is chief
executive officer of the company and was the one who orchestrated
mergers with other companies in different countries.</P>
      <P>Most of Hon Hai's factories are in China, with others in

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT  CHEN WARNS  CHINA NOT TO MEDDLE  IN TAIWAN'S  POLITICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Beijing would
gain nothing by meddling in Taiwan's domestic politics and elections
and doing so would not improve relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in an exclusive interview with Reuters
Global Managing Editor David Schlesinger at the Presidential Office
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Chen was asked to comment on speculation that
Beijing may not heed his call for resuming cross-strait talks until
after 2008 when his independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) may no longer be in power and another party may take the helm.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen claimed that if Beijing pins its hope on Ma
Ying-jeou, chairman of Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), to
return the pro-unification KMT to power by winning the 2008
presidential election, its dream would not come true.</P>
      <P>When he first assumed the presidency in 2000, Chen said, Beijing
expected his early ouster. In the run-up to the 2004 presidential
election, Beijing hoped that the joint ticket of the KMT and the
People First Party could trounce his re-election bid. Beijing's wish
didn't materialize.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan began direct presidential elections in 1996, Chen
said none of the Beijing-favored candidates have managed to succeed.</P>
      <P>Given China's undemocratic, opaque one-party dictatorship,
Beijing leaders can't understand Taiwan voters' mindset, Chen said.</P>
      <P>It is the 23 million Taiwan people, not a handful of Beijing
leaders, who would choose their national leaders, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He further said that unless Beijing shows sincerity to genuinely
improve cross-strait relations, it cannot narrow the divide with the
Taiwan people nor will it win their hearts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARMS PACKAGE TO CLEAR LEGISLATURE AFTER YEAR-END ELECTIONS: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday he
believes that his administration's long-stalled arms procurement
package can clear the legislature after the year-end "three-in-one"
elections.</P>
      <P>Chen made the optimistic forecast during an exclusive interview
with Reuters Global Managing Editor David Schlesinger at the
Presidential Office in Taipei.</P>
      <P>For more than a year, the Chen administration's plan to procure
three-big ticket items of weapons from the United States has been
blocked by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT)
and the People First Party (PFP) which controls a slim majority in
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chen attributed the "pan-blue alliance's" opposition to the
package in part to its antagonism toward him and its attempt to curry
favors from China.</P>
      <P>Another reason is PFP Chairman James Soong's opposition, Chen
claimed. According to Chen, Soong has threatened to push for the
passage of a bill to force the KMT to return its ill-gotten party
assets to national coffers if the KMT dares to soften its stance
against the arms procurement package.</P>
      <P>Chen said it is regrettable that the KMT puts its ill-gotten
party assets above the arms package which he said is critical to
Taiwan's defense and overall national interests.</P>
      <P>As the KMT needs the PFP's support and cooperation in the run-up
to the Dec. 3 "three-in-one" elections, Chen said he sees little
chances for the package to clear the opposition-controlled
legislature.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he added that he believes the legislature would
eventually begin to screen the package after the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>The arms package includes eight diesel-electric submarines, a
squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six Patriot PAC-III
anti-missile batteries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PENTAGON'S POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN REMAINS UNCHANGED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. Department of Defense said
Friday that its policy toward Taiwan remains unchanged and that the
weaponry the United States plans to sell to the country are defensive
rather than offensive.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon made the remarks in response to a Japan Times' report
related to the U.S. military's stance on Taiwan's defense.</P>
      <P>According to the report, U.S. military officers who asked not to
be named have said that the new commander of American forces in Asia
and the Pacific, Adm. William J. Fallon, has quietly encouraged
Taiwan "to strengthen its defenses with increased spending, a better
command structure, and defensive missiles, mines and helicopters."</P>
      <P>The report also said that at the same time, the commander has
urged Taipei to forgo high-tech offensive weapons.</P>
      <P>Officers in the U.S. Command headquarters have suggested that an
arms package featuring weapons such as diesel-electric submarines and
destroyers that the Bush administration offered to sell Taiwan in
2001, be allowed to fade away, the report further said, adding that
the arms package has languished in Taiwan's legislature due to
stonewalling by the opposition.</P>
      <P>However, the U.S. Defense Department said it has not changed its
policy toward Taiwan and that it remains firmly committed to
fulfilling the security and arms sales provisions of the Taiwan
Relations Act (TRA).</P>
      <P>"We will continue to assist Taiwan in meeting its legitimate
self-defense needs in accordance with our obligations under the TRA,"
it continued.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon also rebutted other parts of the report, pointing

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
Friday that if a cross-strait peace promotion bill initiated by the
opposition People First Party (PFP) becomes law, it will be against
the Constitution and complicate the administrative system.</P>
      <P>The PFP has put forward the bill in the Legislative Yuan for
further review.</P>
      <P>Bluntly questioning the contents of the bill, the MAC said that
even if it is enacted, it will not be possible to implement it.</P>
      <P>If adopted, it will become "Taiwan's version of the
Anti-Secession Law enacted by China in March of this year, " it
further claimed, adding that the public will question whether Beijing
is intervening in Taiwan's legislation process and whether the
opposition wants to publicly carry out Beijing's tactics by forcing
the government to accept their initiatives.</P>
      <P>The council also criticized the PFP bill's intent to legalize the
so-called "1992 consensus, " which is not recognized by the Taiwan
government, and its interpretation of President Chen Shui-bian's
"five noes" statement out of context.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the passage of the bill would be a disaster for
Taiwan as it would "bring political parties into conflict and the
nation into instability," the MAC said that the enactment of the bill
would also lead the nation into a constitutional crisis.</P>
      <P>So far, the bill has been stalled in the legislature due to
opposition by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has temporarily
stopped issuing quarantine clearance for a packaging plant that was
responsible for processing a shipment of apples destined for Taiwan
that were infested with coddling moth, Taiwan officials in the United
States said Friday.</P>
      <P>The orchard where the apples were produced has also been banned
from exporting its fruit to Taiwan for a year, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The action was taken after coddling moth larvae were discovered a
day earlier by Taiwan quarantine authorities in a shipment of apples
from Washington State.</P>
      <P>According to Liu Hsing-shan, deputy chief of the economic affairs
section at the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in
the United States, the U.S. authorities will provide Taiwan with
information concerning the affected orchard and packaging plant
within two days and work out an investigative report within one week.</P>
      <P>Taiwan imported 63,000 tons of apples worth US$45 million from
the United States in 2004, accounted for 50 percent of the country's
total apple imports.</P>
      <P>According to an agreement signed between Taiwan and the United
States in 2003, the United States is required to suspend apple
exports to Taiwan if coddling moths are found three times in apple
shipments within a year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan last banned apple imports from the United States in
December 2004 and only lifted the ban in April this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET URGED TO BETTER EXPLAIN FINANCIAL REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan should seize every
opportunity to explain in detail the issues related to the
government's ongoing financial reforms, participants in a
high-ranking meeting said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office invited Executive Yuan Secretary-General
Cho Jung-tai, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Executive
Director of Policy Committee Ker Chien-ming, DPP legislative caucus
whip William C.T. Lai and DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang to
participate in the meeting.</P>
      <P>The participants pointed out that the opposition parties have
continued to criticize the second phase of financial reforms, which
makes the daunting task even more of a challenge.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan, the DPP and the DPP legislative caucus should
step up their defense and debate of the issue, they said.</P>
      <P>The reforms refer to the government's goal of making the joint
assets of any three banks exceed 10 percent of the total value of
Taiwan's banking sector and to cut the number of 12 state-owned
financial institutions in half to six by the end of this year, and to
halve the 14 financial holding companies and have at least one
bank run by a foreign financial institution by the end of 2006.</P>
      <P>On the barrage of media criticism of the scandals surrounding the
Taiwan high-speed railway and the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit
projects, the participants also claimed that there are "gaps between
the reports and the truth, " showing that there is a need for the
government to step up its role as an exponent of its major policies.</P>
      <P>The participants cited the example of the National Communications
Commission bill, saying that it aims at reforms, which should be an
issue beneficial to the DPP, but the party has failed to seize an
early opportunity to explain it to the public, causing it to lose
public support.</P>
      <P>The participants also said that reports about China Steel Corp. 
(CSC) Chairman Lin Wen-yuan receiving an annual bonus of around NT$44
million (US$1.32 million) has further cast the ruling party in a bad
light. Lin represents the government in the CSC, which has been
privatized, but the government still has a stake in the firm. </P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan should also address the questions posed by
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislator Lai Shin-yuan about
retired government officials serving in lucrative posts in
government-donated foundations, the participants added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EFFORTS TO LOWER SUICIDE RATE NEED TO BE IMPROVED: RESEARCHER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An Academia Sinica Institute of Biomedical
Sciences researcher said Saturday that the government's efforts to
reduce the national suicide rate from 14.2 in 100,000 to 11.3 in
100,000 faces many practical challenges.</P>
      <P>The challenges include that fact that existing methods of
epidemiological surveys on suicides are rough and inaccurate, Cheng
Tai-an said in a report on Taiwan's suicide control and prevention
framework at a conference held by the National Health Research
Institute to map out strategies for suicide control and prevention.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he found the actual number of people who kill
themselves might be higher than those officially published because in
many cases concerning people who die of poisoning or suffocation by
toxic gas, prosecutors tend to record the cause of the death as
accidental rather than suicide.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan has never listed charcoal-burning as a
suicide method, even though it became a very common method after a
woman killed herself by burning charcoal in Hong Kong in 1998.</P>
      <P>The researcher cited official statistics as saying that he found
the number of the people in Taiwan who committed suicide by means of
"other gas " -- mostly by burning charcoal -- has significantly
increased since 2001. In 2003, the number of suicides caused by
"other gas" accounted for about 18 percent of the total, a figure

    <TEXT>
      <P>Most Taiwan people want a peaceful
and stable cross-Taiwan Strait relationship and a good economy,
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Expressing his opinions about President Chen Shui-bian remarks in
a recent interview on issues related to cross-strait relations and
the controversial arms procurement package, Ma said that "Taiwan and
China must maintain a stable and peaceful environment as this is the
expectation of the Taiwan people."</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in Yunlin County, where he was wooing support
for KMT candidates in the year-end county mayor and magistrate
elections.</P>
      <P>Even though the president mentioned in the interview his idea of
"delaying but engaging in a dialogue without fear" in dealing with
cross-strait problems, Ma said that in order to stabilize
cross-strait relations, Taipei and Beijing should hold talks as soon
as possible.</P>
      <P>Touching on Chen's comments that the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" stance against the arms procurement package stems from
their opposition to him as well as their eagerness to please Beijing,
Ma described them as "irresponsible, " claiming that the
procrastination over the arms deal in the legislature is the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's "own fault."</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the DPP government only put forward the arms
procurement bill to the legislature in 2004, although the Bush
administration agreed to sell the weapons to Taiwan in 2001.</P>
      <P>"It is clear that the DPP has caused many problems on the issue,
even though it wants to shift the blame onto the opposition, " he
claimed.</P>
      <P>He also said the government should do whatever it can to develop
the economy, as Taiwan might experience a record low trade surplus
this year and a trade deficit next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANTI-GRAFT CAMPAIGN TO TARGET HIGH-TURNOUT AREAS, CAPITAL FLOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An anti-graft campaign this year will target
areas of high turnout in previous elections and the capital flow of
the aspirants, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>MOJ officials made the remarks as campaigning for the year-end
"three-in-one" elections -- referring to elections of city and county
chiefs, councilors, and village and township chiefs -- is gearing up.</P>
      <P>They said that to prevent candidates linked to corrupt "black
gold" politics from winning elections through vote-buying, the
ministry has instructed law enforcement agencies islandwide to keep
close tabs on those areas where turnout rates are high, where votes
overwhelmingly go to a single candidate and where candidates who have
no special relationship to their constituencies are running.</P>
      <P>On candidates who are likely to buy votes, the ministry will keep
track of the flow of their capital so they will be unable to use
their money to buy votes.</P>
      <P>The ministry said the anti-graft campaign over the past two
months has borne fruit, noting that several aspirants who had
originally wanted to register in the elections bowed out, while other
aspirants who had wanted to embark on "gift-giving" campaigns during
the Mid-Autumn Festival to curry favor with voters had been scared
away from doing so.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday
that the direction of the government's financial reforms is correct,
although she admitted there might be flaws in the process of their
implementation.</P>
      <P>Lu said the second phase of financial reforms that is under way
is part of the government's efforts to narrow the wealth disparity
and promote economic justice, adding that the government will make
sure that the financial system is not monopolized by business
conglomerates.</P>
      <P>She made the remarks while addressing the opening of Kaohsiung
Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing's re-election campaign headquarters.</P>
      <P>The second phase of financial reform involves the privatization
of state-owned banks and mergers between banks, with a goal to
halving the number of state-owned banks to six by the end of this
year and having at least three domestic banks increase their market
shares to more than 10 percent.</P>
      <P>Opposition lawmakers have accused the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) government of favoring certain pro-DPP
business conglomerates in the privatization process.</P>
      <P>Also Saturday, Lu visited a shipyard in Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Han Pi-hsiang, owner of the yard, took the opportunity to urge
the government to put more effort into developing the country's
yacht-building industry.</P>
      <P>According to Han, the quality of yachts produced in Taiwan is not
inferior to that of Europe and the United States, but they are
relatively cheaper.</P>
      <P>Han said the yachts produced by Taiwan are also more competitive
and popular than those produced by China because of their luxurious
appearance and facilities.</P>
      <P>He called on the government to relax its regulations and build
more marinas to facilitate the development of the yachting industry.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will continue to play "an
indispensable role in the global village" with its strong
competitiveness, ample pool of talent and democratic achievement,
Taiwan's representative to South Africa Richard Shih said Friday.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks when he addressed nearly 300 guests taking
part in a banquet to mark Taiwan's Oct. 10 Double Ten Day, or
National Day.</P>
      <P>He noted that the World Economic Forum in its latest global
competitiveness report placed Taiwan fifth among the 117

      <P>Taiwan has used good management to help people get out of
poverty, while its entrepreneurial culture and efficient government

ample room for improvement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT REAFFIRMS TRUST IN PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday his
trust in Premier Frank Hsieh is beyond question.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks came a day after acting Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh
Chu-lan announced the establishment of a five-member Kaohsiung MRT
investigative team to look into controversies surrounding the massive
construction project.</P>
      <P>Speculation about Chen's trust in Hsieh arose following Yeh's
announcement. It was widely believed that Yeh was acting on Chen's
directive in launching the inquiry into the problem-ridden project,
which got underway during Hsieh's tenure as mayor of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Responding to a media query as to whether he still trusts Hsieh,
Chen said firmly: "Of course I trust him."</P>
      <P>Chen made the response after paying a visit to a 102-year-old
resident of Taipei, Lin Chen Jih, as part of celebrations of Senior
Citizens' Day which falls on Oct. 11 this year.</P>
      <P>The controversies surrounding the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit
system construction surfaced after a group of Thai laborers working
on the project rioted Aug. 21 in protest over unfair and inhumane
treatment by their management. Law enforcement authorities have been
investigating the cause of the riot and all possible irregularities
involved in the employment and management of the Thai workers.</P>
      <P>The riot has already led to the resignations of Chen Chu as
Council of Labor Affairs chairwoman and Chen Chi-mai as acting
Kaohsiung mayor. Earlier this week, two of President Chen's advisers
-- Chen Che-nan, who once served as a Presidential Office deputy
secretary-general, and Chen Min-hsien, who used to be vice chairman
of the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) -- also resigned amid
speculation that they might be involved in an illegal profiteering
racket between the employer -- KRTC -- and a labor brokerage firm
that has exploited Thai laborers.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) approval rating
has shown signs of decline since the Aug. 21 riot. As a
damage-control measure to prevent the alleged KRTC scandals from
affecting the DPP's support rating ahead of the year-end
"three-in-one" elections, President Chen reportedly asked Yeh to form
a special investigative team to probe the administrative
accountability of past Kaohsiung mayors, including Wu Den-yih, Hsieh
and Chen Chi-mai, in the controversies.</P>
      <P>Yeh said Friday that the five-member team's investigation will be
conducted "without any limitations."</P>
      <P>"All related personnel, be they former mayors or government
officials and the KRTC itself, will be targets of our inquiry, " Yeh
told a news conference.</P>
      <P>The team, composed of legal and construction experts, will look
into alleged conflicts of interest impartially and selflessly and
release its findings Oct. 20, Yeh added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRADE SURPLUS DROP DUE TO DECREASED MARKET SHARE IN CHINA: BOFT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's decreased market share in China was
the major reason behind a sharp 69.5 percent year-on-year drop in its
foreign trade surplus in the first nine months of this year, Board of
Foreign Trade (BOFT) officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>In the January-September period, the amount of Taiwan's foreign
trade accumulated to US$272.36 billion, registering a growth of 8.9
percent over the same period of last year, according to Customs
statistics. </P>
      <P>The tallies show that exports reached US$137.15 billion in the
nine-month period, a growth of 6.9 percent over the previous year,
while imports recorded a growth of 10.9 percent to US$135.21 billion.</P>
      <P>In September alone, the amount of foreign trade totaled US$31.69
billion for a surplus of US$710 million.</P>
      <P>Explaining the surplus decrease, BOFT officials cited statistics
released by China's customs authorities as saying that China's
general imports from January to August recorded a growth of 15.13
percent over the previous year.</P>
      <P>In terms of Taiwan's exports to China, a 10.11 percent increase
was registered in the first eight months of this year, smaller than
those of South Korea, Singapore, Russia, Australia and Thailand.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's market share in China also dropped to 11.04 percent in
the eight-month period from the level of 11.54 percent in the same
period of last year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan lagged behind Japan and South Korea as the third-largest
source of imports for China, the officials said.</P>
      <P>With the signs showing Taiwan's export dependence on the china
market falling, the BOFT will boost its efforts to assist Taiwan
exporters to try opening other markets, they added.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan' own customs statistics, the nation's exports
to Hong Kong and China totalled US$51.36 billion in the first nine
months of this year. The number accounted for 37.4 percent of the
island's total exports, posing a growth of 8.4 percent, while the
growth of the total exports was 6.9 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO CONSIDERATION OF PRESIDENCY IN ARMS STANCE: KMT HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou claimed Saturday that his party supports "reasonable" arms
procurements and will not consider the issue from the point of view
of a possible future ruling party.</P>
      <P>Ma was responding to media reports that KMT staff recently
proposed in a report on the party's response to the controversial
arms procurement package that Ma consider the necessity of arms
procurement from the angle of a "para-ruling party" head.</P>
      <P>Ma said on the sidelines of a trip to Yunlin County to call on
KMT Legislator Chang Li-shan, that the long-standing stance of the
party has been to support reasonable arms procurements, adding that
this is the mainstream party view.</P>
      <P>As to what constitutes "reasonable" arms procurements, Ma said
only that he has to listen to the voices from all quarters and that
"the KMT legislative caucus has been working on an integration
process with its ally parties," and the KMT will publicize the result
after the integration process completes.</P>
      <P>On a reported suggestion that he consider the issue from the
angle of the next leader of the nation, Ma said the time-span for the
arms procurement is up to 15 years, which covers more than just one
presidential term, and for this reason, the presidency term will not
be a factor.</P>
      <P>He said that arms procurements have to take into consideration
Taiwan's defense needs and the maintenance of the necessary deterrent
force, as well as the government's financial situation.</P>
      <P>The package refers to the purchase of three big-ticket weaponry
items -- eight diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC -III
anti-missile batteries and a squadron of 12 anti-submarine P-3C
aircraft -- from the United States. For more than a year, the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party
(PFP) has used its slim majority in the legislature to stonewall the
review of the package.</P>
      <P>Ma's staff suggested that the missiles should continue to be
blocked, noting that a national referendum held simultaneously with
the 2004 presidential election nixed the proposal and that the same
proposal could not be posed within three years, while the submarines
and anti-submarine planes can be included in the national defense
budget starting from 2007.
</P>
      <P>In the 2004 referendum, the question of whether Taiwan should
step up national defense faced with Beijing's missile threat was
considered invalid because fewer than half of the eligible voters
voted, although over 90 percent of those who did vote answered in the
affirmative.</P>
      <P>In this way, Ma's staff reasoned, it will avoid being smeared by
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party for showing no concern for
national security and will also avoid being taken hostage by the PFP,
which has emerged as the consistent opponent to the arms deal after
reports that the KMT might cave in and reconsider its opposition
stance.</P>
      <P>The PFP has said it opposes listing the arms procurement under a
special budget, and that as long as it is listed under the regular
budget, there is no reason for the party to oppose it.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislators
denied Saturday a report that the party is considering dropping its
opposition to the government's controversial arms procurement package
from the United States.</P>
      <P>Members of a KMT panel studying the arms procurement plan, who
include Shuai Hua-min, Ting Shou-chung and Su Chi, said the group has
not met lately and that the party has not made a final decision as to
how it will deal with the package.</P>
      <P>According to a proposal reportedly put forth by a key KMT member,
the party, in preparation for a possible return to power in 2008,
should demand that the government include the plan to purchase eight
diesel-electric submarines and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine
aircraft in the regular annual budget from 2007.</P>
      <P>As to the plan to purchase six Patriot PAC-III anti-missile
batteries, the KMT should continue to block it within the three years
since a referendum was held on the issue.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian called the referendum alongside the
presidential election on March 18, 2004 to let the people vote on
whether to purchase more anti-missile armaments. The referendum was
declared invalid because fewer than half of the eligible voters took
part in the poll. According to the country's referendum law, no
referendum can be held on the same issue within three years of it
being voted on.</P>
      <P>Ting claimed that the three weapons are unnecessary in light of
the cross-Taiwan Strait and international situations, adding that
whether the KMT will support the arms procurement plan is not related
to whether it will return to power.</P>
      <P>In response to the report, opposition People First Party (PFP)
legislative caucus convener Huang Yi-chiao said the PFP will remain
opposed to the arms procurement plan as long as it is financed by a
special budget instead of the regular annual budget.</P>
      <P>However, Huang said, the PFP will not support the plan to
purchase the Patriot PAC-III anti-missile batteries, even though the
Ministry of National Defense has included it in the government's
annual budget for 2006, because the plan is inconsistent with the
result of the referendum.</P>
      <P>He said the KMT would be making a "serious mistake" if it were to
consider the issue from the perspective of whether it will return to
power.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, William Lai, the leader of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party legislative caucus, said the report, if proven
true, would indicate that the KMT is ready to continue to delay the
arms procurement.</P>
      <P>Lai urged the KMT and PFP not to misinterpret the result of the
referendum, saying that the fact that the referendum is invalid does
not mean the people are opposed to the purchase of anti-missile
armaments.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Wen-chung warned that Taiwan might have
problems obtaining the weapons if the opposition parties continue to
block the procurement plan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  8  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office denounced a
controversial lawmaker's speculation Saturday that a Kaohsiung MRT
system contractor might have won contracts because of his ties with
the first family.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chiu Yi, who collaborates with the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) caucus in the legislature after quitting the People
First Party earlier this year but who has so far not yet become a
formal KMT member, claimed at a news conference Saturday that all
suspicious irregularities surrounding the Kaoshiung Rapid Transit
Corp. (KRTC) are related to Huang Chang Co., whose chairman has close
ties to first lady Wu Shu-jen.</P>
      <P>Chiu further claimed that Huang Chang Chairman Chiang Cheng-jin
got acquainted with President Chen Shui-bian when both of them were
serving jail terms in the 1980s. Chen was once imprisoned for a
libel suit during Taiwan's martial law era.</P>
      <P>"Chiu's insinuation that Chen gave favors to Chiang is a
mudslinging tactic, " said Chen Wen-chung, director of the
Presidential Office's Public Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Wen-chung, President Chen got acquainted with
Chiang during his tenure as Taipei mayor because Chiang's company was
a contractor of various Taipei MRT construction projects.</P>
      <P>"Chiang won all those Taipei MRT contracts during the mayorship
of Huang Ta-chou, Chen's predecessor, " Chen Wen-chung said. Huang, a
KMT stalwart, lost his mayoral bid to Chen in 1994.</P>
      <P>After Ma Ying-jeou, who now doubles as KMT chairman, took the
Taipei City Government's helm in 1998, Chen Wen-chung said, Chiang
still managed to win many infrastructure construction contracts in
the capital city.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-chung further said President Chen didn't know whether
Chiang had been jailed, not to mention whether they had served jail
term at the same time.</P>
      <P>Stressing that President Chen has on many occasions thrown his
wholehearted support behind judicial probes into whether any
conflicts of interest, kickbacks or other irregularities were
involved in the multibillion-dollar Kaohsiung mass rapid transit
system construction project.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, William Lai, a legislative whip of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said Chiu is notorious for making
false accusing. Among others, Lai said, Chiu once accused a
prosecutor investigating the KRTC scandals as a womanizer. But it was
later proved that the prosecutor named by Chiu was a woman.</P>
      <P>Lai said Chiu should present evidence to back his accusations
against President Chen. "Otherwise, he should make an apology, " Lai
said, adding that the DPP caucus plans to ask the legislature's
disciplinary commission to discipline Chiu for making false
accusation against the president.</P>

      <P>The State Public Prosecutor General's Office
(SPPGO) reiterated Saturday that prosecution authorities have no
preset stance on the investigation into all alleged scandals in the
Kaohsiung mass rapid transit (MRT) system construction.</P>
      <P>As the investigation is still going on, the nation's highest

authorities can not publicize the content of its inquiry and all

day to demand that the SPPGO explain in detail progress in its probes
into the alleged Kaohsiung MRT scandals in 10 days.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmakers claimed at the news conference that the SPPGO " has
deliberately skipped key points" in its Friday press release about
progress in its inquiry into whether any irregularities or conflicts
of interests were involved in the Kaohsiung City Government's
decision to adopt a BOT (build-operate-transfer) formula for the
city's MRT system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP CHAIRMAN SOONG DANCES AROUND ISSUE OF RUNNING FOR TAIPEI MAYOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 9 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To run or not to run -- that is the question
the public was pondering Sunday regarding a possible run for Taipei
mayor by People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong, after a local
paper speculated that he would throw his hat in the ring for the
year-end election.</P>
      <P>Soong tried to dodge the media Sunday morning before hopping a
plane to London. However, he did address claims that he was over the
hill when it came to running against younger candidates.</P>
      <P>The 63-year-old said his critics were using a double standard.
Soong claimed that when he was urged to be Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Lien Chan's running mate in the 2004 presidential election -- which
Lien and he lost -- he was younger than Lien. "Lien was senior to me,
but now you say I am a bit too old to run for Taipei mayor."</P>
      <P>He added that a candidate's ability and willingness to serve
society is more important than his age, but refused to confirm or
deny that he was planning on running for Taipei mayor. However, he
did say that he appreciated the support for the idea from his
followers.</P>
      <P>Then, seemingly to ensure that no one could be clear on his exact
intention, Soong turned to PFP Legislator Lee Ching-an who was at the
airport to see him off and said that Lee ought to make a bid for the
mayorship, "That is, if I don't run myself," Soong said.</P>
      <P>Although Soong, a former Taiwan provincial governor, would be
setting a precedent by stooping to run for the lesser position of
mayor, the China Times said he was likely to be a candidate since it
would be the only way that Soong could regain any political clout,
which would give his ailing KMT spin-off party a lifeline.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIME NOT RIGHT TO ENACT PFP VERSION OF CROSS-STRAIT PEACE LAW: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Now is not the time to legislate a law to
promote peace between Taiwan and China as proposed by the opposition
People First Party (PFP) , a ranking Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Huang Wei-feng quoted a Taiwan ThinkTank survey
as warning that if the largest opposition party, the Kuomintang
(KMT), joins hands with its political ally, the PFP, to pass the bill
in the legislature, it will exacerbate social divisions and
confrontations between the ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Huang made the comments at a Taiwan ThinkTank news conference to
announce the finding of a survey it conducted, which found that just
over 60 percent of respondents who were familiar with the
PFP-sponsored bill said that if it is forced through the legislature,
it would accelerate social divisions.</P>
      <P>He added that if the bill is enacted as it stands, it will become
a "bylaw" of China's Anti-Secession Law that threatens to use
"non-peaceful means" to settle cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>He said the PFP bill runs counter to the principles of consensus,
public support and constitutional rule, and the MAC "firmly opposes
and will never accept it."</P>
      <P>"People will question if China has meddled in the legislative
process of the bill; they will also wonder if some elements in Taiwan
are openly carrying out China's strategy of 'using civilians to force
the government's hand' and 'using the opposition parties to bully the
ruling party,'" Huang said.</P>
      <P>He explained that the bill has a "serious fallacy" in that it
will formally incorporate into law the so-called "1992 consensus" as
well as a biased interpretation of President Chen Shui-bian's
commitment to his "four noes" policy -- no changes to the title of
the Republic of China, no declaration of Taiwan independence, no
referendum on Taiwan's future, and no amendment to the Constitution
to show that the relations between Taiwan and China are special
"state-to-state" in nature.</P>
      <P>The "1992 consensus" refers to the concept that both China and
Taiwan belong to "one China, " with both sides free to interpret the
meaning of the term. Many officials in Taiwan, particularly from the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party and its allies, say that no
consensus was ever reached on the matter.</P>
      <P>According to the Taiwan ThinkTank poll, more than 50 percent of
Taiwan's public do not know that the "pan-blue alliance" of the PFP
and the KMT are pushing the PFP version of the bill, but of those who
know, 63 percent feared it will worsen social divisions if the
"pan-blue alliance" rams it through the Legislative Yuan, where the
alliance enjoys a slim majority.</P>
      <P>In view of this, Huang said, now is not the right time to
legislate such a law given that it might induce cross-strait
relations to develop in an unreasonable direction, rather than
promoting peace.</P>
      <P>Professor Chen Ming-tung of National Taiwan University called on
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, a law professor-turned politician, to stop
the bill from being passed because it violates the principle of
constitutional rule and the principle of political responsibility.</P>
      <P>Hsu Sze-chien, an assistant research fellow at Academia Sinica,
pointed to the international implications of the PFP bill, saying
that its initiation alone indicates that the ruling-opposition
confrontation at the legislature is reaching a peak, and the world
will interpret this as the collapse of Taiwan's internal mechanism to
settle differences through the political process.</P>
      <P>"This certainly would tarnish Taiwan's image since foreigners
think that Taiwan is a polity that is incapable of taking
responsibility for its own actions, " Hsu said. He urged the
opposition not to do something that would result in consequences that
would be unbearable.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SURVEY SHOWS LOW JOB APPROVAL RATINGS FOR ALL POLITICAL PARTIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The public has a low opinion of the
performance of all major political parties and President Chen
Shui-bian's job approval rating has hit its lowest level since he
became president in 2000, according to results of an opinion survey
released Sunday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by the United Daily News Oct. 7-8, shows that
Chen's overall job approval has dropped to 25 percent, a sharp
contrast to the 79 percent approval rating he received shortly after
he became president in 2000.</P>
      <P>Chen's 25 percent approval rating represents a 9 percent slide
from a month ago. Respondents who said they are dissatisfied with his
performance also reached a new high -- 54 percent.</P>
      <P>The approval rating of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) also plunged to 24 percent, with 56 percent of the respondents
saying they are dissatisfied with the party's performance.</P>
      <P>The poll comes on the heels of allegations of corruption by some
DPP officials regarding a profiteering case brought to light because
of the Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers working on the Kaohsiung rapid
transit system in protest of their inhumane treatment by a manpower
management company.</P>
      <P>Sixty-one percent of those polled believe that the DPP has lost
its core values. Forty-nine percent see the DPP as a corrupt party,
while 45 percent view the party as having neglected the people's
wishes, with 43 percent blaming the DPP for not paying attention to
social justice.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 72 percent of the respondents believe
there has been collusion between certain government officials and
private companies for mutual profiteering.</P>
      <P>The other three main political parties did not fare well in the
poll either. Although the Kuomintang (KMT), the largest opposition
party, received the highest approval of 35 percent, the rate
represents a 14 percent drop from July, when the party was preparing
to hold its election for chairman.</P>
      <P>The People First Party, an ally of the KMT in the "pan-blue
alliance," had an approval rating of 20 percent, while the Taiwan
Solidarity Union's performance was approved of by only 19 percent.</P>
      <P>The poll, based on telephone interviews with a randomly selected
sample of 1,088 people, was taken Oct. 7-8. It had a margin of error
of plus or minus 3 percentage points.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), said Sunday that he will lead a review to find out
why the party's approval rating fell 14 percent from July to the
current 35 percent, as shown by results of a new poll.</P>
      <P>Chairing a meeting of the KMT Central Standing Committee, Ma said
the approval rating fall is a warning for the KMT, although the party
scored better than the other parties in the poll, conducted by the
United Daily News Oct. 7-8.</P>
      <P>According to results of the survey released Sunday, the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) had a 24 percent approval rating,
while the People First Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
received 20 percent and 19 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Fifty-six percent of the respondents said they are dissatisfied
with the performance of the DPP. The numbers were not much better for
the KMT, the PFP and the TSU, who scored negative ratings of 43
percent, 53 percent and 46 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that the KMT must not be complacent even though the
other parties fared even worse than the KMT in the poll, and that as
a party with the ability to reflect upon itself, the KMT must find out
what factors caused the plunge in its approval rating if the party is
to regain the confidence of the public.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman cautioned party members that when the ruling and
the opposition parties are being compared in terms of whose
performance is worse, voters who are dissatisfied with the other
parties may not necessarily become supporters of the KMT.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT PEACE BILL A MYSTERY TO HALF OF RESPONDENTS IN POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 9 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than half of the people responding to a
Taiwan Thinktank-sponsored survey had no idea that the People First
Party (PFP) was sponsoring a bill advocating cross-strait peace, and
63 percent who were aware of the legislation felt that it would only
fuel divisions in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the poll released Sunday showed that the same 63
percent said that the bill, which would give the
opposition-controlled legislature the power to call the shots in
forming policy toward China, would intensify the confrontation
between the legislature and the executive branch.</P>
      <P>The survey conducted by the Focus Survey Research Corporation
found that 55.6 percent of those interviewed didn't know the
opposition PFP, with the support of the Kuomintang (KMT), is pushing
for a cross-strait peace-promoting bill, let alone that it was going
to try to ramrod the bill through the legislature this Tuesday.</P>
      <P>However, 57.9 percent said that, being informed of the situation,
they are concerned about the bill.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that 50.9 percent said that they are
unsatisfied with the way the Legislative Yuan is pushing for peace
with China.</P>
      <P>As to the question of who is better suited to represent Taiwan in
negotiations with China, the president or the legislature, 40.2
percent said the president, against 32.5 percent opting for the
legislature.</P>
      <P>Also, 60.5 percent said they do not favor writing the "one China"
principle into law as the proposed bill would do.</P>
      <P>Citing the survey, the Taiwan ThinkTank said the PFP and KMT are
running against public opinion by pushing for the legislation, which
would empower the legislature to dictate China policy to the
administration.</P>
      <P>The survey conducted Oct. 7-8 by telephone, gathered 1,130 valid
replies, with the make-up of the respondents mirroring the ratios of
the various political parties in the legislature with a error margin
of plus or minus 2.92 percentage points, the author of the poll
claimed.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) vowed Sunday that its legislative caucus will "fight to the
very end" to resist the opposition's attempt to pass a bill proposed
by the People First Party (PFP) to promote peace between Taiwan and

China policy, which would instead be vested in the
opposition-controlled legislature, resulting in Taiwan's "actual
surrender to China in the name of peace."</P>
      <P>Therefore, in spite of the opposition's slim majority in the
Legislative Yuan, the DPP caucus has issued a "class-A" alert for all
members to be present on Tuesday, when the PFP-initiated bill is due
for a show-down vote.</P>
      <P>"We will fight to the end, although we will not provoke anyone, "
Lai said.</P>
      <P>He urged the PFP to realize that any legal structure promoting
peace between Taiwan and China must first obtain the support from a
broad cross-section of the public, and if it and its "pan-blue
alliance" ally, the Kuomintang, railroad the bill through the
legislature, it will not help solve problems between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lai accused the PFP of threatening to pass the bill even at the
price of blood, adding that he fears that bloody clashes might occur
in the legislative hall.</P>
      <P>Chao Yung-ching, DPP caucus convener, said only one article in
the PFP bill has passed at the legislature's home affairs committee,
so the "pan-blue alliance" should not use "numerical violence" to
push the entire bill through the legislature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP LAWMAKER ADVOCATES SUITING UP FOR RUMBLE IN THE LEGISLATURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 9 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Expecting a lawmakers' version of "Kung Fu
Hustle" over the vote of the bill for the National Communications
Commission (NCC) Tuesday in the Legislative Yuan, an opposition
lawmaker Sunday advised fellow party lawmakers wear karate uniforms
to be ready to thwart any ruling party attempts to take over the
proceedings by force.</P>
      <P>Huang Yi-chiao, convener of the People First Party's (PFP)
legislative caucus, revealed his party's strategy to prevent ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators from commandeering the
speaker's quarters and paralyzing legislative proceedings as they did
on Sept. 27.</P>
      <P>Huang recommended that KMT lawmakers come to the floor wearing
martial arts gees like the one the youngest member of the KMT, Huang
Chih-hsiung, was wearing when he won the silver medal in taekwondo at
the last Olympics, and join the PFP's Chang Hsien-yao and Hsieh
Kuo-liang, who are martial arts students, to "maintain order on the
legislative floor" Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Huang said the PFP is a "modest and reasonable" party that does
not seek violence. "However, we are not afraid of any violent
provocation," he declared.</P>
      <P>He noted that if the DPP uses violence to stop the legislature
from dealing with the NCC organic bill, "We believe that Legislative
Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng will call in the police as he sees fit."</P>
      <P>Both PFP and its "pan-blue alliance" ally, the Kuomintang (KMT),
have issued a "class-A" alert to their caucus members, readying them
for a possible clash during the show-down vote. The alliance enjoys a
slim majority over the "pan-green" camp of the DPP and Taiwan
Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT's Central Policy
Committee and caucus whip, called on the DPP to give up its intention
to "unreasonably filibuster" and to allow a free vote on the bill so
that Taiwan's media industry can have a "clean environment" in which
to develop.</P>
      <P>Tseng said the "pan-blue alliance" caucuses have made a
concession to the "pan-green" camp by giving up some pre-registered
spots to speak on individual articles of the bill, so that a
representative from each party can speak for an equal amount of time
before putting the bill to a vote.</P>
      <P>As to the focus of the controversy -- the composition of NCC
members -- Tseng said the "pan-blue alliance" will not change its
basic position that members be selected in accordance with the
percentage of legislative seats each party holds.</P>
      <P>"We are insisting on this simply to keep the ruling party from
manipulating the media by appointing all the president's men to the
NCC," he said.</P>
      <P>He repeated the KMT-PFP version of the bill regarding the
appointment of members -- they would come from such backgrounds as
humanities, telecommunications, mass communications, finance and
economy and they must not have held any political party job within
the last three years.</P>
      <P>"This is our proposal regarding the qualifications and ethical
requirements for NCC members, a proposal we believe will stand the
test of public opinion," he said.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian made a pitch for
the signing of a free trade agreement with Honduras during a state
banquet host by him for visiting Honduras President Ricardo Maduro
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Noting that a free trade agreement between the United States and
Central America, as well as the Dominican Republic will take effect
on Jan. 1, next year, Chen said his country is eager to tap the
American market via its Central American allies, not the least
Honduras.</P>
      <P>Honduras can work together with Taiwan more closely in exploring
the North America market if a free trade agreement is concluded
between the two countries, hopefully during Maduro's term, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He reiterated a promise he made on Sept. 22 in Guatemala City
when he was on a trip to five Central American states that his
country will offer US$250 million in aid to its allies there and
encourage Taiwan businessmen to invest there.</P>
      <P>The president admired Maduro as a successful entrepreneur and a

    <TEXT>
      <P>The significant increase in the number of
real estate brokers in Taiwan in the past years signifies that the
boom in Taiwan's housing market is likely to continue, a major real
estate broker predicted Sunday.</P>
      <P>In a research report, Sinyi Real Estate quoted statistics
released by the Ministry of the Interior as showing that the number
of real estate brokers in Taiwan increased 40 percent in 2004, and is
expected to rise another 30 percent this year.</P>
      <P>The number of real estate brokers registered with the Ministry of
the Interior stood at 2,825 as of Oct. 5, with Taipei County ranking
first with 492 brokers, followed by Taipei City with 489 and Taoyuan
County, which has 307 brokers, surpassing Taichung City and Kaohsiung
City for the first time.</P>
      <P>Researchers at Sinyi said they believe that the increase in the
number of real estate brokers is a clear indication of their
confidence in the prospect of Taiwan's housing market.</P>
      <P>Figures compiled by Sinyi show that housing transactions in
Taiwan increased 19.6 percent in 2004, with continuous growth in each
season. The housing market recorded a 23.5 percent growth in 2002,
its first positive growth in six years. The year 2003 saw a growth of
only 9 percent, due mainly to the influence of severe acute

    <HEADLINE>DPP HEAD: DPP WILL PECK OUT 'BAD GUYS' LIKE WOODPECKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman Su Tseng-chang of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) compared his party Sunday to a
woodpecker that will peck out "bad elements" within the party to
project its image as a political party capable of self-reflection and
self-renewal.</P>
      <P>Su made his remarks while campaigning for Luo Wen-chia, DPP
nominee for Taipei County magistrate -- Taiwan's largest county. The
race is being viewed as a critical bridgehead to keep the party's
ruling power in 2008, as a published poll indicated that about 46
percent of the respondents think the DPP is not a party of integrity.
The poll also showed that President Chen Shui-bian's popularity is at
an all-time low.</P>
      <P>Su said a party's popularity rises and falls, so it's normal to
see survey figures go up and down; the upcoming elections are for
local governments, and the voters attach importance to the candidates
themselves, not to the parties that nominate them. He said he
believes that DPP candidates are "competent" and that their chances
for getting elected will not be affected by polls.</P>
      <P>However, he also admitted that the DPP needs to be humble and
listen to the voice of the people and act like a woodpecker to "peck
out bugs that are hurting the tree."</P>
      <P>"The biggest enemy of the DPP is itself, " said Su, "so we must
face ourselves and seek boldly to reform." He stressed that President
Chen will never halfheartedly do the task of "getting at the bad
elements" in the party.</P>
      <P>Su said the president will use the "quickest and most forceful"
way to tackle alleged corruption cases involving party members, "so
please believe in his determination and give the DPP another chance."</P>
      <P>Luo, who along with a DPP faction leader, Yuan Yi-kang, recently
launched a drive to "renew the DPP, " said they did so merely to
invite party members to think over recent incidents and try to recall
the party's core values that can be summed up as "freedom, democracy,
fairness and justice."</P>
      <P>As to allegations that he was doing this simply in a bid to save
his election campaign, Luo said he had just said what he needed to
say and did what he should have done. "Now I feel totally at ease and
clear in my mind," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS UNAWARE OF CABINET RESHUFFLE PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is not aware of any plan by
President Chen Shui-bian for a partial reshuffle of the Cabinet, a
whip of the DPP caucus said Sunday.</P>
      <P>News reports quoted a source in the DPP as saying that a
reshuffle is inevitable and is likely to take place before the
December elections of mayors and country magistrates.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment, Legislator Lai Ching-te, a whip of the DPP
legislative caucus, said the party should be introspective and
institute intra-party reforms if need be, but he added that a Cabinet
reshuffle before the elections would be unnecessary.</P>
      <P>He said the DPP caucus believes reports about a reshuffle are
nothing more than opposition parties' tactics.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on the reports, Legislator Huang Shih-cho,
convener of the legislative caucus of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union -- an ally of the DPP in the "pan-green" alliance --
suggested that the DPP government should try to maintain political
stability in Taiwan before the year-end elections by avoiding such a
reshuffle.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sun Ta-chien, deputy convener of the opposition
Kuomintang's legislative caucus, said the reports about the reshuffle
plan signify that the president is not happy with the performance of
the Cabinet led by Premier Frank Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Sun added that he believes that a series of scandals and
disputes, including the Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers working on the
Kaohsiung rapid transit railway project, have apparently created
negative impacts on the DPP's election campaign.</P>
      <P>He said the ongoing investigation led by acting Kaohsiung Mayor
Yeh Chu-lan into possible roles played by three former Kaohsiung
mayors, including Hsieh, in a profiteering case involving the
Kaohsiung rapid transit railway project at the instruction of the
president has become a threat to the premier's political future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOW POPULARITY FOR ALL PARTIES INDICATES 'JOINT DESTRUCTION': PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 9 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opinion poll published on the eve of the
National Day rocked the nation Sunday, with Premier Frank Hsieh
saying low support rates for both the ruling and opposition parties
indicate people's aversion to politics, pointing to "joint
destruction."</P>
      <P>Making his "Report to the People" in Chiayi County, central
Taiwan, Hsieh referred to the United Daily News survey which shows
President Chen Shui-bian's popularity had dipped to an all-time low
and public support for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also
dropped to just 24 percent.</P>
      <P>But he also cited statistics of the same poll showing that
support for the major opposition Kuomintang (KMT) fell by 14 percent
to 35 percent from July, when the party was preparing to elect a new
chairman. Support for the second largest opposition People First
Party was at 20 percent, while that for the minor opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) was at 19 percent.</P>
      <P>The low popularity for all political parties is an indication of
the people's dislike of politics, "and this is joint destruction, "
said the premier.</P>
      <P>His pessimism was shared by Vice President Annette Lu, who in
Taipei told the media before attending a music concert in celebration
of the Double Ten National Day that some media just like to criticize
from different perspectives, making people wonder "what is our
nation's future?"</P>
      <P>Chang Fu-mei, chairwoman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs
Commission, sponsor of the concert, said media polls or criticisms
should be seen as an effort to "rectify things out of true love of
the country." So the DPP, as the ruling party, will "reflect deeply
on itself," Chang added.</P>
      <P>She also urged the media to report more on the DPP government's
"positive performances" instead of merely muckraking.</P>
      <P>In Tung-shih town, Chiayi County, Hsieh urged the media not to
use "double standards" to look at the government's performance. He
cited a media report naming Hwang Chang General Contractor Co. as a
"new friend of the DPP government" while the company has been cited
by Taipei City Government, whose mayor is now KMT chairman.</P>
      <P>Even if Hwang Chang were in any way involved in any unlawful
activities, it should be investigated by the prosecution, and should
not be alleged by the media, Hsieh said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO CLEAN GOVERNMENT AND REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed his
commitment to keep his administration clean and to press ahead with
reforms in his Double Ten National Day address Monday.</P>
      <P>In a defense of his administration which has lurched from scandal
to scandal and has been facing mounting criticism about its drive for
its second-stage financial reforms recently, the president said that
his administration brooks no systematic or structural corruption and
that members of his ruling team should be measured by the highest
possible moral standards.</P>
      <P>The lawyer-turned-president warned that anyone involved in any
irregularities would be persecuted to the full extent of law
regardless of their political background and rank in the government.</P>
      <P>Noting that he was swept to power in 2000 on his promises to
implement reform, the president said that his administration was born
out of the people's desire for reform and that it would live up to
the people's expectations by continuing reform in six fields as
outlined by his administration.</P>
      <P>Noting that the country has developed many systematic imbalances
during its all-out pursuit of economic growth over the last five
decades, the president said his administration will address these
problems while keeping the economy growing.</P>
      <P>Chen delivered the address at a ceremony held at the Presidential
Office in celebration of the Republic of China National Day.</P>
      <P>Following is the full text of the president's address:</P>
      <P>Vice President Lu, government Officials from Taiwan,
distinguished guests, colleagues, fellow citizens, ladies and
gentlemen: Congratulations and greetings to each and every one of
you!</P>
      <P>Today, on the 94th National Day of the Republic of China
(Taiwan), we gather here to celebrate the birthday of our nation, our
hearts filled with both solemnity and jubilation as we wholeheartedly
wish our beloved Taiwan a splendid future.</P>
      <P>As we look back on the history of Taiwan's developments over the
past half century, we see that World War II had devastated people's
livelihoods and left the country's infrastructure in ruins, waiting
to be rebuilt. For the survival of the nation and the stability of
society, the government at that time set economic development as its
highest priority.</P>
      <P>Through the collective efforts of its people, Taiwan has created
great economic miracles that have won the acclaim of the world
community. Nevertheless, what lies beneath this brilliant economic
performance are many institutional and structural imbalances.</P>
      <P>Various social movement groups, including those formed by
farmers, laborers, women, indigenous peoples, and environmentalists,
have made repeated appeals for reform, demanding that the government
uphold fairness and social justice as it pursues economic growth.</P>
      <P>These appeals for reforms not only ignited the Taiwan people's
strong desire to strive for the betterment of our society, they
constituted one of the major causes that eventually led to the first
transfer of power between political parties in Taiwan in 2000.</P>
      <P>We may say that the new government formed in 2000 was born to
carry out reforms and that it exists to realize fairness and social
justice. These missions represent the most solemn mandate from the 23
million people of Taiwan, and they embody the true meaning of the
historic transfer of power between political parties.</P>
      <P>However, shortly after we completed the first-ever transfer of
power between political parties in Taiwan's history, the bursting of
the Internet bubble, the 9-11 terrorist attacks, the ensuing
anti-terrorism struggles, and the U.S.-led war in Iraq all
precipitated serious recession in the world economy.</P>
      <P>Owing to these factors, Taiwan also saw its first negative
economic growth since the end of World War II. Meanwhile, with its
unemployment rate on the rise and the health of its financial system
rapidly declining, Taiwan could have suffered domestic financial
crises at any time.</P>
      <P>In this precarious environment, the government set "economic
revitalization" and "comprehensive reform" as its paramount tasks.
With these objectives in mind, the government pushed for deregulation
of various economic and trade sectors, actively pursued
revitalization of the economy, and created more job opportunities, so
as to improve the well-being of the vast unemployed population.</P>
      <P>The tasks to accomplish "economic revitalization" and
"comprehensive reform" are meant to create win-win situations for
employees, employers and the government. They are not, as alleged by
some, government policies that lean toward the business community or
big corporations. We pursue economic prosperity in order to enhance
the people's quality of life. Wealthy people living in a poor country
cannot retain their fortune for long, whereas a wealthy society that
turns its back on the continual existence of poor people is by no
means a fair and just society.</P>
      <P>With the gradual revitalization of the economy and the continuous
lowering of the unemployment rate, the government shall adjust its
priorities step by step. In the next two-and-a-half years, my
administration will further execute reforms in six priority areas.</P>
      <P>The Six Reform Priorities are: financial reform, tax reform,
reform to change the preferential interest rates of 18 percent, media
reform, investigation into properties inappropriately seized by
political parties, and constitutional reform. These reforms aim to
balance " economic prosperity" with "social justice" in Taiwan's
comprehensive development.</P>
      <P>Since the government set the so-called "2-5-8 financial agenda"
in 2002 to reduce the average non-performing loan ratio (NPLR) to
less than five percent and raise the average capital adequacy ratio
to eight percent within two years, the NPLR for domestic banks, which
once reached a record high of 8.09 percent, had been lowered to 2.83
percent by August 31, 2005.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the average capital adequacy ratio has been raised to
more than 10 percent. Non-performing loans, with a total amount of
NT$1.4694 trillion, have been dissolved. This accomplishment, which
has helped our nation avert possible financial crises, is lauded by
the country's business community as the most successful financial
reform over the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>The first-phase financial reform has been completed; the
second-phase financial reform has started. We hope that through the
merger and integration of public and private financial institutions,
we can accelerate the inflow of foreign capital investments to our
country and attract foreign managerial teams to enhance the
competitiveness of Taiwan's financial industry in the global
community.</P>
      <P>Although the second-phase financial reform has encountered
certain challenges and there is still room for improvement in
executing the policy, the direction of the financial reform is
entirely correct. The healthy development of our country's financial
service sector not only indicates that Taiwan's industrial structure
has been moving toward the level of that of advanced countries, it
also offers our people more competitive capital management and
financial services.</P>
      <P>The second-phase financial reform is one of the government's most
imperative policies at the moment. I would like to ask all related
government agencies to rise above every challenge and achieve our
financial reform goals in due course so that our financial industry
can be well-equipped to respond to future challenges brought by
globalization.</P>
      <P>Over the years, preferential measures to encourage investment and
promote upgrading of industries have not been routinely re-examined,
which, coupled with tax exemptions for certain groups of people, has
turned our country's tax system into an unfair one and seriously
affected our people's confidence in the preservation of social
justice.</P>
      <P>To address this problem, the Executive Yuan has sent the revised
version of the Income Tax Law and regulations regarding the
Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) system to the legislature for review.
The move manifests the government's effort and determination to
improve our unfair taxation system. Through re-examining and
adjusting related tax items and rates, we aim to effectively improve
the government's capacity to carry out major national development
projects and offer more resources for the disadvantaged groups.</P>
      <P>The reform of our taxation system will certainly encounter all
sorts of difficulties and challenges, but our people's expectation of
the realization of fairness and justice in our society provides the
most forceful impetus propelling us forward. The government will try
to engage in extensive communication with our people and do its
utmost to implement comprehensive tax reform step by step.</P>
      <P>On July 1, 2005, the "new pension system, " which has been
postponed for 14 years, was eventually implemented. More than 90
percent of the nation's workers, numbering more than 7 million, are
now eligible to obtain pensions under the new system. The
establishment of the system is the most significant breakthrough in
Taiwan's history of building up a social safety net.</P>
      <P>However, even with this new system in place, there are still many
unreasonable practices in Taiwan's overall pension programs. After
the implementation of the "new pension system, " ordinary workers can
enjoy 54 percent of pension replacement rate after 30 years of work.
However, some retired military personnel, civil servants and teachers
who enjoy the 18 percent interest rates can have 100, 120 or even 130
percent pension replacement rate of pre-retirement income. This
situation exposes the unreasonable and unfair practices in our old
pension system.</P>
      <P>So far, related government agencies have studied possible
measures to limit the amount of savings to which the 18 percent
interest rates can be applied; other potential approaches to reduce
the pension replacement rate of pre-retirement income for retired
military personnel, civil servants and teachers to no more than 90
percent have also been considered.</P>
      <P>These efforts are taken to address the unreasonable situation
where some retired military personnel, civil servants and teachers
receive pensions that are higher than their pre-retirement income,
and to narrow the gap between pensions received by these individuals
and workers from other walks of life.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by the Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission, more than 60 percent of the public believes
that it is unreasonable that some certain individuals should enjoy
100 percent pension replacement rate of pre-retirement income. The
survey also revealed that nearly 50 percent of the public believes it
is acceptable that pension replacement rates for these retired
military personnel, civil servants and teachers be lowered to 90 or
80 percent.</P>
      <P>Proposals to improve our pension system will be sent to the
Examination Yuan for review, and I would like to urge members of the
Examination Yuan to make decisions on these proposals as soon as
possible to meet the public's expectations.</P>
      <P>It has been five years since the completion of the first-ever
transfer of power between political parties; however, many problems
inherited from past authoritarian regime -- under which a single
party's control deeply entrenched the government's operations -- have
yet to be completely resolved.</P>
      <P>These problems include but not limit to: the handling of
inappropriately acquired assets by political parties and the all-out
elimination of the influence of political party, government and the
military in the media. Although the executive branch has already sent
relevant bill proposals to the Legislative Yuan for review, however,
to date, these proposed bills have never been put to discussions or
deliberation.</P>
      <P>In the process of its recent internal power re-shuffling --
notwithstanding the expectations from our society and the appeals
made by public discourse, calling for reformed conducts and returning
of the seized properties to the people -- the political party
responsible for inappropriately seizing the nation's assets not only
has refused to comply with the public's expectations, but has instead
rushed to sell off these properties at a low price.</P>
      <P>Their actions provide a glaring confirmation of their lack of
sincerity in acknowledging and making amends for their past mistakes.
The handling of assets inappropriately acquired by political parties
has set the stage for the competition between those who advocate for
reforms and those who oppose them.</P>
      <P>I want to hereby solemnly proclaim our commitment to employ all
possible means to return to the people of Taiwan and our country
properties seized inappropriately by political parties, because these
properties are not single party's assets and the transfer of their
ownership does not automatically legalize the possession of these
properties.</P>
      <P>Also, pursuant to the amendments to the Broadcasting and
Television Law, all political parties, government, and the military
must withdraw their remaining clout in the media by December 26th of
this year. However, the deliberation of bills concerning the release
of government-owned shares in the media proprietorship have not been
completed in the Legislative Yuan, thereby barring the continuation
of follow-up actions.</P>
      <P>Relevant government agencies must continue to strive for the
legislation of these proposed bills expeditiously; more importantly,
greater efforts must also be devoted to completely eliminate the
influence of government from the media by appropriate means and
within the time limit mandated by the revised Broadcasting and
Television Law, in order to push forward a constructive development
of Taiwan's media industry and democracy.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years, my administration has never wavered in
our commitment to implement reforms. To this end, we have neither
hesitance nor reservation in our resolve. However, the political
reality confronting a minority government -- which does not represent
the majority in the Legislative Yuan -- continues to hamper the
implementation of various reform measures, undercutting the efficacy
of these reforms.</P>
      <P>The current state of affairs with regard to reforms has exposed
the deficiencies in our constitutional system -- deficiencies that
constitute the greatest resistance and impediment to our reform
projects. Our current constitutional system is one that does not
provide the mechanism to effectively deal with political stalemate,
and one that has rendered our nation and our government idling in a
state of incessant quibbling. In order to strengthen good governance
and upgrade our nation's overall competitiveness, we must continue to
make headway in comprehensive constitutional reforms.</P>
      <P>With the first phase of the constitutional re-engineering project
completed on June 7th, the right to hold referendum has been
incorporated in the statues governing the procedures for
constitutional amendments. Henceforth, all future constitutional
re-engineering projects will be carried out by adopting a "bottom-up
and outside-in" approach; that is, relevant proposals will be first
initiated by the social groups before political parties are involved.</P>
      <P>The social groups may even take the lead in the constitutional
reform processes with the government playing a mere supporting role
and helping to map out the procedures and channels for popular
participation, as well as to encourage extensive discussions on
constitutional reforms among people from all walks of life. Finally,
through deliberative democracy, we hope to step-by-step assemble a
concrete constitutional reform plan, which will be proposed and put
to vote in the Legislative Yuan, and its final ratification approved
by the people of Taiwan through referendum.</P>
      <P>The era of constitutional reforms dictated by one-person or
one-party, or with the participation and consultation of party elites
only, has ended. Future constitutional re-engineering project must
engage popular participation, for that its success necessarily hinges
on the support and acceptance of the people.</P>
      <P>Currently, our Constitution is neither timely, nor suitable, nor
viable. In order to lay a solid foundation for political stability in
Taiwan and for our nation's long-term stability and sustainability,
there must be comprehensive constitutional reviews and revisions.</P>
      <P>I would like to hereby call upon all our fellow citizens to
pro-actively take part in the constitutional re-engineering process.
What we strive to accomplish together, after all, is a Constitution
that belongs to each and every one of us. Let us, therefore,
galvanize our collective wisdom and strength to engender a timely,
suitable and viable new Constitution for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Dear fellow citizens, the abovementioned Six Reform Priorities
stand at the top of my administration's agenda; more importantly,
these are the "Contracts with the people of Taiwan." Rest assured
that everyone in the government will spare no effort to achieve these
reform objectives, unopposed by any difficulty or obstacle.</P>
      <P>The first step of reform rests upon the reform of the government
itself. Since the completion of the transfer of power between
political parties, our government has imposed upon ourselves the
highest moral and ethical standards, based on which we have
endeavored to ensure a political system free of corruption and an
administration proactive and assiduous.</P>
      <P>Despite criticisms we faced along the way, we will forge ahead
courageously, while humbly and with an open-mind, reflecting and
readjusting to pursue improvements. Furthermore, we pledge to impose
zero tolerance for any systematic or structural corruption. In the
event of any individual found to violate the laws of our nation --
provided that there is evidence substantiating such allegation -- he
or she will be sanctioned by the law; and any corruptive misconduct
will be subject to actions taken by our legal authorities,
irrespective of the background, credentials or social status of the
persons involved.</P>
      <P>To this end, our resolve to eliminate corruption sees no bounds.
As for any judicial personnel found to have violated the law or to be
ill-suited for his or her position, tougher yet are the standards
that will be applied to establish impartial review procedures to
expedite the removal of these individuals from the judicial system,
so as to restore the confidence and trust our people have in the
quality of our judicial system and in our democratic rule of law.</P>
      <P>Historical developments have set Taiwan on the course of becoming
the safe haven as well as the homeland for the 23 million people of
Taiwan. Furthermore, over the last half century, people of Taiwan --
in their struggle for freedom, democracy, equality and justice --
have been brought together by a shared destiny.</P>
      <P>Each time we take an aerial view of the beautiful land of Taiwan,
it always stirs the deepest emotions we have for this land we call
home. On this land, Taiwan stands as an integrated and indivisible
entity; on this land, people of Taiwan are united by our shared
destiny intrinsically connected to our land; and for better or worse,
our people have, and will continue to walk alongside one another
through thick and thin.</P>
      <P>For the future of Taiwan and for the well-being of our future
generations, we must unite as one and consolidate the strength of our
people to deepen and expand the scope of our reforms; and in
continued prosperity and progress, we must, and we will, vigorously
persist on the path to attain equality and justice.</P>
      <P>In closing, let us wish the Republic of China (Taiwan) a happy
birthday and sustained prosperity. And to all my fellow citizens,
dear friends and honorable guests, may health and happiness be with
you always.
Thank you</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT REITERATES PROMISE TO PRESS AHEAD WITH REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian pledged Monday to
press ahead with further reforms during his last two years in office,
saying these reforms will help bring "prosperity" and "justice" to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony marking the 94th founding anniversary of
the Republic of China held at the Presidential Office, Chen spoke of
his great determination to carry out reform of the island's
financial, tax, media and constitutional systems as well as in
matters related to a controversial interest rate system that has
given preferential treatment to certain groups of retirees and to
recovering assets inappropriately acquired by political parties.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan experienced its first-ever transfer of political
power between political parties in 2000, Chen said that the bursting
of the dot-com bubble, the 9-11 terrorist attacks on America, and the
subsequent global war on terrorism and the U.S.-led war in Iraq
caused a setback for the world economy, resulting in Taiwan
experiencing negative economic growth for the first time since the
end of World War II.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that in this precarious environment, his
administration set "economic revitalization" and "comprehensive
reform" as its top priorities, the president said the Cabinet then
made efforts to deregulate economic and trade rules in order to
stimulate economic recovery and create more jobs as well as a
"win-win situation" for employees, employers and the government.</P>
      <P>Chen said the tasks to accomplish economic revitalization and
comprehensive reform are aimed at upgrading the standard of living of
all Taiwanese, and are "not, as alleged by some, government policies
that lean toward the business community or big corporations."</P>
      <P>"Wealthy people living in a poor country cannot retain their
fortune for long, whereas a wealthy society that turns its back on
the existence of the poor also goes against the principle of social
justice and fairness, " he said.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that with the gradual revitalization of the
economy and the continuing lowering of the unemployment rate, the
government will adjust its priorities step by step.</P>
      <P>Talking about financial reform, the president said that after
completing the first stage of reform, the government has begun the
second-stage of reform by consolidating public and private financial
institutions in order to accelerate the flow of foreign investment
and financial management into the island which will upgrade the
international competitiveness of Taiwan's financial sector.</P>
      <P>Although the second-stage financial reform has encountered some
difficulties and there is still room for the government to improve
its policies in carrying out the reform, the president said that he
has requested that the authorities concerned do whatever they can to
achieve the goal of reform in order to respond to the challenges of
globalization that the financial sector will encounter in the future.</P>
      <P>Concerning tax system reform, the president said that the
Executive Yuan has put forward the " revised version of the Income
Tax Law and regulations regarding the alternative Minimum Tax system"
to the Legislative Yuan for review.</P>
      <P>"The reform of our taxation system will certainly encounter all
sorts of difficulties and challenges, but the public's expectation of
the realization of justice and fairness in our society provides the
most forceful impetus propelling us forward," the president said.</P>
      <P>Criticizing the so-called preferential interest rates of 18
percent given to some retired teachers, civil servants and military
personnel, the president noted that ordinary workers only enjoy a
pension replacement rate of pre-retirement income of only 54 percent
after 30 years of work, while some civil servants enjoy a rate of
over 100 percent, which he said is "unreasonable and unfair."</P>
      <P>According to Chen, relevant governmental agencies have studied
possible measures to limit the amount of savings to which the 18
percent interest rates can be applied, with other potential
approaches to reduce the pension replacement rate of pre-retirement
income for retired military personnel, civil servants and teachers to
no more than 90 percent also being considered.</P>
      <P>"Proposals to improve our pension system will be sent to the
Examination Yuan for review, and I would like to urge members of the
Examination Yuan to make decisions on these proposals as soon as
possible to meet the public's expectations," he added.</P>
      <P>The president also said that many of the problems "inherited from
the past authoritarian regime" have yet to be resolved.</P>
      <P>These problems include the handling of inappropriately acquired
assets by political parties and the elimination of influence of
political parties, the military and government in the media, Chen
said. He promised that the government will use "all possible means"
to return to the people and the nation all properties seized
inappropriately by political parties.</P>
      <P>Touching on the legislature's delay in deliberating on bills
concerning the release of government-owned shares in media
organizations, the president called for related government agencies
to continue to work on the legislation of these bills and on
eliminating completely the influence of the government in the media
by appropriate means and within the time limit mandated by the
revised Broadcasting and Television Law.</P>
      <P>Admitting that the minority government has been continually
hampered in trying to implement various reforms in the nation since
he took office in 2000, the president said that this proves that the
Constitution's deficiencies "constitute the greatest resistance and
impediment to our reform projects."</P>
      <P>"Our current constitutional system is one that does not provide
the mechanism to effectively deal with political stalemate, and one
that has rendered our nation and our government idling in a state of
incessant quibbling, " he also said, adding that "in order to
strengthen good governance and upgrade our nation's overall
competitiveness, we must continue to make headway in comprehensive
constitutional reforms."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT REITERATES NEED FOR CONSTITUTIONAL RE-ENGINEERING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reiterated Monday
that it is imperative to accelerate constitutional re-engineering,
saying that only well-designed constitutional paradigms will form the
bedrock of an efficient and long-lasting state system.</P>
      <P>In his National Day address, Chen stressed that in order to lay a
solid foundation for political stability in Taiwan and for the
nation's long-term stability and sustainability, there must be a
comprehensive review and revision of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan's Constitution is neither timely, nor suitable,
nor viable, he said, adding that the era of constitutional reforms
dictated by one person or one party, or with only the participation
and consultation of party elites, has ended.</P>
      <P>Chen said the current state of affairs in Taiwan with regard to
the reforms has exposed the deficiencies in the nation's
constitutional system, claiming that these deficiencies represent the
greatest impediment to his administration's reform projects.</P>
      <P>He said the current constitutional system does not provide the
mechanism to effectively deal with political stalemate, adding that
the system has rendered the nation and government "idling in a state
of incessant quibbling."</P>
      <P>Chen maintained that as a responsible government, he and his
Democratic Progressive Party administration have deeply perceived the
imperative for building a new political order in a swiftly changing
society like Taiwan's.</P>
      <P>Constitutional re-engineering is a pressing issue and a "sacred
mission" of the administration that must be carried out in order to
complete Taiwan's transition from an authoritarian to a stable
democratic system, he said.</P>
      <P>The constitutional re-engineering project must include popular
participation as the project's success depends on the support and
acceptance of the people, he added.</P>
      <P>With the first phase of the constitutional re-engineering project
completed June 7, the right to referendum has been incorporated into
the statutes governing the procedures for constitutional amendments,
Chen said, adding that henceforth, all future constitutional
re-engineering will be carried out by adopting a "bottom-up and
outside-in" approach. That is, he said, relevant proposals will first
be initiated by social groups before political parties get involved
in the process.</P>
      <P>The social groups may even take the lead in the constitutional
reform process, with the government playing a mere supporting role
and helping to map out the procedures and channels for popular
participation, and to encourage extensive discussions on
constitutional reforms among people from all walks of life.</P>
      <P>Finally, he said, "through deliberative democracy, we hope to
step-by-step assemble a concrete constitutional reform plan, which
will be proposed and put to a vote in the Legislative Yuan, with its
final ratification approved by the people of Taiwan through
referendum."</P>
      <P>"I'd like to hereby call upon all our fellow citizens to
proactively take part in the constitutional re-engineering process.
What we strive to accomplish together, after all, is a Constitution
that belongs to each and every one of us. Let us, therefore,
galvanize our collective wisdom and strength to engender a timely,
suitable and viable new Constitution for Taiwan, " the president
proclaimed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP, TSU LEGISLATIVE CAUCUSES POSITIVE ABOUT PRESIDENT'S REFORMS</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) , were positive Monday about the six reforms
espoused by President Chen Shui-bian in his Double Ten National Day
message.</P>
      <P>President Chen stressed in the message his administration's
resolve to continue with reforms. He said the six reform priorities
are financial reform, tax reform, reform to change the preferential
interest rate of 18 percent for certain pensioners, media
reform, investigation into properties inappropriately seized by
political parties, and constitutional reform.</P>
      <P>William C.T. Lai, DPP caucus whip in the legislature, said that
every aspect of Chen's message has "met the needs of the nation" and
demonstrated that the DPP is the best defender of the nation's
security and the top choice for carrying out reform.</P>
      <P>On President Chen's affirmation that he will have "zero
tolerance" for any corruption, Lai said that this shows the
president's concern for the matter and that he will address the
flurry of recent scandals, including the high-profile Kaohsiung mass
rapid transit construction scandal.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the legislative caucus of the Taiwan Solidarity Union
said Monday that the six reforms outlined by the President Chen "are
the right direction and conform with social justice."</P>
      <P>However, Ho Min-hao, the TSU caucus whip in the legislature, also
said that reforms can only be carried out if related bills have been
passed by the legislature.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that the legislature is still controlled by the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First
Party, Ho said that he is pessimistic about pushing through the
reforms.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT'S NATIONAL DAY REMARKS  'POLITICAL SLOGANS': KMT, PFP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) shrugged off
President Chen Shui-bian's comments during the ROC's national day as
"political slogans" that were unlikely to resonate with the public.</P>
      <P>Celebrating the Republic of China's 94th national day, Chen said
from the Presidential Office that over the remaining two years of his
term, he will see that the government does whatever necessary to
reform the financial sector, make the taxation system fairer, better
govern operations of media, correct the unfair preferential interest
rate of 18 percent given to certain minority retirees and recover
assets that have been taken inappropriately by political parties.</P>
      <P>However, the "pan-blue alliance" considered the president's words
to be of no value.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, director of the KMT's Central Policy Committee,
said that even though Chen's remarks were forceful, they were still
just " political slogans."</P>
      <P>"The president must set an example for the public by taking
concrete actions rather than chanting slogans; the reforms must be
applied, not just talked about, " Tseng said. The people will not
trust him, Tseng said, if the president continues "giving lip service
instead of actually doing something."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Daniel Hwang, convener of the PFP caucus at the
Legislative Yuan, said that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) "can only govern the nation by sloganeering."</P>
      <P>Although the people have given the president and his party five
years to make reforms a reality, they have failed to run the nation
efficiently, the legislator said, adding that the public has lost
confidence in the government. "People are probably not even paying
attention to the president's recitation of his intention to make
reforms," he said.</P>
      <P>During the last five years, the gap between the rich and the poor
has grown and the nation is also suffering a high rate of
unemployment, he further said, adding that the ruling party can only
chant slogans ahead of various elections to excite voters rather than
seriously contemplate measures on how to solve the problems that the
people are concerned with.</P>
      <P>What the public currently wants most is a more equal distribution
of wealth and an incorruptible government, he continued, adding that
the government's slogans have disappointed the people and that the
president has lost his honesty and the people's trust. "It is the
president's personality and honesty that need to undergo a reform, "
Hwang noted.</P>
      <P>He also said that Chen's remarks are an attempt to steer the DPP
away from the current "turbid situation" related to its campaigns for
the year-end county mayor and magistrate elections.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Political leaders from home and abroad
gathered at the Presidential Office Plaza Monday to watch the 94th
Republic of China National Day celebrations.</P>
      <P>The Double Ten National Day celebrations were presided over by
Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng, with President Chen Shui-bian
delivering a keynote National Day address.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou was also present at
the ceremony, marking the first time that an opposition leader has
taken part in a National Day ceremony at the Presidential Office
since the completion of the first-ever transfer of power between
political parties in Taiwan five years ago.</P>
      <P>Other heads of states and political leaders from abroad,
including the presidents of the Gambia and Honduras, were also on
hand to offer their congratulations to the Republic of China on its
birthday.</P>
      <P>In his address, Wang said that the nation's forefathers came from
the Chinese mainland to Taiwan 500 years ago by risking their lives
to cross the Taiwan Strait. After settling on Taiwan, they
concertedly cultivated the lands without ethnic tensions and made
Taiwan a diverse society where everybody enjoyed freedom and
equality.</P>
      <P>Wang called for the country to emulate their forefathers and
jointly strive for Taiwan's future and its international
competitiveness while discarding ethnic differences and political
quibbling.</P>
      <P>On the development of cross-strait relations, Wang said that
since the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are originally "one family,"
sharing a common history, culture, traditions and languages, the two
sides should bury the hatchet and avoid the recurrence of strife
between rival political entities that has been occurred over the past
decades.</P>
      <P>As private cross-strait exchanges have been unavoidable in recent
years, but the two sides officially remain in a position of political
stalemate, Wang said that only when rulers from the two sides forsake
their arm races and political intimidation can they cooperate and
create a win win situation for both.</P>
      <P>Following the National Day ceremony a festive gala was held
featuring a variety of performances by students and private groups
from around the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT WARNS OF DANGERS OF LACK OF SELF-DEFENSE RESOLVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A lack of self-defense determination is the
biggest threat to Taiwan's security, and the inactivity of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is a result of caving in to pressure from
another political party, President Chen Shui-bian said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while speaking at a ceremony at the
Presidential Office marking the Double Ten National Day of the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Despite the huge challenges that lie ahead, Chen vowed again to
pursue "conciliation, cooperation and ever-lasting peace" in terms of
cross-Taiwan Strait ties, and said that "beefing up Taiwan's defense
capability and protecting peace in the strait" is something the
government must do to echo the fervent calls from the international
community for the reopening of peace talks between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The president lamented that the KMT "has been snatched away by
another party" from granting approval to a major arms procurement
bill in the Legislative Yuan -- an apparent reference to the People
First Party (PFP) , which together with the KMT and New Party forms
the "pan blue alliance."</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the major weaponry purchase plan dates back to
the days when the KMT was in power, Chen called on the KMT to reverse
its stance of opposition to the plan and not turn a blind eye to
public opinion.</P>
      <P>The administration has made adjustments to the major arms deal
which the opposition camp had repeatedly claimed was too expensive,
but the KMT has failed to respond positively by cooperating on the
issue in the legislature, Chen said, attributing this to the PFP's
foot dragging.</P>
      <P>At a time when the United States and Japan have been on increased
alert over China's rapid military modernization and expansion which
has widely been viewed as a significant risk to peace and security in
the Asia-Pacific, Taiwan has displayed no confidence or resolve in
safeguarding itself, Chen said, calling this "extremely regrettable
and a grave concern."</P>
      <P>The "pan blue alliance" and the "pan green camp" of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity
Union, have been engaged in fierce political wrangling virtually
since the time that President Chen was first elected in 2000.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan blue alliance" has blocked the major arms
purchase bill at the legislature 31 times since the middle of last
year. The bill would allow the government to use a special budget to
buy eight diesel-electric submarines and 12 P-3C Orion anti-submarine
aircraft for NT$340 billion (US$11 billion) -- down significantly
from the original NT$680 billion projected by the Ministry of
National Defense (MND).</P>
      <P>The MND has agreed to finance the purchase of the third item in
the arms procurement package -- six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries -- with the ministry's regular annual budget, instead of
through a special budget.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRIVATE GROUPS SAY PFP 'PEACE BILL' INCONSISTENT WITH CONSTITUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Society and the 21th Century
Constitutional Reform Association lambasted a bill Monday proposed by
the opposition People First Party (PFP) that purports to promote
peace with China, claiming it is inconsistent with the ROC
Constitution.</P>
      <P>Huang Hsiou-tuan, president of the Taiwan Society and a professor
at Soochow University, said this "peace-promoting" bill, which
envisions the formation of a special commission to negotiate peace
with China with its members mirroring the ratios of various political
parties in the legislature and its budget examined by the
legislature, would be counter to the constitutional principle
concerning the division of the executive and legislative branches.</P>
      <P>Under the bill, the commission would be in charge of negotiations
with China for peace, with the power to conclusion treaties. This
would encroach on the constitutional rights of the president and the
Executive Yuan, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Political parties should propose bills for the general good of
the people rather than for their partisan interests, and should
always keep in mind constitutional principles, Huang went on.</P>
      <P>Noting that political power transfers are common in democracies,
Huang warned opposition parties that by "digging a hole" by enacting
this legislation, "they may find themselves one day falling to this
very hole should they win the next presidential election and form the
next administration."</P>
      <P>Hung Yu-hung, a professor at National Yangming University and the
convener of the 21th Century Constitutional Reform Association, said
the political impasse between the legislature and the executive
branches results from the country's ill-conceived governmental
system, with both the opposition, which controls the legislature, and
the ruling party, which controls the presidency, believing they have
the sole mandate to form policy.</P>
      <P>The contradiction in provisions in the Constitution have led to
this ridiculous legislation, Hung said, citing the
opposition-sponsored Organic Statute of the 319 Truth Investigation
Commission as another example of an ill-conceived bill.</P>
      <P>To avoid confusion, Hung said, his association advocates
rewriting the Constitution to redefine the roles of the executive and
legislative branches.</P>
      <P>He echoed Huang in warning the PFP and its political ally, the
Kuomintang (KMT) , against ramming the bill through the legislature
because this would only intensify the confrontations between the
opposition and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>They made the comments one day before the KMT and the PFP, which
control a slim majority in the legislature, are set to put the bill
to a vote in the legislature in defiance of the DPP's objections.</P>

      <P>Lo Chih-cheng, director of the Department of Information of the

    <DATELINE>Poipet, Cambodia, Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Hsu Yu-li and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Many people donate to the poor or
the needy from the comfort of their homes, but few like Yang
Wei-ling, a flight attendant-turned-philanthropist, have chosen to
live with those in need to better their lives.</P>
      <P>An attractive China Airlines' (CAL) flight attendant, who doubled
as a volunteer with Taipei's 119 Emergency Hotline, Yang became aware
of what she wanted at the age of 22 and quit her well-paid CAL job in
1989 and set up the Field Relief Agency (FRA) , non-profit NGO group
devoted to humanitarian relief work overseas.</P>
      <P>Since 1999, Yang has divided her time between traveling around
Cambodia helping the poor and the needy there and raising money and
collecting donated books in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Staying with orphans, the handicapped and the homeless in
Cambodia over the past 10 years or so, Yang is now an expert on
Cambodia and knows the country better than most Cambodians
themselves.</P>
      <P>In her latest book about her experiences in Cambodia, Yang said
that the really strong people are not political leaders who turn
countries into slaughterhouses but those who love and serve the poor
and the needy.</P>
      <P>Yang established an orphanage in Poipet, a poverty-stricken
border town in northwestern Cambodia, in 1999, followed by a
vocational training center in the same town in 2001, in an effort to
provide homes for the homeless kids and help housewives without
incomes learn some skills which can help earn them a living in a
country that was bathed in bloodshed several decades ago.</P>
      <P>In September, five Taiwan charity organizations joined the FRA
and offered humanitarian relief to the people of Poipet by sending
representatives there.</P>
      <P>The "Love of Taiwan" delegation, comprised of members of the FRA,
the Taiwan Roots Medical Peace Corps (TRMPC) , Compassion
International, the Eden Social Welfare Foundation and the Noordhoff
Craniofacial Foundation, arrived in Poipet on Sept. 25 to deliver
humanitarian relief to the locals.</P>
      <P>In two days, delegation members had offered free medical services
to more than 700 people in Poipet.</P>
      <P>The delegation had brought with it some 600 kilograms of
medication and medical aid materials, including wheelchairs,
crutches, walking aids and white sticks for the blind, as many people
in Poipet are victims of landmines that were planted secretly there
when Poipet was a war zone.</P>
      <P>Due to poverty and poor sanitation, many youths aged around 15 in
Poipet weigh only 20kg to 30 kg, while many men, due to long-term
coolie labor, suffer problems with their joints and most women have
gynecological problems, according to TRMPC medical professionals.</P>
      <P>In addition, a large number of Poipet residents suffer from
vision problems, some of whom have suffered eye problems since their
childhood, said an eye doctor with the TRMPC.</P>
      <P>Sept. 26 was a "big day" for the Poipet locals, particularly the
children and youths, because the town's first high school was
inaugurated, thanks to Yang's devotion and compassion to the
Cambodian people over the past decade.</P>
      <P>The Cambodian-language high school, the first of its kind in
northwestern Cambodian, is capable of allowing more than 1,000 youths
to attend school free of charge.</P>
      <P>Yang managed to raise US$120,000 to build the school, which
offers junior and senior education for youths aged over 12.</P>
      <P>Knowing that Cambodian teachers tend to give closer academic
attention to their students in paid after-school classes in order to
make extra money, Yang decided to pay the teachers at the high school
salaries twice or three times more than ordinary levels, hoping that
they will focus their teaching on the new school.</P>
      <P>Yang offered her gratitude to the Taiwan International Lions Club
300-A2 for a donation of US$80,000 to fund the hardware development
in the new school and to Compassion International for donating 18
standard blackboards ready to be installed in the school's 18
classrooms.</P>
      <P>The FRA will finance 80 percent of the cost of maintaining the
school, including teachers' salaries, while Cambodia's education
authorities will finance the remaining 20 percent, according to Yang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the FRA has also launched a campaign to have 500
bicycles donated to help children and youths in Poipet to go to
school. "Each bike means a boy or a girl can go to school, " she
added.</P>
      <P>Believing that education is the best way to help people surmount
poverty, Yang has continued to build schools in Cambodia and she even
coined the phrase, "Education changes a child's fate, " the motto of
the new school.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT IS ACTING AGAINST PUBLIC OPINION: PFP SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A spokesman for the opposition People First
Party (PFP) on Monday branded President Chen Shui-bian as a head of
state who is self-contradictory and acts against public opinion.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Kung-ping made the remarks in response to Chen's Republic
of China Double Ten National Day speech, which was delivered in a
celebration rally held in front of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>In the speech, Chen blamed opposition parties -- referring to the
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the PFP -- for
blocking bills concerning the government's multi-billion NT dollar
U.S. arms procurement proposal from being put on the legislative
agenda 31 times in a row.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that President Chen upholds the right of referendum on
one the one hand, but on the other spares no effort to push for the
arms procurement, which he claimed has already been defeated in a
referendum held at the same time as the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The referendum was considered "invalid" because the required 50
percent of voters participation was not met. However, of the roughly
45 percent who did vote, over 90 percent said "yes" to the following
question: "The people of Taiwan demand that the Taiwan Strait issue
be resolved through peaceful means. Should mainland China refuse to
withdraw the missiles it has targeted at Taiwan and openly renounce
the use of force against us, would you agree that the government
should acquire more advanced anti-missile weapons to strengthen
Taiwan's self-defense capabilities?"</P>
      <P>Hsieh claimed that the fact that the "pan-blue alliance's" clear
stand against the "arm purchase of the rich" helped them win a
majority of legislative seats in last year's election reflects the
public's opposition to the proposal.</P>
      <P>"President Chen's attempt to revive the procurement is not only a
move contradicting his own political idea, but a defiant move against
democracy, " Hsieh claimed, adding that the president is "acting
against public opinion."</P>
      <P>Mentioning Chen's promise in his National Day speech to continue
efforts to promote a wide range of reforms, Hsieh said that the PFP
believes this is nothing but a slogan. "President Chen is himself in
need of reform," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Around 500 dignitaries took part in a
national day cocktail reception sponsored by the Republic of China
representative office in the city-state of Singapore to mark its
Double Ten National Day Monday.</P>
      <P>The dignitaries included several Singaporean parliamentarians,
ranking military officials, members of the diplomatic corps as well
as Taiwan expatriates.</P>
      <P>Compared with last year's Double Ten reception when China vented
its displeasure over then-Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien
Loong's visit to Taiwan in July 2004 prior to his taking the post of
prime minister, the number of dignitaries taking part in this year's
banquet was bigger, especially Singaporean political and military
figures, showing that Taiwan-Singapore relations have returned to
normal in the wake of being pressured by China after Lee's visit,
local analysts said.</P>
      <P>ROC Representative to Singapore Hu Wei-jen said that since
assuming his job in July, he has called on Singaporean government

    <HEADLINE>SHOWDOWN EXPECTED IN LEGISLATURE OVER NCC, PEACE-PROMOTION BILLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative causes of the various
political parties are bracing themselves for a showdown and possible
bloodshed in the legislature Tuesday over whether two controversial
bills should be put to a vote.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally, the
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), in the "pan-green camp" are opposed to
the National Communications Commission (NCC) Organic Bill and an
opposition People First Party (PFP)-proposed bill that aims to
promote peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>However, the "pan-blue alliance" of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) and the PFP, which enjoys a slight majority in the 225-seat
legislature, hopes to pass the two bills as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU), which holds 11 seats
and calls itself the "pivotal minority, " has expressed its support
for the two bills. Lin Ping-kun, convener of the NPSU caucus, said
the two bills should be allowed to become law because, he claimed,
they have "considerable support" from the people. However, he added
that "if the public reaction is not good," the bills can always be
amended in the future.</P>
      <P>The DPP caucus, which used drastic measures to obstruct the
legislative proceedings of the two bills Sept. 27, has made some
concessions on the NCC bill by agreeing to debate it before the vote.</P>
      <P>Chao Yung-ching, convener of the DPP caucus, said Monday that if
the bill gets passed, the "pan-green camp" will try to have the bill
overturned or seek a final judgment from the Council of Grand
Justices based on the Constitution. However, on the peace-promotion
bill, he was adamant that the DPP caucus will do whatever it can to
prevent it from becoming law.</P>
      <P>Ho Min-hao, convener of the TSU legislative caucus, told
reporters Monday that the TSU legislators are "combat-ready" and will
use the "most radical" means to block the passage of the
peace-promotion bill.</P>
      <P>The KMT and PFP caucuses have proposed a clause-by-clause debate
before the two bills are put to the vote. Their whips said the
pan-blue side will tolerate reasonable filibustering by DPP and TSU
legislators.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jing-pyng said he will arrange a
pre-meeting consultation between the two sides. Pan-blue caucus
leaders have indicated that if no agreement is reached at the
consultation, the KMT and the PFP caucuses will force a vote on the
two bills.</P>
      <P>The PFP caucus has advised its legislators to wear casual clothes
and sneakers and to be prepared for possible conflict and bloodshed.</P>
      <P>The controversy over the NCC Organic Bill is mainly about the
composition of the commission. The pan-green side is strongly opposed
to the NCC members being selected in proportion to the number of
seats each party holds in the legislature, while the pan-blue side
insists that this is designed to keep the ruling party from
manipulating the media by appointing all the president's men to the
NCC.</P>
      <P>As for the so-called peace-promotion bill, the pan-green side
believes that if it is enacted in its present form, the bill will
become a "bylaw" of China's Anti-Secession Law that gives China the
legal means to use "non-peaceful means" to settle cross-Taiwan Strait
issues. However, Huang Yi-chiao, convener of the PFP legislative
caucus, claimed that the bill is aimed at preventing the ruling party
from "dominating cross-strait affairs" and hurting Taiwan people's
interests by clinging to the DPP's political ideology.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui will depart
for the United States Tuesday for a two-week visit to meet with "old
friends," his aides said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee will visit four U.S. cities -- Anchorage, New York,
Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles -- where he will meet with senior
executives of major Taiwanese associations as well as American
politicians, think tank scholars and opinion leaders.</P>
      <P>An outspoken critic of China's military threat and diplomatic
suppression of Taiwan, Lee will take advantage of his visit to arouse
attention to the possible impact of China's rise on the peace and
stability in the Taiwan Strait, the Asia-Pacific region and the
entire world, Lee's aides said.</P>
      <P>Lee, an active advocate of Taiwan's separate national identity,
will also urge the international community not to condone China's
increasingly evident attempts to annex Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, his aides said, Lee will discuss with Taiwanese
community leaders how to pool resources at home and abroad to defend
Taiwan's national interests.</P>
      <P>He will also exchange views with influential U.S. congressional
members, think tank researchers and social opinion leaders on the
latest developments in the general international situation.</P>
      <P>Beijing has branded Lee a separatist for supporting Taiwan
independence. He retired in 2000, but Beijing still warns foreign
governments against granting him visas, saying that the former leader
seizes any opportunity to advocate Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Lee will be in Washington from Oct. 17-20, during which he is
scheduled to deliver a speech at the National Press Club. During his
tenure as Republic of China president, Lee made a rare visit to the
United States in June 1995, which sparked a fierce protest from
China. Beijing accused him of using a reunion at his alma mater,
Cornell University, to advance his political agenda.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The South Korean cargo ship Samho Brother
that overturned following a collision off Hsinchu on Taiwan's
northwest coast, carries 3,140 cubic meters of benzene, which could
pose a hazard to fishing vessels operating in the area, the Coast
Guard Administration (CGA) warned Monday.</P>
      <P>CGA officials said they had notified the Chemical Disaster
Prevention Center for northern Taiwan to send experts to inspect
whether the harmful chemical has leaked into the sea. At the same
time, fishery radio stations were asked to warn fishing vessels to
stay away from the area, located about nine nautical miles west of
Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>In addition to benzene, the ship was carrying 85 tons of fuel oil
and 16 tons of diesel. An oil slick on the surface of the sea could
been seen clearly from TV pictures.</P>
      <P>Benzene, made mostly from petroleum sources, is toxic and highly
flammable, and can dissolve slightly in water. It is used for
manufacturing rubber, lubricants, dyes, detergents and pesticides.
The chemical is known to cause leukemia in humans when its fumes are
breathed at industrial exposure levels.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration formed an emergency
task force in an attempt to control the pollution.</P>
      <P>The 3,561-ton freighter collided with a container ship --
believed to be the 13,629-ton TS Hongkong registered in Liberia --
early Monday morning. It overturned nine hours later.</P>
      <P>The CGA sent four boats and two helicopters and rescued all 14
crew members from the ship.</P>
      <P>The TS Hongkong is now in Keelung Harbor, northern Taiwan.
Experts from the CGA who examined the ship found clear collision
marks on its starboard side and are trying to determine the
responsibility for the accident.</P>

      <P>Chen offered his sympathies on behalf of the government in a
speech delivered at a cocktail reception at the Taipei Guest House in
celebration of Double Ten National Day.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Chen also extended his heartfelt appreciation for
all Republic of China allies for their support for Taiwan's bids to
join the United Nations and the World Health Organization over the
past year, despite China's fierce opposition.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan is willing and able to assist needy
countries in their national development, Chen urged the major
countries around the world to support Taiwan's efforts to defend its
democratic way of life, prosperity and peace in the Taiwan Strait in
the face of China's threats and containment attempts.</P>
      <P>About 3,600 dignitaries, including foreign heads of state,

functions.</P>
      <P>Presentations of traditional Taiwanese folk arts, including dough
figurine making, capped the reception.</P>
      <P>In the past few years, the National Day cocktail reception was
held at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall but with the completion of
Taipei Guest House refurbishment project, this year's reception was
relocated.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Guest House was constructed from 1897 to 1901 and
remained the governor's residence throughout the Japanese occupation,
which ended in 1945.</P>
      <P>The house is a rectangle oriented along an east-west axis, with a
U-shaped two-story main structure. On the first floor is a reception

      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou does
not exclude the possibility of visiting China after his term as Taipei
City mayor ends, KMT Vice Chairman Wu Pah-hsiung said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the comments while responding to media questions in
Guangzhou, China. The vice chairman is currently in China for a
visit.</P>
      <P>He said that Ma might visit China in the future, depending on
whether such a visit would make an important contribution to
cross-strait peace and would be in the interests of the Taiwan
people.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, Ma is not expected to visit China during his

      <P>The Taipei City mayoral election is set to be held in December
next year.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that his current China visit has significance in

      <P>Wu also expressed the hope that high-ranking officials of the

      <P>"The two parties can easily reach consensus if the CPC can send
high-ranking officials to Taipei to take part in the forum, " he
added.</P>
      <P>However, he said that whether the high-ranking CPC officials can
participate in the forum depends on whether the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party will allow them to visit the island as "the KMT
cannot make any decision on that matter."</P>

    <HEADLINE>BOFT SEEKS TO BOOST SALES OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS, TEXTILES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) has set
its sights on pushing up exports of telecommunications and textile
products in a bid to revive the country's sliding outbound shipments,
a BOFT spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>To that end, the BOFT has invited foreign buyers to visit local
exhibitions such as the annual Taipei Innovative Textile Application
Show (TITAS) and the Computex Taipei show, the spokesman said, adding
that trade promotion delegations have also been organized to boost
sales overseas.</P>
      <P>The activities have shown initial fruit in a gradual manner, as
this year's TITA and Computex shows both drew large numbers of
foreign buyers, the BOFT official noted.</P>
      <P>More than 2,000 foreign buyers visited TITAS from Sept. 29 to
Oct. 1, including executives from heavyweight companies like Nike and
Stafnal. Orders worth US$3.04 million were placed with domestic
companies on the spot, while the value of follow-up orders were
estimated at around US$15 million.</P>
      <P>The elimination of a global quota system at the beginning of this
year was widely believed to impact Taiwan's textile industry due to
aggressive competition from China, and it has increasingly shifted
focus to value-added functional products, he said.</P>
      <P>The BOFT is planning to turn TITAS into a world-class trade fair
that enjoys similar global acclaim as Computex -- the world's
second-largest computer show -- in three years to push the slogan
"Think Functional Textile, Think Taiwan," the official said.</P>
      <P>The two categories of products have shown heavy declines in
exports since the start of this year, with the total value of
telecommunications exports for the first nine months dwindling by 20
percent year on year to US$7.562 billion. During the same period, the
value of textile product outbound shipments also contracted by 6.2
percent to US$8.89 billion, customs statistics show.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS INJURED IN SCUFFLE OVER NCC BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two legislators were injured in a scuffle
that broke out prior to a showdown on the National Communications
Commission (NCC) Organic Bill in the Legislative Yuan Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Around 30 legislators from the "pan-green camp" of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally, the Taiwan
Solidarity, and the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) scuffled in front of the
podium as DPP legislators hoisted placards in protest when
Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng announced the beginning of a
clause-by-clause debate of the controversial law.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chang Shuo-wen received cuts to his eye and
accused the DPP lawmakers of wielding cellular phones and the sticks
supporting their placards to attack him.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ming-hsien of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) accused Chang of starting it by kicking him, injuring
his nose, knees and lips. Both Chang and Lee were sent to the
hospital for treatment.</P>
      <P>Wang convened an inter-party consultation on the two
controversial bills -- the NCC bill and a bill supposedly designed to
promote cross-Taiwan Strait peace -- but to no avail. Two "pan-blue
alliance" legislators -- the KMT's Hung Hsiu-chu and the PFP's Lee
Yong-ping -- took to the podium in the meantime to criticize the KMT
and PFP caucus whips for being "tied down" by the DPP and "wasting
time with consultation."</P>
      <P>As the two sides stalled, Wang put the question of whether to
stop discussion on the bill and the result showed 79 in favor with
seven against and two abstentions.</P>
      <P>But the DPP legislative caucus said the vote was invalid because
the number of legislators present was less than half of the 225. DPP
legislators at one point tried to climb on to the podium to grab the
speaker's gavel, forcing the meeting to go into recess.</P>
      <P>When the meeting reconvened, Wang announced a clause-by-clause
debate on the NCC bill, and the legislators from the ruling and the
opposition parties then began fighting.</P>
      <P>Before the meeting began, several "young turks" from the
"pan-blue alliance, " including Olympic Taekwondo
medalist-turned-Legislator Huang Chih-hsiung and Kao Su-po of the
PFP, donned taekwondo attire to "underscore their determination to
defend the dignity of the legislature and maintain smooth
proceedings."</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Justin S. Chou, one of the group, pointed out that
the last time the DPP legislators occupied the podium when discussing
the NCC bill, they made Taiwan a laughing stock in the international
community.</P>
      <P>Around a dozen TSU legislators donned military fatigues, singing
and shouting slogans before the meeting to "demonstrate that they are
like valiant soldiers defending Taiwan" and that they oppose the
cross-strait peace promotion bill.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PARTIES BLAME EACH OTHER FOR LEGISLATIVE VIOLENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling and opposition parties were
unanimous in condemning the violence that erupted in the legislative
hall Tuesday over the organic bill of the National Communications
Commission (NCC) but that was the only thing they agreed upon.</P>
      <P>Beyond that, the parties denounced each other for initiating
physical violence against two lawmakers -- one each from the two
camps -- who were injured and hospitalized following a schoolyard
brawl in full view of the media cameras.</P>
      <P>Bleeding opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chang Shuo-wen,
who suffered a cut eye, told the media before being sent to the
hospital that he was attacked by ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) lawmaker Lee Ming-hsien, who used a cell phone and a placard in
the rough-up. Lee himself was injured to the face and knees.</P>
      <P>"My personal injury is a minor matter, but the DPP should
apologize to the people of Taiwan, " said Chang, whose constituency
is in Changhua County.</P>
      <P>Independent Legislator Chang Li-shan, also from Changhua County,
came out in support of Chang Shuo-wen, claiming that his antics were
really attempts to "safeguard" Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng.</P>
      <P>William C.T. Lai, DPP legislative caucus secretary-general, said
he could produce film evidence that Chang Shuo-wen made the first
strike and that therefore the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and
People First Party (PFP) should take the largest share of
responsibility for the incident.</P>
      <P>Lai accused the "pan-blue alliance" of planning in advance of
Tuesday's meeting to have Chang, KMT Legislator Pai Tien-chih and PFP
Legislator Hsieh Kuo-liang act as "hit men." He also said he sent
urgent messages to all DPP caucus members advising them not to resort
to violence.</P>
      <P>Lai and Chao Yung-ching, DPP caucus convener, said the violence
had been anticipated.</P>
      <P>He said the DPP caucus had repeatedly reminded the "pan-blue
alliance" that Article 4 and Article 9 in their version of the bill
contradicts the Law on the Basic Structure of the Executive Yuan and
the administrative remedial procedure, and yet the alliance insisted
on keeping these unreasonable articles for a show-down vote.</P>
      <P>After visiting Chang Shuo-wen at the hospital, KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou claimed that Chang's attack was "well planned" by the
ruling party while he was trying to protect the speaker, whose gavel
was taken by lawmakers of the "pan-green camp" that includes the DPP
and the Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>Ma said the KMT "vehemently denounces" and has deep regret over
the violence.</P>
      <P>The legislature is a place for debating policy, he said. If out
of fear of violence lawmakers dare not discuss issues at the
legislative hall, then "an immediate and clear damage has been done
to democracy," he added.</P>
      <P>Ma said if violence erupts again during the legislative
procedure, police should be called in to restore order and to prevent
further injuries.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang also denounced the violence and
expressed regret over the incident.</P>
      <P>Su said the NCC bill has become a sacrifice of "unreasonable
parliamentary politics" as a result of the "pan-blue alliance's"
parochial and partisan domination of the legislative process.</P>
      <P>He pointed at the KMT's attempts to continue to own a
broadcasting company and a TV channel as evidence of the "pan-blue
alliance" reneging on its commitment to "withdrawing party,
political, and military influences from the media."</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" version of the bill would foil the
country's consensus on reforming the media, he said, going on to
accuse the alliance of trying to use "majority violence" to railroad
the bill through the legislature.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT Central Policy
Committee and caucus whip, said the DPP caucus' actions prove it had
a plan to stop the NCC bill from being passed by any means.</P>
      <P>Tseng claimed that the DPP does not want the NCC to be
established officially because it is trying to use the Government
Information Office (GIO) to continue its grip on the media and press
freedom.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng denounced the violence,
stressing that it must be stopped by all means, including strictly
banning any objects that could harm people from being taken into the
legislative hall.</P>
      <P>However, he then said that banners can be brought into the hall
but not bullhorns, which he said would "interfere in the
proceedings."</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT SEEKS TO RAISE APPROVAL THRESHOLD FOR CONTROL YUAN NOMINATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou Tuesday proposed raising the approval threshold for Control
Yuan, Judicial Yuan and Examination Yuan nominations from a majority
vote to a two-thirds vote to ensure the acceptability of the
nominees.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that members of the Control Yuan and Examination
Yuan, as well as grand justices, are required to exercise their
duties independently and therefore must be nominated based on their
professionalism rather than from political considerations.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, raising the approval threshold to a two-thirds
majority will help shut out "politicians who are not supposed to get
in."</P>
      <P>Ma's proposal was intended to resolve a deadlock in which the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan has over the past year refused
to consider a list of Control Yuan members nominated by President
Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The KMT and its ally, the People First Party, are dissatisfied
with the nominations, especially that of Clement C.P. Chang, who was
nominated for Control Yuan president. Chang resigned from the
position of transportation and communications minister in 1991 over
corruption allegations and his nomination has been criticized by the
opposition as representing the degeneration of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The opposition has asked that the list be changed, but the
request has been rejected by the president.</P>
      <P>KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen said Chen's "abuse of his power as
the president and his refusal to renew the list" is to blame for the
deadlock.</P>
      <P>The KMT hopes to reform the existing system to prompt the
president to take different opinions into consideration to protect
the independence of the Control Yuan and prevent the president from
abusing his power, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on the proposal, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng said the proposal could be a solution to the deadlock, but
he urged the party to consider the matter properly before moving to
amend the law governing the operation of the legislature to raise the
approval threshold.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao proposed that a
recommendation panel be formed by representatives of the political
parties and that the president nominate the Control Yuan personnel
according to the recommendations from the panel.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVER 40 PERCENT OF TAIWAN PEOPLE OPPOSE ARMS BILL: PFP POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 40 percent of the people in
Taiwan oppose a major arms procurement bill, while 52 percent think
that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has become
corrupt, according to the results of a survey released Tuesday by the
opposition People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>PFP officials claim that 42 percent of those polled said they are
opposed to the major military procurement bill, now valued at NT$340
billion (about US$11 billion) after the Ministry of National Defense
(MND) slashed the spending from originally projected NT$610.08
billion in response to the opposition's strong criticism.</P>
      <P>In contrast, 34 percent favor the bill that would allow the
government to use a special budget to acquire eight diesel-electric
submarines and 12 P-3C Orion anti-submarine aircraft from the United
States.</P>
      <P>The MND has agreed to drop the third item in the weaponry
procurement plan -- six PAC III anti-missile batteries -- from the
special budget list. Instead, it would buy the item with the
ministry's regular annual budget.</P>
      <P>Around 60 percent of the respondents want to have direct trade,
transport and postal links with China and believe that a cross-Taiwan
Strait peace promotion bill advocated by the PFP at the Legislative
Yuan meets high public expectations, the poll shows.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 25 percent are not in favor of setting up direct links
with China before Beijing publicly renounces the use of force against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>About 52 percent of those polled term the DPP as corrupt after a
series of alleged scandals related to the construction of the mass
rapid train system in Kaohsiung erupted in recent months, the survey
finds.</P>
      <P>Some 56 percent answered "yes" to a question of whether the
ruling party pays greater attention to the needs of vested groups,
well ahead of 21 percent and 17 percent, respectively, who contended
that the DPP is devoted to reform and taking better care of the
ordinary people.</P>
      <P>As many as 68 percent of the respondents to the PFP survey said
that they are not satisfied with the pace of prosecutors'
investigation into the building of the Kaohsiung mass rapid transport
system, while 64 percent said that former Kaohsiung Mayor Frank
Hsieh, now premier, should assume the largest share of responsibility
in the alleged scandal.</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out Oct. 6 - Oct. 7 by telephone,
recovering 983 valid samples from among Taiwan residents aged over
20.</P>
      <P>In a related development, the major arms procurement bill for the
32nd time failed to clear the floor of the legislative Rules
Committee after being killed jointly by lawmakers of the PFP and the
main opposition Kuomintang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHALLENGES PRESIDENTIAL ADVISORY GROUP TO DEBATE FINANCIAL REFORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   11  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang's
legislative caucus challenged the Presidential Economic Advisory
Group Tuesday to debate the government's second phase of financial
reforms program, one day after President Chen Shui-bian claimed that
the direction of the reforms "is entirely correct."</P>
      <P>In his National Day address, Chen said the first phase of reforms
has been completed and that the second phase has started. Although
the second phase has encountered "certain challenges" and there is
still room for improvement in executing the policy, it's direction
"is entirely correct," he said.</P>
      <P>However, the KMT caucus claimed that the second phase of reforms,
if implemented as planned, will lead to the nation's financial
industry being dominated by conglomerates, to which the party is
opposed.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Fei Hung-tai, convener of the caucus' second phase
financial reform group, questioned the president's wisdom in his
decision to push ahead with the program whose direction, Fei claimed,
the Finance Ministry and the Financial Supervisory Commission are not
clear about.</P>
      <P>He also challenged the Economic Advisory Group to an open debate
about the program.</P>
      <P>Fei's deputy, Legislator Lee Chi-chu, said that if the reforms go
wrong, it could trigger a financial crisis. If government officials
who drafted the plan dare not debate it with experts and scholars,
that means "something is not quite right" about the reform program,
she claimed.</P>
      <P>Chen said the second phase of reforms will center on the merger
and integration of public and private financial institutions, which
he hopes will "accelerate the inflow of foreign capital investment
and attract foreign managerial teams to enhance the competitiveness
of Taiwan's financial industry in the global community."</P>
      <P>The first phase, a so-called "2-5-8 financial agenda," was set in
2002 to reduce the average non-performing loan ratio (NPLR) to less
than 5 percent and to raise the average capital adequacy ratio (CAR)
to 8 percent within two years. The task was completed by Aug. 31,
2005, when the NPLR was lowered to 2.83 percent and the CAR was
raised above 10 percent, with NT$1.45 trillion-worth of bad loans
dissolved, he claimed.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low and Chou Hui-ying)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui left for the
United States Tuesday for a two-week visit to meet with who his aides
described as "old friends."</P>
      <P>According to Su Chin-chiang, chairman of the opposition,
pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union of which Lee is the
so-called "spiritual leader, " Lee's U.S. trip will be "purely
personal" and has been arranged at the invitation of some members of
the U.S. Congress and of the Taiwanese expatriate community in the
United States.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the trip is mainly to catch up with these "old
friends" and Lee will keep his tour simple and low-profile, Su said.</P>
      <P>Lee is scheduled to visit the U.S. cities of Anchorage, New York,
Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles, where he will meet with leaders of
major Taiwanese associations, American politicians, think tank
scholars and opinion leaders.</P>
      <P>Lee will be in Washington, D.C. from Oct. 17-20, during which he
will deliver a speech at the National Press Club.</P>
      <P>He reportedly will promote Taiwan's democratic experience and
call the international community's attention to China's threat to the
peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, the Asia-Pacific region and
the entire world.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Michel Lu said Lee's
itinerary has been arranged by his office and that the ministry has
not participated in the process.</P>
      <P>However, the Republic of China representative office in the
United States will provide Lee with all necessary administrative
assistance, Lu said.</P>
      <P>David Ta-wei Lee, ROC representative to the United States,
confirmed last week that the government has requested that the United
States grant the former president diplomatic courtesy during his
trip.</P>
      <P>Lee made a rare visit to the United States in June 1995 during
his tenure as president, sparking a fierce protest from China, which
accused him of using a reunion at his alma mater, Cornell University,
to advance Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Also Tuesday in Beijing, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs
spokesman Kong Quan said Beijing opposes Lee's visit, no matter what
form it takes, as he will be promoting his pro-independence ideas.</P>
      <P>Calling Lee a "troublemaker" who did serious damage to
Beijing-Washington relations in the past, Kong urged the United
States to follow the three communiques with China and the "one China"
policy so as "not to send the wrong message to the Taiwanese
separatists."</P>

    <HEADLINE>AGENTS QUESTION FORMER KRTC VICE CHAIRMAN OVER KICKBACKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Agents of the Investigation Bureau under
the Ministry of Justice questioned a former vice chairman of the
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KTRC) Tuesday after finding more than
60 illegal transfers of funds in large sums from four non-profit
organizations under his control.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, agents from the Kaohsiung section of the
Investigation Bureau searched the office of the Southeast Cultural
Foundation and took away its accounting records and other related
documents, hoping to trace some of the recipients of the funds.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Investigation Bureau's Kaohsiung section said
that all the documents have been sealed for safekeeping, and will be
examined by former KTRC vice chairman Chen Min-hsien himself in hopes
that the money trail will be uncovered.</P>
      <P>Chen, currently chairman of the Southeast Cement Corp., has been
under judicial investigation on suspicion of illegally profiting from
the Kaohsiung rapid transit railway project and hiring Thai laborers
for the construction project. He resigned his post as KRTC vice
chairman in September after the irregularities were brought to light
by the Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers protesting their maltreatment by
the KTRC employers and Huapan Administration Consultant Co.</P>
      <P>When he was first questioned by Kaohsiung district prosecutors on
Sept. 5, Chen categorically denied any wrongdoing in bringing in Thai
laborers to work on the Kaohsiung rapid transit railway project. He
also denied that he went with a brokerage operator to Thailand on
luxury trips, claiming that he only went to Thailand once in recent
years and that was with a friend last November during which he paid
his own expenses.</P>
      <P>However, subsequent investigation into the accounting records of
Huapan Co. unearthed airplane tickets and hotel bills showing that
Chen was with the Huapan owners on at least three overseas trips --
twice to Thailand in 2002 and once to South Korea in 2004.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, news media are calling for an investigation into why
Chen, as a shareholder owning only 7 percent of the total investment
in the KRTC, was able to control the entire company, in which
NT$150.8 billion in public funds account for 83 percent of the
company's total capital.</P>
      <P>Chung Chung-hsiao, spokesman for the task force charged with the
investigation of the profiteering case, acknowledged that it will be
a very laborious and time-consuming process to trace the destinations
of the kickbacks and unlawful gains from the exploitation of more
than 1,700 Thai laborers.</P>
      <P>He said the Investigation Bureau's section dealing with money
laundering has doubled the number of agents working on the case to 20
people, and that they have conducted nearly 100 interviews with both
suspects and witnesses and examined details in hundreds of bank
accounts.</P>
      <P>An investigation report by the Investigation Bureau has confirmed
that there is clear evidence that Wang Tsai-pi and Yen Shih-hua, the
owners of Huapan Co., received kickbacks from contractors using the
service of Thai workers. The couple have been detained by order of
the Kaohsiung District Court.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOME TAIWAN BUSINESSES'S CHINA INVESTMENTS SCRUTINIZED BY MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
said Tuesday that the ministry has commissioned credit information
service institutions to investigate Taiwan businesses that have
invested in China illegally for years.</P>
      <P>Ho was responding to media reports that the ministry has recently
commissioned private credit institutions to look into those
businesses that have invested in the mainland in violations of the
law under the government's "active opening, effective management"
policy regarding investment in the mainland. Ho was speaking on the
sidelines of the 2005 Taipei International Electronics (TAITRONICS)
exhibition.</P>
      <P>Ho said the media reports were "not totally true, " saying that
the ministry is not randomly targeting Taiwan businessmen, only
looking into those businesses that the ministry suspects have
invested in China without obtaining prior approval, and on which the
ministry has not been able to get further information.</P>
      <P>The government has commissioned credit information services to
investigate and to collect this information," Ho said.</P>
      <P>On reports that the economics ministry investigation is targeting
around a dozen listed or over-the-counter companies, especially those
in the flat-panel sector that are currently prohibited from investing
in the mainland, Ho said that she was not aware of this, adding that
as far as she was aware, the flat-panel sector has followed
regulations.</P>
      <P>Ho said that there is no reason to doubt the fairness of the
credit information service institutions. In addition, the information
collected will be judged by the ministry and the ministry will also
listen to the responses of the Taiwan businesses.</P>
      <P>"If anyone has a better suggestion as to how to obtain this
information, the ministry is all ears," Ho added.</P>
      <P>The Investment Commission under the economics ministry said the
credit information service firms commissioned by the ministry are
large, not small institutions, and the ministry has followed
the Government Procurement Law for open bidding. This practice has
been going on for four or five years, and is not a new measure as
reports have said. More than a dozen Taiwan businesses have been
disciplined because of these checks, commission officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu Sheng-hsiung, chairman of the Taiwan Electrical
and Electronic Manufacturers' Association, expressed the hope that
the government can have a clearer management mechanism for local
businesses to follow.</P>
      <P>Hsu said on the sidelines of the electronics show that he has yet
to learn of the details, but Taiwan businesses are now reaching out
around the globe and the government should use different approaches
to achieve effective management. The commissioning of credit
information services to check on Taiwan businesses doesn't seem
suitable, Hsu added.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-hsiang said Monday
that the ministry has commissioned legal credit institutions to
investigate whether Taiwan businessmen's investments in the mainland
are legal, and the credit institutions have sent officials to the
mainland to get first-hand information or collect information on
capital flows of the Taiwan businessmen overseas through cooperation
with international institutions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BANANA EXPORTS FALL TO FIVE-YEAR LOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan banana exports totaled US$10.29
million in 2004, a five-year low, the Directorate General of Budget,
Account and Statistics (DGBAS) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials said that bananas have been the mainstay of
Taiwan fruit exports and almost all of them are shipped to Japan, but
current exports to Japan are a far cry from the past because of
rising production costs in Taiwan, competition from cheap produce
from the Philippines and Central and South American countries, as
well as Japan's scrapping of preferential tariffs for Taiwan
products.</P>
      <P>They noted that banana exports of US$10.29 million last year was
a dramatic decrease from the US$30.73 million in 2000. In addition to
steep international competition, other factors including low
temperatures early this year and strong winds and torrential rains
brought by typhoons in mid-year, resulted in the volume of bananas
grown falling by 14.9 percent, with exports being cut by 47.4
percent in terms of value.</P>
      <P>The ratio of banana exports accounted for only 26.8 percent of
Taiwan fruit exports in 2004 compared with 65.6 percent in 2000. If
the trend continues, the officials said that they worry that the
exports could fall below US$10 million this year.</P>
      <P>But the silver lining is that although banana exports are
dropping, other premium Taiwan fruits have emerged and mangoes have
shown dramatic growth, mainly exports to Japan, Hong Kong and
Singapore. Mango exports totaled US$4.82 million in 2004, up 30.5
percent from the previous year, replacing lychees to become the
second-biggest export fruit, accounting for 12.5 percent of total
fruit exports.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$38.49 million in fruits in 2004, down 11.7
percent from 2003. In terms of exporting countries, Japan accounted
for 44 percent of Taiwan's exports, followed by the United States and
Hong Kong, with the three accounting for around 85 percent of
Taiwan's exported fruits. China only accounted for 0.9 percent of the
total exports.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed Article One of
the organic bill of the National Communications Commission (NCC) in
the second reading by an 111-2 vote Tuesday after ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers failed to stop the speaker from
putting it to a vote.</P>
      <P>The article deals with the purposes of setting up the NCC -- to
realize the constitutional provisions on the protection of freedom of
expression, to honor the commitment of "withdrawing partisan,
political and military influences from the media, " and to maintain a
professional and autonomous environment for the healthy development
of the media industry.</P>
      <P>After calling off the meeting, which was boycotted by the DPP and
its "pan-green" camp ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) ,
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said the boycott "hurt the
DPP greatly."</P>
      <P>He was referring to the "pan-green" camp's obstruction in the
morning, which led to a scuffle in which two lawmakers were lightly
injured and hospitalized, and some DPP lawmakers' attempts to crawl
up onto the speaker's quarters in the afternoon which were stopped by
legislators Yen Ching-piao and Lin Ping-kun of the Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>Wang urged the ruling party and its ally not to boycott or
interfere in meeting procedures again, since it is normal for the
legislature to resort to balloting when negotiations break down.</P>
      <P>After the bill is passed, the government can request the
legislature to "reconsider" or ask for a constitutional
interpretation of the newly passed law, Wang said. But if the DPP
keeps on boycotting proceedings dealing with the bill, it will

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Ministry of National Defense official
said Tuesday that the United States has postponed an annual
computer-assisted war simulation with Taiwan because of a recent
personnel change at the Pentagon's strategic planning department.</P>
      <P>As part of U.S.-Taiwan military exchanges, Taiwan military
officials have been invited to visit the headquarters of the U.S.
Pacific Command in Hawaii annually over the past years for a
simulation of a war across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to ministry spokesman Liu Chih-chien, this year's
simulation, which was originally expected to be held in late
September, has been postponed to early next year, because William J.
Fallon, the new commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, needs some
time to familiarize himself with the new position.</P>
      <P>Liu said other military exchanges and cooperation between Taiwan
and the United States have not been affected and that the
postponement of the war simulation has nothing to do with the delay
in Taiwan's latest arms procurement package from the United States.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's plan to buy eight diesel electric submarines, six
Patriot PAC-III anti-missile batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft has been stalled over the past year owing to
objections by the opposition-controlled legislature. The U.S. side
has expressed much concern over the situation and has urged Taiwan to
show its resolve to defend itself by speeding up the procurement.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) formed a task force Tuesday to investigate whether Chen
Che-nan, a former deputy secretary-general of the Presidential
Office, violated party discipline because of his alleged involvement
in the exploitation of Thai laborers working on the Kaohsiung rapid
transit railway project.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Li Yi-yang disclosed after a meeting of the
DPP Central Standing Committee that party Chairman Su Tseng-chang
introduced the motion to form the task force which was passed by all
those present unanimously.</P>
      <P>Li indicated that despite continuous media allegations about
Chen's involvement in the illegal profiteering racket between the
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) and the brokerage firm Huapan
Co. that exploited the Thai laborers, Chen has not clarified the
situation effectively, thus hurting the image of the DPP.</P>
      <P>Li said that after being notified about the DPP's decision to
question him, Chen expressed understanding of the party's position
and agreed to cooperate.</P>
      <P>He added that there is no timetable for the investigation,
although the sooner it is done, the better.</P>
      <P>Chen resigned last week as national policy adviser to the
president after evidence showed that he took two trips to Thailand
with Chen Min-hsien, former vice chairman of the KRTC, and the owners
of Huapan Co. while he was deputy secretary-general of the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The profiteering case exposed by the Aug. 21 riot by Thai
laborers to protest their maltreatment by KRTC and Huapan Co. has
already led to the resignations of Council of Labor Affairs
Chairwoman Chen Chu and acting Kaohsiung mayor Chen Chi-mai, son of
Chen Che-nan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION MILITARY FINANCE PLAN WOULD SET BACK MILITARY 10 YEARS: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC military's development will be set
back 10 years if the opposition has its way and lumps all items in
the U.S. defense purchase into the ministry's regular budget, the
defense ministry said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hours after the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan rejected a
motion to review the special budget of NT$340 billion (US$10.23
billion) for the arms package for the 33rd time, the ministry said
the weaponry in question is vital to boosting the country's defense
capabilities, and that this is only a part of the ministry's efforts
to strengthen the nation's defense.</P>
      <P>The U.S. package refers to the purchase of 12 anti-submarine
aircraft, eight submarines and six patriotic PAC-3 batteries.</P>
      <P>Other hardware, such as search and surveillance radar, Kidd-class
guided missile destroyers, and Clouded Leopard armored vehicles,
should be acquired simultaneously for the effective defense of the
country, the ministry said in a statement.</P>
      <P>If all three major items in the U.S. package are financed from
the ministry's regular budget, as requested by the opposition parties
in the legislature, the other arms procurement programs would have to
be put on the back burner for at least 10 years and would expose the
country to China's military threat for quite a long time, the
statement said.</P>
      <P>China's military threat against Taiwan consists mainly of its
missiles and jet fighters, the statement said, adding that Beijing
has deployed in southeastern China more than 700 missiles within the
range of the whole of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also, the ministry said, Beijing has about 120 jet fighters
stationed in its coastal provinces across Taiwan, and another 660 jet
fighters in provinces in central China, all within striking range of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Patriot missiles proved to be an effective anti-missile weapon in
the Iraq War, and can help shelter Taiwan from Beijing's missiles;
but its price, NT$130 billion, is simply too much to be incorporated
into the regular defense budget, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Citing the country's purchase of 150 F-16 jet fighters from the
United States and 60 Mirage jet fighters from the French in 1992, the
ministry said the huge outlays for them were financed by a special
budget over nine years.</P>
      <P>In order to complying with the opposition's request, the ministry
has included the Patriot missiles in its regular budget while leaving
the other two items in a NT$340 billion special budget.</P>
      <P>But its efforts have failed to soften the opposition's
objections. They have refused to budge in their opposition to the
special budget, and do not agree with the Patriot missiles in the
regular budget on the grounds that this was already rejected by the
public in a 2004 referendum, a claim the Executive Yuan denies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TEXTILE MAKERS URGED TO PREPARE FOR MORE U.S. ORDERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh urged Taiwan's textile
and garment exporters Wednesday to grab the opportunity presented by
U.S. authorities' ongoing investigations into whether to impose
import tariffs on textile imports from China.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a regular Executive Yuan meeting, Hsieh said that
as a result of the U.S. investigations, many textile and garment
orders have been flowing out of China to other countries, including
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh instructed relevant government agencies to quickly come up
with measures to facilitate textile and garment exports to the United
States by Taiwan manufacturers and exporters.</P>
      <P>The Bush administration reportedly has accepted petitions from
the U.S. textile industry to launch investigations into whether
quotas should be imposed on 26 categories of clothing and textile
imports from China, including wool suits, coats, cheesecloth and
polyester filament fabric.</P>
      <P>U.S. and Chinese negotiators met last week in a third round of
talks on reaching a comprehensive deal to limit Chinese clothing
imports, which have been flooding the United States since global
quotas were lifted last January.</P>
      <P>Since the trade dispute began, export orders from the United
States have been flowing to Taiwan, and manufacturers in the Tainan
area in southern Taiwan are now operating at full capacity to meet
these orders, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He instructed the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and the
Council of Labor to work out measures to help Taiwan's textile
industry take on as many textile and garment orders released from
China as possible.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, textile and garment manufacturers can be
encouraged to move their operations into the Chang Ping Industrial
Park in central Taiwan where many plant openings are available and
where operators are entitled to governmental investment incentives.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taiwan Sweater Industry Association has also
voiced interest in relocating some investment abroad back to Taiwan,
he noted.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA officials, Taiwan's textile and garment exports
have averaged about US$12.5 billion annually in recent years,
compared with US$2.6 billion in imports, giving Taiwan a trade
surplus of roughly US$9.9 billion annually in this sector.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TO NAME LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER TO ATTEND APEC SUMMIT MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will appoint
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng to attend the annual informal
leadership summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum to be held in Busan, South Korea in November, the president's
chief of staff said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general of the Presidential Office, said
President Chen expressed to a special South Korean envoy earlier in
the day that he would like to attend the summit meeting himself but
that he has instead decided to appoint Wang to go to Busan to attend
the summit on his behalf in order not to put the host country in a
difficult position.</P>
      <P>James Huang, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office,
noted that Wang has rich political experience and is well respected
by both the ruling and opposition parties as the speaker of the
nation's legislative branch.</P>
      <P>Wang has gladly accepted President Chen's invitation to attend
the summit, Huang said, adding that Taiwan has informed South Korea
and the United States of the decision.</P>
      <P>The United States, which supports Taiwan's participation in the
APEC summit, responded positively to the decision, saying it is a
"creative move" to send the legislative speaker to attend, according
to Huang.</P>
      <P>For his part, the legislative speaker said that he would be glad
to attend the summit if it will benefit the country.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT),
also said that he is still a KMT member and that he will have to
report the matter to the party as well as to KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>The politically-savvy Wang stressed that he is willing to work
for the benefit of the nation, but added that everything is still
"under arrangement" and that he wouldn't speculate about the outcome.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, it will be the first time that Wang represents
the ROC's head of state in attending the annual APEC summit.</P>
      <P>In line with long-established protocol, the 2005 APEC summit
organizing committee sent a special envoy to Taipei in July to
forward an invitation to Chen. While meeting with the special envoy,
Chen said he looks forward to attending the summit meeting in the
name of the leader of "Chinese Taipei" -- Taiwan's official APEC
designation.</P>
      <P>APEC is one of the few international organizations that admit
both Taipei and Beijing. Because of Beijing's opposition, the
Republic of China's head of state has been unable to attend previous
APEC annual informal leadership meetings and has instead had to name
a proxy to attend on his behalf. Lee Yuan-tseh, Nobel laureate and
the president of nation's highest research institute Academia Sinica,
has represented Chen over the past few years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL) announced Wednesday
that it will launch a codeshare service with Deutsche Bahn AG (DB) ,
Germany's national railway company, from Oct. 30.</P>
      <P>The service will allow passengers flying between Taiwan and
Germany to enjoy convenient high-speed rail connections between
Frankfurt Ariport and seven German cities, including Hamburg,
Cologne, Dusseldorf, Hanover, Munich, Nuremberg and Stuttgart,
according to a CAL press statement.</P>
      <P>Passengers using the codeshare service will only need to pay an
extra NT$1,000 (US$30) for a single rail trip, which is cheaper than
domestic air connections, and they can also enjoy access to DB's VIP
lounges in the railway stations, the statement said.</P>
      <P>CAL is currently offering various preferential programs to
promote the service, including free upgrades, bonus mileage and price
discounts.</P>
      <P>However, owing to immigration and customs restrictions,
passengers using the codeshare service will not be able to check
their baggage to their final destination in Germany, nor will they be
able to enjoy through check-in. Also, CAL's Dynasty Flyer members
will not be able to accumulate DB mileage.</P>
      <P>In addition to CAL, DB also maintains codeshare partnerships with

    <HEADLINE>EXPATS GATHER AT GOOGLE HEADQUARTERS TO UPHOLD TAIWAN'S SOVEREIGNTY</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Scores of Taiwan expatriates
residing in the Silicon Valley area swamped the headquarters of the
search engine giant Google Tuesday in a display of support for Taiwan
as a sovereign country.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Google Inc. removed its reference to Taiwan
as a "province of China" from its Google Maps service over the
weekend after the Republic of China Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
Taiwan nationals living in the United States voiced their concerns
about the reference, the Taiwan expatriates still decided to gather
in front of Google's headquarters in Silicon Valley to make known
their stance of upholding Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The protesters waved banners that read "Taiwan is an independent
country" and "One China, One Taiwan."</P>
      <P>After receiving a letter of concern from the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in San Francisco, a de facto Taiwan consulate office,
Oct. 6 complaining about Google Maps service's reference to Taiwan as
a "province of China, " Google removed the reference from the service
Oct. 9.</P>
      <P>Reports from Taiwan have said that Taiwan authorities and
legislators were up in the arms over the Google Maps description of
Taiwan as a province of China. The reports also said that Taiwan's
liaison offices in the United States had been asked since Sept. 19 to
convey Taiwan's concern and indignation to Google Inc. about the
matter but that the requests had "all fallen on deaf ears."</P>
      <P>One of the protestors, Hung Shun-wu, a former Taiwan national
assemblyman representing the ruling Democratic Progressive Party,
expressed his appreciation to Google for listening to the Taiwan
public's call "to present the facts as they are."</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is an independent state, Hung said that while
striving to boost its business expansion in China, Google's services
should also portray the truth, such as the political reality of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hung added that the Taiwan expatriates' demonstration in front of
the Google headquarters was also aimed at notifying other high-tech
companies ready to head to China not to make the same sort of
mistake.</P>
      <P>A Google Inc. international affairs spokesman would not confirm
Tuesday whether Google changed the Taiwan map reference due to
pressure from Taiwan, only saying that the map service is a pure
American product and that the change was made in response to concerns
expressed by Web site visitors about the user interface (UI).</P>
      <P>Taiwan's complaint is not the first that Google Maps has
received. Last year, South Koreans protested Google's use of the name
"Sea of Japan" to describe the sea between Japan and South Korea,
instead of the name "East China Sea." Following the protests, Google
decided to use both names on its maps in a bid to calm protests.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) offered Wednesday to compromise
with the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) on
the controversial organic bill of the proposed national
communications commission (NCC).</P>
      <P>Legislator Jao Yung-ching, convener of the DPP legislative
caucus, challenged the KMT and PFP to agree with a proposal presented
by a private group on the makeup of the NCC one day after the
opposition-initiated bill was blocked by the DPP in a violent
confrontation in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Jao said that his party, which has insisted that the NCC members
be named by the Executive Yuan, would agree with the private group's
proposal, if the opposition were to do the same.</P>
      <P>Under the private group's proposal, the nine members of the NCC
should be selected by a panel consisting of scholars and
representatives of independent civil groups from a list of 27
candidates-- 18 of which are named by the legislature and nine by
the Executive Yuan-- and approved by the premier.</P>
      <P>The members of the panel in charge of preparing the final list of
nine NCC members should be appointed by the political parties in
proportion to the number of seats each of the parties holds in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>The list of candidates named by the legislature and the Executive
Yuan should cover nine different fields, including education,
communications, law, economics and so on, with the legislature naming
two candidates from each of these fields and the Executive Yuan
naming one from each of the fields.</P>
      <P>Under the opposition's bill, the NCC members should be named by
political parties in proportion to the number of legislative seats
each party holds.</P>
      <P>The differences between the ruling and opposition parties on the
makeup of the NCC has resulted in a political impasse which has

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh urged the ruling and
opposition parties Wednesday to put aside their disagreements and
cooperate with each other in the wake of violent clashes between the
rival camps in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that the struggle between the ruling party and the
opposition has thrown the approval rating of the Cabinet to a low of
20 percent, while that of the Legislative Yuan has declined to just
8.7 percent.</P>
      <P>The situation proves that it is a mistake for both sides to try
to destroy each other through such extreme means, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Fistfights broke out again Tuesday in the Legislative Yuan when
opposition lawmakers made a second attempt to steamroller through a
bill governing the formation of the National Communication Commission
(NCC).</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chang Sho-wen and ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Lee Ming-hsien were
injured amid scenes of violence.</P>
      <P>The two parties continued to trade accusations Wednesday, blaming
each other for provoking the clashes.</P>
      <P>William Lai, a leader of the DPP legislative caucus, said the
party condemns the violence and regrets that lawmakers were reduced
to exchanging blows over a bill.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the ruling and opposition parties continue
their negotiations on the bill rationally to "maintain the dignity"
of the legislature.</P>
      <P>However, KMT lawmakers said the DPP should be held responsible
for creating the confrontation.</P>
      <P>They said it was the DPP that has made the Legislative Yuan an
international laughing stock by occupying the podium and attacking
opposition lawmakers with shields, pipes, mobile phones and wooden
clubs to obstruct legislative proceedings.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET APPROVES PARTY ASSETS BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet approved a bill for handling
political parties' "ill-gotten" assets at a meeting Wednesday, two
days after President Chen Shui-bian announced that the government
will focus on six major reforms that include investigations into
property inappropriately seized by political parties.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who is also
Taipei mayor and in that capacity attended the Cabinet meeting, did
not voice his objection during the meeting but told the media later
that the KMT "basically does not quite agree" with the bill, which is
aimed at "purging" the KMT of its assets.</P>
      <P>Ma claimed that the bill violates legal principles and is
unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>Under the Cabinet's draft law, all party assets except membership
dues, campaign funds donated by the public and businesses, and
government subsidies for elections, will be defined as "ill-gotten"
assets that must be returned to the national coffers or local
governments.</P>
      <P>A provision in the draft law says that any property given gratis
or sold at unreasonable market prices after April 6, 2001 by
political parties and their affiliated groups will also be defined as
ill-gotten assets. The provision aims to stop political parties,
especially the KMT, from selling out their assets before the bill
becomes law.</P>
      <P>The bill says all political parties must report their assets
within six months of the law becoming effective, including those
listed by the Control Yuan in its April 6, 2001 report to the
Executive Yuan, as well as those entrusted to third parties.
Violations will be subject to fines of between NT$500,000 and NT$2.5
million. Those who refuse to conform will be fined every 10 days and
after five fines, their assets will be defined as ill-gotten.</P>
      <P>After the law's promulgation, political parties and their
affiliated organizations will be banned from handling any assets
except membership dues, political donations, election subsidies paid
by the government, and "spending needed to run a party." Violations
will be subject to fines one to three times the value of the disputed
assets.</P>
      <P>The draft law proposes that a political party assets
investigation and handling committee be established with 11 to 13
members whose expertise covers prosecution, law, economy, finance,
accounting and land administration, with the rest being
well-respected and fair-minded persons. No more than a quarter of the
members should come from any one political party; they will be
nominated by the premier and appointed by the president.</P>
      <P>However, the draft bill still needs to be sent to the Legislative
Yuan, where it has little chance of passing as the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and People First Party enjoys a slim
majority.</P>
      <P>KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen claimed that the bill is nothing but
a tool of the DPP government to purge civic groups of their assets
and is "evidently unconstitutional."</P>
      <P>She said Chen and the government are sending a threatening
message to people interested in buying KMT assets and claimed that
the KMT has been handling its assets in a "legal and transparent
manner."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO HOST APEC CONFAB ON RECYCLING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has been chosen to host the 2005
Conference on Recycling under the framework of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, officials from the Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The APEC Conference on Recycling, scheduled to be held in Taipei
Thursday and Friday, is expected to tackle all issues concerning
recycling, including challenges and problems in promoting recycling;
the sharing of successful recycling experience; and building
websites, EPA authorities said.</P>
      <P>Experts from Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Thailand and
Taiwan are expected to attend the two-day meeting.</P>
      <P>According to EPA officials, Japan recommended earlier this year
that the conference be held in Taiwan as it has made noticeable
progress in recycling in recent years. The 2005 APEC Conference on
Recycling is part of the activities under an APEC project to build
APEC economic entities' recycling prowess, sponsored by Japan.</P>
      <P>As global trade expands continuously and its impact on the
Asia-Pacific region grows, industrial products are sold and used
across borders, resulting in the fact that products that are
manufactured in one country can end up having to be recycled in
another, the EPA officials said.</P>
      <P>This cross-border recycling issue will be one of the major topics
to be discussed at the conference, the officials added.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending the conference, the participants from
abroad are also scheduled to visit the EPA headquarters, exchange
views with their Taiwan counterparts on the ideal "zero waste" issue
and make field trips to a number of recycling sites for used home
electrical appliances, motorcycles and automobiles in the following
two days, the officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA HAS `NO RIGHT' TO VETO APEC CANDIDATE: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chan Shui-bian said Wednesday
that he will appoint Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng to attend
the annual informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum to be held in Busan, South Korea next month,
and claimed that China has "no right" to veto the representative he
chooses.</P>
      <P>Chen told South Korean APEC envoy Yun Hai Jung at the
Presidential Office that he is keen on attending the summit meeting
in person, but in order not to put the host country in a difficult
position, he will send Wang instead.</P>
      <P>As a member of the APEC forum, Taiwan has the same rights and
obligations as other members and that as the leader of Taiwan, he has
the right to attend the summit meeting. His exclusion is the biggest
regret and most unfair discrimination against the 23 million people
of Taiwan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>On rhetoric that Taiwan leaders will not attend the summit
meeting because there was a tacit agreement or understanding when it
was admitted into the regional organization, Chen said this "was
totally wrong."</P>
      <P>When Taiwan entered APEC, it did not reach any tacit agreements
or sign any kind of memorandum of understanding with other members,
Chen said, adding that his inability to attend the meeting is purely
due to China's persistent obstruction.</P>
      <P>The president explained that Taiwan, China and Hong Kong were
admitted to the regional organization in 1991 with the assistance of
South Korea and that they became formal members in 1992. At the
initiative of former U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1993, an APEC
informal leadership meeting was inaugurated.</P>
      <P>There is no tacit agreement or practice to prevent Taiwan's heads
of state from attending the summit meeting, Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>For this reason, Chen said, Taiwan protests China's high-handed
obstruction and wants to know on what basis Taiwan's leader is shut
out of the meeting.</P>
      <P>He said the APEC forum belongs to all members, including Taiwan,
and not to China, and that Beijing has no right to decide on whether
Taiwan's president can attend or not.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma Ying-jeou, Taipei mayor and opposition Kuomintang
chairman, said Wednesday that he felt slighted when he learned that
Chen will appoint Wang, a former KMT vice chairman, to serve as his
envoy at the APEC meeting. Wang earlier said that as a KMT member, he
still has to report the matter to the party and Ma.</P>
      <P>Asked if felt disrespected upon learning that Chen had appointed
Wang without a prior consultation with him, Ma said "of course."</P>
      <P>Ma said he had yet to hear the details of the matter and that he
will discuss the issue with Wang.</P>
      <P>In line with protocol, the 2005 APEC summit organizing committee
sent a special envoy to Taipei in July to extend an invitation to
Chen. While meeting with the special envoy, Chen said he looked
forward to attending the summit meeting in the name of the leader of
"Chinese Taipei" -- Taiwan's official APEC designation.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's opposition, the Republic of China's head of
state has been unable to attend previous APEC annual informal
leadership meetings and has instead had to name a proxy to attend on
his behalf. Lee Yuan-tseh, Nobel laureate and president of the
nation's highest research institute, Academia Sinica, has represented
Chen over the past few years.</P>
      <P>APEC, which is dedicated to promoting free flow of information,
trade and investment, groups 21 economies, including Australia,
Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South
Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru,
Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States
and Vietnam.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD MAKE KNOWN STANCE ON OILFIELD DISPUTES: TAIPEI MAYOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should make known its stance
on the ongoing dispute over exploration in the Chunxiao oil and gas
fields in the East China Sea, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a regular Executive Yuan meeting, Ma said that
since the Chunxiao field is located in one of Taiwan's five major
undersea crude fields, the administration should make known Taiwan's
stance on the dispute, which presently mainly involves China and
Japan.</P>
      <P>Ma made a similar call later in the day when he met with a
visiting delegation from the U.S. Republican National Committee at
Taipei City Hall. He said the Chunxiao field is located in the third
Republic of China-claimed undersea field and that Taiwan should not
stay silent in the dispute.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) made an announcement in
August that disputes over exploration in the Chunxiao field should be
tackled through negotiations by all the nations who have an interest
in the area.</P>
      <P>At issue is the problem of differing sovereignty claims and
economic interests, with both China and Japan wishing to develop the
area that has potentially large reserves of oil and natural gas, MOFA
spokesman Michel Lu said.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jyn-ping
urged the ruling and opposition parties Wednesday to sort out their
differences over a bill on a national communications commission
(NCC) by compromise.</P>
      <P>In order to try and ensure that the NCC bill is passed in two
weeks, the speaker said both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) and the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party
(PFP) should stop thinking that each has a corner on the truth with
regard to the makeup of the NCC.</P>
      <P>Wang pointed out that the DPP is in the minority in the
legislature and cannot block the bill for ever.</P>
      <P>The KMT and PFP should not refuse to budge on the sticking point
in the bill -- the actual members of the NCC -- adding that the
fracas between the two sides in the legislature the previous day only
puts the country to shame.</P>
      <P>The president was referring a brawl between rival lawmakers in
the legislative chamber when DPP lawmakers scrambled to occupy the
speaker's podium and grabbed his gavel in an attempt to prevent him
putting the bill to a vote, which led to a fistfight with opposition
lawmakers that left two people injured.</P>
      <P>The speaker defended his decision of not calling in the
sergeant-at-arms to restore order in the chamber, claiming that the
legislature can "settle its own disputes" and it would disgrace the
legislature to pass a bill with the help of the sergeant-at-arms.</P>
      <P>At the center of the dispute is the method to be used to name the
NCC members. The opposition wants them named by political parties in
proportion to the number of seats each holds in the legislature,
while the DPP insists that the Executive Yuan should have the right
to name them.
</P>
      <P>In order to prevent the KMT and PFP from steamrolling the bill
through, the DPP occupied the speaker's podium Sept. 27 to paralyze
the session, a move it repeated Tuesday.

      <P>The legislature is set to act again on the bill Oct. 25.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo, Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Japanese expert unveiled Wednesday a draft
law governing relations between Japan and Taiwan that is aimed at
strengthening friendship and exchanges between both countries in the
absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Kazuo Asano, a professor at Heisei International University, said
the legislation is intended to be the Japanese equivalent of the
Taiwan Relations Act enacted by the United States in 1979 following
the severance of diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asano said it is necessary for Japan to review its relations with
Taiwan 33 years after diplomatic ties were cut and that he hopes the
bill can be passed during the remaining one-year tenure of Japanese
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.</P>
      <P>According to the draft, the objective of the legislation is to
bring stability and prosperity to the Asia-Pacific region and to
develop trade and cultural exchanges between Japan and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese will continue to enjoy the rights and protection they
are entitled to under Japanese law as long as they do not violate the
public interests of Japan, the draft states.</P>
      <P>It says the Japanese government can provide the government of
Taiwan with the necessary intelligence to protect peace and stability
in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Affairs concerning Japan and Taiwan will be dealt with according
to the agreement between the Tokyo-based Interchange Association and
the Taipei-based East Asia Relations Commission, which includes the
protection of the property and physical safety of Japanese and
Taiwanese as well as matters related to economic, trade, tourism,
academic, cultural and sports exchanges between both countries, the
draft stipulates.</P>
      <P>It says the Japanese government can grant staff of the East Asia
Relations Commission privileges and immunities equal to those enjoyed
by foreign diplomats in Japan.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the draft law, ROC representative to Japan Koh
Se-kai said its content is very solid and practical and that the law
will be helpful in establishing a legal basis for Taiwan-Japan
relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATORS WANT CHINA STEEL CHAIRMAN TO RETURN BONUS STOCK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ninety-four legislators of the "pan-green
camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union issued a statement Wednesday demanding that Lin
Wen-yuan, chairman of China Steel Corp., return his bonus stock
valued at NT$44 million (US$1.32 million) to the national coffers.</P>
      <P>The statement said that Lin is leading China Steel as a
representative of the government, which owns 23.5 percent of the
privatized company, and that he should voluntarily return the bonus
stock, totaling 1.5 million shares, to the national treasury.</P>
      <P>Lin has worked as chairman of China Steel since December 2002 and
receives an annual salary of about NT$8 million.</P>
      <P>The pan-green lawmakers said in their statement that in line with
President Chen Shui-bian's declaration of a reform plan in a Double
Ten National Day address, the conduct of government officials and
representatives should be held to above-normal moral standards.</P>
      <P>They demanded that the government send Lin a letter within 10
days demanding the return of the windfall to the national treasury.</P>
      <P>In a rebuttal in his own defense, Lin said he saw nothing wrong
in accepting the bonus stock because, as CEO of China Steel, he was
merely enjoying the same treatment as his three predecessors.</P>
      <P>He insisted that he has always been law-abiding in his 20-year
career as a public servant. However, he added that he is willing to
relinquish the bonus stock if the Ministry of Finance wants it
returned to the national coffers.</P>
      <P>In response to the demand by the pan-green legislators, Cabinet
Secretary-General and spokesman Cho Jung-tai said the matter will be
handled by the Finance Ministry, which will work out a solution
within 10 days.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hualien, eastern Taiwan, Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One woman and two men were
indicted Wednesday for selling Taiwan passports to illegal Chinese
immigrants to help them enter Canada.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said Cheng Mei-hua was the mastermind behind the fraud
scheme. Cheng, working with Weng Tien-ling and his sister Weng
Su-emi, and another man, identified as Hsi Tien-lin, used a steak
house run by the Wengs in Hualien, eastern Taiwan, as a facade to
solicit staff or patrons willing to supply passports.</P>
      <P>The foursome offered those who complied with their wishes the
chance to tour Southeast Asia, where they met with illegal Chinese
immigrants who would familiarize themselves with the backgrounds of
the Taiwanese travelers in order that they would not arouse
suspicion on the part of Canadian customs authorities.</P>
      <P>The Hualien Prosecutors' Office said the suspects used the same
method to help illegal Chinese in Vietnam and Malaysia to enter
Canada three times between September 2004 and January 2005.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors indicted Hsi and the two Wengs and issued an
arrest warrant for Cheng.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER URGES WAR ON GOVERNMENT DEFICIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Lai Shin-yuan of the opposition
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) urged a war Wednesday on the government
deficit, but a government agency dismissed the worries about leaving
debts to future generations, saying that the nation's financial
situation has continued to improve.</P>
      <P>Lai, who called a press conference to outline her speculation
that 2008 may be the "doom" year of the nation's public debts, said
that accumulated government debts will reach more than NT$3.9
trillion (US$117.11 billion) this year, near the public debt ceiling
under the law.</P>
      <P>The economic researcher-turned-legislator said that for every 
NT$100 the government appropriates, it has to use NT$15 to pay debts,
and even so, it will take 65 years to clear all debts.</P>
      <P>She said that the government has listed the deficit for next
fiscal year as NT$195.7 billion and claimed that if the Legislative
Yuan approves it, then the accumulated debts will reach NT$3.93
trillion, approaching the debt ceiling of 40 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP), or around NT$4 trillion, stipulated under the
public debt law.</P>
      <P>She noted that the government has appropriated NT$192 billion
this year to pay public debts -- with NT$60 billion paying for the
principle and NT$132 billion paying for the interest.</P>
      <P>If the trend continues, then "in 2008, the government will reach
the legal ceiling of the debts, " Lai said, adding that unless the
government resorts to accounting techniques to conceal debts or the
lawmakers agree to raise the debt ceiling, the government will be
unable to appropriate a legal budget for 2008.</P>
      <P>In addition, judging from the financial shortfall of the 
government's budget and debt payments over the past five years, the
government can only pay NT$56.6 billion on the principle and interest
a year, but has incurred an additional NT$200 billion in debts on
average, Lai said.</P>
      <P>"The government is paying its debts by raising more debts, " she
claimed.</P>
      <P>She said that if the government can achieve a fiscal balance next
year, and pay debts at a speed of NT$56 billion a year, then it still
"will take 56 years to clear all debts." She expressed worry for
leaving huge debts to future generations.</P>
      <P>Lai said that ending the budget deficit and not leaving huge
debts to future generations are the responsibilities of legislators
irrespective of their party affiliation and she expressed hope that
they will rigorously review the government's budget and work toward
budgetary balance, starting this year.</P>
      <P>However, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) pointed out that as of the end of this year, the
outstanding debts will reach NT$3.9367 trillion, or 37.3 percent of
the GDP on average over the past three years, well within the bounds
of 40 percent.</P>
      <P>In addition, the debts are used for public construction and there
is no question of leaving the debts for future generations, DGBAS
officials said.</P>
      <P>They said that the government attaches great importance to
improving the nation's financial situation, saying that according to
a financial reform project approved by the Executive Yuan in April
2003, the reforms goals included raising the total tax revenues as a
percentage of the GDP by 1 percent every two years, controlling
expenditure to zero growth and reaching a fiscal balance of revenues
and expenditures in between five and 10 years.</P>
      <P>Related agencies are also promoting short-, middle- and long-term
thrift measures, they added.</P>
      <P>They stressed that compared with other nations, the proportion of
Taiwan's outstanding debts to the GDP, currently at 35.9 percent, is
lower than France' 58.7 percent, Britain's 48.9 percent and Japan's
154.7 percent, showing that Taiwan is not a high-debt country.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
officials said Wednesday that they are checking why a Taiwan search
and rescue team offering to help in the aftermath of the massive
earthquake in South Asia were told not to head to Pakistan.</P>
      <P>Thirty-eight members of the International Headquarters S.A.R.
Taiwan, who had flown to Bangkok to prepare to transfer to Pakistan,
returned home earlier in the day after they were told not to enter
the disaster area because traffic was disrupted by rainy weather.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA spokesman Michel Lu, the officials from the
Pakistan embassy in Thailand, who had promised to assist with the
members' trip, did not show up, and Pakistani authorities only had
airlines workers pass the message to the team members.</P>
      <P>Lu said the ministry is investigating why another 15-member
rescue team from Taiwan was able to reach Pakistan on the same flight
while members of the International Headquarters S.A.R. Taiwan were
blocked.</P>
      <P>A MOFA official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
problems relating to their visa applications could be the reason why
they could not board the plane.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT SECTOR GIVING HELPING HAND TO TEXTILE INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government sector has swung into full
gear to help Taiwan's textile industry break into Central America,
where experts said it stands a good chance of reaping handsome
profits, officials of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The MOEA, the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will each set up an
ad hoc group by the end of this month to serve that end, according to
officials at the MOEA's Industrial Development and Investment Center
(IDIC).</P>
      <P>IDIC Director-General Ou Chia-juey said that some Taiwan
companies have shown strong willingness to invest in Central America,
which is widely viewed as especially suitable for Taiwan textile and
garment makers after the CAFTA-DR (Central American Free Trade
Agreement-Dominican Republic) takes effect.</P>
      <P>The domestic industry has been hit by the abolishment of a global
quota system at the beginning of this year, with its exports in the
first nine months of this year falling by 6.2 percent year on year to
US$8.89 billion.</P>
      <P>The CAFTA-DR is a comprehensive trade pact that will immediately
eliminate tariffs on more than 80 percent of U.S. exports of consumer
and industrial products. Eighty percent of CAFTA-DR exports already
enter the United States duty free under the Caribbean Basin
Initiative.</P>
      <P>Central America is also where many of Taiwan's diplomatic
partners are located.</P>
      <P>At present, Nicaragua has attracted most investment from Taiwan's
textile industry, which has swelled to US$170 million and provides
jobs for nearly 30,000 employees, MOEA statistics show. Honduras is
the second-largest destination, drawing US$40.88 million in Taiwan
capital and providing 5,045 jobs. Taiwan companies have channelled in
US$38.7 million and employ 7,402 workers in El Salvador.</P>
      <P>Taiwan investment has also gone to Guatemala, Belize, the
Dominican Republic and Haiti, the same tallies show.</P>
      <P>The task force teams to be set up by the MOEA and the CEPD will
be devoted to studying investment climates in Central American
countries and Taiwan investment cases, respectively.</P>
      <P>The MOFA will establish "investment service groups " in Central
American nations that will be headed by Republic of China ambassadors
in their host countries. The cooperation and Development Fund under
the MOFA will also help Taiwan companies with personnel training.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Wednesday that he will talk to Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
regarding the possibility of President Chen Shui-bian sending Wang to
this year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum summit as
his envoy.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks while answering questions from reporters on
his chances of serving as President Chen's envoy at the APEC summit
slated for mid-November in Busan, South Korea, after Presidential
Office Deputy Secretary-General James Huang said that President Chen
had told a South Korean envoy earlier the same day of his intentions.</P>
      <P>Huang said that President Chen has asked the envoy to relay his
wish to South Korean President Roh Woo-hyun. Roh first sent an envoy
to extend an invitation to Chen in July, with Chen replying that he
hoped that he could take part in the summit himself.</P>
      <P>Admitting that he would only be able to take part in the summit
after President Chen makes a formal decision, Wang said that he would
undoubtedly report to Ma when everything is cleared. "November is
still some way off," he said.</P>
      <P>"I believe that Ma will take the nation's overall interest into
consideration while weighing the issue, " Wang said, adding, "I will
personally elaborate on the issue to Ma when it has fully been
decided that I will represent the president at the APEC summit."</P>
      <P>According to Wang's aides, the issue regarding Wang's
representation as Chen's special envoy at the APEC leadership meeting
will be widely assessed from both international and domestic
perspectives, which will include Washington's and Beijing's
viewpoints and the political atmosphere at home.</P>
      <P>Media reports said that Ma was uncomfortable about not having
been notified of the president's consideration of Wang.</P>
      <P>The head of the Legislative Yuan is a KMT heavyweight, who
competed against Ma, also Taipei mayor, in the party's historic
direct vote for KMT chairman in July.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation said Wednesday
that 27 percent of Chinese medicines it had tested contain
pharmaceutical elements that may cause health problems over the long
term.</P>
      <P>The foundation said of the 122 Chinese medicines it had tested,
which are considered more organic and thus less harmful to patients,
33 had foreign chemicals added.</P>
      <P>Out of 79 samples that consumers asked the foundation to test for
heavy metals, four contained more than 100 ppm (parts per million) of
mercury, the safety limit set by the Department of Health. Lead is an
accumulative poison.</P>
      <P>Most of the Chinese medicines found to contain questionable
levels of drugs were brought in to Taiwan from abroad or sold at
local Chinese medicine shops, according to the foundation.</P>
      <P>More and more cases of "doctored" Chinese medicines have been
discovered in prescriptions from traditional medicine shops, an
indication that some manufacturers have been trying to boost the
efficacy of their products by illegally adding drugs to them.</P>
      <P>The medicines claiming to be effective for curing accumulations
of uric acid -- the cause of gout, pain killers and rheumatism
fighting compounds are most likely to contain drugs, followed by
those for colds, coughs and nasal inflammations, the foundation said.</P>
      <P>Drugs found in Chinese medicines include caffeine, diuretics,
pain killers and antipyretics -- all illegally added to boost the
effectiveness of the Chinese medicines, the foundation said.</P>
      <P>The foundation said consumers who are interested in having their
Chinese medicines tested can send samples to its Taipei headquarters.
Application forms can be downloaded from the foundation's
Chinese-language Web site at www.consumers.org.tw.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
renewed a thinly veiled threat Wednesday that if its ally, the
Kuomintang (KMT) , relents in its opposition to the arms procurement
bill, it will not get the PFP's help in blocking the party assets
bill in the legislature aimed at depriving the KMT of its "improperly
obtained" assets.</P>
      <P>Sun Ta-chien, a whip of the PFP legislative caucus, reiterated
the PFP stand after the Cabinet approved the party assets bill, which
will soon be introduced in the legislature by the legislative caucus
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Sun said the PFP caucus has also drafted its own version of the
party assets bill but will refrain from introducing it as long as the
KMT caucus does not let the arms procurement bill get out of the
Procedure Committee for a vote in the Legislative Yuan meeting.</P>
      <P>He said he is confident that the KMT and the PFP are equally
resolute in their positions regarding the two bills and will work
hand in hand to block them from being passed.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP enjoys a slim
majority in the 225-seat legislature, but the KMT caucus must depend
on the support of the 34 PFP legislators to maintain this advantage.</P>
      <P>The KMT claimed Wednesday that the party assets bill approved by
the Cabinet is nothing but a tool of the DPP government to purge
civic groups of their assets and is "clearly unconstitutional."</P>
      <P>The arms procurement bill is requesting a special budget of
NT$610.8 billion to purchase eight diesel-electric submarines, a
squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six Patriot PAC III
anti-missile batteries from the United States.</P>
      <P>However, opposition legislators have blocked the bill 32 times in
Procedure Committee meetings on the grounds that the cost is too high
and that the money should come out of a normal budget rather than a
special one.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian was following a
set protocol in naming Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng as his
proxy to attend this year's informal leadership meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, his chief of staff
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun was responding
to opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's remark's that
he felt disrespected by the Presidential Office's decision to appoint
Wang as Chen's proxy at the 2005 APEC summit to be held in the
second-largest South Korean city of Busan in November. Wang is a KMT
stalwart who once served as a KMT vice chairman.</P>
      <P>President Chen told South Korean APEC envoy Yun Hai Jung earlier
in the day that if he is still barred from attending the upcoming
APEC summit in person, he intends to appoint Wang to attend on his
behalf.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, President Chen had long sought Wang's consent to
serve as his proxy at the Busan APEC summit. Yu said he believes that
Wang will brief Ma on the matter later.</P>
      <P>APEC is one of the few international organizations that admit
both Taiwan and China. Because of China's opposition, Taiwan's
president has been barred from attending the annual APEC summit and
has had to name a surrogate to attend on his behalf.</P>
      <P>In the past few years, Chen appointed Academia Sinica President
Lee Yuan-tseh, a co-winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry, to
be his envoy to the annual APEC informal leadership meeting. This
time around, Lee politely rejected Chen's invitation to serve as his
envoy.</P>
      <P>Wang said earlier in the day that he will talk with Ma about the
APEC summit attendance when he has the chance.</P>
      <P>In his view, Wang said this is just the beginning. "When the time

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian was showing
goodwill toward China when he decided to appoint Legislative Yuan
President Wang Jin-pyng as his special envoy to the upcoming APEC
informal leaders' summit in South Korea, a ranking official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said
Wang's appointment also creates a chance to "say hello" to China's
top leader, Hu Jintao, in addition to serving as a "starting point"
for domestic reconciliation.</P>
      <P>"For China, this should be goodwill (from Taiwan) that is
acceptable," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou told Wang the
party would like to help him complete his mission as the president's
APEC envoy.</P>
      <P>The KMT is ready to use its influence to persuade China to help
Wang, a key KMT member, to attend the APEC summit in Busan, South
Kora, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma has also asked KMT think tanks to prepare all background
information for Wang concerning the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum.</P>
      <P>Wang said he is "grateful for" Ma's decision to help him, a
decision that he believes was made for the sake of the nation's
overall interests.</P>
      <P>Wang said that when he told Ma's predecessor, Lien Chan, who now
serves as honorary chairman of the KMT, of the president's decision,
Lien expressed that he was happy to hear about it.</P>
      <P>Lien told Wang that it would be "very significant" for him to
represent the people of Taiwan at the APEC summit in his capacity as
the president of the Legislative Yuan, the nation's highest lawmaking
body.</P>
      <P>Wang said he is not sure whether China will try to obstruct him
from participating in the meeting. He added that if he is able to
represent Chen at the summit, he would like to "not only shake hands
with Hu, but also exchange views with him."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng accepted opposition
lawmakers' challenge Thursday to debate the government's second-phase
financial reform program.</P>
      <P>In reply to independent Legislator Chiu Yi's challenge in the
legislature, Hu said he would gladly accept it "at any time you
choose, the sooner the better."</P>
      <P>Hu said he is confident that the number of publicly owned banks
can be halved by the end of the year, and "if not, I am willing to
take the responsibility."</P>
      <P>In response, Chiu asked which three banks would be "reduced" in
the halving process, to which Hu replied that he was not at liberty
to answer as doing so would involve divulging information that would
put him in violation of the stock trading law.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Democratic Progressive Party lawmaker Tsai Chi-fang
said President Chen Shui-bian's second-phase financial reform program
is aimed at clearing up irregularities from the previous government.</P>
      <P>The opposition allegation that the DPP government is trying to
benefit big conglomerates by selling public banks is not fair, Tsai
said.</P>
      <P>If public banks are being sold at unreasonable prices, private
bankers will not buy them, so "we cannot say the program is aimed at
benefiting conglomerates," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA FEARS FOR PASSAGE OF TAIWAN AFFAIRS ACT BY CANADA PARLIAMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Toronto,  Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By C.Y. Chang and P.C.tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing has great fear that the Canadian
Parliament will pass a "Taiwan Affairs Act" to provide a better
framework for further improvement of relationship between the people
of Canada and the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chinese Ambassador to Canada Lu Shumin warned Wednesday the
Canadian Parliament against passing a Taiwan Affairs Act, saying that
doing so would seriously affect relations between China and Canada.</P>
      <P>Addressing a luncheon at the Canadian National Press Club, the
envoy said that a change in Canada's "one China" policy would
certainly undermine relations between the two countries as their
diplomatic relationship is based on a consensus on the Taiwan issue.
Canada switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in
1970.</P>
      <P>The Canadian Parliament has been discussing passing a Taiwan
Affairs Act to provide a better framework for further economic, trade
and cultural exchanges and other initiatives between the people of
Canada and the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Canadian Member of Parliament Jim Abbott put forward a few
months ago Bill C-357 in the House of Commons, requesting that the
legislature enact a Taiwan Affairs Act to strengthen the relations
between Canada and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the lawmaker, enactment of the bill would provide a
statutory framework for economic, trade, cultural and other
initiatives between the people of the two countries.</P>
      <P>The Canadian government is also currently trying to further
promote its trade relations with China as leverage in its trade
dealings with the United States, which has imposed what Ottawa
considers unfair import tariffs on Canadian cork products.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, China, with a huge market of 1.3 billion people
and a rapidly growing economy, is likely to import ever greater
amounts of construction raw materials, including cork goods, from
Canada in the coming years.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by Chinese customs authorities show that
two-way trade between Canada and China amounted to US$7 billion in
2000, representing a 45-percent increase over the 1999 level. The
figure mushroomed to US$15.5 billion for 2004.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the human rights issue, including Beijing's
repression of the Falun Gong, as well as several cases of Chinese
industrial espionage in Canada in recent years have presented
obstacles on the path to further development of relations between the
two countries.</P>

      <P>Appointing a special envoy to the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit is the exclusive right of
the Republic of China president and cannot be meddled in by any other
country, Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the statement in reply to Kuomintang Legislator John
Chiang's question as to whether the government has a back-up plan to
assigning Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng as the president's
envoy to the APEC summit in South Korea.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the selection of Wang could be a problem if any of
the APEC members offer a different interpretation of the memorandum
of understanding Taiwan signed in 1992 for joining APEC. He noted
that former Vice President Lee Yuan-zu had been prevented from
attending an APEC summit in the past because of this.</P>
      <P>Chen responded by saying that attending the summit is the right
of every member and that no member can be deprived of this right by
any other member.</P>
      <P>"If President Chen Shui-bian himself cannot attend, appointing
someone to represent him is his right which cannot be meddled in, "

    <HEADLINE>NEW POLICY ON FOREIGN CAREGIVER EMPLOYMENT SET TO START 2006</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairman Lee
Ying-yuan affirmed Thursday the government's plan to implement a new
policy on the employment of foreign caregivers from Jan. 1, 2006.</P>
      <P>Under the new policy, Taiwan families which intend to hire
foreign caregivers to take care of sick or elderly family members
will have to first pass an assessment by medical institutions proving
that they require 24-hour care.</P>
      <P>Social service authorities will then help these families look for
local workers who are willing to accept the jobs. A family will only
be permitted to hire a foreign worker if no local worker can be found
to fill the position.</P>
      <P>Delivering a report on the policy to the legislature, Lee said
the CLA is planning to provide a subsidy of NT$5,000 to NT$10,000 to
families hiring local caregivers, who are more expensive than foreign
workers.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, there are approximately 330,000 elderly people
who need long-term care in Taiwan, 130,000 of whom require care
around the clock.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that there are currently some 130,000 foreign
caregivers in Taiwan, and he predicted that the number will increase
by 5,000 to 10,000 in the near future.</P>
      <P>However, opposition Kuomintang Legislators Hou Tsai-feng and Yang
Li-huan called the policy poorly planned.</P>
      <P>They questioned the feasibility of the policy, saying the CLA did
not even make an estimate as to how much will be needed to fund it
and how many local caregivers will benefit from it.</P>

      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Thursday that the
Ministry of Finance is studying whether China Steel Corp. Chairman
Lee Wen-yuan has violated any laws in accepting a huge bonus in
company stocks.</P>
      <P>If it is determined that he has violated the law, the bonus will

      <P>In the event that it is determined that acceptance of the bonus
was inappropriate even though no law was broken, then the law and
relevant regulations will have to be amended, Hsieh further said.</P>
      <P>Also under study, according to Hsieh, are the questions of how
much of the bonus should be returned, and if Lin is to return all or
part of the bonus, should his predecessors also be required to return
the bonuses that they had received.</P>
      <P>Lin's company stocks bonus worth about NT$44 million has become a
heated topic of discussion in the country as a large group of
"pan-green camp" lawmakers signed a motion Wednesday demanding that
Lin give up his bonus stocks and return them to the national coffers.</P>
      <P>Chairman Su Tseng-chang of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said that even though Lin is not a DPP member, he is a
member of the ruling team and must be judged by a high moral standard
and subject to relevant laws and regulations.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-tsan, director of the DPP Department of Culture and
Information, noted that compensation packages for government
appointed leaders at state-run enterprises, government-invested
businesses and government-subsidized non-profit organizations must be
"reasonable and legal" and acceptable to the public.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO PAVE WAY FOR WANG'S ATTENDANCE AT APEC SUMMIT</HEADLINE>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
urged the government Thursday to pave the wave for Legislative Yuan
speaker Wang Jin-pyng's attendance on behalf of President Chen
Shui-bian at this year's informal APEC leadership summit.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he phoned Wang earlier the same day to express his
support for Wang's participation as Chen's special envoy at the
summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) slated
for Nov. 18-19 in Busan, South Korea.</P>
      <P>Stating that KMT Vice Chairman P. K. Chiang and the party's think
tanks will assist Wang in making the necessary preparations to take
part in the APEC summit, Ma urged the government to help facilitate
Wang's trip to Busan. Chiang has participated in APEC summit meetings
as the president's envoy several times in the past.</P>
      <P>Although South Korea has expressed agreement with the idea of
having Wang attend on Chen's behalf, Ma said that the government
still needs to work to remove other hurdles.</P>
      <P>Ma beat Wang to become the KMT's chairman in a historic direct
election for the party's top post in July. Both Ma, who is also
Taipei mayor, and Wang were vice chairmen of the main opposition
party at the time of the election. Wang did no accept Ma's invitation
to serve as his deputy after Ma took the KMT's helm.</P>
      <P>President Chen informed Wang in August of his intention of
dispatching Wang as his envoy to take part in the APEC leadership
meeting, but Wang did not notify Ma of the matter. Media reports said
a day earlier that Ma was uncomfortable about not having been told
about the president's consideration of Wang.</P>
      <P>According to Wang's aides, his participation in the APEC summit
as the president's envoy will be broadly evaluated from international
and domestic viewpoints, including Washington's and Beijing's
reactions and the domestic political atmosphere.</P>

    <TEXT>La Repubblica: House of Deputies voting over
electoral reforms.

The House of Deputies voted over a series of proposals for
electoral reforms Wednesday. The ruling coalition won over most of
duels against the opposition, but was defeated in an amendment
it proposed to increase the female quota in the parliament to not
less than 30 percent. Premier Silvio Berlusconi is optimistic over
the reforms, while the opposition criticized them as back to the
last century. The duel between the ruling and opposition camps over
the controversial eletoral reform is extending.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>TWO DPP LAWMAKERS CLAIM INNOCENCE IN HEALTH INSURANCE SCAM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) legislators who also run hospitals claimed Thursday that they
were not involved in reported health insurance frauds, and one of
them pledged to resign if he is found to have taken any illicit money
from the Bureau of National Health Insurance.</P>
      <P>Both Lin Chin-hsing and Chiu Yung-jen said their hospitals might
have been used as a tool to swindle insurance companies by people who
have feigned to be in-patients. They claimed that they themselves
were "victims" in the scams.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, prosecutors have found that suspect
Wen Tsung-ming and his 31-member family bought insurance policies
before colluding with five hospitals in Tainan and Kaohisung, getting
documents "proving" they were hospitalized so they could claim money
from insurance companies while the hospitals claimed fees from the
Bureau of National Health Insurance.</P>
      <P>The Wens have been doing this over the past 10 years, reaping a
total of NT$30 million in illicit profits, according to a newspaper
report.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
demanded that the bureau get to the bottom of the situation, and if
the two DPP legislators' hospitals were found to have claimed
insurance money from the bureau by cheating, it should cancel
contracts with them and turn them over to prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Caucus deputy secretary-general Pan Wei-kang said the Yung-jen
Hospital owned by Chiu was accused of swindling the Bureau of
National Health Insurance of money with false accounts last month;
now this new scandal is implicating his hospital.</P>
      <P>If the cheating is found to be true, then the "cheating lawmaker"
should be charged according to law, she said.</P>
      <P>Chiu claimed that he never cheated the bureau of any money and
that he is a victim in the reported scam. If he had violated any law,
he said, he would immediately quit as a lawmaker.</P>
      <P>He said he has handed all hospital records about the Wen family
to investigators, hoping they will clear his name soon.</P>
      <P>Lin said his hospital is well managed and he was "purely out of
luck" to have been implicated in the fraud. Lin claimed he has never
cheated a cent from the Bureau of National Health Insurance.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that when the prosecution authorities searched his
hospital Wednesday, only one of the 51 in-patients were not on the
hospital grounds, indicating that the hospital was managed as it
should be.</P>
      <P>As to Wen's testimony that he had been Lin's assistant at the
Legislative Yuan, Lin said none of the 31 members in the Wen family
had been his legislative assistant.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus, which has been reeling from a number
of scandals involving the ruling camp, asserted that any member found
to have broken the law to make illicit profits would be kicked out of
the caucus.</P>
      <P>William C.T. Lai, caucus secretary-general, called for calm while
the nation waits for the investigation results. "We support an
intensive investigation into alleged violations of the law," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACADEMIA SINICA PRESIDENT ADMITS FAILURE OF EDUCATION REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
admitted Thursday that it was his fault that education reforms in
Taiwan over the past decade have failed to relieve the stress on
students but has instead put them under heavier pressure.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks during a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
science and information committee, where he was asked if he has made
any mistakes over the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>Lee, who headed an education reform committee under the Cabinet,
pointed out that public expectations were too high regarding what the
committee could achieve and that they were unaware that the committee
was only responsible for putting forth a proposal and had no power
over the implementation of the reform measures.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the issue, education reform activists agreed that
the reforms have failed to meet expectations but said Lee should not
take all the blame.</P>
      <P>According to National Teachers' Association Chairman Wu
Chung-tai, Lee's remarks are "belated justice" for all the students
and parents who have suffered under the reforms, but substantial
actions are required to correct the mistakes made.</P>
      <P>One of the aspects that needs adjustment is the government's
teacher-training policy, Wu said, adding that cooperation and the
inclusion of different opinions are crucial to the success of the
reforms.</P>
      <P>Feng Chiao-lan, executive director of the Humanistic Education
Foundation, noted that the government has focused the education
reforms on changing the school curriculum and the model for students
to advance to a better school, while there has been little change
involving "individuals."</P>
      <P>Feng said teachers have not changed their teaching methods but
have continued to use supplementary books in their teaching and
instil students with the concept of getting grades to advance to a
better school, which she said is the source of students' pressure.</P>
      <P>Pao Chung-min, head of the Parents Association in Taipei, urged
the government to review the reforms to find out what went wrong, as
he said the reforms have obviously failed to achieve their goal.</P>
      <P>Pao said parents still expect education reforms to continue
regardless if the measures implemented over the past 10 years have
been right or wrong.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Hui-ying, chairwoman of the National Alliance of Parents
Association, said it is true that the pressure on students has not
lessened after the reforms were launched and that teachers and
parents are the sources of this pressure.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said future reforms should focus on the expansion of
government-funded education from nine years to 12 years to help
reduce the pressure on students.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER ROC PRESIDENT TAKES TRAIN RIDE WITH ALASKA GOVERNOR AS GUIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Anchorage,  Alaska,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Y. C. Chen and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China
President Lee Teng-hui began his second full day in Anchorage, Alaska
Wednesday by boarding a train to see a glacier, with Alaska
Government Frank Murkowski serving as his guide.</P>
      <P>Lee was warmly greeted by Murkowski when he arrived at the
railway station from the hotel where he is staying. The governor was
also elated to see Wu Li-pei, a senior advisor to President Chen
Shui-bian whom he has known for three decades.</P>
      <P>Murkowski talked of the landscape along the way, calling
everyone's attention when two reindeers were spotted on the plain.</P>
      <P>Lee, while enjoying the views, said the weather in Anchorage was
very cold. He wouldn't divulge further the contents of their
conversations.</P>
      <P>Murkowski said the former ROC president is young and energetic,
hardly looking like an octogenarian.</P>
      <P>Murkowski, who is a staunch supporter of Taiwan, also said that
it was good to see President Chen make a transit stop in Miami on his
way to Central America last month, and for Lee to visit the United
States.</P>
      <P>He said that Alaska and Taiwan have close relations mainly
because Anchorage is between Asia and America, and that his state has
rich energy, mineral and fishery reserves which can be complementary
to those of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu echoed his view, saying that Taiwan could form joint ventures
with Alaska to tap energy resources, saying that it will help
stabilize domestic oil prices and create economic stability.</P>
      <P>Wu said that his friendship with Murkowski dates back to the
Alaska National Bank where Murkowski served as a president before
being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1980 and serving in Alaska for 22
years. During his tenure in the U.S. Senate, Murkowski served as
Subcommittee Chairman of Pacific and East Asian Affairs on the
Foreign Relations Committee, further deepening his understanding of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Saying that Murkowski is a man who attaches importance to
friendship and principles, Wu said that he is indeed a friend Taiwan
needs.</P>
      <P>Anchorage is the first leg of Lee's two-week U.S. trip which will
also take him to New York, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, where
he will meet with leaders of major Taiwanese associations, American
politicians, think tank scholars and opinion leaders.</P>
      <P>Lee will be in Washington, D.C. from Oct. 17-20, during which he
will deliver a speech at the National Press Club.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT AIR LINKS IMPOSSIBLE BEFORE 2006: MAC CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opening of direct air links between
Taiwan and China seems unlikely before 2006, but the government will
still do its best to eliminate hurdles to two-way talks on the issue,
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
about a newspaper report that cross-Taiwan Strait air links might be
set up before the beginning of the next year. Calling the report
groundless speculation, he said that it is too early to talk about
the matter when concrete results have yet to be worked out.</P>
      <P>Bilateral negotiations on direct charter cargo and passenger
services and on allowing Chinese tourists to sightsee in Taiwan have
remained in gridlock, Wu said, quoting sources as saying that
Beijing is attempting to postpone the talks until after Taiwan's
city and county chiefs elections on Dec. 3.</P>
      <P>If what the sources said are true, it would be a very unwise move
by Beijing -- a situation which the MAC chief said is not in the
interests of the people on either side.</P>
      <P>There are elections almost every year in Taiwan, and Beijing must
not weigh bilateral negotiations from that viewpoint, he said, citing
concerns of some people that Beijing might be seeking to put off the
talks until the next presidential race in 2008 has ended in
anticipation that the opposition "pan blue alliance" candidates would
win.</P>
      <P>"If this is true, the efforts that we have made are in vain, and
it is extremely unwise for Beijing to adopt that approach since it
will not benefit the people in Taiwan -- something contrary to the
Beijing leaders' repeated claims that they will do whatever they can
to accomplish all tasks that are beneficial to the Taiwan people, "
he said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's sole Nobel laureate said Thursday
that he is disappointed with the performance of the ruling Democratic

      <P>Lee Yuan-tseh, a co-winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry,
revealed his feelings when answering questions from independent

Technology and Information Committee in his capacity as president of

      <P>Lee obviously played an important role in President Chen
Shui-bian's victory in the 2000 presidential election by a narrow
margin over opponents James Soong and Lien Chan, in part because only
days before the voting, he openly threw his support behind Chen.</P>
      <P>He was asked by Li whether he owed an apology to the people for
supporting Chen, whose popularity rating has plunged from 75 percent
to 25 percent, as indicated by a recent poll.</P>
      <P>In reply, Lee acknowledged that the policies of the DPP

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of aboriginal
people from Hualien went to Taipei Thursday to appeal to the
government to recognize the "historical truth" and officially
designate them the 13th indigenous group in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Group members, calling themselves the Sakizaya tribesmen,
traveled in two buses to Taipei to promote their "identity movement"
that was initiated in May this year.</P>
      <P>According to Kao Hsing-yi, movement initiator, the Sakizayas had
traditionally lived in areas today known as Hualien City more than
127 years ago until an ethnic purge incident occurred in 1878, known
as the "Dagubuwan Incident, " when many Sakizaya people were killed
by Ching dynasty soldiers.</P>
      <P>Survivors of that incident were so scared that they moved and hid
behind false identities, mostly as Amis, technically making
themselves disappeared from the planet, according to Kao.</P>
      <P>Although the Sakizayas had "vanished," the group had continuously
lived in Hualien over the past 127 years discreetly, maintaining
their traditions, culture and language, which are completely
different from those of the Amis, Kao said.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan becoming more and more democratic, Kao said, the
Sakizayas have increasingly craved for their own identity.</P>
      <P>Since the Sakizaya identity movement was launched in May, more
than 5,000 letters have been endorsed by Sakizaya offspring,
confirming that they are Sakizayas instead of Amis and demanding that
the Sakizayas be recognized by the central government as the 13th
indigenous group in Taiwan, Kao said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu Cheng-wan, an activity leader, said that the
Sakizayas owe the Amis much for their magnanimity over the past
century by not revealing their secret so that the Sakizayas could

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian hailed Thursday
the mass production of biodiesel by a local company, describing it as
the first step toward Taiwan's long-held dream of energy
self-sufficiency.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during an inspection tour of a biodiesel
demonstration factory in Chiayi County's Minghsiung Industrial Zone
in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The factory was established by Taiwan NJC Corp., a joint venture
of the Nice Group of Taiwan and New Japan Chemical Co. of Japan, with
the assistance of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Industrial
Technology Research Institute.</P>
      <P>It is Taiwan's first biodiesel production facility using waste
edible oil and oil-rich plants such as soybeans and sunflowers, to
produce biodiesel, which is a renewable energy source. The plant can
turn out 3,000 tons of biodiesel annually.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was very pleased to see the factory's smooth
operation.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan relies on imports for 95 percent of its energy demand.
Compared with other countries, we have lagged behind in developing
renewable energy. We should now catch up and invest more in
eco-friendly energy resources development. It is hoped that Taiwan
can succeed in developing clean, efficient, renewable and sustainable
energy resources and finally joining the ranks of oil-producing
countries," Chen added.</P>

China on President Chen Shui-bian's choice of Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng as his representative to the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in South Korea has drawn mixed

as his envoy.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that Chen has in the past tried getting higher-level
officials to attend APEC on his behalf, including former Vice
President Li Yuan-zu and former Vice Premier Lai In-jaw, without
success, proving, he said, that "his misgivings are not unfounded."</P>
      <P>Ma said the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) owes an
explanation to the nation -- whether Taiwan has agreed to accept the
tacit agreement on whom to send in the past, whether the tacit
agreement is binding and if it is, what are Chen's considerations in
naming Wang -- who has no financial or economic background.</P>
      <P>He said that if Wang, a former KMT vice chairman, can go, the
party will be happy for him to make the trip. But, he went on, as
Wang is not in charge of foreign affairs, Chen should "pave his way
to Busan, and not ask him to take the adventure."</P>
      <P>However, Chen Shui-bian noted Wednesday that when Taiwan entered
APEC in 1992, it did not reach any tacit agreements or sign any kind
of memorandum of understanding with other members, adding that his
inability to attend the meeting is purely due to China's persistent
obstruction. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton initiated the APEC
summit meetings in 1993.</P>
      <P>Cheng Li-wen, a spokeswoman of the KMT, said that the party will
feel regret if Wang cannot make the trip.</P>
      <P>She claimed that Taiwan has in the past dispatched mostly
"economic officials" to attend the APEC summit and that any approach
other than this has invariably failed, saying that Chen's appointment
of Wang is "basically a child's game."</P>
      <P>Cheng also claimed that Chen's announcement of Wang as his envoy
before making certain he can actually make the trip is "immature, "
adding that the approach will not achieve a diplomatic breakthrough
but will only show "disrespect to Wang."</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition People First Party
expressed the hope that China will view Wang in a "broad-minded way,"
saying that as the legislative speaker, he will convey the voice of
Taiwan on cross-Taiwan Strait issues and will not have a negative
impact on bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>The PFP legislative cause will explain to China through various
channels such as the media, scholars and the party-to-party
communication platform that Wang is a suitable envoy, Sun said.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, an ally of
the DPP, said that China has no right to meddle in Taiwan's internal
affairs and expressed the hope that the government will stick to its
guns on Wang and not bow under pressure.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANNOUNCEMENT OF APEC ENVOY PREMATURE: KMT</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian should not have
made the announcement that he will send Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jin-pyng as his envoy at the informal leadership summit of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in South Korea until
Wang's attendance becomes certain, opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Commenting on news reports that China had voiced vehement
opposition to Wang's assignment, Cheng said the premature
announcement not only is unhelpful to making a breakthrough for
Taiwan on the diplomatic front, but also amounts to disrespect to the
speaker of the legislature.</P>
      <P>She said the KMT will feel regret if Wang cannot attend the
summit as a result of China's opposition.</P>
      <P>Beijing has based its opposition on the grounds that according to
a memorandum of understanding signed in 1992 before Taiwan --
formally designated in APEC as Chinese Taipei -- joined the
organization, Taiwan can only send its "minister in charge of
APEC-related economic affairs" to attend the meeting, and that since
then, APEC "has operated on this basis."</P>
      <P>Chen has insisted that no other country should tamper with his
exclusive right to appoint his representative to the APEC leadership
summit.</P>
      <P>Wang's attendance at the summit appeared to hang in the balance
and it will be up to the government of South Korea to decide whether
it will succumb to pressure from China to make Wang's trip

    <HEADLINE>AIT OFFICIAL REAFFIRMS U.S. COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING ASIAN SECURITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A top official at the American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) reaffirmed Thursday the United States' commitment to
protecting security in Asia, where the rise of China has raised much
regional concern.</P>
      <P>Douglas Paal, director of the AIT's Taipei office -- the de facto
U.S. embassy in Taiwan -- pointed that how to deal with China's
rising power is a central question in American foreign policy and
that the United States now needs to encourage China to become a
responsible stakeholder in the international system.</P>
      <P>The United States respects China's interests in Asia and
recognizes the useful role of multilateral diplomacy in the region,
but concerns will grow if China seeks to maneuver toward a
predominance of power, Paal said.</P>
      <P>"Instead, we should work together with ASEAN, Japan, Australia
and others for regional security and prosperity through the ASEAN
Regional Forum and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, " he
said.</P>
      <P>Paal said it is important for China to resolve its differences
with Taiwan peacefully because its choices about Taiwan will send an
important message.</P>
      <P>Paal made the remarks while delivering a speech at the
Asia-Pacific Security Forum 2005 held in Taipei by the Institute for
National Policy Research.</P>
      <P>He emphasized the need for the United States, Japan and China to
cooperate on both regional and global challenges, saying there are
many common interests and opportunities for cooperation.</P>
      <P>He said China has many opportunities to be a responsible
stakeholder, one of most pressing of which is North Korea.</P>
      <P>China has played a constructive role in the six-party talks on
the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, where an agreement on the goal of
"verifiable denuclearization of the Korean peninsula in a peaceful
manner" was achieved last month, he noted.</P>
      <P>"But the hard work of implementation lies ahead, and China should
share our interest in effective and comprehensive compliance, " he
added.</P>
      <P>In terms of the energy policy, Paal suggested that China work
with the United States and other countries to develop diverse sources
of energy, including through clean coal technology, nuclear,
renewables, hydrogen and biofuels.</P>

      <P>Former opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Lien Chan will leave for China Friday for a two-week private visit, a
KMT spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lien, now honorary chairman of the main opposition party and
chairman of the KMT-affiliated National Policy Foundation, will visit
Shengyang, Liaoning Province, in northeastern China -- the land of
his 97-year-old mother -- where he will take part in a family reunion
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lien will proceed to Shangdong, Hunan and Sichuan provinces,
accompanied by his wife and children. It will be Lien's second visit
to China after his first trip in late April, when he was still the
KMT head before passing on the baton to Ma Ying-jeou, who is also
mayor of Taipei, in the middle of August.</P>
      <P>Lien's first China trip was dubbed by the KMT as a "journey of
peace" that signified a major breakthrough in relations between the
KMT and the Communist Party of China (CPC) -- long-time rivals since
1949 when the KMT retreated to Taiwan after losing a civil war to the
CPC in China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh called for Taiwan and
Mongolia Thursday to bolster bilateral exchanges, saying that in
addition to accelerating economic, medical and cultural ties, the two
sides should also have high-level exchanges, including premier-level
visits.</P>
      <P>Receiving a group of Mongolians visiting Taiwan for public
administration training, Hsieh said he would like to visit Mongolia
if given the chance.</P>
      <P>Hsieh offered his appreciation for Mongolia's support for
Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization and related
activities and said he is pleased to see closer medical exchanges
between the two countries.</P>
      <P>He extended a welcome to the visitors, saying that Taiwan and
Mongolia are actually "emulating each other" when they engage in
exchange programs.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, Taiwan also offers 20 scholarships to
outstanding Mongolian students annually, allowing Mongolian young
people to come to Taiwan to gain a better appreciation of the
country.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Hsu Chih-hsiung, chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, noted that
Taiwan has offered training to Mongolia in the economic, judicial and
administration fields over the last 15 years, training more than 1,200
people who have in turned contributed significantly to the
development of Mongolia and its efforts to improve the welfare of its
people.</P>
      <P>A total of 26 Mongolians came for this year's public

governors, eight provincial assembly speakers and officials from the
city government of Ulan Bator, the Mongolian parliament and even the

    <HEADLINE>SWITZERLAND `MIRROR FOR TAIWAN': CEPD REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With only one-third of Taiwan's population
and mountainous country "similar to that of Taiwan, " Switzerland
represents a miracle that provides a great deal from which Taiwan can
learn, according to a government report issued Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Switzerland's per-capita income -- US$37,083 -- is nearly triple
Taiwan's, and the country enjoys a prosperous economy with an
unemployment rate lower than 1 percent while boasting the world's
best living environment, according to the report by the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>The report attributes Switzerland's success to what it described
as "a comprehensive and sophisticated programming of national
territory that allows the country to turn its unique cultural and
geographic features into prosperous businesses."</P>
      <P>Switzerland, though poor in natural resources and fertile soil
like Taiwan, is strong in the upscale financial-service and high-end
precision instrument industries, after having gone through five
decades of development that initiated in the 1950s, the report says.</P>
      <P>In addition to luring a large number of business visitors thanks
to its role as a leading world conference center, Switzerland also
attracts millions of tourists every year from around the world who
come to see its magnificent natural scenery, half of which is 1,200
meters above sea level and includes mountains, glacier, forests and
farms, it elaborates.</P>
      <P>In light of Switzerland's success both in high technology,
conservation and tourism, Taiwan should consider how to blend its
competitive edges into a national territory programming to further
upgrade its developments on a wide range of fronts, it suggests,
adding that this would also create many jobs for its people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S POLITICAL MANEUVERING COMPLICATES PANDA ISSUE: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has made its stance clear on the
idea of accepting a "gift" of pandas from China and the Chinese
authorities' recent political maneuvering will only further
complicate the issue and will not help cross-Taiwan Strait relations,
the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The MAC issued a news release amid reports that China's selection
of a pair of pandas to be sent to Taiwan is nearing the final stage
and that a spokesman for Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office under the
State Council also expressed hope Thursday that Taiwan will make the
necessary preparations to facilitate the delivery.</P>
      <P>Beijing first mentioned sending a pair of the endangered animals
to Taiwan as a goodwill gesture following a visit to China by
former opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan in late April.</P>
      <P>The MAC said the government's stance on the issue is based on an
assessment of the following four conditions: qualified groups seeking
to house the pandas should make the application according to wildlife
conservation laws; the applicants should have a good environment for
pandas; the way of transporting the pandas should conform with the
law; and world wildlife conservation organizations and opinions
should not be opposed to their coming to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing has recently continued to use the opposition parties to
engage in political maneuvering on the issue, causing the issue to
deviate from professional considerations, the news release said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei and Taichung are gearing up for a competition
to house the pandas.</P>
      <P>A Taipei city government official said it applied to the Council
of Agriculture to take the pandas earlier in the day after collecting
all necessary documents.</P>
      <P>However, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, who is in China to take part in
a regional conference, has instructed his deputy, Hsiao Chia-chi, to
make preparations before seeking to house the pandas. Hu's efforts,
however, were dismissed by his two rivals in the year-end elections
-- Lin Chia-lung of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and Shen
Chi-huei of the People First Party -- as mere election gambits, an 
unsurprising accusation, given that Taichung has no zoo.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Thursday he "looks forward to China's support" for his attendance at
this year's informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum as President Chen Shui-bian's proxy.</P>
      <P>Wang made the appeal after China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs
said earlier in the day that it opposes Wang's attendance at the 2005
APEC summit to be held in the second-largest South Korean city of
Busan in November.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, China should have "long been aware" of Chen's
decision to send him to represent Taiwan at the upcoming APEC summit.</P>
      <P>In the end, Wang said he believes it's not up to Taiwan to decide
whether he can attend the APEC summit on Chen's behalf.</P>
      <P>"I think it will hinge on interaction between the United States
and China," he went on.</P>
      <P>Wang, an opposition Kuomintang (KMT) heavyweight, said KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou promised him in a phone conversation earlier in
the day to assist in seeking China's support for his APEC attendance.</P>
      <P>Noting that national interests should take precedence over
partisan interests, Wang said he believes his presence at the APEC
summit would benefit both the nation and the KMT.</P>
      <P>"I take it as a great honor and an opportunity to serve our
country. I'm hopeful that China will not hinder the realization of
this perfect mission," Wang said.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Chen asked him in July whether he would be
willing to represent Taiwan at this year's APEC summit if Chen was
still barred from attending in person.</P>
      <P>"In August, Chen formally informed me of his decision to name me
as his envoy at the APEC summit, " Wang recalled, adding that Chen's
sincerity in sending him is unquestionable.</P>
      <P>Commenting on China's claim that an APEC memorandum of
understanding restricts Taiwan to sending only ministerial-level
economic officials to take part in APEC activities, Wang noted that
many years have passed since 1993, when the first APEC informal
leadership meeting took place.</P>
      <P>"The times have changed. Given the ever-increasing civilian
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, China should change its way of
thinking and adjust its stance to forge goodwill and mutual trust, "
Wang said.</P>
      <P>APEC is one of the few international organizations that admit
both Taiwan and China. Because of China's opposition, Taiwan's
president has been barred from attending the annual APEC summit and
has had to name a surrogate to attend on his behalf.</P>
      <P>In the past few years, Chen appointed Academia Sinica President
Lee Yuan-tseh, a co-winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry, to
be his envoy to the annual APEC informal leadership meeting. This
time around, Lee politely rejected Chen's invitation to serve as his
envoy.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian suggested Thursday
that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) should invite
people recognized as having good reputations to form an independent,
objective commission against corruption.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the DPP elite at a special meeting, Chen said the
proposed commission should have the authority to accept petitions and
hear complaints from all sectors and to investigate charges of
corruption against any DPP members working in government posts,
including himself.</P>
      <P>He assured fellow DPP members that he is not involved in any way
in an illegal profiteering case brought to light by the Aug. 21 riot
of Thai laborers working on the Kaohsiung rapid transit railway
project, and said he is not covering up wrongdoings by anyone else.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that if what he said proves to be contrary to the
results of investigation, he would be willing to resign.</P>
      <P>Chen said he understands that people are anxious to see results
from the public prosecutors' investigation of the profiteering case
and he expressed regret that legislation on the establishment of a
commission against corruption failed to materialize in 2001.</P>
      <P>The DPP meeting took place amidst pressure from within the party
calling for a "new DPP movement" to clear the party's image, which
has been soiled by a series of scandals and disputes linked to
charges of corruption. Those present at the meeting included Vice

      <P>China is deliberately distorting the spirit
of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on Taiwan's participation in
the annual informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, a Presidential Office spokesman said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General James Huang was
responding to a claim by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs earlier
in the day that according to an MOU signed before Taiwan joined APEC,
Taiwan can only send its "minister in charge of APEC-related economic
affairs" to attend APEC activities, and that since then, APEC "has
operated on this basis."</P>
      <P>China's claim came a day after President Chen Shui-bian said he
had decided to name Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng to attend
this year's APEC summit on his behalf.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the MOU only prescribes that Taiwan's foreign
affairs minister should not attend the annual APEC ministerial-level
meeting.</P>
      <P>With South Korean assistance, Huang said, Taiwan, China and Hong
Kong managed to join APEC simultaneously in 1992. At that time, the
highest-level APEC event was the annual meeting of economic and
foreign affairs ministers of all APEC member economies. Taiwan has
traditionally sent economics and finance ministers to take part in
APEC ministerial meetings.</P>
      <P>Noting that APEC began to hold an annual informal leadership
meeting in 1993, Huang said he does not think the MOU is applicable
to Taiwan's representation in this event.</P>
      <P>Because of China's opposition, Taiwan's president has been barred
from attending the annual APEC summit and has had to name a surrogate

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed his
commitment Thursday to materializing the "six reform priorities"
outlined in his Doble Ten National Day message, stressing that if the
reform projects are not completed as scheduled, relevant department
heads should be held responsible.</P>

in various fields.</P>
      <P>"Reform is our ultimate goal, not just a slogan to gain power. We
pursue power simply for promoting reform. Power is not our goal, "
Chen said. Stressing that the "six reform priorities" elaborated in
his National Day message aim to balance "economic prosperity" with
"social justice" in Taiwan's comprehensive development, Chen said all
government departments should work hard to realize them.</P>
      <P>The Six Reform Priorities are: financial reform, tax reform,
reform to change the preferential interest rates of 18 percent, media
reform, investigation into properties inappropriately seized by
political parties, and constitutional reform.</P>
      <P>Chen said he looks forward to see the completion of the some
second-phase financial reform programs, including cutting the number

(By Y.C. Chen and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The gravest threat that the
regime in Beijing faces is democratization, and not the Taiwan people
determining their own future, former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee, who is currently in Anchorage, Alaska on the first leg of a
two-week trip to the United States, made the remarks while delivering
a speech at the World Affairs Council on "Democracy in Taiwan and the
Asia-Pacific Region." Alaska Governor Frank Murkowski was on hand to
listen to the speech.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that establishing a democratic system and democratic
values in Taiwan was a difficult process, Lee said that Taiwan still
faces tough challenges posed by the totalitarian regime in Beijing
and its ambition to "swallow" the island.</P>
      <P>China has been deeply worried about Taiwan's democratic
development as this development has served as a beacon of hope for
Chinese living on the mainland and in the Asia-Pacific region, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Admitting that international support, especially from America,
has been an important factor in Taiwan's democratization, Lee said
that because of this support and the Taiwan people's determination to
pursue democracy and be their own master, Beijing had to restrain
itself from taking further action during the 1996 missile crisis in
the Taiwan Strait and the 2000 presidential election in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He further said that China's use of the threat of force against
Taiwan to attain its so-called goal of reunification is aimed at
covering up the "irrationality and fragility of the totalitarian
regime."</P>
      <P>"The gravest threat the Beijing regime faces is not the Taiwan
people determining their own future, but rather democracy which has
given power to the people, which threatens the legitimacy and
existence of the totalitarian regime," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Although U.S. efforts to push for democratization in various
parts of the world have gradually borne fruit, there has been
virtually no progress on democratization in China, Lee claimed,
adding that the international community and the United States have
done nothing to call for Beijing to follow the global democratic
trend.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is on the front line against the totalitarian Chinese
regime, the island's democracy and existence have significant meaning
to the future democratization of China and Asia, Lee claimed, adding
that to the United States, the existence of democratic Taiwan also
represents the existence of the expansion of democracy in the
Asia-Pacific region as well as a foundation of U.S. interests and
security in the region.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the basic values of freedom and democracy have been
the foundation of economic and security relations among allies, Lee
said that the common values of democracy and freedom shared by Taiwan
and the United State have been the reasons why the two countries have
been able to maintain a stable friendship.</P>
      <P>"Creating a democratic environment and a democratic alliance in
the Asia-Pacific region is the real basis for peace in the region, "

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TO SPEAK ON SIX REFORM PRIORITIES SUNDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will speak on his
"Six Reform Priorities" on television Sunday, and afterwards will
travel around Taiwan to explain them directly to the people,
participants in a high-level meeting said Thursday night.</P>
      <P>They were quoting Chen's remarks during a dinner party with
senior administration officials and influential figures from the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , including Vice President
Annette Lu, Premier Frank Hsieh, Presidential Office
Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun, DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang, DPP
lawmakers, DPP local government chiefs, and candidates for the
year-end mayoral and magistrate elections.</P>
      <P>President Chen also expressed the hope that all DPP legislators
will defend the reform priorities whenever the chance arises, the
participants said.</P>
      <P>The Six Reform Priorities are: financial reform, tax reform,
reform to change the preferential interest rates of 18 percent for
retired military personnel, civil servants and teachers, media
reform, investigation into properties inappropriately acquired by
political parties, and constitutional reform.</P>
      <P>Participants also quoted Premier Hsieh as saying that the
Executive Yuan will continue to defend its policies, adding that
although the public has been critical of his Cabinet, some of its
policies have won a positive response, such as the passing of the
first-phase constitutional reforms under which the nation will see a
dramatic change in the system for electing legislators and the
halving of the number of seats in the legislature, as well as a new
pension system for laborers.</P>
      <P>The government will continue pursuing the assets inappropriately
acquired by the Kuomintang (KMT) and working to prevent the KMT from
selling the assets and using the funds for campaigning for the
year-end elections, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the meeting, Vice President Lu said that she
regretted that meetings were only held after a flurry of scandals
such as the controversial insider stock trading scandal and the
Kaohsiung mass rapid transit construction project scandal, urging
party members not to underestimate the adverse impact of these
scandals on the party.</P>
      <P>"Reforms are good things, and they will never be too late, " Lu
was quoted by the participants as saying.</P>
      <P>Lu also expressed the hope that the DPP will take heed of the
KMT's three-stage strategy to sweep the DPP out of power, namely
winning the year-end elections, the Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral
elections in 2006, and the next presidential election in 2008.</P>
      <P>The vice president said she wants to see the communications
mechanism between the Presidential Office and the Executive Yuan and
the DPP improved, as well as to see legislators sharpen their
professional expertise.</P>
      <P>She also said that some of the reform priorities unveiled by
President Chen are old issues and that she wonders why they have yet
to be carried out.</P>
      <P>Lu also called for serious consideration of a Cabinet reshuffle
before or after the year-end elections. Neither the president nor
premier responded directly to the suggestion.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The year 2005 is a key one in the
development of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum as
it faces several unprecedented challenges both within and without the
region, Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) President David
S. Hong said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening of a symposium on "APEC Under Global
Change and Taiwan's Participation in APEC" hosted by the Chinese
Taipei APEC Research Center, Hong said that Taiwan must pay very
close attention to these factors and their impact on APEC's
development.</P>
      <P>Hong said that APEC has faced several unprecedented economic and
non-economic challenges over the last 10 months, including the
stagnation of the multilateral World Trade Organization talks, global
terrorism, the spread of epidemic diseases, and a string of natural
disasters, including tsunamis, typhoons and hurricanes.</P>
      <P>As a result, Hong said, APEC members have strengthened their
level of cooperation in dealing with problems both within and without
the region and have included more issues into APEC discussions.</P>
      <P>At the same time, APEC has continued to reform itself, adjusting
its administrative structure, distribution of tasks and missions,
financial management, as well as appropriation portfolio, Hong noted.</P>
      <P>More importantly, he pointed out, APEC is facing a serious threat
to its existence as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) integrates with China at an alarming pace.</P>
      <P>Noting that APEC is one of the most important channels for
reaching out to the world for Taiwan which faces a difficult
diplomatic situation due to Beijing's unrelenting suppression, Hong
said Taiwan should keep closely abreast of all the latest
developments in APEC.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, he said, Taiwan has actively participated in various
APEC activities over the past year, including sponsoring or taking
part in APEC meetings and seminars on development of small- and
medium-size enterprises and the information technology industry.</P>
      <P>"An important supporter of the APEC spirit and contributor to
APEC activities, Taiwan must maintain a high level of sensitivity
regarding APEC's position and functions and efficiently grasp all the
latest developments," Hong said.</P>
      <P>TIER is one of the major sponsors of the Chinese Taipei APEC
Research Center.</P>

      <P>The government's efforts to divert more of
its resources from northern Taiwan to the south over the past few
years has helped creat more balanced development in the country,
President Chen Shui-bian said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while presiding over the opening of a new
section of the Hsinchu-based Industrial Technology Research Institute
(ITRI), which is located in Liuchia in southern Tainan County.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that the ITRI has been the prime mover promoting
the upgrading and innovation of Taiwan industries since it was
established more than 30 years ago.</P>
      <P>The ITRI has assisted in the development of the information,
electronics, semiconductor, IC design and flat panel display
industries in the country, with 17 Taiwan products now claiming the
world's largest market share and 11 products ranking second or third,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to the president, industrial competition in the future
will not only involve lowering production costs but also boosting
innovation and research and development and creating value.</P>
      <P>The "2008 national development project" promoted by the
government in recent years is aimed at leading Taiwan industries to
advance toward global competition in the 21st century, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said that the ITRI's Tainan section will focus its research
and development on the themes of "digital life," "health and safety,"
and "green future" and serve as the fountainhead of industrial
innovations and development in southern Taiwan to enhance the
international competitiveness of Taiwan industries.</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes the ITRI will assist small- and medium-sized
businesses and traditional industries in southern Taiwan to map out a
new development model in addition to seeking breakthroughs in the
development of high-tech and high precision industries.</P>
      <P>The ITRI's Tainan section covers an area of 47 hectares and has
the capacity to accommodate 1,500 people. It comprises seven research
centers on networking and communications, micro/nano systems,

      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday that
adjusting the lineup of his Cabinet at this stage would lead to
problems, suggesting that the Cabinet should not be reshuffled if 
there isn't an urgent need to do so.</P>
      <P>Premier Hsieh noted that many of the current bills and budgets

      <P>Hsieh made the remarks during a legislative interpellation

      <P>Huang said that President Chen Shui-bian won re-election in 2004

    <HEADLINE>DPP PUSHES FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF ANTI-CORRUPTION COMMISSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Responding to President Chen Shui-bian's
recent calls for six reform priorities, leaders of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative caucus pushed for the
establishment of an independent anti-corruption commission Friday.</P>
      <P>Chao Yung-ching, DPP legislative party whip and William Lai, a
DPP legislative caucus secretary, both said that if the opposition is
resolved to unearthing the truth behind irregularities and corruption
scandals, they should support the establishment of an anti-corruption
commission, instead of continuously obstructing the passage of a bill
governing its establishment.</P>
      <P>Chao said the DPP legislative caucus fully supports Chen's
remarks made a day earlier that "the DPP pursues power simply for
promoting reform and the DPP should conduct self-examination."</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus called for the DPP nerve center to
move immediately to initiate the six reform priorities that Chen has
instructed, beginning with members of the DPP hierarchy averting
interest conflicts and investigations into whether DPP members have
exerted pressure on executives in public offices, Chao added.</P>
      <P>Lai ridiculed the opposition "pan blue alliance's" contradiction,
saying that while continuously revealing irregularities and
corruption scandals, the "pan blue" legislators have blocked the
passage of the bill governing the establishment of an anti-corruption
commission, flunking it at the legislative Rules Committee 74
consecutive times.</P>
      <P>The "pan blue" legislators have also refused to give their
consent to a name list of a new Control Yuan nominated by Chen for
nearly one year, Lai added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang said in Tainan, southern
Taiwan Friday that the DPP is not divided on Chen's directives and
will offer its full support.</P>
      <P>Su also called for Premier Frank Hsieh to help implement the
directives.</P>
      <P>Chen reaffirmed his commitment Thursday to materializing the "six
reform priorities" outlined in his Double Ten National Day message,
adding that if the reform projects are not completed as scheduled, he
will hold the relevant department heads responsible.</P>
      <P>The Six Reform Priorities are: financial reform; tax reform;
reform to change the preferential interest rates of 18 percent; media
reform; investigation into properties inappropriately seized by
political parties; and constitutional reform.</P>

the launch of service for a year until Oct. 31, 2006.</P>
      <P>The government recently told China Aviation Development
Foundation and CTCI (China Technical COnsultant, Inc.) Foundation,
both under its control, to chip in NT$7.5 billion to make up for the
capital shortfall for the project, incurring opposition criticism.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that if the government had not invested new money,
THSRC would not have been able to pay its bank loans and the building
work would have had to stop immediately, leading to a host of
disputes.</P>
      <P>Hsieh promised to step up government monitoring of government
shares in the high speed rail project by sending more representatives
to the corporation's board of directors and supervisors.</P>
      <P>THSRC was founded in 1998 by five prominent local business groups
-- Continental Engineering Corp., Evergreen Marine Corp. (Taiwan)
Ltd., Fubon Insurance Co., Ltd., Pacific Electric Wire &amp; Cable Co.,
Ltd. and Teco Electric &amp; Machinery Co., Ltd., and now has over 35,000
shareholders.</P>
      <P>The government has been participating in the private sector
project, currently the largest build-operate-transfer railway project
in the world, as outlined in the Statue for Encouragement of Private
Participation in Major Transportation Infrastructure Projects.</P>
      <P>In Feb. 2000, THSRC secured a total of NT$323 billion-worth of
credit by signing the Tripartite Agreement and the Credit Syndication
Contracts with a syndicate of 25 local banks, including the Chiao
Tung Bank, the Bank of Taiwan and the International Commercial Bank
of China.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 14 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A local alliance against domestic violence
unveiled Friday a proposal to amend the Domestic Violence Prevention
Act to expand the applicability of protective orders to cover victims
in a cohabitation relationship.</P>
      <P>Others to be covered by protective orders will include social
workers, clinical psychologists and educators, according to the
proposal put forth by the alliance, which comprises private groups
including the Modern Women's Foundation, the Taipei Awakening
Association and the Garden of Hope Foundation.</P>
      <P>Also, the alliance proposed changing the law to grant the police
the power to make non-warrant arrests on those who inflict violence.</P>
      <P>Lai Shu-ling from the Taipei Awakening Association said the
change will better protect victims because the police will be able to
make immediate arrests and issue warrants later.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, under the alliance's proposal, people who ignore a
court order requiring them to hand over the victim's children will
constitute a violation of protective orders.</P>
      <P>To help the victims achieve financial independence, the alliance
suggested that sheltering and employment services also be made
available to them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PANDA ISSUE BE TACKLED ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL PRECEDENT: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The issue of China's "gift" of pandas to
Taiwan should be solved in accordance with international norms and
the precedents of cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges, Premier Frank Hsieh
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Responding to opposition People First Party Legislator Shen
Chih-hui on whether the administration is prepared to give a green
light to Taiwan's acceptance of two pandas from China as a "gift, "
Hsieh said that the government has set no prerequisite on the issue.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that since both Taiwan and China are World Trade
Organization (WTO) members, he suggested that panda affairs be
tackled according to international and WTO norms, adding that "the
administration is taking the issue in stride."</P>
      <P>The panda story has been a hot topic in recent days as China's
selection of a pair of pandas to be sent to Taiwan is nearing the
final stage, with Taipei and Taichung cities competing to playing
host to the furry guests.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Council of Agriculture (COA) Chairman Lee Chin-lung
said that as pandas are protected animals, recipients must be
academic or research institutes or publicly or privately run zoos
according to regulations of the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) . This means the
delivery of the two pandas to Taiwan must come together with export
and import permits issued by CITES, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>He added that so far, only Taipei City Zoo has filed for an
import permit from the Taipei city government but the application has
yet to be referred to the COA.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on the issue, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairman Joseph Wu said the MAC will not spell out its "political
guidance, " at this moment since preliminary technical affairs
regarding the issue have not yet been resolved.</P>
      <P>Beijing first mentioned sending a pair of the endangered animals
to Taiwan as a so-called "goodwill gesture" following a visit to
China by former opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan in late
April.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO PLAN TO REPLACE APEC SUMMIT ENVOY: PRESIDENTIAL AIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng is a
good candidate to represent President Chen Shui-bian at this year's
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum summit and the
government has no plans to replace him, despite Beijing's opposition
to his attendance, a presidential aide said Friday.</P>
      <P>James Huang, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office,
said Chen's decision to send Wang to take part in the summit on his
behalf has gained support from the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
and that Beijing's suppression of Wang will only provoke resentment
among the people of Taiwan. Wang is a KMT heavyweight who once served
as KMT vice chairman.</P>
      <P>Huang blamed China for twisting history and the spirit of an APEC
memorandum of understanding (MOU) by making comments intended to
"mislead the international community."</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry bluntly opposed a
day earlier Wang's participation in the informal APEC leadership
meeting slated for mid-November in Busan, South Korea, citing an APEC
MOU stipulation that says Taiwan can only send officials in charge of
economic affairs to APEC-related activities.</P>
      <P>Based on the "routine" that Taiwan has practiced in compliance
with the rule, China is opposed to Wang's attendance as Chen's envoy,
the Beijing official said.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the Beijing official's view is contradictory to the
facts, Huang pointed out that Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
has represented Chen at the APEC summit three times, while the late
Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman C.F. Koo also has acted as an
APEC presidential envoy. Neither Lee nor Koo are or were responsible
for economic affairs, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>According to the presidential aide, the MOU only stipulates that
Taiwan cannot send its foreign minister to take part in APEC
ministerial-level meetings, and it also rules that Taiwan, Hong Kong
and China are entitled to participate in APEC activities on an equal
footing with the current APEC participants. He appealed to the South
Korean government to help Wang take part in the summit.</P>
      <P>With assistance from South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China
entered APEC in 1992 under a set of terms documented in the MOU that
was agreed upon by the three sides in 1991.</P>
      <P>One of the terms says that Taiwan "shall be represented at
ministerial meetings only by a minister or ministers in charge of
APEC-related economic affairs, while its "foreign minister" or "vice
foreign minister" shall not attend APEC meeting. Taiwan's delegation
may include officials of foreign and other ministries at or below the
level of department director.</P>

Lien Chan left Taipei for Shengyang, in northeastern China's Liaoning
Province, for a two-week visit Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-lin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of
China's State Council, as well as other Chinese officials, were
on hand at the Shengyang airport to greet Lien, his wife, children
and son-in-law.
</P>
      <P>Lien, now honorary KMT chairman and chairman of the
KMT-affiliated National Policy Foundation, is visiting Shengyang to
take part in a family gathering Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lien's 97-year-old mother, Chao Lan-kun, asked Lien to attend the
gathering on her behalf because she is not fit for long-distance
travel.</P>
      <P>The Liens will then proceed to Shangdong, Hunan and Sichuan
provinces before returning to Taiwan Oct. 28.</P>

April when he was still the KMT head before passing on the baton to
Ma Ying-jeou in August.</P>
      <P>Lien's first China trip was dubbed by the KMT as a "journey of
peace" that signified a major breakthrough in relations between the
KMT and the Communist Party of China (CPC) -- long-time rivals since
1949, when the KMT fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war to the
CPC. Lien met with Chinese President and CPC General Secretary Hu
Jintao during the trip.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>There is hardly anything the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) can do since Beijing voiced its opposition to
President Chen Shui-bian's decision to appoint Legislative Speaker
Wang Jing-pyng as his envoy at the informal leadership summit of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Busan, South Korea.</P>
      <P>KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen played down a report Friday that KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou will try to convince Beijing to withdraw their
opposition through the party's communication channels with the
Communist Party of China, saying there is little leeway for mediation
because Chen announced his decision in public Thursday without
testing the political water first.</P>
      <P>Citing a statement by Chang Jung-kung, director of the KMT's
Mainland Affairs Department, she said that "once the Chinese leaders
have made up their minds, even the gods cannot make them turn
around."</P>
      <P>After five years as president, Cheng said, the president really
should know better than to make a decision like this without
consulting the relevant parties first.</P>
      <P>Citing the president's bungling in 2001 when he named former Vice
President Li Yuan-zu as his envoy to the APEC summit in Shanghai only
to be rejected by China, which resulted in Taiwan's non-appearance,
Cheng said Chen obviously has not learned his lesson.</P>
      <P>The KMT spokeswoman said Taiwan cannot afford to miss the summit
in light of the fact that APEC is one of the few international
organizations to which Taiwan has access.</P>
      <P>It is widely known that Taiwan should consult with the United
States and win the understanding of Beijing about its envoy to the
summit, and while the KMT would like to help, Chen's unilateral
announcement of his decision has made it too late for any
negotiations, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that Taiwan has already locked horns with China on
this issue, Cheng said it would be impossible for her party to sort
it out easily.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S GERMANY REPRESENTATIVE PUSHES FOR OFFICE NAME-CHANGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Berlin,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Lin Yu-li and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's representative to
Germany said Thursday that he will strive during his term in office
to push for a name change for his office from the present "Taipei
Representative Office in Germany" to the "Taiwan Representative
Office in Germany."</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with CNA, Shieh Jhy-wey said that the
title "Taipei Representative Office " does not represent Taiwan.
Since using the name "Republic of China Representative Office" will
presumably not be accepted by the German government as Germany does
not recognize Taiwan, the use of "Taiwan Representative Office" is
the only pragmatic option, he added.</P>
      <P>Only by naming it the "Taiwan Representative Office" can the
interests of Taiwan's 23 million people be represented in Germany,
according to Shieh.</P>
      <P>Shieh, who obtained a PhD in German literature at the Ruhr
University in 1987, said he will start this effort himself,
describing himself on his name cards, letterheads or meetings as the
"Taiwan representative" instead of the head of the "Taipei
Representative Office."</P>
      <P>He noted that his office has received complaints from Taiwan
students in Germany complaining that their "country of origin" is
mistakenly changed to "China" when they file for visa extensions with
Germany's immigration authorities.</P>
      <P>He said he will write to all German offices responsible for
immigration affairs around Germany to inform them that Taiwan is not
a part of China and that Republic of China passport holders are from
Taiwan and not from China, to prevent any recurrence of the
"mistakes."</P>
      <P>Hsieh added that his pushing for a name change is not meant to
undermine Germany's relations with China, nor to challenge the "one
China" policy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 7th joint meeting between the Taiwan
and Paraguay business councils opened Friday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The meeting was held by the Taipei-based Chinese International
Economic Cooperation Association (CIECA) and Paraguay's Confederation
of Production, Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>The theme of this year's meeting is to examine how Taiwan
businesses can make use of Paraguay's industrial advantages to expand
their business opportunities in the Americas and to make Paraguay a
springboard for Taiwan businesses to advance into the vast South
American market.</P>
      <P>CIECA officials pointed out that there are 34 countries in North,
Central and South America with a combined population of approximately
500 million, and that the Americas are expected to become the world's
largest economy under a new free trade agreement framework.</P>
      <P>It will facilitate express marketing of Taiwan products to the
rest of the world if Taiwan businesses can make early access into
Paraguay -- the only South American nation to maintain diplomatic
relations with Taiwan, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the economic structures of Taiwan and Paraguay
complement each other very well, they said Paraguay's low production
costs and advantages in the Southern Common Market are a perfect
combination with Taiwan's experience, capital and technology.</P>
      <P>According to official statistics, bilateral trade between Taiwan
and Paraguay amounted to US$35.62 million between January and July
this year, up 34.99 percent compared with the same period of last
year.</P>
      <P>While exports to Paraguay rose 52.17 percent to US$32.43 million,
imports from Paraguay declined 37.21 percent to US$3.18 million.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The status of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum is not expected to be eclipsed by the
emerging regionism in Asia immediately, an economist said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chiang Chi-chen, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, said at a seminar that the trade complementary index
compiled by the World Bank in October, 2003, shows that the index
among the newly developed economies in Southeast Asia has increased
from 51.2 in 1985 to 67.3 in 2003, which indicates a greater growth
pace and a greater interdependence than that of the European Union
and the North American Free Trade Zone.</P>
      <P>Thanks to China's rapid economic growth, Chiang said, Southeast
Asia has transformed into a diversified and dynamic economic region,
which in turn has led to vociferous calls for the establishment of
trade blocs via free trade pacts, as well as the emergence of
regionism.</P>
      <P>The regionism that came along with the formation of trade blocs,
however, will not threaten APEC because of the wide variety of
culture, society and economic development among countries in the
region, as well as hostility between the countries, he said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Chiang claimed, no country in the region can provide
leadership for other countries in the region, which makes it
impossible for any trade blocs in this region to replace APEC in the
foreseeable future.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The public should be on guard against
China's relentless international boycotting of Taiwan, a ranking
official in charge of China policy said Friday.</P>
      <P>You Ying-lung, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) , made the remarks in the wake of vehement opposition by China
to President Chen Shui-bian's appointment of Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng to take part in the annual informal leadership meeting
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum on his behalf.</P>
      <P>China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said a day earlier that
according to a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed before Taiwan
joined APEC, Taiwan can only send its "minister in charge of
APEC-related economic affairs" to attend APEC activities, and that
since then, APEC "has operated on this basis."</P>
      <P>You pointed out the "conflicting nature" of Beijing's remarks,
saying that China has deliberately distorted the spirit of the
MOU to mislead the international community, noting that Academia
Sinica President Lee Yuan-tse, as well as the late chairman of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Koo Chen-fu have both served as
envoys to the summit meeting on half of the Republic of China head of
state.</P>
      <P>He said China has no reason to oppose Wang's attendance and that
he believes the international community will also not accept it if
Beijing continues to oppose Wang's participation.</P>
      <P>For this reason, he pointed out the double-handed approach of
Beijing since its enactment of the Anti-Session Law March 14. On one
hand, it has used pandas to try to woo the Taiwan people, while on
the diplomatic front, it has relentlessly stifled Taiwan's
maneuvering space.</P>
      <P>He said that the MAC will consider the panda issue from the angle
of professional and legal aspects, adding that China's use of the
issue for political maneuvering only complicates things.</P>
      <P>China, which first spoke of "giving" the endangered animals to
Taiwan after then-opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan's visit to
China in late April, is reported to have picked 11 pandas from which
to choose a pair to send to Taiwan in what it calls a "goodwill
gesture to the Taiwan people." A spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs
Office under China's State Council, also urged Taiwan to make
necessary preparations to facilitate their delivery.</P>
      <P>You reaffirmed the four conditions regarding acceptance of the
pandas: qualified organizations stipulated under the wildlife
conservation law should make the application to receive the animals;
the applicants must have good environment in which to keep them; the
delivery should conform to current legal regulations; and the views
of world wildlife protection groups and opinions must be respected.</P>
      <P>He also said qualified organizations must apply to the Council of
Agriculture and Forestry Bureau and that the handling process
will take at least four months. As far as he knows, Taipei Zoo, which
is keen on housing the pandas, has nowhere to keep them and is
stepping up construction of housing facilities.</P>
      <P>"I can't answer the question on when or whether the pandas can
come to Taiwan judging from the four conditions and related
developments," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC REITERATES NON-EXISTENCE OF '1992 CONSENSUS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 14 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official
dismissed an opposition Kuomintang (KMT) proposal Friday that Taiwan
and China resume dialogue based on the so-called "1992 consensus, "
saying that such a consensus never existed.</P>
      <P>According to MAC Vice Chairman You Ying-lung, the deadlock in
relations between Taiwan and China lies in the fact that Beijing
denies the existence of the Republic of China, refuses to renounce
the use of force to resolve cross-Taiwan Strait differences, and
rejects dialogue with the elected leader and government of the
Republic of China on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>You urged the KMT to identify the real problem in cross-strait
relations, instead of repeatedly asking the government to make the
"1992 consensus" the foundation of cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>You was referring to comments made by KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
during an interview with the Hong Kong-based Ming Pao daily.</P>
      <P>Ma said both sides of the Taiwan Strait should resume dialogue as
soon as possible based on the "1992 consensus, " which the KMT claims
was established between representatives of Taipei and Beijing in
landmark talks held in Hong Kong in 1992 during the former KMT
government.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the consensus means that the two sides are
allowed to maintain their respective interpretations of the meaning
of "one China."</P>
      <P>Differing from what the KMT says, Beijing claims that Taiwan and
China both agreed to the "one China" principle in 1992.</P>
      <P>In light of the differences displayed by the KMT and Beijing on
the issue, the current Democratic Progressive Party government has
argued that the "1992 consensus" means "no consensus" at all.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FILIPINOS COULD TEACH ENGLISH IN TAIWAN: PHILIPPINE LABOR MINISTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Emerson Lim and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Philippine Ministry of Labor and
Employment has suggested that Filipinos able to teach English should
be allowed to do so in Taiwan because of the shortage in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Citing sources from the labor affairs center at the Manila
Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei, a ranking ministry official
said Thursday that Taiwan's Ministry of Education will soon launch a
campaign to recruit qualified English teachers.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has hired many English teachers on a contract
basis from countries like Australia, Britain and Canada, the official
said that Taiwan still desperately needs English teachers.</P>
      <P>Starting salaries for English teachers from the Philippines would
be around NT$25,000 (US$750) per month, about half that of monthly
salaries offered to other English-speaking natives, he said.</P>
      <P>According to the official, Taiwan was the world's fifth-largest
overseas job market for Filipino workers for the first seven months
of this year. A total of 27,151 Filipinos headed for Taiwan to work
during the January-July period.</P>
      <P>Quoting statistics offered by the Philippine Overseas Employment
Administration under the labor ministry, he said that at least
170,000 Filipinos currently live in Taiwan -- some 154,000 of whom
are workers on contract, while 1,500 are legal immigrants.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
will hold a march Sunday in Kaohsiung in the hope of prodding the
government to take concrete measures to wipe out corruption, PFP
Policy Center Director Chang Hsien-yao said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang, who is also a legislator from Kaohsiung, made the
announcement at the Kaohsiung City Council, with various PFP
Kaohsiung city councilors backing the rally at a time when several
serious scandals allegedly related to the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) have erupted, involving the building of a</P>
      <P>mass rapid transit system in Kaohsiung -- Taiwan's second-largest
city where the DPP has long enjoyed firm support.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, as many as 63 percent of Kaohsiung citizens
are disgruntled with former Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, now premier,
according to the results of a PFP public opinion poll. Most of those
who answered the poll think Hsieh should take the blame for the
corruption allegations surrounding the project.</P>
      <P>Commenting on President Chen Shui-bian's call a day earlier for
the formation of an anti-corruption task force within the DPP to
probe the case, Chang criticized the approach as lacking genuine
resolve to find the truth and punish corrupt officials with ties to
the scandal, as the commission will not have any judicial powers.</P>
      <P>Chen must display wholehearted determination to deal with the
scandals to regain public confidence, he said, adding that thousands
of people are expected to show up for the demonstration.</P>

      <P>The disasters have also caused tremendous damage to the country's

      <P>In addition, the ROC government has offered US$300,000 in

    <HEADLINE>PROSECUTORS UNEARTH THAI WORKERS' PETITION THAT PREDATES AUGUST RIOT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecution authorities investigating
the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit (MRT) scandal have unearthed a
petition started by a Thai worker in April, long before Thai workers
rioted in protest against their inhumane treatment in August.</P>
      <P>The petition warned that if their ordeal continued and their
pleas for redress fell on deaf ears, as all their previous petitions
had, "What will happen if 1,500 people act in concert?"</P>
      <P>On Aug. 21, around 100 of the roughly 1,500 Thai workers living
in the dormitory rioted, triggering a political storm as authorities
have been forced to investigate what went wrong in the management of
the foreign workers and in the construction of the MRT system.</P>
      <P>The petition letter was found at a labor official's office. The
official, a section chief of the Bureau of Labor Affairs, evaded
media inquiries Friday.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Chung Chung-hsiao said he will question labor
officials concerning the petition to find out why it had been hidden
for so long.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an ad hoc group was formed Friday to monitor the
progress of the MRT construction and ensure its safety.</P>
      <P>The "Kaohsiung MRT Monitoring and Promotion Group" is made up of
seven experts and scholars and the group has the backing of acting
Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh Chu-lan, who encouraged the group to give their
professional recommendations freely.</P>
      <P>The city's senior technical advisor, Liao Ching-lung, will be the
leader of the group, with other members including Lin Jen-yi,
president of National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, and
professors Yang Ming-chien, Tseng Kuo-hung and Shen Mao-sung.</P>
      <P>Acting Mayor Yeh said Kaohsiung's MRT system has become the focus
of the nation's media since late August and everyone participating in
the project is under psychological pressure bordering on shame.</P>
      <P>How to keep Kaohsiung citizens informed of the progress of the
MRT project and ensure its quality and safety is the group's main
task, she added.</P>
      <P>She urged the members of the group to speak up on whatever
subject they think should be improved, adding she will accept their
views wholeheartedly.</P>
      <P>The group will focus on four areas: safety of construction,
mechanical and electronic systems, transportation and train stations.</P>
      <P>Yeh said she hopes the monitoring group will help the Kaohsiung
Rapid Transit Corp. successfully complete the project so that
Kaohsiung residents will soon enjoy a safe and comfortable rapid
transit system.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh will consider the
possibility of a partial Cabinet reshuffle after the Dec. 3
"three-in-one" elections, Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said Friday.</P>
      <P>Cho's remarks came a day after Vice President Annette Lu
suggested a partial Cabinet reshuffle during a meeting of influential
politicians from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
chaired by President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The DPP meeting took place amidst pressure from within the party
calling for a "new DPP movement" to clear the party's image, which
has been soiled by a series of scandals and disputes linked to
charges of corruption.</P>
      <P>Cho said now is not the best time for a Cabinet reshuffle as the
Legislative Yuan is screening the government's budget for the coming
year.</P>
      <P>"A changing of the guard in any government agency at this moment
would definitely affect that agency's budget screening. Therefore, we
believe it is more suitable to consider any personnel changes after
the year-end elections for mayors, magistrates, city and county
councilors and township chiefs," Cho said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun said
President Chen didn't respond to Lu's "Cabinet reshuffle" proposal
during Thursday's meeting.</P>
      <P>In his view, Yu said, he feels that no Cabinet personnel changes
should be made before the "three-in-one" elections.</P>
      <P>"Stability is the most important thing before the elections. A
stable environment is critical to ensure smooth proceedings of
various reforms and development projects," Yu said.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday he has no
intention of resigning.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks during a Legislative Yuan interpellation
session where opposition Kuomintang Legislator Su Chi asked Hsieh
whether he would step down after Vice President Annette Lu called for
a Cabinet reshuffle a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Lu's appeal came during a meeting of influential politicians of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) chaired by President
Chen Shui-bian. The DPP meeting took place amid pressure from within
the party calling for a "new DPP movement" to clear the party's
image, which has been soiled by a series of scandals and disputes
linked to charges of corruption.</P>
      <P>In response to Su's question, Hsieh said if he were to resign
now, detractors could dismiss it as a gesture of grandstanding or
even speculate that he resigned out of fear of exposing his role in
alleged scandals related to one of his pet projects during his tenure
as mayor of Kaohsiung -- the city's mass rapid transit system.</P>
      <P>At present, Hsieh said, the legislature is screening the central
government's 2006 budget bill. A changing of the guard in the Cabinet
would affect the budget screening, he said.</P>
      <P>In his view, Hsieh said, a comprehensive review is needed before
a Cabinet reshuffle. If the legislature passes bills regarding
restructuring of the Executive Yuan and the creation of a National
Communications Commission during its current session, a Cabinet
reshuffle may be inevitable.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Hsieh said it may be possible that the Cabinet is
reshuffled in the future in line with the principles of a coalition
government that he has been advocating.</P>
      <P>"Anyway, I must take into account my responsibilities, my own
conscience and life goals in determining when I should quit, " Hsieh
added.</P>

Friday that the warning by Beijing's top envoy in Ottawa to the
Canadian Parliament not to pass an act aimed at improving relations
between Taiwan and Canada represented bullying and was unwise.</P>
      <P>According to the editorial in the Calgary Herald, Chinese
Ambassador to Canada Lu Shumin warned Wednesday that passage of Bill
C-357 (the Taiwan Affairs Act) would undermine 35 years of diplomatic
attempts to foster trade between Canada and China.</P>
      <P>The bill, put forward by Member of Parliament Jim Abbott, is
aimed at providing a better framework for further economic, trade and
cultural exchanges and other initiatives between the people of Taiwan
and the people of Canada.</P>
      <P>Addressing a luncheon at the Canadian National Press Club
Wednesday, Lu not only warned against passing the act, but also said
that a change in Canada's "one China" policy would certainly affect
relations between the two countries as their diplomatic relationship
is based on a consensus on the Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>Canada switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing
in 1970.</P>
      <P>Criticizing Lu's remarks, the Calgary Herald editorial said that
although the bill introduced by a private member of the Canadian
Parliament is unlikely to go very far, "the belligerent reaction to
its mere introduction provoked in Beijing should be a salutary
reminder to Canadians of the kind of regime their government is
cultivating."</P>
      <P>"Surely, therefore, we can spare some vinegar for a regime whose
human rights record is among the worst in the world, whose justice
system evokes the show-trial world of Stalinism, and which routinely
persecutes Christian churches, as well as its own pacific cult, the
Falun Gong," it said.</P>
      <P>The editorial further said that the Canadian government's hope is
to help the country's businesses get a piece of what is promised to
be the world's largest market, adding however, that "if it is, it has
yet to deliver." It noted that "if Canada multiplies its exports to
China ten-fold in 10 years, they will still be worth less than
one-fifth of Canada's exports to the United States right now."</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Ottawa's biggest concession to Beijing has been
the acquiescing to its one-China policy, the editorial said that this
policy "treats Taiwan as a non-country, with no diplomatic presence
in Canada and its leaders barred from visiting and trade not
encouraged."</P>
      <P>"This leaves Canada in the invidious position of earnestly
courting a brutal dictatorship, while shunning an emerging liberal
democracy, " it said, adding that "for small reward, unless growing
imports of Chinese products to the detriment of Canadian competitors
is the desired policy end."</P>
      <P>"When Beijing's ambassador threatens Canada with serious
"consequences, " its time for Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin to
make the same kind of speech he recently made for an American
audience: Canada will not be pushed around," the editorial said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN GOVERNMENT URGED TO SUPPORT TAIWAN'S WHO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct. 14 (CNA)
(By S.K. Wu and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A medical professionals leader from Taiwan
expressed Friday the hope that Ottawa will comply with the resolution
passed by the Canadian Parliament in 2003 to support Taiwan's bid to
gain observer status in the World Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Wu Shui-min, chairman of the board of directors of the Foundation
of Medical Professionals Alliance in Taiwan, made the appeal while
meeting with local scholars and media representatives in a forum held
in Ottawa.</P>
      <P>While expressing his gratitude for the Canadian government and
people's assistance to Taiwan in public health matters, particularly
in the fight against the outbreak of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) in 2003, Wu said he hopes the Canadian government
will work to help Taiwan become an observer in the World Health
Assembly (WHA), the highest decision-making body of the WHO.</P>
      <P>The Canadian Parliament passed the resolution in support of
Taiwan's WHA bid in 2003 at the height of the SARS outbreak on the
island.</P>
      <P>Wu is currently heading a delegation of the foundation on a visit
to Canada to drum up support in the country for Taiwan's WHO bid.</P>
      <P>"Although helping Taiwan to gain WHO observer status is our
responsibility, China's continuous obstruction has prevented Taiwan
from gaining such status, " he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that disease knows no boundaries, Wu said that Taiwan's
exclusion from the WHO has prevented the island's 23 million people
from being able to receive international medical and health
assistance. "This is due to political factors and Beijing's
hindrance, which is unfair to the people of Taiwan," he added.</P>
      <P>Several of the Canadian scholars and media representatives at the
forum echoed Wu's appeal, saying that Taiwan has a basic right to
join the WHO as participation in the organization will allow the
Taiwan people to be able to share international medical and health
resources with other countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CGA SEIZES FOWLS SMUGGLED FROM CHINA IN TAICHUNG HARBOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Coast Guard Administration (CGA)
announced Saturday the seizure of some 1,500 fowls, rodents and
turtles aboard a Panama-registered cargo ship in Taichung Harbor,
central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tipped off recently that someone was attempting to use a cargo
ship to smuggle precious fowls and pets from China into Taiwan via
the third places, the coast guard went on high alert. They made the
seizure Friday night.</P>
      <P>In view of the recent reports of avian flu in Asia and Europe,
coast guard officials wore full protective gear when they
boarded the ship anchored at the No. 22 wharf in Taichung Harbor.</P>
      <P>Chen Xi, a Chinese second mate on the ship, admitted that he had
transported the fowls and other animals from Fuzhou, Fujian in
southeastern China. The ship had sailed around Japan's Ishigaki
Island before coming to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The case has been turned over to the Taichung Prosecutors'
Office. Chen has been charged with smuggling as well as with
violating wildlife conservation and prevention of infectious disease
from animals regulations.</P>
      <P>The CGA launched a drive in mid-August against Chinese fishing
vessels and ocean survey ships intruding into waters near Taiwan's
outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu. The operation is also
aimed at cracking down on smuggling, including human trafficking,
across the Taiwan Strait and preventing the possible spread of avian
flu into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CGA officials reported that the coast guard has chased 929
Chinese fishing vessels out of Taiwan waters and seized 1,489 kg of
catch from poachers over the past two months. They also seized 4,500
smuggled fowls aboard a ship in Kaohsiung Harbor in August.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS TO BE LINKED WITH ELECTIONS: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the introduction of a new system
requiring that proposed constitutional amendments be ratified through
referendum, the nationwide legislative elections are expected to be
the most likely occasion when a constitutional referendum will be
held in the future, an official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to a package of constitutional amendments adopted in
June, future constitutional amendment proposals will be put to
referendum after they have obtained the consent of at least
three-quarters of the legislators.</P>
      <P>In a referendum, the approval of more than half of all eligible
voters is required in order for any amendment to be considered
passed.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a seminar held by the Taiwan Foundation for
Democracy on the impact of the amendments, Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission Chairman Yeh Jiuun-rong said the high threshold
will make future constitutional reforms difficult.</P>
      <P>It will be "logical" for a constitutional referendum to be held
alongside a national-level election because otherwise, it will be
difficult to attract such a large number of voters to come out to the
polls, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Also, reforms covering multiple issues will be more likely than
those focusing on a single issue to accumulate the momentum required
to obtain the necessary number of votes in a referendum, he said.</P>
      <P>He predicted that there will likely only be a chance to amend the
Constitution once every three or four years at most in light of the
long process of agenda setting and discussion involved in
constitutional reform.</P>
      <P>He said that future reforms will be based on public consensus
achieved through extensive public discussion and participation, and
no longer dominated by political elites.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has unveiled a plan to promote a second
phase of reforms to give Taiwan a new constitution that is "timely,
relevant and viable" by the time he steps down in 2008.</P>
      <P>The next phase of reforms is expected to address issues such as
whether to change the country's political system to a presidential
system or parliamentary system; lowering the voting age from 20 to
18; and adopting a voluntary military service system.</P>
      <P>Officials have promised that they will not involve sensitive
issues such as changes to the country's status, territorial
boundaries or official designation.</P>
      <P>Also during the seminar, Academia Sinica research fellow Lin
Cheng-yi and National Sun Yat-sen University professor Lin Wen-cheng
said that when promoting the next phase of constitutional reforms,
Taiwan will need to communicate with and win the support of the
United States, besides watching the possible reaction of Beijing.</P>
      <P>They said it is completely reasonable for Taiwan to draw a new
constitution since the Republic of China Constitution currently
enforced in Taiwan was enacted in 1946 in China.</P>
      <P>However, if Taiwan seeks to promote a new constitution to
establish Taiwan's status as an independent sovereign state, Taipei
will almost certainly be subjected to heavy pressure from both
Beijing and Washington, they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO INCREASE STOCKPILES OF TAMIFLU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is planning to dramatically increase
its stockpiles of Tamiflu and other flu-fighting medicines in the
latter half of 2006, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the
Department of Health (DOH) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>CDC officials made the remarks amid reports that the global alarm
over the spread of avian flu has sent nations on a Tamiflu buying
spree. Tamiflu is considered the most effective medicine against the
flu, and the Roche, the manufacturer of Tamiflu, has increased its
production by nearly 10-fold over its 2003 level.</P>
      <P>According to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
estimates, up to 5.3 million people in Taiwan would be infected in a
major avian flu breakout, with 70,000 of that total having to be
hospitalized and more than 14,000 dying.</P>
      <P>The CDC officials said that Taiwan currently has 1.6 million
doses of Tamiflu, enough for 160,000 people, or 0.7 percent of the
total population. Taiwan's current stockpiles of Tamiflu would be
unable to meet needs in the event of an avian flu outbreak on the
island.</P>
      <P>The officials said that they are planning to boost Tamiflu
stockpiles to cover 4 percent of the total population in the second
half of 2006.</P>
      <P>In addition, the officials said that Relenza, which is
manufactured by British Glaxo Wellcome, is as effective as Tamiflu,
and that they will consider stockpiling some in the future.</P>
      <P>They said that their preparations have followed the World Health
Organization's suggestions, and that although Tamiflu and Relenza are
equally effective, the former, in capsule form, is more easily stored
and therefore a better option.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA SETS GOAL OF CUTTING AIR POLLUTION IN HALF IN 3 YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 14 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's environmental protection minister
said Saturday that his administration is determined to cut air
pollution in metropolitan areas around the island by half in three
years.</P>
      <P>Chang Kuo-lung, head of the Environmental Protection
Adminstration (EPA), announced the goal in his speech to participants
in the Ketagalan Institute's civil education program on the topic of
national leadership and development strategy on the first day of
classes.</P>
      <P>Noting that air pollution has resulted in one in three children
in Taiwan suffering from asthma or some other forms of respiratory
illness, the minister said he knows of no other country with such a
high ratio of asthma patients.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that air pollution is mainly caused by automobile
emissions, Chang blamed the high level of pollution on low gasoline
prices. He suggested that local people have never been taught to
value resources.</P>
      <P>Chang said the EPA has mapped out several strategies to reduce
emissions, including introducing liquefied gas to replace gasoline.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the minister also said that the negative effects of
environmental pollution have been clearly visible in Taiwan since at
least 1982 when cancer was listed as the No. 1 killer of Taiwanese
people. Since that time, cancer has remained at the top of the list.</P>
      <P>Describing how badly Taiwan is polluted, Chang cited soil
pollution as an example, noting that laboratory studies have put
Taiwan at the top of the list among industrialized countries around
the world in terms of dioxin contamination of soil.</P>
      <P>Dioxin is a highly poisonous hydrocarbon that occurs as an
impurity in some herbicides, defoliants and other chemical compounds,
and sometimes as a byproduct of incineration.</P>
      <P>Such contamination can be seen in many areas in the counties of
Taipei, Taoyuan and Taichung, and the problem has been expanding to
the counties of Changhua and Yunlin, he said.</P>
      <P>Besides dioxin, Chang noted, Taiwan's soil has also been poisoned
by mercury and other hazardous chemicals. "The situation is so
complicated that there is no easy way to solve the problem," he said.</P>

      <P>A three-day forum on legal aid opened in
Taipei Saturday, with 24 experts from 17 countries around the world
attending.</P>
      <P>The forum, organized by the Legal Assistance Foundation (LAF) ,
offers a conduit for local and foreign legal professionals to share
their experiences in legal aid to the disadvantaged, a foundation
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The LAF was established July 1, 2004 with funds from the Judicial
Yuan. The foundation has so far received more than 17,800
applications for legal aid, and 7,640 of them have been approved.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony, Judicial Yuan President Weng
Yueh-sheng said the legal aid system is aimed at assisting
disadvantaged people and foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>Noting that the legal aid system has only been in place in Taiwan

are welcome to offer their counseling to help Taiwan improve its
nascent system.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Alison Hannah, a legal aid
specialist from Britain, said lawyers are no longer the only source
of legal assistance in advanced countries. In New Zealand and Canada,

established to offer easy access to legal information via phone or
computer.</P>
      <P>Foreign legal experts from Germany, Britain, the United States,
Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and South Africa are among those
attending the forum. During the three-day gathering, they will report

      <P>A total of 10.5 percent of teenaged boys
and 18.7 percent of teenaged girls in Taiwan have thought about
committing suicide, according to the results of a survey released
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the psychiatry department of National

between 10 and 18 around the country. The students were asked if they
had thought about killing themselves at any time over the past month.</P>

respondents said they once attempted suicide, compared with just 0.34
percent of teenaged boys.</P>

teenage boys committed suicide than teenage girls did in 2004.</P>
      <P>Presenting the survey results during a seminar on depression

Chiu Yen-nan said that children suffering from depression usually
display symptoms such as refusing to eat, irritability and slow
development, and that they often are not able to verbally express
their emotional state.</P>

stock bonus worth more than NT$40 million (US$1.2 million) to the
nation's coffers as demanded by some "pan-green" legislators of the
DPP and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, could "pose
difficulties in practice."</P>
      <P>President Chen also reportedly said that Lin is not a greedy man
and that he has contributed a lot to the party's campaign funds.</P>
      <P>Department officials said that it was actually other participants
in the meeting who took the initiative to say that Lin is not greedy
and that he had assisted some in the party to solicit election
campaign donations. As for the issue of Lin's high salary and huge
stock bonus, it is in line with the current system, they added.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the president said that Lin has yet
to sell the stocks he received as a bonus and therefore could not
possibly have funneled the money to the DPP campaign fund.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the media report, DPP Legislator Jao
Yung-chin, one of the participants in the meeting, said that
President Chen had not claimed that returning the money Lin had
supposedly funneled to the DPP campaign fund "could pose difficulties
in practice."</P>
      <P>The president only said that "everyone knows the character of
Lin, and that he has in the past contributed a lot to the party. The
matter of the stock bonus should be viewed from the angle of system,"
according to Jao.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the legislative caucus of the main opposition
Kuomintang claimed Saturday that the government's representatives in
the listed companies are like sitting on "gold mines."</P>
      <P>They pointed out that nearly 20 chairmen or presidents who
represent the government in listed companies obtain more than NT$112
million per year in salaries. Among them, CSC Chairman Lin
concurrently holds 17 titles, including chairman of six companies,
while Lin Tzong-yeong, chairman of the International Commercial Bank
of China, concurrently holds 25 titles.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Pan Wei-kang asked Lin to explain whether he has
funnelled the money from his stock bonus to the DPP campaign fund,
adding that if he has and if the money cannot be returned to the
nation's coffers, then the move "is tantamount to sending the money
straight into party coffers."</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh attended an
aboriginal Fona Festival activity on Alishan, a mountain resort in
the southern county of Chiayi, Saturday to show his concern for the
well-being of the people of the Tsou tribe.</P>
      <P>Tsou is a relatively small tribe among Taiwan's aboriginal
groups. The tribe has traditionally populated in the Alishan area and 
now has slightly more than 3,000 members.</P>
      <P>Addressing a wedding ceremony for 12 Tsou tribal couples held in
connection with the Fona Festival, Hsieh said he looks forward to
seeing the Tsou population grow as fast as the number of foreign
tourists visiting Alishan.</P>
      <P>Fona, a creeping plant commonly seen in the mountainous area of
Alishan, is known as the "life bean" among members of the Tsou tribe
for its ability to grow in barren land.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he hopes the Tsou population grows and prospers. In
the past five years, only 45 babies have been born to Tsou people.</P>
      <P>Hsieh presented ocarina performances during a traditional

    <HEADLINE>CSC CHAIRMAN RESIGNS OVER STOCK BONUS CONTROVERSIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China Steel Corp. (CSC) Chairman Lin
Wen-yuan said Saturday he has decided to resign from his current post
with an aim to quell controversies surrounding the stock bonus he has
received as the company's chief executive officer (CEO).</P>
      <P>Lin also told a news conference held at the CSC's Taipei office
that he would donate all the stock bonus to charity organizations
after deducting taxes.</P>
      <P>Lin represents the government in the Kaohsiung-headquartered
steel company, which has been privatized but the government still
holds a controlling stake in the firm.</P>
      <P>Thanks to a steel industry boom in recent years, Lin has received
stock bonus worth more than NT$4,000 from the company's 2004
earnings.</P>
      <P>Critics, including lawmakers from both ruling and opposition
camps, have been pushing Lin to return the funds to national coffers.</P>
      <P>Lin said CSC has implemented a stock bonus system since it was
privatized in 1995. According to current regulations, remunerations
paid by the company to members of its board of directors and
supervisors belong to institutional investors, but stock bonus
belongs to individual directors or supervisors.</P>
      <P>Both of his two predecessors -- Wang Chung-yu and Kuo Yen-tu --
pocketed stock bonus in line with the corporate rules, Lin said,
adding that his stock bonus has become an issue mainly because the
amount is too fat.</P>
      <P>"The stock bonus generates from CSC's handsome earnings and a
steep rise in its share prices on the stock exchange," Lin explained.
He further said both of his two predecessors received 20.83 percent
of the total stock bonuses for commissioned CSC managers.</P>
      <P>"After I took CSC's helm, the ratio for CEO was cut to 20.14
percent in 2003 and further trimmed to 20.12 percent in 2004. In
terms of the ratio, I received less than my two predecessors. This
indicates that I have not tried to gain illicit profits," Lin said.</P>
      <P>During his three-year tenure as CSC chairman, Lin said he has
introduced a number of new ideas, concepts and systems.</P>
      <P>"Over the past three years, CSC has set a string of new records
in production, sales, revenues and profits. Some people may
attributed the achievements to a global steel boom. But I think I
deserve some credits judging from the facts that CSC has broken 27
records in steel production and its affiliates have all set new
records in sales and earnings," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lamenting that the enormous barrage of criticism over his stock
bonus in the past two weeks has overshadowed him and his family, Lin
said he has decided to quit to defend his personal dignity and
integrity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CSC WILL NOT LOSE ANYTHING FROM INVESTING IN HIGH-SPEED RAIL: LIN</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Outgoing China Steel Corp. (CSC) Chairman
Lin Wen-yuan said Saturday the company will not incurre any financial
losses from its investment in the high-speed railway project.</P>
      <P>"CSC has invested in preferred shares of Taiwan High-Speed Rail
Corp. (THSRC). This guarantees our gains from the investment, " Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lin said he feels regret that the high-speed
rail project, like the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit system, has been
stigmatized and scandalized for political reasons.</P>
      <P>As a civil engineer-turned-business executive, Lin said he is
fully aware that the high-speed railway's civil engineer work is
impeccable. Some opposition politicians have claimed that the rail
system's civil engineering work was defective and awful.</P>
      <P>Lin also defended CSC's investment in the problem-ridden Kaohsiung
MRT system, saying that the investment has a long historical
background. He didn't elaborate.</P>
      <P>CSC, which used to be a state-owned enterprise but was privatized
in 1995, holds a 31 percent stake in Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp.
(KRTC).</P>
      <P>KRTC has come under fire after an Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers
working for the project over unfair and unjust treatment by
management. Judicial authorities are investigating whether any
kickbacks or profiteering irregularities were involved in the
project.</P>
      <P>Lin said CSC will assume its responsibility if judicial
authorities find it should be held responsible.</P>
      <P>Lin announced his resignation from CSC chairmanship earlier in
the day to quell controversies surrounding the stock bonus he has

    <HEADLINE>NO DAMAGE REPORTED AFTER 7.0 QUAKE JOLTS N.E. TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>No casualties or damage were reported in
Taiwan as of Sunday morning after an earthquake with a magnitude of
7.0 on the open-ended Richter scale rattled northeastern Taiwan at
11: 51 p.m. the previous evening, according to the Central Weather
Bureau (CWB).</P>
      <P>Taiwan was spared from the major devastation that could have been
caused by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake because it was centered far out
to sea and deep -- with an epicenter around 185 km east of the
northeastern city of Keelung and an undersea depth of 181.4 km, said
Kuo Kai-wen, director of the CWB Seismology Center.</P>
      <P>The temblor was the strongest earthquake monitored in the Taiwan
area so far this year, equivalent to the energy released by the
explosion of 16 atomic bombs at once, according to Kuo.</P>
      <P>The quake was felt almost everywhere around the island. It had an
intensity of 3.0 in Ilan, Hualien and Taitung counties in eastern
Taiwan, Taichung County in central Taiwan and Miaoli County in
western Taiwan; 2.0 in Taipei, Taoyuan and Hsinchu counties in
northern Taiwan and Nantou County in central Taiwan; 1.0 in Keelung
City and Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>There was no danger of tsunamis because of the depth of the
quake, Kuo added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan sits on the Circum-Pacific Belt, which encompasses fault
lines stretching from the coast of Chile to California and around
through Japan and Taiwan. The belt is, along with the large European
Alpida Belt, responsible for 95 out of every 100 earthquakes that
occur around the world.</P>
      <P>Taiwan experienced its deadliest earthquake in five decades Sept.
21, 1999, when a 7.6 magnitude temblor struck central Taiwan, killing
2,415 people and injuring more than 10,000. It also caused tremendous
damage to property and infrastructure.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) will hold
a supra-ministerial exercise Oct. 19 in which customs, coast guard,
health, defense and transportation officials will take part in a
simulation of fighting an outbreak of avian flu, COA officials said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Participants in the exercise will simulate killing affected
birds, burying or burning the culled birds, and managing their own
health risks, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>As the highly infectious disease has been found in recent years
in Asia, Europe and the Americas, the COA said Taiwan must increase
its preparations against a possible flu epidemic caused by the H5N1
virus.</P>
      <P>Health experts have warned that if the virus mutates into a
strain that can jump to humans and become infectious among humans, it
could cause widespread chaos and heavy casualties.</P>
      <P>Some Asian countries have already reported cases of bird flu and
now is the season for migratory birds to pass through Taiwan in their
journey south, the officials said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>South Korea, the host of the 2005 informal
leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum, is expected to make its stance on Taiwan's representation at
the summit known Oct. 20, diplomatic sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon is expected to make
known the nation's position on whether it will accept Wang Jin-pyng,
speaker of Taiwan's Legislative Yuan, who has been named by President
Chen Shui-bian as his proxy at the summit to be held in Busan in
November, sources said.</P>
      <P>In line with long-established protocol, the 2005 APEC summit
organizing committee sent a special APEC envoy to Taipei in July to
forward an invitation to Chen.</P>
      <P>Yun Hai-Jung visited Taipei again Oct. 12 to meet with Chen to
put the final touches on Taiwan's presentation at the summit. Chen
reportedly told Yun during the meeting that he looked forward to
attending the summit meeting in the name of the leader of "Chinese
Taipei" -- Taiwan's official APEC designation.</P>
      <P>Wang's appointment turned into a controversial issue after
Beijing voiced its opposition, complaining that Taiwan can only be
represented at APEC-related activities by officials responsible for
economic affairs.</P>
      <P>APEC is one of the few international organizations that admit
both Taipei and Beijing. Because of Beijing's opposition, the
Republic of China's head of state has been unable to attend previous
APEC annual informal leadership meetings and has instead had to name
a proxy to attend on his behalf. Lee Yuan-tseh, Nobel laureate and
the president of nation's highest research institute Academia Sinica,
has represented Chen over the past few years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRIVATE ACTIVIST GROUPS OPPOSE CHINA'S PANDA GIFT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of social and environmental
activist groups voiced opposition Sunday to the idea of Taiwan
accepting two pandas that China is planning to give to Taiwan as a
"gift."</P>
      <P>The activists argued that only by allowing pandas to live and
reproduce in their natural, original habitat can the endangered
animals be protected.</P>
      <P>The activists, representing the Environment and Animal Society of
Taiwan (EAST) , the Society of Wildlife and Nature (SWAN) , the
Homemakers' Union and Foundation, the Humanistic Education Foundation
and the Peacetime Foundation of Taiwan, stressed that keeping pandas
in Taiwan would be counter to the ideals of wildlife protection.</P>
      <P>They said that if the Taiwan people indeed like pandas, they
should seek to adopt the animals by offering financial support while
allowing the animals to stay in their natural habitat.</P>
      <P>The Taipei city government has been making plans to house the
pandas in the city zoo, where a 5,500-square-foot enclosure will be
built for the pair with a donation of NT$200 million from the
Shinkong Group.</P>
      <P>But according to EAST President Chu Tseng-hung, China's panda
conservation authorities in Sichuan Province have expanded their
panda enclosure to a semi-open area in excess of 240,000 square feet,
while maintaining a semi-open environment for pandas requires only
about one-sixteenth of the cost of housing them indoors.</P>
      <P>SWAN Secretary-General Tsai Hui-ching suggested that if Taiwan
accepts the pandas, it should make sure the animals are kept in their
natural habitat in Sichuan and could send students or researchers
there to learn and monitor the animals.</P>
      <P>Beijing first mentioned sending a pair of the endangered animals
to Taiwan as a so-called "goodwill gesture" following a visit to
China by former opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan in late
April.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP PEACE BILL DESCRIBED AS ECHO OF BEIJING'S WILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ketagalan Institute Director Lee Hung-hsi
brushed aside Sunday a cross-Taiwan Strait peace promotion bill
proposed by the opposition People First Party (PFP) , saying that it
codifies Beijing's "one China" principle and echoes China's
will-to-power over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Commenting at a Ketagalan Institute forum on an upcoming showdown
at the Legislative Yuan over the bill, Lee said that a bill that
involves the Constitution and sovereignty should not be decided upon
solely by the legislature.</P>
      <P>Instead, Lee said, the issue should be tackled by all of the
people of Taiwan, promoted via a bottom-up approach.</P>
      <P>He said it is "simply wrong" that an opposition-dominated
legislature can control and manipulate a bill in such a way.</P>
      <P>Most importantly, Lee claimed, in the face of China's increasing
hostility toward Taiwan, it is unforgivably wrong that Taiwan's
legislators are trying to rein in Taiwan independence ideology via
legislation.</P>
      <P>You Ying-lung, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council, told the forum that even if the PFP version clears
the floor of the Legislative Yuan, it will not help solve the
cross-strait dispute and create peace.</P>
      <P>He added that the government is not opposed to the legislation of
a law aimed at promoting peace across the Taiwan Strait, but the
PFP-proposed bill is definitely not what the country wants.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LACK OF DRUGS, VACCINES TAIWAN'S ACHILLES HEEL IN FIGHTING AVIAN FLUBy S.C. ChangCNA Staff Reporter</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 16 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As the world prepares itself to battle an
avian flu epidemic, Taiwan is grappling with a lack of drugs and
vaccines and working hard to find solutions to the shortages.</P>
      <P>Before the solutions can be reached, the government is adopting a
"four-cordons" defense strategy to keep the much-feared H5N1 virus
and its possible mutations from entering the country -- stopping it
offshore, at customs, in communities, and within the health care
system.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health said it has stockpiled only 160,000
doses of Tamiflu, a drug seen to be effective against H5N1, far short
of the 5 million that it estimates the country needs to fight a bird
flu outbreak.</P>
      <P>As the patent owner of Tamiflu, Roche Holding AG, is not yet
ready to release the patent to the World Health Organization (WHO) ,
the government must resolve the patent issue before the National
Health Research Institute (NHRI) , which has the technology to make
Tamiflu, can help local drug manufacturers mass produce the drug.</P>
      <P>Officials said that acquiring and stockpiling Tamiflu is not
Taiwan's problem alone; many countries have asked the WHO to persuade
Roche into giving up the patent. Roche is willing only to "donate" a
certain amount of the drug to the WHO, they said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan could go ahead with producing Tamiflu before getting a
permit to do so. Taiwan could also follow its own stockpiling action
by negotiating terms of compensation to the patent owner. At the same
time, the DOH is looking to buy another anti-flu drug called Relenza,
which is more expensive than Tamiflu.</P>
      <P>A DOH official said Taiwan cannot reply on just one or two drugs
to fight avian flu. "We will revise our stockpiling policy as we see
fit, " said Lin Ting, deputy director of the Center for Disease
Control under DOH.</P>
      <P>Another way of fighting a bird flu epidemic is to vaccinate the
population. Taiwan needs 4 million flu vaccines every year. Last
month, Europe's largest drug manufacturer, Sanofi-Aventis, indicated
to Taiwan that it had signed a contract with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to invest US$100 million in producing avian flu
vaccine.</P>
      <P>The company's Taiwan branch said the vaccine that Sanofi-Aventis
is aiming to produce has been tested on 400 people for preventing
H5N1 infection, with good results.</P>
      <P>As of the end of September, only two drug makers in the world had
announced a successful testing of anti-avian flu vaccine. But neither
of them have a large-scale human testing report, and even if their
R&amp;D proves effective, Taiwan would have to vie with a host of other
countries waiting to buy the new product.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Taiwan should set up its own vaccine-producing
facilities to avoid over-dependency on other countries, health
officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's research institutes have been cooperating with foreign
partners in the study of H5N1 vaccines. For instance, the NHRI is in
the preliminary stage of building a vaccine plant, while the DOH
Center for Disease Control is planning to match domestic and foreign
drug makers in joint-venture projects to mass produce vaccines in
Taiwan starting in 2010.</P>
      <P>Lin Lung-tsan, bio-medical research project manager at the
Institute of Industrial Research, said setting up a production
facility in Taiwan would be best for national security, as foreign
manufacturers, out of market consideration, might not make their
vaccines exclusively for fighting the virus strains hitting Asian
countries.</P>
      <P>As the weather is gradually turning colder and migratory birds
are flying to Taiwan on their journey south, health authorities are
reminding people to maintain good hygiene, such as washing hands,
avoiding uncooked meat and eggs and wearing masks in public places.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP: PEACE BILL WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE TO MONITOR CROSS-STRAIT POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In response to ruling camp criticism of the
opposition People First Party's (PFP's) cross-Taiwan Strait peace
promotion bill, PFP spokesman Hsieh Kung-ping said the bill is aimed
at speeding up peaceful interaction between the two sides of the
strait and enabling Taiwan's people to monitor cross-strait policy.</P>
      <P>Hsieh accused the DPP of "smearing" the PFP bill in an attempt to
divert the public's attention from the ruling party's scandal-ridden
administrative record.</P>
      <P>He said the bill contains a proposal for setting up a
peace-promotion committee staffed with ruling and opposition members,
an idea that was originally put forward by President Chen Shui-bian
himself.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang said the PFP has been acting in
concert with Beijing's "three-step" strategy to assimilate Taiwan --
first, legislating the Anti-Secession Law; then, inviting Kuomintang
and PFP leaders to visit China; and seeing the PFP propose its
peace-promotion bill.</P>
      <P>The PFP bill completes China's "three-step strategy" to swallow
Taiwan, Su said, warning that if the bill is passed, Taiwan will
never be a sovereign country.</P>
      <P>According to Su, accepting China's "one China" principle and its
version of the so-called 1992 consensus, as proposed in the PFP bill,
would mean that Taiwan would become a special administrative region
of China like Hong Kong, something that no-one is willing to accept
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the 1992 consensus and "four-noes policy" have been
reiterated time and again by the DPP government and its predecessor,
the KMT government, and that he does not understand why the DPP keeps
distorting these two policy goals.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the PFP is willing to negotiate with all other
parties on the details of the bill in order to reach a consensus, but
said the time has already passed for such negotiations, so that PFP
must insist on pushing the bill through the legislature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEGOTIATIONS TO BE HELD ON NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
will chair negotiations among the political parties Monday on a
controversial bill that has pitted the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party against the bill's authors, the opposition Kuomintang and the
People First Party.</P>
      <P>The sticking point in the bill, which calls for the establishment
of a national communications commission, is the appointment of the
members of the proposed commission. The opposition insists that the
members should be named by the various political parties in the
legislature in proportion to the number of seats they hold in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>However, the DPP believes the members should be chosen and named
by the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan, the whip of the KMT legislative
caucus, claimed Sunday that giving political parties a say in
choosing the commission's members would keep it independent of the
ruling party's manipulation.</P>
      <P>An independent communications commission charged with regulating
the country's media is vital to keeping the government from meddling
with the media and to ensuring the freedom of the press, the KMT
lawmaker claimed.</P>
      <P>However, Tseng said his party would like to hear the DPP's
opinions about how to sort out the differences between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The DPP, which has twice blocked a showdown vote on the bill in
the legislature by violence, said it will offer in Monday's
negotiations to have the members chosen jointly by the Executive Yuan
and the legislature rather than by the Executive Yuan alone.</P>
      <P>Dismissing the DPP's offer as nothing new, PFP legislator Sun
Ta-chien said the ruling party should promise not to resort to
violence in the legislature before any meaningful negotiations can
take place.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With one-and-a-half months to go before the
year-end elections of county and city chiefs, county and city
councilors and chiefs of rural townships, many election aspirants
started their election campaigns Sunday, well ahead of the legal
period when they are allowed to do so.</P>
      <P>Teng Tien-you, a spokesman of the Central Election Commission
(CEC), said Sunday that local governments should restrict candidates'
campaigns until the legal period, which according to the Public
Officials Election and Recall Law, is 10 days before the elections.</P>
      <P>As the candidates' campaign rallies, billboards, and campaign
trucks are already common around the island, Teng said violators can
be fined according to the law concerning noise, advertising
billboards and parades and rallies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile the CEC unveiled Sunday an amendment to the existing
laws to allow televised debates among candidates for county and city
chiefs, if two-thirds of the candidates in the same constituency
agree to it, although some constituencies had already staged such
debates Sunday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROSPECTS DIM FOR LOW-INCOME FAMILIES: YOUTH COMMISSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Children of low-income families have fewer
opportunities to get education, and poor education in turn leads to
poorer-paying jobs or even keeps them from getting jobs, making the
prospects for them to get out of poverty dimmer and dimmer, according
to the National Youth Commission.</P>
      <P>The commission quoted a Ministry of the Interior survey as
showing that 31.9 percent of people aged 15 or above with high school
or higher education come from low-income families, while 58.2 percent
are from other families, indicating that there is room for improving
education opportunities for members of low-income families.</P>
      <P>It quoted another survey as showing that 74.3 percent of people
aged 15 or higher in low-income families are not working, much higher
than the 45 percent in other families. The survey also shows that 30
percent of low-income families are single-parent.</P>
      <P>The commission said the gap between rich and poor in Taiwan has
been widening in recent years, as has the gap of education
opportunities and resources, making it ever more difficult for the
poor to get out of poverty.</P>
      <P>Some social groups blamed the government's high tuition policy
for widening the rich-poor gap. They cited government statistics as
saying that over the past 10 years, tuition for public and private
universities has risen 70 percent and 20 percent respectively while
the overall consumer price index has gone up only 10 percent.</P>
      <P>Lin Po-yi, a graduate student of social science at National
Chengchi University, said tuition has been rising faster than
children of poor families can ever hope to catch up.</P>
      <P>He quoted Taipei City government figures as reporting that in
August, pawnshops lent out a total of NT$227 million, more than any
other month, with the average loan at NT$50,000 to NT$60,000,
"precisely the amount for paying university tuition."</P>
      <P>Moreover, he pointed out, children of poor families often have to
work through the university years, knowing that without a university
degree it will be difficult for them to find jobs.</P>
      <P>Lee Chun-ta, a philosophy major of Soochow University, said he
uses up his NT$50,000 student loan every semester, accumulating a
debt of NT$500,000 before graduating; and to make his own living, he
has to work 100 hours a month in order to earn a wage of NT$10,000.</P>
      <P>Lin and Lee, attending a seminar on high tuition and the
declining value of degrees, said education supposedly will give poor
people a chance to improve their fortunes, and yet they are being
burdened by the high cost of higher education.</P>
      <P>The participants quoted government statistics as pointing out
that 7,129 college and university students asked for a long leave of
absence on economic grounds in academic year 2003, up from 2,664 in
1998.</P>
      <P>They further cited Ministry of Education figures as saying that
in 1993, the government spent an average of NT$200,500 on each
university student, but the amount fell 26 percent to NT$150,000 in
2002.</P>
      <P>This means that while uinversities are charging sutdents higher
tuition than ever, the educational resources they are getting in
return are shrinking, they said.</P>
      <P>If the Ministry of Education does not figure out ways to
re-allocate resources, the rich will get richer and the poor will
simply copy poverty generation after generation, they claimed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP PANNED FOR OBLIGING PARTY PUBLIC OFFICIALS TO DONATE TO IT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) was lambasted by opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Sunday for
obliging party public office holders to give a part of their income
to the party as its war chest for campaigns.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Pan Wei-kang claimed the DPP's practice of forcing
public office holders to contribute to its campaign funds is running
against the law governing the political donations, and provides the
DPP a chance to line its pocket with the government funds.</P>
      <P>Pan made the comment after Lin Wen-yuan, the DPP-appointed
chairman of the China Steel Corporation, caused an alarm after
newspaper reports said he earned about 1.6 million shares of his
company as bonus-- with a market price of about NT$40 million--
during his three-year in office.</P>
      <P>Lin quit his job and donated his bonus to charity Saturday three
days after 93 lawmakers, mainly from the DPP, asked him to return the
bonus. These lawmakers claimed that as a chairman who owed his post
to the government, Lin is not entitled to the bonus meant to reward
the professional managers.</P>
      <P>Before Lin gave up his post, news reports said Lin had difficult
returning his bonus because part of it has already been diverted to
the DPP as political donations according to a DPP mechanism which
forces DPP public office holders to share the party's expense.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Joanna Lei said the DPP is sponging on the
government through officials appointed by it for political purposes.</P>
      <P>Independent Legislator Chiu Yi claimed Lin is not the only one
who share his income with the party, Chen Min-hsien, the former vice
chairman of Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corporation who quit because of
financial scandal is also suspected of giving political donations to
DPP in exchange for government's preference in awarding contracts,
and the DPP owes the public an explanation.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Oct 16 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Taiwan poets and song writers
gathered at a fortification in Kuningtou, where the Nationalist and
Communist troops massacred each other in the 1950s, to send their
anti-war messages to people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Hu Teh-fu, Lin Huan-chang, Kuan Kuan, Pai Ling and others read
their poems and sang songs of peace in the event dubbed "the crossing
of thunder and buds, " part of the 2005 Kinmen Cultural and Arts
Festival activities.</P>
      <P>Facing Xiamen, China, Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng said
10 years ago, he had to travel 2,000 km via Hong Kong or Macao to
visit the Chinese city which is but 10 km away.</P>
      <P>Now, he needs just to take a boat under the government's "mini-
three links" program to travel to Xiamen, he said, adding that the
triangular fort that used to see ROC-PRC confrontations has been
turned into an arts exhibition ground.</P>
      <P>Song writer Hu Teh-fu, a Pei-nan tribe aboriginal, said his wife
Mo Wa is from the Pu-nong tribe, which had been in war with Pei-nan
for more than 200 years before both tribes finally learned to live in
peace.</P>
      <P>"So the tens of years of military confrontation between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait is nothing compared with the long history
of war between the two aboriginal tribes. The Han Chinese should
learn from Taiwan's aborigines as to how to live in peace together, "
Hu said.</P>
      <P>The Hu couple sang a number of native-language songs and U.S.
anti-war song "Where Have All the Flowers Gone" to express their
wishes for peace.</P>
      <P>Some of the poets had served as soldiers on the "front-line"
islets, writing poems commemorating their life and thoughts during
that time, poems that they read aloud to share with the audience and
the people on both sides of the Strait Sunday.</P>
      <P>The poems included Lin Huan Chang's "Waiting, " Pai Ling's "The
Drowning Line near the Triangular Fort, " Kuan Kuan's "A Pear Tree

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian made a pitch
Sunday for the six reforms spelled out in his National Day address on
Oct. 10, and defended his administration which was dogged by scandals
recently.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a cable TV station, the SETTV, the president
took pains to defend Lin Wen-yuan, who was named by Chen's
administration as the Chairman of the China Steel Corporation three
years ago but quit the previous day after being criticized for taking
huge bonus from the corporation.</P>
      <P>The president said it is the practice which rewards generously
the executives of corporations which should be blamed, not Lin
himself.</P>
      <P>The president also defended his former adviser Chen Che-nan who
was embroiled in the scandal surrounding the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit
Corporation, saying Chen gave up his post as his adviser at the hint
of the president's aide.</P>
      <P>The president said his administration examines its officials by
the highest moral standards.</P>
      <P>He also took pains to explain the necessity for the six reforms,
namely the financial reform, tax reform, reform to change the
preferential interest rates for retired government officials, media
reform, investigation into properties inappropriately seized by
political parties, and constitutional reform.</P>
      <P>As to the financial reform which was criticized for letting a few
business groups to take over the state-run banks, the president urged
the public to respect the principle of laissez-faire.</P>
      <P>In order to highlight his determination to press ahead of the
financial reform, the president said any member of his ruling team
who is not confident of carrying out the reform should quit.</P>
      <P>Chen took a jab at the opposition which initiated a controversial

      <P>"I hope that Taiwan and E.U. nations can better their
understanding and opportunities of further cooperation in the future
through direct contact, " he said.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, about 40 percent of all the research projects
jointly proposed by Taiwan and E.U. member states have been accepted
by the E.U. headquarters, which he said is much higher than the
headquarters' average acceptance rate of 19 percent for other
projects.</P>
      <P>"This is why many E.U. members now would like to cooperate with
Taiwan," he added.</P>
      <P>Even though Taiwan cannot gain any subsidies from the E.U.
authorities if joint projects put forward by the island and its E.U.
partners are accepted, Taiwan's development in science and technology
can make strong and rapid progress through international cooperation,
and that's why the ROC government has actively worked on pushing the
internationalization of the country's research in science and
technology.</P>
      <P>He further said that despite the fact that Taiwan has only had
minor cooperation with Italy in science and technology in past years,
the great achievement of the Italians in creative design and the
remarkable performance of Taiwan in creativity as well as in research
and development, particularly in the information technology sector,
will "surely provide a huge amount of room for the two countries to
cooperate."</P>
      <P>In Milan, Hsieh and members of the delegation will meet with
members of the local science and technology community in a
workshop set to be held Monday at Politechnic University of
Milan. They will also visit the design college of the university
before heading to Poland later the same day.</P>
      <P>Italy is the fourth leg of Shieh and his delegation's current
tour in Europe, which has already taken them to Britain, Belgium and
Spain.</P>
      <P>Shieh said that a cooperation project between Taiwan and Spain is
expected to be completed within the coming one or two months and that
Taiwan's Representative Office in Poland is also expected to set up a
science and technology division at the end of this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Coast Guard Administration (CGA) has
tightened border controls aimed at barring the entrance of smuggled
poultry and meat to try to prevent the spread of avian flu to Taiwan
as the world prepares to battle a possible bird flu pandemic, CGA
officials reported Monday.</P>
      <P>The CGA is also preparing to activate an anti-bird flu
contingency plan based on a "four-cordons" defense strategy mapped
out by the Council of Agriculture (COA) to keep the much-feared H5N1
strain of the virus and any possible mutations from entering the
country -- stopping it offshore, at customs, in communities, and
within the health care system.</P>
      <P>The "four-cordons" defense strategy is a set of measures similar
to those adopted in the country two years ago during the severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Taiwan and neighboring
countries, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Members of the front-line coast guard force have been instructed
with health and quarantine protection tips and are ready to further
strengthen controls against smuggling, CGA officials said.</P>
      <P>Experts from the COA Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection
and Quarantine have given lectures to the CGA patrollers on
quarantine efforts and how to bolster their own protection during
patrolling missions.</P>
      <P>The deadly H5N1 strain has decimated flocks around Asia and
killed dozens of people. Authorities around the world fear it could

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is planning to initiate an
anti-avian flu medication development project during the upcoming
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum meetings, Vice
Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael Ying-mao Kau said Monday.</P>
      <P>A series of APEC meetings, including an informal leadership
summit, is scheduled to be held in South Korea's second largest city
of Busan in November. The prevention and control of bird flu is
expected to be one of the major issues to be tackled during the APEC
meetings.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Kau said that Taiwan
is aiming to propose that distribution of anti-bird flu medication
and development of such medication, including the development of bird
flu vaccines, can be promoted via the APEC mechanism.</P>
      <P>Kau said that APEC has perceived the gravity of a possible global
pandemic of bird flu and believes that the development of bird flu
vaccines is a pressing issue. Against this backdrop, Kau said, Taiwan
should propose that a bird flu vaccine development plan be initiated
by selected APEC countries which have ready and commendable medical
research strength, such as Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kau pointed out, however, that since the development of bird flu
vaccines will be a costly and painstaking task which will require the
concerted efforts of several nations, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
is currently contacting Japan, South Korea and the United States
about the plan in the hopes that bird flu vaccine development project
can be initiated jointly by these countries.</P>

stock he earned in bonuses from the company, the premier said it is
the established practice of offering such generous rewards to the

    <HEADLINE>DOH COULD PRODUCE FLU DRUG LOCALLY IN PANDEMIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) has
contingency plans to help Taiwan secure enough medication against a
possible pandemic of avian flu, a health department official said
Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the World Health Organization (WHO) , "Vaccines
effective against a pandemic virus are not yet available. Vaccines
are produced each year for seasonal influenza but will not protect
against pandemic influenza. Although a vaccine against the H5N1 virus
is under development in several countries, no vaccine is ready for
commercial production and no vaccines are expected to be widely
available until several months after the start of a pandemic."</P>
      <P>However, the seasonal flu drug commercially known as "Tamiflu, "
could improve the survival prospects of persons infected with the
H5N1 virus, if it is administered in a timely fashion, according to
the WHO.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, Liao Chi-chou, director of the DOH Bureau of
Pharmaceutical Affairs, said Taiwan's health department has earmarked
NT$400 million (US$11. 97 million) to be used next year to purchase
Tamiflu and materials, should a pandemic occur. Half of the money
will go toward buying Tamiflu from its manufacturer, the Swiss
pharmaceutical giant Roche, and half will be used to purchase raw
materials from the company to produce the drug in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the world gears up to battle a possible bird flu pandemic,
Taiwan is grappling with a lack of drugs and vaccines and working
hard to find solutions to the shortages, he said.</P>
      <P>The health department has contracted the Taiwan Clinical Pharmacy
Association to provide training courses to local pharmacies around
the country, including those on outlying islands, to enable them to
know how to formulate the drug before the end of the year, Liao
noted.</P>
      <P>Health department authorities said Sunday that they have
stockpiled only 160, 000 doses of Tamiflu, far short of the five
million that it estimates the country would need to fight a bird flu
pandemic.</P>
      <P>As the weather is gradually turning colder and migratory birds
are flying to Taiwan to overwinter, health authorities are reminding
people to maintain good hygiene, such as washing their hands and
avoiding uncooked meat and eggs.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition lawmakers on Monday dismissed as
political rhetoric President Chen Shui-bian's offer the previous
night to give up his executive immunity and to subject himself to
judicial investigation if there is evidence suggesting he was
involved in the mushrooming scandal around the Kaohsiung Rapid
Transit Corporation (KRTC).</P>
      <P>Cheng Li-wen, a spokeswoman for the opposition Kuomintang, said
the president's immunity from judicial investigation is provided in
the Constitution and cannot be waived, and any university freshman
who has studied the Constitution would know this.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the prosecutors would break the Constitution by
investigating the president for any crime other than rebellion or
treason.</P>
      <P>Chen's offer to give up his immunity, made in an interview with a
local cable TV station, is political rhetoric intended to pull the
wool over the eyes of people who don't know the contents of the
Constitution, the spokeswoman said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Sun Ta-chian from the opposition People First Party
said Chen's offer highlighted the president's intention to stop
speculation about his role in the scandal rather than his
determination to mend his ways, but "it is doomed to be useless."</P>
      <P>Chen's statement won't help clear the image of himself and his
party, Sun claimed.</P>
      <P>Annoyed by speculation suggesting his role in the KRTC scandal,
the president said last night that he has recommended that the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party form a commission to look into
corruption allegations regarding any party members.</P>
      <P>The president said he would step down if he were found to be
involved in the case despite his executive immunity.</P>
      <P>However, the country's prosecutor-general, Wu Ying-chao, told the
legislature Monday morning that the president's constitutional right
cannot be waived, adding that the president's statement was meant to
give a free hand to prosecutors investigating the KRTC scandal.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several opposition lawmakers on Monday
asked the Ministry of National Defense (MND) to investigate a
high-ranking military official's remarks that apparently violated the
military's stance of remaining politically neutral over the arms
purchase plan.</P>
      <P>At a session of the legislature's National Defense Committee,
several opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP)
lawmakers expressed their concern over a recent appeal made by Lt.
Gen. Chen Kuo-hsiang, director of the Political Warfare Department of
the MND's Armed Forces Reserve Command, calling for the public to
vote for those in support of the MND's arms purchase package from the
United States in the year-end, three-in-one elections.</P>
      <P>High on the MND's arms procurement list are eight diesel-electric
submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries and a squadron
of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the U.S.</P>
      <P>It was said that Chen, who was upset about the arms procurement
budget's being stalled in the legislature by the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" for more than a year, urged the public to vote for those
candidates who are in support of the arms deal, and turn away from
those who are against it, in a seminar held recently.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Ting Shou-chung said that Chen's remarks
apparently violated the National Defense Law by politicizing the arms
purchase question.</P>
      <P>Although Chen said his remarks were just "personal opinion, " PFP
Legislator Lin Yu-fang insisted that military personnel should not be
involved in political issues.</P>
      <P>In response, Vice Chief of the General Staff Tseng Chin-ling said
he was not well informed of Chen's remarks, but added that Minister
of National Defense Lee Jye has promised to look into the matter.</P>
      <P>However, Tseng said if this was what Chen actually said, his
comment were "inappropriate and unnecessary."</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC is prepared to donate over US$8
million to help its diplomatic ally El Salvador build a vocational
training center, an economics official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The three-year plan is part of the "Rong Bang co-prosperity
project" announced by President Chen Shui-bian during the fifth
ROC-Central American leadership meeting in Nicaragua in late
September.</P>
      <P>The planned vocational training center will be built in a planned
industrial park -- the "Taiwan Park in El Salvador" initiated by the
ROC government to encourage Taiwanese businesses to invest in El
Salvador.</P>
      <P>The minister of the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD), Hu Sheng-cheng, doubles as the executive director of the team
in charge of the establishment of the industrial park, while the
Council of Labor Affairs has been assigned to build the vocational
center.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD, the construction of the vocational center
is divided into two stages, with work on the first stage to center on
facility planning and market surveys. In the second stage, efforts
will be made on facility construction and the establishment of a set
of training systems and standards.</P>
      <P>The training center is aimed at assisting El Salvador to
integrate its need for professional industrial manpower with the

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER MAKES SUGGESTION TO SORT OUT DIFFICULTIES OVER APEC ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the opposition Kuomintang
suggested Monday that Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng serve as
a senior adviser to President Chen Shui-bian to help sort out
difficulties in attending the informal leadership summit of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in South Korea.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator John Chiang made the remarks during a legislative
committee meeting in which Vice Foreign Minister Michael Y.M. Kau and
MOFA-affiliated International Cooperation and Development Fund
Secretary-General Chen Cheng-chung reported on the implementation of
MOFA's foreign aid budget.</P>
      <P>Chiang inquired about South Korea's response toward
President's Chen's announcement last week that Wang will serve as his
envoy to attend the APEC summit meeting. China has voiced vehement
opposition to Wang's assignment, saying that according to a
memorandum of understanding signed in 1992 before Taiwan -- formally
designated in APEC as Chinese Taipei -- joined the organization,
Taiwan can only send its "minister in charge of APEC-related economic
affairs" to attend the meeting, and that since then, APEC "has
operated on this basis."</P>
      <P>Kau said that response from South Korea on Wang is negative,
showing the effect of China's attitude.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is currently negotiating with South Korea on this
matter," adding that he has learned indirectly that South
Korea hopes the envoy will have a financial or economics background.</P>
      <P>For this, Chiang said the MOFA should provide correct information
to the president so that "his choice of envoy won't be rejected
outright," which could hurt national dignity as well as Wang. </P>
      <P>Chiang said that if President Chen still wants Wang to go, he can
invite Wang to serve as a senior adviser and go in that capacity,
noting that C. F. Koo, the late chairman of the Straits Exchange
Foundation, went to the APEC summit meeting in his capacity as a
senior adviser to the president before.</P>
      <P>"If Wang still can't go, a second candidate can be P.K. Chiang,"
Chiang also suggested.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, currently a KMT vice chairman and a legislator, once
served as the chairman of the nation's economic planning agency
-- the Council for Economic Planning and Development. P.K. Chiang
attended the APEC summit meeting in 1993 on behalf of then-President
Lee Teng-hui.</P>

    <DATELINE>New York,  Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Y. C. Chen and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui urged full
support for Taiwan's "indigenous political parties" Sunday in New
York, saying that the Taiwan people must not allow non-democratic
political parties to take back power in 2008.</P>
      <P>Lee made the appeal while giving a one-hour speech to about 1,000
Taiwan expatriates during a dinner banquet.</P>
      <P>It is critically important to continue Taiwan's democratization
and make the island into a sound country, Lee stressed. He said that
the core issue is not whether the country should declare independence
from China; rather, it is a question of what the country should be
called instead of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan does not need to declare independence since it is already
a sovereign and independent state, but the existing ROC Constitution,
although amended six times, is still not suitable for Taiwan, which
he called a temporary shelter for the ROC government, which fled
China in 1949.</P>
      <P>Warning that the 2008-2010 period could be a window for Beijing
to attack Taiwan, the former president encouraged Taiwan people
living overseas to unify and serve in the diplomatic vanguard to make
Taiwan's voice heard around the world.</P>
      <P>He called on the Taiwan people both at home and abroad to throw
their support behind "indigenous political parties" in the 2008
presidential election, because "Taiwan is our motherland where we
have our roots, and we must not allow non-democratic parties to
return to power."</P>
      <P>A "Republic of Taiwan" will eventually be set up, but this will
take time as there are difficulties to overcome, he said, emphasizing
that "Taiwan is Taiwan and China is China. We are strongly opposed to
China's swallowing up Taiwan and all the Taiwan people should loudly
voice their opposition."</P>
      <P>Lee is slated to proceed to Washington, D.C. via Philadelphia
Monday, the third leg of his current U.S. tour after Anchorage,
Alaska and New York.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) official said Monday that the party will set
up 10 ad hoc groups to push for the various reforms including those
outlined by President Chen Shui-bian recently.</P>
      <P>Chao Yung-chin, a whip of DPP's legislative caucus, made the
remarks after convening a meeting of DPP cadres and senior lawmakers
from various factions held earlier that day.</P>
      <P>The meeting was aimed at establishing a negotiation mechanism
within the country and studying the future direction of the party,
with the participants also including those legislators who recently
endorsed a declaration calling for a new DPP movement to revive the
party's core values at a time when the party is mired in allegations
of scandals.</P>
      <P>Chao said in a press conference following the meeting that the
party will establish 10 ad hoc groups responsible respectively for
financial reform, tax reform, reform to change the preferential
interest rates of 18 percent for retired military personnel, civil
servants and teachers, media reform, investigation into properties
inappropriately seized by political parties, constitutional reform,
reviewing the bonus system for government officials in enterprises
with government shares, avoiding retired government officials to
receive extra pay or pensions in other government agencies, as well
as reviewing the salary structure of senior advisers to the president
and national policy advisors to the president.</P>
      <P>Chao stressed that now that both the legislature and the DPP are
troubled with many problems, the DPP will strengthen communications
within the party in the future to keep pushing for reforms and will
convene such a meeting at least once every two weeks in the future.</P>
      <P>As for the "new DPP movement," a term that the opposition parties
have used to cause misunderstanding among the public, Chao said, the
participants decided not to mention it frequently in the future, and
just focus on reforms.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
signed a cooperative agreement with Intel Corp. of the United States
to jointly promote WiMAX wireless technology, which provides
high-throughput broadband connections over long distances.</P>
      <P>WiMAX, an acronym that stands for Worldwide Interoperability for
Microwave Access, is a wireless metropolitan area network (MAN)
technology that can connect IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) hotspots to the
Internet and provide a wireless extension to cable and DSL for
last-mile broadband access.</P>
      <P>The agreement was signed by Economics Minister Ho Mei-yueh and
Sean Maloney, Intel's executive vice president and general manager of
Intel Communications Group.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement, the MOEA will promote the
development of WiMAX equipment and service industries with the aim of
providing highly cost-efficient WiMAX products, equipment and
solutions to the fast-growing global telecommunication market.</P>
      <P>The MOEA will also coordinate distribution of domestic airwave
frequencies and offer resources and assistance for WiMAX field
trials.</P>
      <P>For its part, Intel, the world's leading manufacturer of
microcomputer components for desktop and server systems, will assist
Taiwan in developing WiMAX technologies that meet IEEE 802.16
standards and will help Taiwan's ODM makers develop advanced WiMAX
broadband devices and solutions.</P>
      <P>Intel also promises to help ensure conformity and
interoperability of locally produced WiMAX equipment with
telecommunications networks in other countries.</P>
      <P>Ho said at the signing ceremony that the cooperative program
offers a good opportunity for Taiwan to not only take part in
equipment manufacturing but also in the development of WiMAX standard
specifications, system establishment and information services.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, the government has drafted a five-year plan to
offer wireless Internet connectivity to 8 million households. If all
goes well, she said, WiMAX infrastructure will be in place in 15
demonstration areas in 10 cities around Taiwan by 2007 to allow for
initial testing.</P>
      <P>"Few countries have begun this kind of testing at present. With a
well-developed information technology industry and local people's
obsession with things new, Taiwan is well-equipped for wireless
broadband communication testing," Ho said.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Minister-without-Portfolio Lin
Feng-ching said the government will invest up to NT$37 billion
between 2005 and 2008 for its ambitious Mobile-Taiwan (M-Taiwan)
project aimed at establishing a comprehensive wireless broadband
mobile communication network and environment.</P>
      <P>"WiMAX is the most important technological option for the
M-Taiwan project," Lin said.</P>
      <P>With a view to making Taiwan the world's largest WiMAX industry
base, Lin said the government will offer NT$1.1 billion in subsidies
for establishing WiMAX platform technology and key components.</P>
      <P>Lin also urged city and county governments interested in
establishing wireless broadband communications networks to file
applications with the MOEA's Industrial Development Bureau.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) said Monday
that fennel, a common vegetable that also produces seeds that are
used as a spice, is nothing like the flu drug Tamiflu and that there
is no point in eating or stockpiling it to ward off flu.</P>
      <P>DOH officials made the remarks as fears over avian flu heightened
after health experts warned of a pandemic, with cases being reported
in Europe after first being detected in Asia.
The pharmaceutical giant Roche, which produces Tamiflu, cannot
meet the demand for the flu vaccine, even if production is stepped up
several-fold.</P>
      <P>Tamiflu uses shikimic acid that is extracted from fennel and then
undergoes several production processes to produce its main
ingredient, oseltaminvir phosphate. When details of the process were
reported, the local price of fennel jumped.</P>
      <P>But DOH officials pointed out that the chemical structure of the
shikimic acid in fennel is greatly different from the product used to
make Tamiflu.</P>
      <P>The officials said the public should not be misled into thinking
that their consumption of fennel will help them against avian flu and
warned that over-consumption could even cause adverse effects.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, acting Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh Chu-lan motioned in a joint
meeting of Kaohsiung city, county and Pingtung county government
chiefs Monday that the three administrations should set up a
cooperative mechanism to combat avian flu within a week. Her
suggestion won the support of Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH ASKS TAMIFLU MAKER TO GRANT TAIWAN PRODUCTION LICENSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The minister of the Department of Health
(DOH) said Monday that he has sent a letter to Franz B. Humer,
chairman of Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche, expressing Taiwan's
desire to have the company's license to produce Tamiflu, the only
vaccine against a possible pandemic of avian influenza.</P>
      <P>Hou Sheng-mou said that protecting people's lives is the
government's priority. Should a regional human-to-human avian flu
pandemic break out, Taiwan will "do whatever it can" to secure enough
vaccine, implying that the country will produce Tamiflu by itself
with or without a license from Roche.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has stockpiled just 160,000 doses of Tamiflu, far short of
the amount the nation needs to fight the pandemic.</P>
      <P>To secure enough medication, the health department has earmarked
NT$400 million (US$11.97 million) to be used next year to purchase
Tamiflu and materials should a pandemic occur. Half of the money will
go toward buying Tamiflu from Roche and the other half will be used
to purchase raw materials from the company to produce the vaccine in
Taiwan, according to the DOH.</P>
      <P>Hou said that even though there is still time before the avian
flu virus mutates into the one that is capable of passing from human
to human, the DOH still hopes Roche will grant Taiwan its Tamiflu
production license as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>According to patent laws, Roche will not be protected in terms of
patent rights under the situation in which the country is faced with
an emergent crisis or that a non-profit usage of its patented product
is needed for the promotion of public health.</P>

      <P>At the meeting, the party members reaffirmed their determination
on reforms and their hate of corruption.</P>
      <P>They also criticized several allegations in a number of scandals
involving the DPP, including the illegal profiteering exposed by the
Aug. 21 riot of Thai laborers working on the Kaohsiung rapid transit
railway project and the huge stock bonus received by former China
Steel Corp. Chairman Lin Wen-yuan in his capacity as the company's
chief executive officer, as well as the "double-dipping" scandal in
which some retired government officials still receive pay or pensions
from various after-retirement posts in addition to pensions from
their original jobs.</P>
      <P>In addition, Su also suggested that the subjects of investigation
should not be limited to current government officials and lawmakers,
but should also include retired or other related figures.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, referring to former President Lee Teng-hui's present
visit to the United States, Su urged the public to express more
recognition of Lee's long-term efforts in promoting Taiwan's causes
in the international community.</P>
      <P>Noting that the promotion of diplomacy is not just the
government's job but a task of all the people, including the
opposition parties, Su expressed support for Lee's plan to visit
Japan next year.</P>
      <P>Criticizing China's protest against Lee's visits abroad, Su noted
that Lee is an ordinary citizen and claimed that Beijing's
obstruction will just deepen the hatred of China by the Taiwan
people.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A forum held Oct. 13-14 in New York City
aimed at attracting global investment to Taiwan's financial market
has received a warm response from international investors, officials
of the Cabinet-level Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said
Monday.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan delegation composed of government officials, FSC
officials, bankers and business representatives traveled to New York
to attend the seminar dubbed "Taiwan: the Gateway to the Region, "
which was organized by Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC, EII.</P>
      <P>In the two-day forum, Taiwan officials responsible for financial
affairs introduced the reform projects in financial
internationalization and liberalization being carried out by the FSC
and the trade opportunities derived from those reform projects.</P>
      <P>According to FSC officials, representatives from several
international investment corporations were excited by the chance to
receive first-hand information from Taiwan's financial officials and
to exchange points of view with Taiwanese business leaders on the
nation's industrial prospects.</P>
      <P>The investors suggested that Taiwan convene more such forums to
attract more global investment.</P>
      <P>However, they also expressed concern about the limitations on
foreign capital entry into Taiwan's financial market, and whether
foreign banks will be given a fair chance in the mergers of banking
institutions being promoted by the government.</P>
      <P>After their stay in New York, the delegation will proceed to the
United Kingdom to conduct a similar seminar Oct. 17-18 in London.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN VOWS TO COMPLETE REFORM OF PREFERENTIAL INTEREST RATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has reaffirmed his
commitment to completing reform of the preferential interest rates
for retired civil servants, military servicemen and public school
teachers by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Chen made the reaffirmation in a taped television interview
broadcast on SETTV, a cable news channel, Monday night.</P>
      <P>Chen said the 18 percent preferential interest rate for pensions
of retired public functionaries, which has been implemented for more
than 20 years, is unfair and unjust.</P>
      <P>"The preferential measure should be revised before the end of the
year or even earlier. The proposed reform is not to remove the 18
percent preferential interest rate. What the government plans to do
is to improve it so that the income replacement rate for retired
civil servants, military personnel and teachers will be capped at 90
percent. This is the world's highest rate. In many other countries,
the maximum ratio is 70 percent," Chen said.</P>
      <P>If the proposed reform plan can be implemented smoothly, Chen
said the government will be able to save NT$700 billion in interest
rate subsidy over the next 20 years.</P>
      <P>"This means we'll be able to save NT$35 billion annually. The
saved money will be used to finance free lunches for schoolchildren
from poor families, extension of compulsory education and increase of
living subsidy for senior farmers," Chen said.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian slammed two major
opposition parties Monday for their obstinate opposition to his
administration's plan to procure a robust package of weapons from the
United States.</P>
      <P>Chen fired barrage the of criticism of the Kuomintang (KMT) and
the People First Party (PFP) in a taped interview broadcast late
Monday night on SETTV, a cable news channel.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP has used its slim
majority in the Legislative Yuan to prevent the arms procurement
package from being put onto the legislative agenda more than 30 times
in the past year.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the two parties have opposed the package for
partisan reasons, Chen said he sees little possibility that the
legislature's rules committee would place the arms bill onto the
legislative agenda before the Dec. 3 "three-in-one" elections.</P>
      <P>Listed in the arms package are eight diesel-electric submarines,
six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft.</P>
      <P>Chen said all of the three big-ticket weapons in the package were
broached by the previous KMT administration.</P>
      <P>"It is regrettable that the KMT and its splinter group -- the PFP
-- have changed their position after losing power," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In the face of China's military threat, Chen said Taiwan badly
needs new weapons to safeguard its national security. Chen said he
aspires to listen to public opinion about the issue.</P>
      <P>Noting that his term of office will expire on May 19, 2008, Chen
said his administration's push for the arms procurement package is
not for partisan interests but purely for national defense needs.</P>

Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and Ma's predecessor Lien Chan
Monday to help push for Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng to
attend the upcoming informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal in a taped interview broadcast on SETTV, a
cable news channel.</P>
      <P>Chen said he had obtained Wang's consent before announcing his
decision last week to name Wang as his proxy at the 2005 APEC summit
to be held in Busan, South Korea in November.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chen said he had sought U.S. opinions about his plan to
appoint Wang to attend the APEC summit on his behalf.</P>
      <P>"U.S. authorities have given a positive response, terming it as a
creative option," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say he had asked ROC Representative to South
Korea Lee Tsai-fang to inform South Korean authorities of his
decision before making a public announcement.</P>
      <P>Chen said he didn't know that China would oppose Wang's
attendance as KMT Chairman Ma claimed.</P>
      <P>Chen said he never thought that he should have consulted with
China before choosing his proxy at the APEC summit.</P>
      <P>APEC is one of the few international bodies that admit both
Taiwan and China. Because of China's opposition, the ROC president
has been barred from attending the APEC summit in person and has to
instead name a special envoy to attend on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is hopeful that the KMT can use it friendly ties
with the Communist Party of China to persuade Beijing not to oppose
Wang attendance at this year's APEC summit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROCHE DECLINES TO COMMENT ON TAIWAN'S REQUEST TO MAKE TAMIFLU LOCALLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A spokeswomen for the Swiss pharmaceutical
maker Roche declined Monday to comment on Taiwan's reported request
for authorization from the company to manufacture Tamiflu locally as
the company has still not received a request from the island's health
authorities.</P>
      <P>Roche is the sole manufacturer of Tamiflu, one of only a handful
of influenza drugs that help fight certain strains of H5N1 infection.</P>
      <P>The spokeswoman said that the company will not close the door to
the possibility of future discussions with Taiwan on the matter.</P>
      <P>Hou Mou-sheng, minister of the Republic of China's Department of
Health (DOH) under the Executive Yuan, said the same day that he has
sent aletter to Roche President Franz B. Humer requesting that the
company and the DOH discuss allowing Taiwan to produce Tamiflu on the
island in order to increase stockpiles to a sufficient level to deal
with a possible avian flu outbreak.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that she could not make any concrete response to the
island's request, the spokeswomen said basically, Roche does not
exclude the possibility of discussing cooperation in manufacturing
Tamiflu with foreign companies in the future.</P>
      <P>She further said that her company will discuss with the Taiwan
government relevant issues after becoming fully aware of the island's
stance.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Roche will likely agree to authorize foreign
companies to produce Tamiflu, the spokeswoman said that no foreign
pharmaceutical companies have yet demanded that the company
authorizes them to produce the drug.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan only has a stockpile of 160,000 doses of
Tamiflu. It has ordered 780,000 more doses of the drug from Roche. It
is expected that the island's stockpiles of the drug by the middle of
next year will reach 4 percent of the population, far behind the safe
level of 10 percent suggested by the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has announced twice during the past 30 days that it has
the ability and technology to produce Tamiflu and that it has
considered breaking patent laws to manufacture the drug. This evoked
a negative response from the Swiss company, which said the island's
consideration is "unrealistic."</P>
      <P>According to the Treaty on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual
Property Rights (TRIPS) , compulsory licensing and government use
without the authorization of the rights holder are allowed, but are
made subject to conditions aimed at protecting the legitimate
interests of the rights holder.</P>
      <P>The treaty also says that as a general rule, such licenses should
only be granted if an unsuccessful attempt has been made to acquire a
voluntary licence on reasonable terms and conditions within a
reasonable period of time, adding, however, that it is not necessary
for those countries that are in an emergency situation to acquire a
voluntary license first.</P>
      <P>According to the treaty, the rights holder should receive
appropriate remuneration for both voluntary licenses and compulsory
licenses.</P>
      <P>Tamiflu has become the most popular drug in the face of a threat
currently posed by a possible worldwide outbreak of the avian flu
pandemic. </P>
      <P>With fears growing around the world of the possible outbreak of
the disease, orders for Tamiflu have shot up. Roche, which has been
unable to meet this growing demand, has come under increasing
pressure to authorize companies in other countries to manufacture
Tamiflu.</P>

dispersal
Davao Archbishop Fernando Capalla, president of the
Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP),
said neither the three bishops and the protesters, on

blamed for the incident because everyone was acting on
their own "deep sense of faith and duty."

      <P>A main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) group
will leave for Beijing Wednesday to help push for Taiwan's opening to
Chinese tourists as early as possible, KMT Policy Executive Committee
Director Tseng Yung-chuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference held at the Legislative Yuan prior
to their departure, Tseng called on the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) to send ranking officials to travel to Beijing
with them.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator John Chiang, KMT Mainland Affairs Department
Director Chang Jung-kung, who will accompany Tseng on the trip, were
also present. They are slated to meet the State Council's Taiwan
Affairs Office Director Chen Yunlin Thursday in Beijing.</P>
      <P>At a time when Taiwan and China have had limited contact and have
failed to come up with concrete results on the tourist issue, the KMT
wants to gain a better understanding of Beijing's viewpoints and to
help explore the feasibility of allowing Chinese tourists to come to
Taiwan for the mutual benefit of the two sides, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that opening Taiwan to Chinese tourists is expected
to generate at least NT$50 billion in tourist dollars and business
opportunities worth more than NT$100 billion (US$3 billion) at home,
he called it the right path to revive the dwindling domestic economy.</P>
      <P>The KMT also hopes to promote tourist charter flights across the
Taiwan Strait to facilitate two-way tourist exchanges, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Responding to questions from reporters, Chiang also ruled out the
possibility that the KMT mission will take the initiative to discuss
with Beijing officials President Chen Shui-bian's idea of dispatching
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT heavyweight, to serve

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FACES MARGINALIZATION THREAT AFTER CHINA-ASEAN FTA: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Oct.  17 (CNA)
(By C.C. Hwang and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With China and the Association of South
East Asian Nations (ASEAN) having signed a free trade agreement,
Taiwan could face a crisis of marginalization, a British scholar
warned Monday.</P>
      <P>Christopher Dent, a senior lecturer on the Southeast Asian
economy at the University of Leeds, made the warning at a forum on
"Taiwan's Global Investment" being held in London.</P>
      <P>Talking about the close trade relationship between Taiwan and
China, Dent, who has done much research into Taiwan's political and
economic situations, said that China is the island's largest export
market and that the number of Taiwanese businesspeople in China and
the total amount of their investment on the mainland is considerable.</P>
      <P>However, he said that an FTA among China, Japan, South Korea and
the ASEAN countries, which would create the largest free trade zone
in the world, could be harmful to Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>However, although claiming that Taiwan faces the threat of
marginalization, the scholar said he has confidence in the island's
ability to " turn bad luck into good fortune. "</P>
      <P>According to Dent, small and medium enterprises have formed the
most important part of the Taiwan's economy and have given the island
the flexibility to respond rapidly to outside changes or shocks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yen Ching-chang, former ROC permanent representative
to the World Trade Organization, who also attended the forum, said
that a successful Doha Round trade negotiations would reinforce the
global multilateral trade mechanism. He said that success would not
only affect the trade systems of the WTO members, but would also help
multinational companies reduce their costs of doing business
overseas.</P>
      <P>Claiming that success of the new round of trade talks would help
liberalize world trade, Yen said that bilateral FTAs would not
undermine the fruits of success of the Doha talks.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is a WTO member. It certainly has the same rights as the
other WTO members and is not worried about the FTA signed between
China and ASEAN," Yen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) is amenable to taking a second look at its system to raise
funds as it applies to public office-holders, Premier Frank Hsieh
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The ruling party's fundraising system, under which public
office-holders must contribute a certain amount to the party coffer,
has become the focus of media attention after President Chen
Shui-bian disclosed during a TV interview that China Steel Corp.
Chairman Lin Wen-yuan had been "paying the dues for some Cabinet
members."</P>
      <P>According to Chen, "Lin has helped the pan-green camp of the DPP
and the Taiwan Solidarity Union a lot, " but his payments have been
misinterpreted as "political donations."</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP) Legislator Lin Teh-fu asked
the premier if Lin was allowed to make political donations in his
capacity as CSC chairman. Hsieh said, "As chairman, no; but as an
individual, yes."</P>
      <P>The premier said the DPP does not own any profit-making
businesses, but it has a good system to regulate raising and using
membership dues and campaign funds.</P>
      <P>Campaign funds should be raised in accordance with the political
donations law, which must be followed by all politicians, Hsieh said,
adding, "If Lin helps raise funds at luncheons or dinner parties, he
is not violating the law."</P>
      <P>Because Lin Wen-yuan was seen to have used his huge bonus and
high salary at CSC to help pan-green politicians, the PFP's Lin
demanded that the government investigate whether the CSC chairman had
violated the political donations law.</P>
      <P>Minister of Finance Lin Chuan and Minister of Justice Shih
Mao-lin said they will act according to law; however, it was not
clear if this meant that an investigation into the matter would be
started.</P>

      <P>The first-ever economic cooperation forum
between the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party
of China (CPC) is slated to be held in mid- December in Taipei, a KMT
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>KMT Mainland Affairs Department Director Chang Jung-kung said
that his party will invite Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan
Affairs Office under the Chinese State Council -- Beijing's No. 1
official responsible for charting policy toward Taiwan -- to take
part in the activity. A KMT-affiliated think tank will apply for an
entry visa for Chen with the government, he noted.</P>
      <P>The news came at a time when former KMT Chairman Lien Chan was
visiting Dalian in the northeastern Chinese province of Liaoning,
from where he will proceed southward to Qingdao, Shangdong province
and where he will meet Chen.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, Lien will not discuss issues related to the
forum during his meeting with Chen, as Lien's current China visit is
private in nature.</P>
      <P>KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang is also planning to lead a KMT
delegation to Beijing late this month, where he will jointly hold a
forum with Beijing officials to forge consensus and iron out concrete
measures on the protection of Taiwan business interests in China,
Chang revealed.</P>
      <P>Lien, now the honorary KMT chairman, made what the party dubbed
as an historic "journey of peace" to China from late April to early
May, when he was still head of Taiwan's largest opposition party. The
KMT-CPC forum idea was first put forward during a meeting between
Lien and CPC General Secretary Hu Jintao in Beijing in late April.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP TO ANTE UP DAMAGES CLAIM IN DEFAMATION LAWSUIT AGAINST PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
indicated Tuesday that it will sue President Chen Shui-bian on
charges of "aggravated defamation" and seek a large amount in damages
because he still refuses to apologize for his remark that PFP
Chairman James Soong met with a high-ranking Chinese official in
secret in the United States earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Soong already filed a civil suit in June at the Taipei District
Court, seeking a symbolic NT$1 in compensation from Chen over his
claim that the PFP chairman had met with Chen Yunlin, director of the
Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council.</P>
      <P>Soong, who returned from a visit to the United Kingdom Monday,
and PFP officials were furious after learning that the president
renewed his claim during an interview with a cable TV channel that
there is a basis for his saying that Soong had met with Chen Yunlin
in the United States early this year, and that he would present the
evidence in court if need be.</P>
      <P>The president questioned in the interview why Soong changed his
previous position after his visit to the United States and began to
oppose a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow for
popular referendums on future constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>When asked to comment, Soong called the president a "liar" and
challenged him to present the evidence right away.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsien-yao, director of the PFP Policy Center, said that in
addition to changing the charge in the lawsuit to "aggravated
defamation" and seeking a large amount in compensation for damage to
Soong's reputation, members of the PFP caucuses at the legislature
and the Taipei City Council will go to the Presidential Office
Wednesday to demand that the president substantiate his claim with
evidence.</P>
      <P>Chang also threatened that the PFP legislative caucus will try to
freeze the next fiscal budget for the Presidential Office because it
is really not necessary to "spend so much money to support someone
who creates political turmoil."</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Chin Chin-sheng claimed that in view of the fact
that the president has discredited Soong's name repeatedly with
untruths, all PFP party officials and PFP members in government posts
will stop calling Chen "President Chen" from Wednesday, and will
refer to him as "liar Chen."</P>
      <P>Chin explained that the PFP was against amending the Constitution
in a flippant manner from the very beginning, and that this position
had nothing to do with Soong's visit to China in May.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng said that he
did not want to get involved in the dispute between Soong and the
president, but declined to say whether the president showed him the
evidence of Soong's meeting with Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>In his interview with SETTV Monday, the president told the host
of a talk show that he had let a heavyweight figure of the opposition
Kuomintang see the evidence. He, however, did not name the person.</P>

(By Y.C. Chen and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui said Monday in Washington, D.C. that Taiwan doesn't have to
declare independence so long as it is a normal country.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remark after visiting the Jefferson Memorial, which
is dedicated to Thomas Jefferson, one of the writers of the U.S.
Declaration of Independence.</P>
      <P>Lee was on the third leg of his two-week U.S. visit which has
already taken him to Alaska and New York.</P>
      <P>Noting that both Taiwan and the United States are immigrant
societies, and that the people of both countries seek freedom, the
former president said the urgent task is to give people a chance to
understand Taiwan's identity and its future direction.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan doesn't have to declare independence, so long as it is a
normal country, it is a good country, " Lee said, adding that Taiwan
is not yet normal and that everyone should work toward that goal.</P>
      <P>Lee went from New York to Washington, D.C. by car in the morning,
stopping at Philadelphia on his way to take a look at the Liberty
Bell.</P>
      <P>He noted that every important event in the U.S. is related to the
symbolism of the Liberty Bell, as the U.S. has been built around the
idea of liberty, and that liberty is also a universal value.</P>
      <P>Lee arrived at a hotel near the White House in Washington, D.C.
at 1 p.m. to the warm welcome of around 100 Taiwanese expatriates.</P>
      <P>Lee and his wife first visited the National Archives where they
took a close look at the original copies of the Declaration of
Independence and the Constitution of the United States.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that each day around 5,000 people visit the National
Archives to see the historic documents, which can be said to be the
pride of the United States and speaks much about the country's
national identity. It is a pity that Taiwan doesn't have a similar
chance to let the public know of its direction, he said.</P>
      <P>Freedom and democracy are universal values and it is unreasonable
to suppress people under the pretext of patriarchy and unification.</P>
      <P>He also said that the U.S. is great because of the lofty ideals
of its founding fathers, and the National Archives is a great way of
getting this concept across, adding that Taiwan's education on
national identification is seriously insufficient, and there is not
enough Taiwan history in the education system. Taiwan people don't
know where they come from and the diligence of their ancestors, he
said.</P>
      <P>Lee will stay in Washington, D.C. Oct. 17-20, during which time
he will deliver a speech at the National Press Club.</P>
      <P>He reportedly will promote Taiwan's democratic experience and
call the international community's attention to China's threat to the
peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, the Asia-Pacific region and
the entire world.</P>

      <P>Officials of the state-run China
Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) expressed their hope Tuesday that they can
start as soon as possible the construction of 30 missile speed boats
ordered by the country's navy.</P>
      <P>The CSBC officials made known their hope after a private ship
building company was launching maximum efforts to persuade the
related agencies to change the decision of the navy on the contract.</P>
      <P>The CSBC gained the contract for 30 new generation missile speed
boats worth more than NT$10 billion (US$297.88 million) in June this
year.</P>
      <P>However, a private ship builder, Jong Shyn Shipbuilding Co. Ltd.,
was still trying to affect the contract by asking the Cabinet-level
Public Construction Commission to overrule the navy's decision.</P>
      <P>Han Pi-hsiang, chairman of Jong Shyn Shipbuilding Co. Ltd., noted
that the contract involves complicated manpower and the construction
of the 30 missile speed boats is expected to help ship building
development for domestic private ship builders.</P>
      <P>Noting that they have the experience in building similar missile
speed boats as well as constructing cruising boats for the Coast
Guard Administration, Han stressed that their capability of building
ships is not inferior to that of the CSBC, and most important is that
the prices they charge are lower.</P>
      <P>Amid the strong lobbying and competition from Jong Shyn, the CSBC
officials noted that the CSBC has been cooperating with the navy for
many years, stressing that it has the capability to complete the
production of the speed boats with the best quality and within the
expected time.</P>
      <P>The new generation, 100-ton speed boats can be equipped with four
missiles, compared with the 50-ton speed boats currently used by the
Republic of China Navy, which can only be equipped with two missiles,
and have more powerful deterrence capability, according to the CSBC.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
unveiled a set of financing and subsidy measures Tuesday aimed at
increasing the incentives for Taiwan investors to set up operations
in the country's diplomatic allies in Central and South America.</P>
      <P>The measures are part of the "co-prosperity project" announced by
President Chen Shui-bian during the 5th ROC-Central America Summit
held Sept. 26 in Nicaragua, under which the government will establish
a fund of US$250 million to help develop the economies of its
diplomatic allies in the region.</P>
      <P>According to Cho Shih-chao, head of MOFA's Department of Economic
and Trade Affairs, the ministry has revised a related regulation to
expand the industrial categories eligible for government subsidies to
include the media, oil exploration and financial service sectors. In
the past, only the manufacturing sector was entitled to the
subsidies.</P>
      <P>While pay and rental subsidies have been increased from 20
percent to 30 percent, the loan interest subsidy has been raised to
50 percent, Cho said.</P>
      <P>Also, the subsidy ceiling has been hiked from NT$15 million
(US$447,761) to NT$20 million, Cho continued, adding that
applications will be accepted one year after operations start and
that the subsidy duration will be five years.</P>
      <P>The revised regulation will be promulgated for implementation
between late October and early November after it is finalized by the
Cabinet, Cho said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the Cabinet's Development Fund and
International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) have earmarked
NT$5 billion and NT$2.5 billion, respectively, as government capital
to be funneled into various investment partnerships with the private
sector.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Development Fund is planning to provide low
interest financing for investors, and the ICDF, Overseas Chinese

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER INSTRUCTS MOTC TO FIND OUT SALARIES OF THSRC EXECUTIVES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that he
will ask the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to look
into the Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp (THSRC) and find out the
salaries of the company's executives.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks during an interpellation session at
the Legislative Yuan amid reports that the THSRC's president and 16
other executives received a combined salary of NT$90.83 million
(US$2.72 million) last year, averaging NT$5.34 million per man per
year. This, coupled with payments to the board chairman, independent
board members and supervisors, has pushed the total payments to over
NT$100 million.</P>
      <P>Compared with their colleagues in the sea and air transportation
sectors, the income of the THSRC executives are the highest,
according to the reports.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that Taiwan has no experience of building high-speed
railways and that the salary payments have to be considered in the
context of social factors and market forces, as well as whether the
executives are hired from overseas.</P>
      <P>Noting that the THSRC will convene a provisional shareholders'
meeting in the near future, the premier said the government has asked
the company to increase the number of board members and supervisors,
as well as independent directors, to step up supervision work.</P>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and Communications Lin Ling-san said
the THSRC is a private company and that he has sent ministry
officials to gain an understanding of the operations of the company.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet set up a special task force to help tackle a host of
problems involved in the nation's first high-speed railway
construction project after THSRC Chairwoman Nita Ing announced late
last month that completion of the project would be postponed for one
year until October 2006.</P>
      <P>The task force's main functions include supervision of the
progress of the railway construction, crisis management, crafting a
comprehensive supervisory mechanism and land development in the
vicinity of various high-speed rail stations.</P>
      <P>The administration has come under fire recently for its decision
to help bail out the cash-strapped THSRC, claiming that Taiwan's
international reputation will be at stake if the railway cannot be
completed.</P>
      <P>The bail-out came in the form of two government-related
foundations -- the China Aviation Development Fund (CADF) and the
China Technical Consultant Inc. (CTCI) -- which were told to invest a
total of NT$7.5 billion in the project.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 345-km railway linking Taipei in the north and
Kaohsiung in the south will form the backbone of western Taiwan's
mass rapid transportation network, Hsieh said that if the project
cannot be completed smoothly, western Taiwan's development will be
affected and the people's confidence will be dented.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPENING TO CHINESE TOURISTS GOVERNMENT POLICY: MAC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Bracing for tourists visiting from China is
a set government policy and the government welcomes every move that
is conducive to that end, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Johnnason Liu said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks following a meeting at the MAC with a group
of opposition Kuomintang (KMT) members scheduled to leave for China
the following day for talks on the issue with Chinese officials in
Beijing, including the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office Director
Chen Yunlin, Beijing's top official responsible for Taiwan policy,
and National Tourism Administration Director Shao Qiwei.</P>
      <P>KMT Policy Executive Committee Director Tseng Yung-chuan and KMT
Legislator John Chiang were present to exchange views with Liu.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, the KMT wants to gain a better understanding
of Beijing's viewpoint and to help push for allowing Chinese tourists
to begin coming to Taiwan as soon as possible for the mutual benefit
of both sides.</P>
      <P>Opening up to tourists from China is the right path for the
government to revive Taiwan's sliding economy, Tseng said, adding
that it will help create large amounts of revenue and business
opportunities.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China have had limited contacts for discussion on the
issue, and a major breakthrough is needed to break the current
impasse, Chiang said, adding that they will ask China to come up with
a set of complementary measures to help facilitate the tourist visits
to Taiwan, such as opening to tourist charter flights across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he will invite Shao to participate in an
international travel fair slated for next month in Taipei, Chiang
said they will first exchange opinions with Shao.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, speculation has been rampant in Taiwan's tourism
sector that Chinese experts will be invited to take part in the
Taipei travel fair in mid-November for the first time in anticipation
of the opening to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>However, officials of the Taiwan Visitors Association (TVA) ,
which will organize the fair, dismissed the rumors, clarifying that
the Chinese visitor to the fair will be a scholar.</P>
      <P>According to TVA officials, 59 countries and areas will take part
in this year's Taipei travel fair, an increase over last year's 51.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian told Reuters during a recent interview
that a Chinese official in charge of tourism will visit Taiwan in the
near future, while travel industry insiders also speculated that Shao
will lead a delegation to visit Taiwan in his capacity as head of the
Chinese National Tourism Administration.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will kick off a
round-the-island campaign tour on the back of a truck Saturday in
southern Taiwan, hoping to directly appeal to the people.</P>
      <P>The president will talk about the government's determination to
implement reforms and drum up support for the candidates of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the year-end city and
county chief elections.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has a lot of experience in campaigning, held several
large rallies with magnificent sound and light shows in the run-up to
the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>For this campaign, however, he has decided to adopt a more
low-profile approach, hoping to remind the public of the time when
the DPP was still a "tangwai" (an outside dissenter) in its
burgeoning years, when it gathered the bulk of its support from the
grassroots.</P>
      <P>The barnstorming approach is actually a follow-up to a series of
local seminars held in the wake of China opening to Taiwan's
agricultural products in August, when the president visited rural
areas to talk with local DPP officials to communicate with them on
the government's stance, advising them not to fall into the trap of
China's "charm offensive," which is said to have been effective.</P>
      <P>His more-than 30-stop barnstorming tour will start in Chiayi
County, Tainan City and Tainan County, and will continue to Hualien
County, Taichung City and Taichung County Sunday.</P>

(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Lee Jye told
legislators Tuesday that the Chung Cheng Armed Forces Preparatory
School in Fengshan, Kaohsiung County, will be phased out.</P>
      <P>Lee was replying to a question during an interpellation session
at the Legislative Yuan from Legislator Yen Wen-chang of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party on whether the school's continued
existence is necessary.</P>
      <P>Yen pointed out that the school, with a 70.5-hectare campus and
many modern facilities, including 32 basketball courts and four
standard-sized swimming pools, has only 1,141 students, while the
campuses for the 12,300 students in the 14 public and private high
schools in Kaohsiung County total only 63 hectares in area.</P>
      <P>Lee explained that the facilities of the military school have
been added in stages over a long period since it was founded by the
Ministry of National Defense (MND) in 1976 to provide free education
for would-be cadets in the academies of the armed forces. He
acknowledged that with enrollment declining at the school, the
hardware is too luxurious and excessive for the number of students.</P>
      <P>However, Lee said the MND needs more time to phase out the school
because those students still at the school must graduate and the
faculty staff must be relocated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RANKS 32ND IN 2005 WORLD CORRUPTION PERCEPTION INDEX</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan ranked 32nd, with a score of 5.9,
among the 159 countries surveyed in Transparency International's
(TI's) 2005 Corruption Perceptions Index, up three notches from last
year's survey, TI Taiwan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>More than two-thirds of the 159 nations surveyed scored less than
five out of a possible 10, indicating serious levels of corruption in
a majority of the countries surveyed.</P>
      <P>Among Asian countries, Singapore was the least corrupt country,
with a score of 9.4. Other Asian countries with a score of five or
above include Hong Kong (15th), Japan (21st) , Malaysia (39th) and
South Korea (40th). China scored 3.2, ranking 78th.</P>
      <P>Except for Singapore, all "clean countries" with a score of nine
or higher are developed countries such as Iceland, Finland, New
Zealand, Denmark and Switzerland.</P>
      <P>The 2005 Index bears witness to the double burden of poverty and
corruption borne by the world's least developed countries.</P>
      <P>"Corruption is a major cause of poverty as well as a barrier to
overcoming it," said TI Chairman Peter Eigen.</P>
      <P>"The two scourges feed off each other, locking their populations
in a cycle of misery. Corruption must be vigorously addressed if aid
is to make a real difference in freeing people from poverty, " he
said.</P>
      <P>Among the countries included in the index, corruption is
perceived as most rampant in Chad, Bangladesh, Turkmenistan, Myanmar
and Haiti-- also among the poorest countries in the world.</P>
      <P>Moreover, extensive research shows that foreign investment is
lower in countries perceived to be corrupt, which further thwarts
their chance to prosper.</P>
      <P>"Corruption isn't a natural disaster. It is the cold, calculated
theft of opportunity from the men, women and children who are least
able to protect themselves, " said David Nussbaum, TI's chief
executive.</P>
      <P>An increase in perceived corruption from 2004 to 2005 can be
measured in countries such as Costa Rica, Gabon, Nepal, Papua New
Guinea, Russia, the Seychelles, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Trinidad &amp;
Tobago and Uruguay.</P>
      <P>Conversely, a number of countries and territories show noteworthy
improvements -- a decline in perceptions of corruption -- over the
past year, including Estonia, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Jordan,
Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Qatar, Taiwan and Turkey.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
condemned President Chen Shui-bian Tuesday for vowing to block
with bloodshed if necessary a PFP-driven bill purporting to improve
peace with China.</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Chin Chin-shen said violence should not be allowed
in society and certainly not in the legislature.</P>
      <P>He said the PFP is worried that violence will be the order of the
day in the Legislative Yuan as a result of Chen's encouragement.</P>
      <P>The PFP spokesman said that Chen, who made the controversial
remarks in a TV interview the previous night, was obviously making a
desperate attempt to revive the sagging popularity of his
administration, but his encouragement for violence has shamed his
people.</P>
      <P>Instead of addressing the issues facing the nation, Chin said
Chen's interview focused on the opposition, and his broadside against
the opposition made him more like an DPP campaign manager than the
head of state.</P>
      <P>Chin disputed the president's claims that the PFP is holding
hostage its opposition ally the Kuomintang (KMT) and has forced the
KMT to support its peace-promotion bill in exchange for the PFP's
support for the KMT in its fight against the government's attempts to
force the KMT to return its illegally obtained assets, saying the
president should look at his own corruption-riddled administration
and at the people, who are in the grip of misery.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS TECHNOLOGY TO PRODUCE TAMIFLU: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Health Research Institute is
technically capable of producing Tamiflu, an anti-viral drug for the
treatment of influenza, and will be granted a special permit to
mass-produce the drug in the case of an avian flu outbreak among
humans in Taiwan, Department of Health (DOH) Minister Hou Sheng-mou
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hou told lawmakers during an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan that the DOH has written to Franz B. Humer, chairman
and CEO of the Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche, to express
Taiwan's intention to negotiate with the company for a licensing
agreement to produce Tamiflu.</P>
      <P>Hou pointed out that Roche has so far only agreed to donate to
the World Health Organization enough of the drug to treat 3 million
people and has refused to license its patent rights to others.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has stockpiled just 160,000 doses of Tamiflu, far short of
the amount the nation needs to fight a pandemic.</P>
      <P>If necessary, Taiwan will start mass production of Tamiflu in
accordance with Article 76 of the Patent Act, Hou said.</P>
      <P>The article stipulates that in order to cope with a national
emergency or in the case of an applicant's failure to reach a
licensing agreement with the patentee concerned under reasonable
commercial terms and conditions within a considerable period of time,
the patenting authorities may, upon an application, grant a right of
compulsory licensing to the applicant to put the patented invention
into practice.</P>
      <P>Upon receipt of a written application for such compulsory
licensing, the patenting authorities shall send a duplicate copy
thereof to the patentee, requesting that a response be filed within
three months. If no response is filed within the specified time
limit, the patenting authorities may decide the matter at its own
discretion, according to the article.</P>
      <P>Also Tuesday, Center for Disease Control Director-General Kuo
Hsu-sung said a pandemic of avian flu will come "sooner or later" and
warned that its impact on Taiwan's society and economy will be 10
times more serious than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
outbreak of 2003.</P>
      <P>Delivering a speech on the issue to officials at the Kaohsiung
city government, Kuo said the government has adopted measures such as
increasing the country's stockpile of anti-flu drugs and developing
new anti-flu vaccines to cope with a possible pandemic.</P>
      <P>The government will also step up quarantine inspection in an
attempt to prevent the virus from entering the country from abroad
and strengthen disease control and prevention efforts in local
communities, Kuo said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Human Development Index (HDI) was
ranked 25th in the world in 2003, with its gross enrollment ratio for
the 6-21 age group at 97 percent, the highest in Asia, the
Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials said that the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) has since 1990 released the HDI, which measures the
average achievements of a country by three basic aspects of human
development -- life expectancy, knowledge and standard of living
measured by GDP per capita.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations, the island's
ranking was calculated by the DGBAS according to the U.N.'s HDI
formula, DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>Among the 177 countries surveyed in the 2003 report, Norway
topped the list, followed by Iceland and Australia.</P>
      <P>Ranked 25th among the countries surveyed, Taiwan belonged in the
category of high human development as defined by the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Among the various categories measured, the life expectancy of
Japanese citizens was 82 years, while that of Taiwanese people was
76.1 years, a slight increase over the 2002 figure.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, deducting those aged over 65, the adult literacy rate
in Taiwan was 99.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Concerning the combined primary, secondary and tertiary education
gross enrollment ratio, Britain topped the list with 123 percent,
with Taiwan ranked 10th in the world and top in Asia.</P>
      <P>In terms of GDP per capita, which can reflect the purchasing
power of each country, that of Luxembourg topped the list, with
US$62,298, while Taiwan's GDP per capita stood at US$23,911, 22nd in
the world.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the GDP ranking does not necessarily
equal the HDI ranking, which means countries not included at the top
of the income pyramid can also achieve high human development, as
evidenced by Sweden.</P>
      <P>Singapore's HDI was ranked 26th, South Korea's was 29th, while
that of Hong Kong was ranked 22nd in the report.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's HDI was ranked 28th in 1990.</P>

      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
spokesman Michel Lu said Tuesday that Taiwan has never given money to
any individual in Malawi, although the country has signed many
cooperation projects with the southern African country.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks after foreign wire services reported that

corruption allegations that might involve millions of dollars said to
have been received from Taiwan, Libya, Morocco and other donors.</P>
      <P>Muluzi, who was Malawi's president from 1994 to 2004, reportedly
has business interests in transport, real estate, media and retail
sales and pocketed nearly US$12 million between April 1999 and
November 2004.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that the Republic of China has signed several
cooperation projects with Malawi, a staunch diplomatic ally of
Taiwan, over the years and that the ROC government has implemented
these projects as planned, but has never funneled money to any
individual.</P>
      <P>However, he noted that if Malawi asks for help from Taiwan in the
investigation, the MOFA will respect the judicial system of Malawi
and will offer necessary assistance.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Any senior Chinese official's request to
visit Taiwan should be examined by a government panel organized by
the Immigration Office under the National Police Agency and should be
negotiated by government agencies of both sides, Mainland Affairs
Council Chairman Joseph Wu said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In response to news report that the opposition Kuomintang is
planning to invite China's top Taiwan affairs official, Chen Yunlin,
to attend a forum in Taiwan next month, Wu said Chen's request, if
presented by the KMT, must first be examined by the Immigration
Office.</P>
      <P>Although officials representing different government agencies in
the panel might have different opinions about Chen's trip, Wu said he
is sure the panel will not impose extraordinary restrictions on
Chen's entry.</P>
      <P>As the director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's Statue
Council, Wu said, Chen's safety in Taiwan is of great concern to the
government and should be guaranteed through negotiations between
government agencies of both sides.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) would be
able to facilitate Chen's trip to Taiwan if it were to take part in
the proposed bilateral negotiations, although there is no sign that
Beijing will give up its refusal to have any contact with the SEF.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO CONDUCT ANTI-AVIAN FLU EXERCISE: OIE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct.  18 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The International Office of Epizootics
(OIE) said Tuesday that it has been informed by Taiwan that it will
conduct an islandwide anti-avian flu exercise Wednesday.</P>
      <P>OIE authorities said that they have been informed by Dr. Chang
Tien-jye, the standing OIE representative in Taiwan, that the
island's Council of Agriculture (COA) is scheduled to hold a
supra-ministerial exercise Wednesday in which customs, coast guard,
health, defense and transportation officials will take part.</P>
      <P>The exercise is aimed at testing Taiwan's capability in
preventing an avian flu outbreak and controlling the spread of H5N1
-- the strain of avian flu considered most likely to mutate into one
that is easily transmitted among humans.</P>
      <P>Since 2003, the H5N1 strain has killed thousands of migratory
birds in western China, led to the culling of millions of chickens in
China, Thailand and Romania, and resulted in the death of at least 60
people.</P>
      <P>Participants in the Taiwan exercise will simulate culling
affected birds, burying or burning the culled birds, stemming the
flow of poultry and meat smuggling, and protecting their own health
as well as the health of locally-raised animals and poultry, OIE
officials said.</P>
      <P>They noted that although the H5N1 strain has raised fears around
the world, there have only been 117 confirmed cases of humans being
infected by the virus to date. Basically, H5N1 is still a disease
among animals, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The OIE, which is on the front line in the global effort to
prevent the spread of avian flu, has worked in close collaboration
with the World Health Organization. The WHO has focused its attention
mainly on preventing the spread of avian flu among humans.</P>
      <P>WHO experts have warned that if the virus mutates into a strain
that is easily transmitted among humans, this could lead to a major
global pandemic which could kill millions of people.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is at particular risk during the current season as
migratory birds pass through the island on their journey south at
this time of the year.</P>
      <P>Both Taiwan and China are full members of the OIE. Taiwan is
represented in the world animal health organization under the title
"Taipei China."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FACES ATTACK IF IT REFUSES REUNIFICATION WITH CHINA: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By C.C. Hwang and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China will swallow Taiwan by force within
the next 10 to 15 years if the island does not accept reunification
on Beijing's terms, a European scholar warned Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The scholar, who currently teaches in Stockholm, said that
China's military threats against Taiwan are "absolutely not a joke
but a real and serious issue."</P>
      <P>He who has done much research into cross-Taiwan Strait relations,
made the comments while speaking at a seminar in London on
"Taiwan-China Relations: What Role Can the European Union Play? "
currently being held by the European Institute for Asian Studies
(EIAS) and the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) of the
Univeristy of London.</P>
      <P>One should pay proper heed to the phenomenon that the ambiguous
tactics which have been adopted by the United States towards the
cross-strait issue have turned the situation in China's favor, the
scholar said.</P>
      <P>He added that the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States and
the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have left Washington with too few
military resources to do as much as it would like to maintain
security in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>These factors, in addition to the international community's
recklessness in pursuing their business interests in the Chinese
market without giving sufficient support to Taiwan, have escalated
tensions in the strait, he also said.</P>
      <P>He further said that people should not turn a blind eye to the
military threat posed by China to Taiwan as Beijing has tried to
legitimize the use of force against the island through its
Anti-Secession Law passed in March of this year.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the scholar continued, the increasing influence of
the People's Liberal Army in China's politics as well as its
modernization which is aimed at challenging the United States'
leadership in the world also poses a threat to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that China has bluntly stated that it will not allow the
current situation between the two sides of the strait to remain
indefinitely, the scholar said that if Taiwan refuses to reunify with
China on Beijing's terms, then China will use ballistic missiles to
attack the island by 2014 or set up a naval blockade of the island.</P>
      <P>He concluded that if the communist regime in Beijing remains
unchanged and if no international forces intervene to prevent a
possible conflict and resolve the cross-strait issue, then there are
only two possible outcomes -- namely, Taiwan's status will be
downgraded at the expense of Beijing, or armed conflict between China
and Taiwan will break out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT'S SIX REFORMS BACKED BY THE PEOPLE: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  19 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The six reforms spelled out by President
Chen Shui-bian in his Double Ten National Day address have the
support of the majority of the people, Premier Frank Hsieh said
Wednesday in a Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>Citing a survey conducted by the Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission under the Executive Yuan, the premier said that
the proposed reshaping of the mass media received the highest level
of support at 72 percent, followed by reform of the tax system, at
67.6 percent.</P>
      <P>He said the survey shows that the people, regardless of their
political affiliation, are looking forward to a revamping of the
country's regulation of the mass media and the nation's tax system.</P>
      <P>Pointing to an opposition-sponsored bill on the formation of a
national communications commission which has been blocked twice in
the legislature by the lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, the premier said the differences between the ruling and
opposition parties over the appointment of the commission's members
should be sorted out through negotiations.</P>
      <P>Even the administration's second-phase financial reform, which
has been widely criticized for giving a few business groups the
chance to corner the financial market, got the support of 51 percent
of those surveyed, the premier said.</P>
      <P>Although the public is split on the issue of financial reform,
the premier said he is confident his Cabinet members will boost
public support for it in a televised debate against the critics of
the reform set for later this afternoon.</P>
      <P>As to the president's other proposed reforms, 61.2 percent of
those surveyed said they support reform to change the preferential
interest rate of 18 percent for bank deposits of retired government
employees, while 59.6 percent said they support investigation into
assets inappropriately acquired by political parties, and 51.1
percent support constitutional reform.</P>

    <HEADLINE>E.U. ARMS BAN ON CHINA UNLIKELY TO BE LIFTED BEFORE MID-2006: SCHOLARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London, Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By C.C.Hwang and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several European scholars said Tuesday that
Taiwan will face an increasing military threat from China if Beijing
succeeds in its lobbying to have the European Union lift its arms
sales ban on China.</P>
      <P>The scholars made the comments while attending a seminar on
"Taiwan-China Relations: What Role Can the European Union Play? "
which is currently being held in London by the European Institute for
Asian Studies (EIAS) and the School of Oriental and African Studies
of the University of London.</P>
      <P>At the same, the scholars predicted that the possibility of the
E.U. lifting the arms sales ban before next July is minimal.</P>
      <P>According to Sebastian Bersick, a research fellow at the EIAS,
even though Beijing has lobbied hard for a lifting of the ban, the
E.U. has delayed doing so due mainly to a lack of improvement in
China's human rights situation.</P>
      <P>Also, although France and Germany, the two leading E.U. members,
have voiced their support for a lifting of the ban, Britain, which
currently holds the rotating presidency of the union until the end of
the year, reportedly is opposed to it. Austria which will hold the
presidency for the first half of next year, is also against it, so
their is little chance that the ban will be lifted before next
summer, Bersick said.</P>
      <P>He added that the E.U.'s main allies, the United States and
Japan, are also strongly opposed to a lifting of the ban.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Bersick also pointed out that it will be difficult
for Taiwan to make a major diplomatic breakthrough in its relations
with the E.U. as the member states have adopted the "one China"
policy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Swedish scholar who has done much research into
cross-Taiwan Strait relations, said that if the E.U. lifts the arms
ban, Beijing will be able to acquire high-tech military equipment and
thereby bolster its level of deterrence against possible U.S.
intervention, which he said would pose a greater threat to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Talking about the role that the E.U. can play in cross-strait
relations, the scholar, who preferred to remain anonymous, said that
the E.U. can safeguard and legitimize Taiwan's current status of
autonomy by helping expand Taiwan's room to join the international
community.</P>
      <P>The E.U. can also make it clear that if China launches an attack
against Taiwan, it will join the United States, Japan, the
Association of South East Asia Nations (ASEAN) and Australia to
initiate an economic embargo against China, he said. He added that
the E.U. should also contemplate ways to prevent and resolve possible
cross-strait conflicts in the future.</P>
      <P>The scholar further said that the political dispute between the
ruling and opposition parties in Taiwan has been a continuing source
of tension in cross-strait relations, stressing that the parties
should work together as well as reach a consensus on the cross-strait
issues and express a clear and united stance that "Taiwan hopes to
maintain its political autonomy" rather than "explain their own
position" while facing the international community.</P>
      <P>Liu Shyh-fang, former secretary-general of the Executive Yuan,
who also attended the seminar, called for the E.U. to play a more
active role in helping resolve the problems between the two sides of
the strait and in maintaining the current status quo in the strait.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of the private Taiwan Roots Medical
Peace Corps decided Wednesday to abandon plans to travel to Pakistan
to provide medical relief to victims in Kashmir in the wake of a
deadly earthquake Oct. 8.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Roots President Liu Chi-hsiang quoted Adam Fields, a U.S.
national who has been a Taiwan Roots' volunteer, as saying after
arriving in Pakistan a day earlier that the Pakistani government
welcomes humanitarian relief and medical aid from around the world to
its earthquake refugees, but will not issue visas to relief personnel
from Taiwan, India or Israel.</P>
      <P>Fields was told by the Pakistani authorities that if Taiwan
groups plan to enter Pakistan for relief work, they should first
obtain permission from Beijing, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>Liu lashed out at the Pakistani government for politicizing a
pure humanitarian aid issue, saying that linking humanitarian work to
politics is the last thing that the Taiwan Roots Medical Peace Corps
would like to see and runs counter to the spirit in which the group
was established.</P>
      <P>Liu said that his group decided to go to Pakistan immediately
after an area straddling India and Pakistan was rocked by a magnitude
7.6 earthquake Oct. 8, in which nearly 1,000 Pakistani hospitals were
reportedly ruined and many medical professionals were killed.</P>
      <P>Liu added that members of the Taiwan Roots Medical Peace Corps,
who traveled to the India-controlled area of Kashmir between late
June and early July this year to offer free medical treatment to the
people there, were planning to head to Pakistani Kashmir after the
Oct. 8 earthquake, since that area was reportedly the hardest-hit.</P>
      <P>The death toll might exceed 80,000 but the exact number is likely
to never be known.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO EARMARK NT$20 BILLION FOR BIRD FLU PREVENTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is planning to funnel NT$20
billion (US$597 million) into avian flu prevention and control,
Department of Health (DOH) Minister Hou Sheng-mou said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Briefing a group of ruling Democratic Progressive Party
legislators on the issue, Hou noted that the DOH has also drafted a
bill on avian flu prevention and control and that it is currently
being screened by the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Hou previously confirmed that the DOH has requested negotiations
with the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche on a licensing agreement to
mass-produce Tamiflu, an anti-viral drug for the treatment of
influenza, in Taiwan in order to ensure that the country has
sufficient stockpiles of the drug to cope with a potential bird flu
outbreak among humans.</P>
      <P>According to Su Ih-jen, director of the Division of Clinical
Research at the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI), Roche is
considering licensing countries that have the capability to produce
Tamiflu, and Taiwan is the first of such countries that has requested
licensing.</P>
      <P>Su said this is a good development, although Roche has not made a
final decision on the matter.</P>
      <P>He said the NHRI is able to produce enough 99.5-percent pure
Tamiflu to treat one million people in three to five months to
increase the country's stockpiles.</P>
      <P>With a stockpile sufficient only to treat 160,000 people at
present, Taiwan will purchase another 780,000 doses next year to make
the reserves enough for use on 4 percent of the population, which
will still be far below the 10 percent suggested by the World Health
Organization, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>While no avian influenza infection in humans has been detected in
Taiwan so far, January to March 2006 -- the next peak influenza
season -- will be a critical period for observation, Su said.</P>
      <P>Former DOH Minister Lee Ming-liang said there are two possible
patterns of avian influenza transmission: the first is the spread of
the virus by migratory birds to Taiwan poultry and then to humans;
and the second is for the virus to spread to Taiwan through
human-to-human transmission in the wake of an avian influenza
outbreak in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Lee predicted that the second transmission pattern is more likely
than the first and warned health authorities to pay extra attention
to the occurrence of cross-border infections.</P>
      <P>Also Wednesday, Council of Agriculture officials said the council
has had the Wild Bird Federation Taiwan step up its monitoring on
migratory birds to prevent the invasion of the highly pathogenic H5N1
strain of the virus.</P>
      <P>The federation is expected to examine 2,000 to 3,000 bird stool
samples a year, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the government will continue to crack down on
smuggling activities to try to prevent the possible invasion of the
virus through smuggling channels, they added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARMY CHEMICAL FORCE JOINS ANTI-AVIAN FLU DRILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of the army's chemical force took
part in a nationwide anti-avian flu exercise held Wednesday in
Hsinchuang, Taipei County, according to military sources.</P>
      <P>The supra-ministerial exercise, sponsored by the Council of
Agriculture, called together personnel from the Ministry of the
Interior, Ministry of National Defense, Ministry of Transportation
and Communications, the Coast Guard Administration, the Department of
Health and the Environmental Protection Administration, as well as
city and county governments around the nation.</P>
      <P>The exercise was aimed at testing Taiwan's ability to prevent an
avian flu outbreak and control the spread of H5N1 -- the strain of
avian flu considered most likely to mutate into a form that is easily
transmitted among humans, officials said.</P>
      <P>Since 2003, the H5N1 strain has killed thousands of migratory
birds in western China, led to the culling of millions of chickens in
Thailand, Romania and a number of other Asian and European countries,
and resulted in the death of at least 60 people. Taiwan is at
particular risk, as many migratory birds pass through the island on
their journey south at this time of year.</P>
      <P>Participants in the exercise simulated culling affected birds,
burying or burning the culled birds, stemming the flow of poultry and
meat smuggling, and protecting their own health as well as the health
of locally raised animals and poultry.</P>
      <P>World Health Organization experts have warned that if the H5N1
virus mutates into a strain that is easily transmitted among humans,
it could lead to a major global pandemic that could kill millions of
people.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials from the Veterans Affairs Commission urged
the country's veterans and their dependents to observe a 10-day
self-health monitoring program after returning to Taiwan if they
travel to Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia or Cambodia. Home-bound people
are required to wear face masks and fill in health report forms if
they cough, have fever or suffer a sore throat during their flights
or after arrival, they added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU PUSHES FOR MASS PRODUCTION OF TAMIFLU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  19 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) will request the legislature to pass a resolution demanding
that the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche license Taiwan to
mass-produce Tamiflu, an anti-viral drug for the treatment of
influenza, to cope with a possible pandemic of avian influenza, a TSU
lawmaker said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Citing an estimate by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) ,
Legislator Lai Hsin-yuan said that approximately 5.3 million people
in Taiwan will be infected in the case of an avian influenza
pandemic, with 14,000 fatalities.</P>
      <P>If the government fails to take proper precautionary measures in
advance, 5 million people could be infected within two weeks of the
first case of infection detected in Taiwan and 2.65 million people
will die from the disease, Lai said.</P>
      <P>Lai pointed out that according to a World Health Organization
recommendation, Taiwan should stockpile enough Tamiflu to treat at
least 2.3 million people and that there are still 2.14 million doses
short.</P>
      <P>Even if Taiwan starts mass-producing the drug now, the production
will only finish in April next year, which will pose a serious gap in
the prevention of a bird flu outbreak, Lai said.</P>
      <P>The DOH has requested negotiations with Roche on a licensing
agreement to mass-produce Tamiflu in Taiwan. Roche reportedly is
considering Taiwan's request.</P>
      <P>Department of Health Minister Hou Sheng-mou said Tuesday that if
necessary, the government will grant the National Health Research
Institute (NHRI) a special permit to mass-produce Tamiflu in
accordance with Article 76 of the Patent Act, in the absence of
Roche's licensing.</P>
      <P>According to Su Ih-jen, director of the NHRI's Division of
Clinical Research, unlike the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,
virus which is transmissible only after an infected person comes down
with a fever, the bird flu virus is transmissible even during the
incubation period.</P>
      <P>Su predicted that the infection rate of avian influenza can be
kept below 3 percent if proper public health measures are taken.</P>
      <P>The cure rate will reach over 90 percent if a bird flu patient
takes Tamiflu within two days of the appearance of symptoms and the
rate will top 70 percent if the drug is taken within five days, Su
said.</P>
      <P>However, Tamiflu will have no effect on the bird flu virus if a
patient takes the drug one week after the appearance of symptoms, he
said.</P>
      <P>He said the NHRI has cooperated with several private
pharmaceutical companies and would be able to produce 200,000 doses
of Tamiflu in two to three months.</P>
      <P>It will take five months to produce one million doses, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Deputy CDC Director-General Lin Ting said the DOH has
prepared more than 3,000 isolation wards, 3.74 million N95 masks,
4.89 million protective gowns and more than 21 million surgical masks
as precautions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO READY TO FIGHT AVIAN FLU: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh claimed Wednesday that
there is "no need for panic" as the government is well prepared to
combat avian flu and that the public needs to simply wash their hands
and take other common sense personal hygiene measures.</P>
      <P>Hsieh offered his reassurances after listening to a joint report
by the Department of Health (DOH) and the Council of Agriculture
(COA) on their preparations for a possible outbreak of bird flu.</P>
      <P>"We should all be confident, as Taiwan is one of the few
countries in the world capable of mass producing Tamiflu," a patented
drug said to be effective in curing flu, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He said he has told the DOH to stage a simulation of class-B and
class-C level onslaught of new flu viruses with the participation of
all related government agencies. He also said a "war conference"
should be held to decide on detailed steps to fight avian flu.</P>
      <P>Now is the time that migratory birds make their south-bound
journeys through Taiwan, Hsieh said, so the COA should step up
efforts to monitor fowl-slaughtering and pigeon-raising businesses
and to urge local governments to carry out quarantine and other
epidemic-prevention measures.</P>
      <P>The Coast Guard authorities should work harder to crack down on
smuggling, including using the NT$20 million reward as an incentive
to encourage tipping off the authorities, said the premier.</P>
      <P>He added that the Ministry of Justice should also raise penalties
by amending existing laws and regulations as part of the effort to
deter would-be offenders.</P>
      <P>Should it become necessary to slaughter migratory birds, he said,
this should still be done on the principle of "least disturbing and
minimizing sacrifices" by, for example, widening the quarantine areas
while limiting the slaughter.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 10-year-old educational reform program
is moving in the right direction and deserves to be carried on,
Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng said Wednesday, although he
admitted that they could be improved upon.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions from lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan, the
minister refused a demand for an apology from an opposition lawmaker
for what the lawmaker called the failure of the education reforms.</P>
      <P>Citing fact-finding trips to elementary and junior middle schools
around the island in the last year, Tu said he is encouraged to find
that the reforms are taking hold in elementary schools, with students
more interested in learning and teachers having more leeway in
organizing their teaching programs and materials.</P>
      <P>However, the minister said, the positive changes brought about by
the reforms in elementary schools do not extend to junior middle
schools because their students are gearing themselves up for senior
high school entrance examinations.</P>
      <P>The cause of the problems hindering the reforms lie mainly in the
way the reforms are implemented and this could be amended to improve
their effects, Tu said.</P>
      <P>Also, the eventual success of the reforms depends partly on
changes in public opinion about education to make parents realize
that education should be more than just giving students degrees or
preparing them for a prosperous career.</P>
      <P>The minister claimed that the reform program is worthy, judging
by its results thus far.</P>
      <P>The opposition lawmaker demanded the apology on the grounds that
the mastermind of the reform, Academia Sinica President Lee
Yuan-tseh, said at the legislature Oct. 13 that he was sorry because
the program had failed to live up to public expectations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government ruled Wednesday that
government-appointed board members of state-run enterprises should
not take any bonuses and that money or assets given in forms other
than bonuses should be returned to the state coffers.</P>
      <P>After a Cabinet meeting, Premier Frank Hsieh also announced that
retired officials who continue to work at government-subsidized
non-profit organizations can take a maximum monthly salary of
NT$31,200 and that anything other than that must also be returned to
the government.</P>
      <P>Those already working at government-funded groups must sign an
affidavit promising to be paid NT$31,200 per month at the most,
otherwise they will not be re-hired when their contracts expire.</P>
      <P>The premier made the decision in the wake of controversy
surrounding China Steel Corp. Chairman Lin Wen-yuan's fat yearly
stock bonus valued at NT$44 million and "double dipping" government
retirees working at government-funded foundations or think tanks.</P>
      <P>The policy takes effect immediately, meaning that from now on,
Lin's replacement and others appointed to profit-making state-run
businesses will not be able to enjoy their fat cat bonuses and the
much-reviled practice of "double dipping" will finally come to an
end.</P>
      <P>Retired government employees, including teachers and soldiers,
already have a retirement fund, part of which bears an annual
interest of 18 percent under a special program funded by the Taiwan
tax payer. If they are hired by government funded groups, they are
paid a second full-time job salary -- thus the term "double dipping."</P>
      <P>Hsieh said current laws do not ban government-appointed members
on the boards of state-run enterprises from taking bonuses, but after
a review by the Ministry of Finance, the government decided to stop
them from taking any profit other than their fixed salaries.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he noted, even if some corporations attempt to give
cash to board members using other titles such as "performance
rewards" or "incentives, " such profits must be coughed up and handed
back to the government coffers.</P>
      <P>The new rule applies to all government-invested enterprises and
non-profit organizations, including special funds, Hsieh said.</P>

      <P>As a young democracy, Taiwan
should learn from the U.S. example, specially in terms of its passing
the history, values and ideals of democracy to future generations,
former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui said in the U.S.
capital Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee said that in order to deepen and consolidate its democracy,
Taiwan needs more time and effort by its government and people, as
well as the support of its American friends and Taiwanese expatriates
overseas.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the constitution passed recently by the Iraqi
people is a great achievement for the United States in promoting
democracy to the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>He said freedom and human rights are universal values and rights
that people around the world should be entitled to.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks while addressing a dinner hosted by ROC
representative to the United States David Ta-wei Lee at his official
residence in Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Also invited to the event were Congressional Taiwan Caucus
co-chairs Steve Chabot and Dana Rohrabacher; former American
Institute in Taiwan Chairmen Therese Shaheen and Natale Bellocchi;
and Randal Schriver, former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state
in charge of East Asia and Pacific affairs.</P>
      <P>Washington is the third leg of Lee's two-week U.S. visit, which
has already taken him to Alaska and New York.</P>
      <P>Lee is expected to attend a welcome reception hosted by a group

deliver a speech at the National Press Club Thursday before flying to
Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>Earlier Tuesday, Lee held talks with scholars during a seminar
held at the Heritage Foundation.</P>
      <P>According to participants, Lee talked about issues relating to
Taiwan's national identity and displayed optimism about the country's

      <P>He also expressed his concern about China's military buildup and
said he believes China's democratization will take a very long time,

    <HEADLINE>'RICE BOMBER' SENTENCED TO SEVEN-AND-A-HALF YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  19 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A panel of Judges at the Taipei District
Court sentenced "rice bomber" Yang Ju-men Wednesday to
seven-and-a-half years in prison, plus a fine of NT$100,000, for
placing 16 bombs in public places in northern Taiwan during a
one-year period from November 2003.</P>
      <P>The 26-year-old poultry merchant can still appeal his case to a
higher court.</P>
      <P>Yang, a resident of Keelung, turned himself in to the police in
November last year. Police said that tests on DNA specimens collected
from some of the crime scenes showed they matched his DNA. Police
also found that he had received explosives training while serving in
the marine corps.</P>
      <P>Yang later admitted to leaving 16 home-made explosive devices in
parks, trains, railway stations and mobile toilets in an attempt to
call the government's attention to the plight of rice farmers caused
by imports of rice under World Trade Organization rules. Some of the
bombs went off, but no one was injured.</P>
      <P>Conspicuously present in the courtroom and outside the court
building Wednesday were hundreds of farmers and social movement
workers, each wearing a yellow ribbon, in support of Yang. There was
a commotion when the supporters became emotional upon hearing the
sentence, but it did not turn into disorder.</P>
      <P>Farmers organizations had urged the authorities not to treat the
terrorist as such, claiming he had "no intention of hurting anyone"
and would always leave a note or a letter at the scene, identifying
himself as an opponent of the government's rice import policy.</P>
      <P>Some 30,000 farmers have signed a petition calling for his
release, and many have donated money for his legal battle.</P>
      <P>The farmers have also called on the government to ease their
plight caused by imported rice. Taiwan imports 147,000 metric tons of
rice a year -- about 8 per cent of the island's total consumption.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ITU RANKS TAIWAN WORLD'S 7TH IN NARROWING DIGITAL DIVIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The International Telecommunication Union
(ITU) ranked Taiwan the world's seventh in its Digital Opportunity
Index, a reflection that Taiwan has made remarkable efforts in the
field, according to Minister-without-Portfolio Lin Ferng-ching.</P>
      <P>The ITU, an international organization within the United Nations
System where governments and the private sector coordinate global
telecom networks and services, placed Taiwan seventh in its global
Digital Opportunity Index which was issued in June, Lin said.</P>
      <P>During this year's May 31 economic ministers and senior
officials' meeting sponsored by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum, attendees loudly praised Taiwan's contribution and
sharing in the APEC Digital Opportunity Center (ADOC) , Lin surther
said, adding that their comments were documented in a joint
declaration of the meeting.</P>
      <P>The Peruvian press has made an extensive report about Taiwan's
assistance in helping the country set up an ADOC, and Peruvian
Congress Speaker Antero Flores-Araoz sent a letter in May this year
expressing his gratitude to APEC, Lin pointed out.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also helped the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Chile
and Papua New Guinea established ADOCs in an effort to help these
countries bridge their digital divides, he said.</P>
      <P>ADOC is an independent, non-profit organization funded by Taiwan,
which put forward the idea of transforming digital divides into
digital opportunities at the 11th APEC economic leaders' meeting in
Bangkok in 2003. It was initiated in 2004.</P>
      <P>At home, the broadband coverage rate has reached 99.1 percent,
close to the 99.6 percent target set for 2008, he said, noting that
the government has refurbished relevant facilities at 389 remote
elementary and high schools nationwide and opened 33 digital
opportunity centers in areas hit by the Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake in
Yunlin, Changhua, Pingtung and Penghu counties and aboriginal
villages across the country in July.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Administration
donated 1,500 computers and the Ministry of Education also gave away
1,000 second-hand computers to poor families in rural areas, he went
on, spelling out the government's hope of building the entire country
into a wireless space where people can easily log on the Internet and
watch television on every corner.</P>
      <P>The government has in recent years subsidized more than 30,000
aboriginal families in mountainous areas in improving the quality of
the image that they receive on their TV sets, he said. Some 15,000 of
those families now enjoy better quality, with the remaining 20,000
households set to get better service by the end of next year, he
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA DEMANDS THAT FREIGHTER SEEPING CHEMICALS BE MOVED SOON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) demanded Wednesday that the South Korean freighter that
collided with a Liberian freighter earlier this month in waters near
Taiwan to be moved away soon due to worries of chemical leakage.</P>
      <P>The 2,761-ton South Korean freighter "Sam-ho Brother" was hit by
the Liberian-registered freighter Oct. 10 in waters off Taoyuan
County, northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Several days after the accident, experts found that there was a
small amount of benzene leakage from the cargo ship, which was
carrying 85 tons of fuel oil, 16 tons of diesel and 3,000 tons of
methyl benzene when it was passing through Taiwan Oct. 10.</P>
      <P>Though the EPA officials estimated that the amount of benzene
leakage is not expected to affect Taiwan proper and its nearby coast
now as the freighter is still 17 or 18 kilometers away from the
island, the officials are still asking the shipowner to move the boat
as soon as possible to avoid polluting the nearby coast.</P>
      <P>It was reported that the shipowner may scupper the ship where it
is.</P>
      <P>However, as there were no complementary contamination prevention
measures presented by the shipowner, the EPA has asked for more
information.</P>
      <P>EPA officials stressed that since this was a rare, serious
accident for chemical freighters within and without the country, the
agency will strictly supervise the movement of the ship and may fine
the shipowner NT$1.5 million (US$44,682) should the freighter cause
contamination of marine resources.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT FAILS TO DEAL WITH ASSET QUESTION AS EAST GERMAN COMMUNISTS: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is inferior
to the German Communist Party in terms of the handling of its
ill-gotten party assets, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) caucus in the Taipei City Council said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Cheng-teh, the DPP caucus whip, said that after the
reunification of Germany in 1990, the German Communist Party, better
known as the DKP (Deutsche Kommunistische Partei), supported the
passage of a law governing political parties and political groups that
required all German parties to reveal their assets and refrain from
operating any profit-making enterprises.</P>
      <P>In line with the law, Chen said, the German federal government
has continued to dig into the DKP's ill-gotten assets. In 1998, an
independent commission came up with an investigative report saying
that the DKP, which is still a force in German politics today under
the designation of the Party of Democratic Socialism, had accumulated
a stash of US$60 billion in ill-gotten assets during its rule of East
Germany. In 2003, the commission furnished the German parliament with
another report that the DKP had additional assets in Luxembourg,
Austria, Switzerland and Hungary. Up until now, the commission
remains operational.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Chen said, the KMT has consistently resisted the
appeal for returning its ill-gotten party assets to national coffers.
In March 1992, then-DPP Legislator Peng Pei-hsien first brought up
the KMT's ill-gotten assets issue during a legislative interpellation
session.</P>
      <P>Another DPP legislator, Lai Ching-lin, came up with a draft bill
on the disposition of the KMT's ill-gotten assets and the
establishment of a political party development fund in March 2000
after the KMT lost a presidential election earlier that month.</P>
      <P>"So many years have passed, the KMT still drags its feet on
disposing of its ill-gotten assets. The party has joined with its
'pan-blue alliance' ally, the People First Party, to stonewall the
inclusion of a Cabinet-proposed bill on the disposition of political
parties' ill-gotten assets into the legislative agenda," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Quoting official tallies, Chen said, the KMT, which fled to
Taiwan in 1949 after losing a bloody civil war to the Chinese
communists on the mainland and ruled Taiwan uninterruptedly until May
2000, has so far returned a marginal 1. 3 percent of its ill-gotten
real estate back to the national coffers.</P>

      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) --
Taiwan's top-ranking university -- has mapped out a detailed plan to
advance itself into the world's top 100 universities in 10 years, NTU
president Li Si-chen said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Answering questions at a joint meeting of the legislature's
Education and Culture Committee and Budget and Final Accounts
Committee, Li said NTU had begun its planning six years ago, and that
the persistent efforts have borne fruit this month, with the Ministry
of Education earmarking NT$6 billion (US$180.7 million) over two
years for NTU's further enhancement.</P>
      <P>The funds came under a government plan to appropriate NT$50
billion over five years to help Taiwan's top universities improve
their international rankings.</P>
      <P>Li said NTU plans to seek breakthroughs in 10 to 15 fields of
study and will use the funds to improve the software and the
infrastructure of the school and create a better research environment
so that the university can achieve its goal of presenting more than
5,000 academic theses in the next five years.</P>
      <P>He said he is confident that NTU will be ranked among the world's
top 100 universities within the next decade.</P>
      <P>According to the 2005 Higher Education Supplement compiled by The

      <P>Mandarin Airlines is set to ply the first
charter flight from Taichung in central Taiwan to Hong Kong Thursday,
with the plane 70 percent full, a spokesman for the aviation company
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>About 70 passengers, mainly members of a tour group organized by
a tourist agency based in Taichung, will board the plane, which is
slated to depart Chingchuankang Airport in Taichung at 5: 00 p.m. and
to return from Hong Kong empty later the same day, the spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines was granted the approval late Tuesday to run
two charter flights to Hong Kong by the civil aviation authorities in
the territory, with the second flight set for Sunday, which will
bring back the tour group to Taichung, he said.</P>
      <P>The approval came at the last minute and was a surprise to
Mandarin Airlines, which filed an application with Hong Kong a few
months ago, leaving very little time for the Taipei-based carrier to
lure a larger number of passengers, he noted, pointing out that the
company might not apply for flights next month during the low season.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, UNI Airways has yet to receive Hong Kong's permission
to operate Taichung-Hong Kong charter flights Oct. 27 and Oct. 30.</P>
      <P>Although Chingchuankang Airport is dubbed as an international
airport by Taiwan's civil aviation authorities, it can only

      <P>Minister of Transportation and

one week whether his deputy, Chou Li-liang, should step down and face
investigation by public prosecutors for profiteering involving the
Kaohsiung rapid transit railway project.</P>
      <P>Replying to questions from Legislator Huang Chao-shun during an

    <HEADLINE>IRREGULARITIES IN NAVY BOATS CONTRACT WILL BE INVESTIGATED: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  19 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If any irregularities are found to have
taken place in the bidding for 30 missile-equipped ROC Navy
speedboats, the defense ministry will refer the case to prosecutors,
Minister of National Defense Lee Jye told lawmakers Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks at the National Defense committee of the
Legislative Yuan in reply to Democratic Progressive Party Legislator
Lee Wen-chung, who said there were several "suspicious points"
regarding the ROC Navy's Kuang Hua No. 6 Shipbuilding Project.</P>
      <P>The minister said he was not aware of the review process that was
handled by the Cabinet's Public Construction Commission (PCC), but he
admitted that there may be "something strange" about the fact that a
company offering a lower price did not win the bid.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that there had been no so-called "pressure from
above" during the bidding process.</P>
      <P>Although China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) was awarded the contract
for the vessels, controversy surrounds the nature of the rankings for
two other companies that did not win the bid.</P>
      <P>Lee Wen-hung pointed to two unusual things about the bidding
process: according to a PCC report, of the 10 review committee
members, five gave Ching Fu Shipbuilding Co. a first-place ranking
while the other five ranked it third.</P>
      <P>These 10 members, five from the private sector and five from the
military, did just the opposite for Jong Shyn Shipbuilding Co. --
with five ranking it first and five putting it third.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the five who gave Ching Fu full marks were
from the military while those placing it third were private-sector
experts. The two groups made the exact opposite assessment of Jong
Shyn.</P>
      <P>He said the authorities should look into the original bidding
files to see if there had been any problems with the two companies
and their connections with these two groups of review committee
members.</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party Legislator Sun Ta-chien suspected
that the two companies might have known beforehand the identities of
the 10 people who were going to vet the tenders.</P>
      <P>Sun claimed at a news conference at the legislature that Ching Fu
Chairman Chen Ching-nan has close ties with President Chen Shui-bian,
while Jong Shyn Chairman Han Pi-hsiang is well connected to first
lady Wu Shu-jen and Vice President Annette Lu, resulting in a bidding
race that more resembled a "duel between two factions inside the
court," instead of a business deal.</P>
      <P>He said Ching Fu has an "extremely poor record" of building
frigates for the navy, and yet the five military experts still ranked
it No. 1. This seems to indicate that its chairman must have had
access to the list of the review committee members, which should have
remained confidential, he asserted.</P>
      <P>In the end, CSBC won the bidding by beating out Ching Fu and Jong
Shyn. However, Sun said, Jong Shyn's appeal to the PCC did not
complain about the CSBC but instead focused criticism on Ching Fu,
meaning that CSBC was kept out of the fray.</P>
      <P>He urged the prosecution to investigate the PCC's decision-making
process, adding that the defense ministry should also explain why the
navy has suddenly suspended the procurement process.</P>
      <P>Even though the CSBC, by all reports, was given the contract, the
building project was halted after Jong Shyn launched a publicity
campaign to sway the awarding of the contract on the grounds that it
can do the same job at a lower price.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SECOND-PHASE REFORM AIMED AT MEGA-MERGERS, COMPETITIVENESS: OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Wu Rong-i defended the
government's policy Wednesday to carry out the second-phase of
financial reform, underlining the urgent need for Taiwan's banks to
merge and sharpen their competitive edge internationally.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan's banks are not competitive either at home
or abroad due to their relatively small scale and assets, Wu said
that the government means to make domestic banking institutions
bigger and stronger through the second-round of reform to tackle
aggressive foreign competition.</P>
      <P>For instance, Wu said, the five largest banks in South Korea take
a combined 79 market share at home, while Taiwan's five biggest banks
only grab a 37 percent market share, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Smaller asset holdings also drag down the competitiveness of
Taiwan's banks, he said, adding that the Citibank Group of the United
States has US$1 trillion in assets, far ahead of the Bank of Taiwan,
the most representative state-run bank that has NT$2.5 trillion in
assets (US$74 billion) , the world's 125th, while Cathay Financial
Holdings, Taiwan's largest financial services company, has US$80
billion.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks during a televised debate with opposition
lawmakers over the government's second-phase financial reform plan,
which has drawn flak from the opposition camp that accuses the
government of intending to sell state property cheaply to special
vested groups.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng said that the second-round
financial revamp plan is meant to build Taiwan into a financial hub
in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's financial industry must seek to catch up with the pace
of the domestic manufacturing sector that has for some time engaged
in global market deployment, Hu said, stressing that the domestic
financial services sector should also branch out to better serve
Taiwan companies abroad.</P>
      <P>To be competitive in foreign markets, Taiwan banks must gain
momentum through mergers to sustain scale operations overseas, he
argued, claiming that 41 state-run banks, though slashed from
originally 47, are still too many compared to those in other
countries such as Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and South
Korea.</P>
      <P>Responding to the question of whether the deadline set for the
end of this year is too early and the process has been clumsy, the
CEPD head pledged that the government will review relevant measures
and make necessary adjustments toward its ultimate goal of making
Taiwan a regional financial center.</P>
      <P>Financial reform has been one of the government's top priorities
since President Chen Shui-bian first came to power in 2000. The
first-phase financial overhaul successfully wrote off much of Taiwan
banks' bad loans.</P>

      <P>The "one-child policy" may be fine for
China, but Taiwan's falling birthrate has prompted officials to
advocate three-child families, with the slogan: "Two kids are happy,
three kids are lively."</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of the Interior Chang Wen-ying said Wednesday that
the ministry has recently published two brochures on population
affairs, with one focusing on new immigrants and the other on locals.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that Taiwanese families have been leaning
toward having only a single child, and the ministry has for some time
been asking families to consider having two children.</P>
      <P>However, according to Chang, the birth rate in Taiwan has been
declining significantly in the last decade, with the number of
newborn babies dropping from 325,000 in 1996 to only 115,000 in the
first seven months of this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese women are inclined to have fewer children due largely
to economic factors and increasing concerns about raising a child,
Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang said if the situation continues, the economic burden for
the new generation in caring for their elderly parents in the future
will increase dramatically.</P>
      <P>In addition, more and more government statistics are showing that
Taiwan's population is aging rapidly, with the island expected to
become an "aged society" by 2018, causing many complicated problems
for the society.</P>

      <P>Taiwan would be better able to resist
China's pressure through becoming more democratic, more open and more
liberal, National Security Council Secretary-General Chiou I-jen said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan budget screening
session, Chiou said a certain number of retired military, police and
security officers have indeed traveled to China and offered
Taiwan-related intelligence to Chinese authorities in exchange for
personal benefits.</P>
      <P>"As Taiwan has become an open, democratic country, we cannot
illegally wiretap anyone," Chiou said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he said, the government has stepped up national
security measures to cope with the new situation. As part of this
campaign, Chiou said President Chen Shui-bian recently called a
high-level national security conference and urged the executive
branch to look into the inroads of Chinese underworld figures into
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the face of China's threat, Chiou said he is convinced that
Taiwan must become even more democratic, more open and more liberal

    <HEADLINE>SPY AGENCIES DENY PROVIDING 'SOONG-CHEN MEETING' INFO TO PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eight intelligence agencies denied Thursday
that they had provided any information about the alleged secret
meeting between People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong and
Chinese official Chen Yunlin in the United States to President Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Officials from the eight units, including the National Security
Bureau (NSB) , the Bureau of Investigation under the Ministry of
Justice, and the Military Intelligence Bureau under the Ministry of
National Defense, also denied that the Presidential Office or
National Security Council (NSC) , which is headed by the president,
had ordered them to check the allegation.</P>
      <P>The officials were invited to a breakfast meeting by the PFP's
legislative caucus, during which they all denied that they had given
any such information to the president.</P>
      <P>During two recent TV interviews, President Chen claimed that
Soong met with the director of China's Taiwan Affairs Office in the
United States in January. Soong has filed two libel suits against the
president, demanding NT$50 million in compensation and an apology
published in major newspapers for three days in a row.</P>
      <P>NSB Chief Secretary Lin Cheng-tung said his bureau, which gathers
all sorts of intelligence from other spy agencies, sends to the
president only the information that it regards as valuable. And what
his bureau has presented to the president does not include the
so-called "Soong-Chen (Yunlin) meeting," he added.</P>
      <P>NSB Director Hsueh Shih-min had earlier told the legislature that
if the NSB had given any information about the alleged "Soong-Chen
meeting" to the president, he would step down to take responsibility.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Chang Hsien-yao asked Lin Cheng-tung and other spy
agencies' representatives at the breakfast meeting if they had been
asked by the Presidential Office or the NSC to double-check the
validity of the president's allegation. The reply was a unanimous
"no."</P>
      <P>Lin said, besides the eight units being represented at the
breakfast meeting, "there should be no other government units in
Taiwan whose mandate is intelligence gathering and analysis."</P>
      <P>Chang said that since the eight units claimed they had neither
supplied to the president nor checked the alleged information, the
president might have disclosed a piece of "false information" that
had not been confirmed, indicating he had "poor judgment in trying to
use false information as a political tool."</P>
      <P>As to the president's claim that his allegation "was based on
something, " Chang said that "something" could be "fabricated" in the
event that the president were forced to show it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN HOPES KOREA WON'T CAVE IN TO CHINA'S PRESSURE ON APEC ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Thursday urged
South Korea, the host of this year's annual informal leadership
summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, not to
cave in to Chinese pressure and to respect his decision to send
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng to attend the meeting on his
behalf.</P>
      <P>President Chen made the remarks while receiving a parliamentary
and academic delegation from South Korea at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>His words came after China voiced vehement opposition to the idea
of Wang serving as the president's envoy to the summit which is set
to take place in the southern Korean port city of Busan Nov. 18-19.</P>
      <P>Beijing argued that according to a memorandum of understanding
signed in 1992 before Taiwan -- formally designated in APEC as
Chinese Taipei -- joined the organization, Taiwan can only send its
"minister in charge of APEC-related economic affairs" to attend the
meeting, adding that APEC "has operated on this basis" since then.</P>
      <P>President Chen noted that he had told South Korean APEC envoy Yun
Hai-Jung, who was sent by South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun to
Taipei last week to deliver an invitation from APEC, that he was keen
on attending the Busan summit meeting.</P>
      <P>As the serving president of the Republic of China, he has the
same rights and obligations to attend the meeting as any of the other
heads of state of member countries, the president told Yun.</P>
      <P>He claimed that Beijing's rhetoric that there was a tacit
agreement or understanding when Taiwan was admitted into the regional
organization that Taiwan's head of state would not attend the summit
meetings "is completely wrong."</P>
      <P>In 1991, South Korea used its political acumen and diplomatic
tact to help Taiwan, China and Hong Kong enter APEC simultaneously
the following year, Chen noted, adding that the understanding
involved only whether foreign affairs ministers from Taiwan should
attend the summit meetings.</P>
      <P>At the initiative of former U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1993,
an APEC informal leadership meeting was inaugurated, Chen noted,
adding that the issue of whether Taiwan's head of state could attend
such meetings had not been discussed when the island entered the
organization.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that Taiwan does not want to see South Korea cave
in to Chinese pressure, adding that China's obstruction has prevented
him from attending. He pointed out that he decided not to push to
attend the summit because he didn't want to put Seoul in a difficult
position and that he therefore appointed Wang as his envoy.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Wang, a heavyweight of the main Kuomintang (KMT),
has gladly accepted and that the KMT is happy to see him go. Wang's
attendance at the summit "is an aspiration shared across the party
spectrum," the president claimed.</P>
      <P>He further said that he regrets that Beijing openly expressed its
opposition to Wang's attending the meeting, saying that the APEC
forum belongs to all members, including Taiwan, and that Taiwan's
head of state, and not Beijing authorities, should decide who his
envoy to the summit will be.</P>
      <P>APEC, which is dedicated to promoting free flow of information,
trade and investment, groups 21 economies, including Australia,
Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South
Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru,
Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States
and Vietnam.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LACK OF IDENTITY BIGGEST THREAT FACING TAIWAN: FORMER PRESIDENT LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington  D.C.,  Oct.  19 (CNA)
(By Winnie Chi and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's own lack of identity,
rather than Beijing's united front tactics, is the biggest threat
facing the country, former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
said Wednesday in Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Speaking to hundreds of Taiwan expatriates during a dinner
banquet, Lee said that China has been using every means at its
disposal to try to "lure" Taiwan into unification, adding that the
people of Taiwan must not give up the battle despite mounting
difficulties and must continue "sticking to the right path to make
Taiwan a normal and happy country."</P>
      <P>The greatest challenge facing Taiwan is not China's military
intimidation, rather it is the country's own lack of identity, Lee
said, adding that the major purpose of his current visit to the
United States is to help Washington better understand the prime
threat facing Taiwan. He stressed that "Taiwan is Taiwan, and it is
by no means a part of China."</P>
      <P>Lee urged the banquet attendees to be "new era Taiwanese" and
encouraged them to wholeheartedly support Taiwan's "native regime" to
counter China's ambition to "swallow Taiwan up."</P>
      <P>The former president also received a copy of the U.S. Declaration

      <P>The Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche will
not discriminate against Taiwan in considering its request for
licensing to mass-produce Tamiflu, an anti-viral drug for the
treatment of influenza, a company official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai Chao-cheng, spokesman for Roche's Taiwan
branch, when considering similar requests put forth by various
countries, the size of these countries and whether they are a member
of the World Health Organization are not Roche's concern.</P>
      <P>The company will negotiate details related to royalties with
these countries individually based on their conditions and the
situation of avian influenza outbreaks in their countries, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) has asked to negotiate with Roche
for licensing to mass-produce Tamiflu in Taiwan to increase the
country's stockpiles of the drug, as a precautionary measure against
a possible bird flu pandemic.</P>
      <P>A spokesman with Roche's headquarters in Switzerland told CNA
earlier this week that any country cooperating with Roche in
producing Tamiflu must follow proper quality standards and safety
guidelines.</P>
      <P>The DOH has coordinated with the Intellectual Property Office
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs to prepare for matters
involving the negotiations.</P>
      <P>Also, the DOH has authorized ScinoPharm Taiwan and Yung Zip

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF WOMEN DRUNK DRIVERS UP IN TAIPEI OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei police statistics have shown that
the number of women caught drunk driving in the last three years has
increased significantly in spite of the fact that harsher penalties
for the offense have been imposed.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Taipei Municipal Police Department
show that the number of drunken drivers on roads around Taipei over
the last three years still centers on the age group between 31 and
50.</P>
      <P>Taipei police officers noted that since stiffer penalties were
imposed in 2002 for drunk drivers in Taipei, the number of young
drunk drivers is still increasing, with 18- to 20-year-olds
accounting for the bulk. Those between 21 and 30 also increased
slightly by 2 percent over the last three years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ratio of women drunk drivers rose significantly
from 5.9 percent in 2002 to 7.4 percent this year, the police
officers added.</P>
      <P>The statistics also showed that the number of drunk drivers
caught in Taipei in the first nine months of this year totalled
14,000, a growth of 12 percent over the same period of last year, or
an increase of 1,500 cases.</P>
      <P>Police officers expressed concern that the number of drunk driver
will rise further over the next few months as that is the peak season
for drunk driving due to several Chinese traditional festivals,
including Chinese Lunar New Year.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou has instructed traffic policemen to
strengthen anti-drunk driving campaigns and to catch those violating

    <HEADLINE>DPP FORGING CONSENSUS ON EX-PRESIDENTS' BENEFITS LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Reviewing the law governing benefits for
former presidents and vice presidents is consistent with the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) image as a party of integrity
and reform, so the DPP legislative caucus will try to forge a
consensus on amending the law Friday, said caucus secretary-general
William C.T. Lai Thursday.</P>
      <P>The law became an issue after DPP Legislator Lin Chuo-shui
proposed looking into the appropriateness of using taxpayers' money
to pay for life-time preferential treatment of former presidents and
vice presidents of the nation.</P>
      <P>Under the current law, a former president and vice president
together get an annual pension of NT$52 million (US$1.54 million) ;
with an annual 3 percent growth adjusted for inflation, it will cost
the government NT$8.5 billion (US$252.33 million) for five pairs of
them in 30 year, Lin said.</P>
      <P>He cited 2001 U.S. figures as saying that five former U.S.
presidents were paid altogether only US$2.5 million (NT$82.25
million) a year, while Taiwan' s ex-president and ex-vice president
are together getting NT$52 million a year. U.S. vice presidents do
not get more than a seven-month relocation allowance.</P>
      <P>If five pairs of former presidents and vice presidents were to be
paid in a similar manner, it would cost Taiwan NT$260 million
(US$7.72 million) a year. However, the per capita GDP in the U.S. is
three times that of Taiwan, meaning Taiwan's ex-presidents and vice
presidents would be paid nine times their U.S. counterparts, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Lin accused the KMT, which was the ruling party until 2000, of
"tailor-making" the law to include former vice president Lien Chan in
the beneficiaries, so that Lien, now honorary chairman of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , has been receiving NT$470,000
(US$13,952) a month in retirement benefits, including NT$220,000
(US$6,531) generated under a special "18 percent annual interest
program."</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang said Lien's 18 percent benefit is
larger than that for the incumbent and retired presidents, an
obviously unreasonable situation that calls for a change.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislative caucus said Lien had been in government
service for several decades, and what he is getting is entirely
legal. "If the law or the system has any problem, that can be
discussed, " said Pan Wei-kang, deputy secretary-general of the
caucus.</P>
      <P>In order not to increase the country's financial burden, she said
the law should indeed be amended. The KMT Central Policy Committee is
studying the issue and is expected to come up with a proposal to
amend the law, she added.</P>
      <P>As the amendment will also affect former President Lee Teng-hui,
the spiritual leader of the minor opposition party Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) , people are watching how it will respond to the DPP
initiative.</P>
      <P>Ho Min-hao, convener of the TSU legislative caucus, agreed with
DPP's Lin that the law must be changed to meet people's expectations
for the sake of social justice.</P>
      <P>"We will make a proposal at the legislature for changing the law,
if no other caucuses do it, " Ho said, acknowledging that this would
shrink Lee's benefits.</P>
      <P>"We are aiming to build a long-lasting system, not aiming at any
particular person," he added.</P>
      <P>Lai agreed with Ho, saying if the amendment passes the
legislature, as it now looks likely, the retirement benefits for Lee,
Lien and former vice president Lee Yuan-zu, as well as DPP's Chen
Shui-bian and Annette Lu will all be reduced.</P>
      <P>"So it will be a change of the system that is issue-oriented
rather than individual-oriented," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CANNOT ACCEPT 'DOMESTIC ROUTE' FOR 2008 OLYMPIC TORCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Olympic torch will not pass through
Taiwan in 2008 if Beijing insists on designating Taiwan as part of
China's "domestic route, " officials from the National Council on
Physical Fitness and Sports said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will not accept a "domestic route" invitation, said Chang
Fen-fen, director of the council's International Affairs Department,
adding that so far, Taiwan has not received any information about
arrangements for the 2008 Olympics torch relay.</P>
      <P>Reports from Hong Kong said that Hong Kong's Secretary for Home
Affairs Patrick Ho told members of the Legislative Council Wednesday
that Hong Kong will be one of the stops that Beijing has committed to
the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the 2008 Olympics torch
relay, which will also include stops in Tibet, the Yangzi River, the
Yellow River, the Great Wall, Macau and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the latest reports, Chang said that according to
Olympic protocol, the Olympic torch relay is divided into a "domestic
route" and "international route." While the host country can
choose freely the cities where the torch relay will pass, the
"international route" must be decided upon by the separate national
Olympic committees of the various countries.</P>
      <P>The host country should notify the separate national Olympic
committees about where the "international route" will pass one year
or one-and-a-half years ahead of time according to Olympic protocol,
Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang added that her council contacted the IOC headquarters
Thursday and was told that the IOC has yet to hear anything from the
Chinese Olympic Committee about details of the "international route"
of the 2008 Olympic torch relay.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chu Shou-chien, vice chairman of the National Council
on Physical Fitness and Sports, said that the Chinese Olympic
Committee has continuously released news since March this year that
the 2008 Olympic torch will be relayed to Taiwan from Hong Kong or
Macau, apparently including Taiwan into the "domestic route"
arrangement, which is absolutely unacceptable to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chu said that both Taiwan and China are separately registered
members of the IOC and Taiwan enjoys equal status to China on the
IOC, stressing that Taiwan will not accept Beijing's "domestic route"
plan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Health Research Institutes
(NHRI) has developed an avian influenza vaccine that is intended for
emergency use in the case of a bird flu outbreak in Taiwan, an NHRI
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The achievement was made in cooperation with Chang Gung
University, using the H5N1 strain of the virus from Vietnamese
patients, which was obtained by the Department of Health (DOH)
through the help of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, according to Su Ih-jen, director of the NHRI's Division
of Clinical Research.</P>
      <P>Su said the vaccine is only good for emergency use and may not be
effective in preventing the disease because the H5N1 virus strain is
still mutating.</P>
      <P>Only vaccines produced one year after an epidemic will have
preventive effects, Su noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the NHRI is constructing a pilot vaccine plant, which
will serve as a bridge between experimental vaccines and commercial
vaccines. The plant is expected to be completed in 2007.</P>
      <P>The DOH is also considering cooperating with international
pharmaceutical companies in establishing a vaccine plant in Taiwan,

    <HEADLINE>CHEN URGES EARLY REVIEW OF ARMS PROCUREMENT FOR SAKE OF THE NATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Thursday urged
the Legislative Yuan to review the arms procurement package as soon
as possible, saying that continued boycotting of the package by the
opposition will put the future of Taiwan in jeopardy.</P>
      <P>President Chen reaffirmed the importance of the arms procurement
package from the United States when he received representatives of 
overseas Chinese associations from the United States. The package has
been stalled in the legislature for more than a year due to the
opposition of "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the
People First Party.</P>
      <P>The package includes eight diesel-electric submarines, a squadron
of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six Patriot PAC-III
anti-missile batteries.</P>
      <P>The president said lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait will rely
on the democratization of China, the goodwill of China toward Taiwan
and the strengthening of Taiwan's self-defense capabilities, although
the first two things are not within Taiwan's control.</P>
      <P>He criticized the opposition parties for basing national security
on the goodwill of the nation's enemies, saying that individuals'
political gambling on public security will put the future of the
nation in jeopardy.</P>
      <P>The president said the most likely flashpoints in the
Asia-Pacific region are the Korean Peninsula and the Taiwan Strait,
adding that the dispute across the Taiwan Strait is not an internal
affair as claimed by China, but will directly impact peace, stability
and safety of the whole region.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that the international community is in
lock-step that the status quo of the Taiwan Strait should not be
unilaterally changed and that cross-strait disputes should be solved
by peaceful means.</P>
      <P>He said that the arms procurement project, which is crucial to
upgrading military equipment and combat readiness, has been
stonewalled for 33 times in a row in the legislature because of the
boycott of the "pan-blue alliance" on various grounds, such as the
price is too high, the items do not meet needs of the nation's
defense, and that the money should not be listed in a special budget,
but in the regular one.</P>
      <P>However, he called these reasons "far-fetched, " adding that if
there are differences on these issues, they should be put to the
legislative defense committee for substantial review, instead of
excluding them from the working agenda over and over.</P>
      <P>This has highlighted the nature of "opposing for opposition's
sake" of the "pan-blue alliance," he said.</P>
      <P>The president said that another reason given by the "pan-blue
alliance" comes from KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who has said that the
government should actively pursue cross-strait peace, and not to
engage in an arms race with the other side of the Taiwan Strait.
This, however, is a "deliberate attempt to pit Taiwan Strait peace
against the strengthening of national defense, and to deny the needs
of Taiwan to upgrade combat readiness," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that national security should be the
"common language" across the party spectrum, and that the public
"should not take chances" on this issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PRESIDENT LEE WARNS OF DANGERS OF AN UNDEMOCRATIC CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  19 (CNA)
(By Chen Yung-chan and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui gave a
speech Wednesday at the U.S. Capitol, warning that an undemocratic
China threats world peace and is the prime factor for conflict in
Asia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the United States have long shared the same
aspirations for democracy and freedom and for peace and security in
the Asia-Pacific region, Lee said, adding that as a thick-and-thin
partner of the United States, Taiwan treasures very much bilateral
relations and has been committed to forging mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>Out of a common concern over the situation in the region, Taiwan
will do its best to stabilize cross-Taiwan Strait relations to
protect the interests of both Taiwan and the U.S., Lee said.</P>
      <P>However, he called attention to the rise of an authoritarian
China, which has been expanding rapidly on both the economic and
military fronts in recent years and fanning fresh uncertainties in
cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he personally went through the pain of World War
II and the ups-and-downs of Japan's militarism, he said he strongly
believes that democratization is the answer to a country's progress
and Asia's development as a whole. Therefore, China's democratization
will be the key to avoiding conflict in Asia, he said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. leadership role is indispensable in maintaining peace in
Asia and Taiwan fully supports a continued U.S. presence as a
peacemaker in the international community, he said, appealing for
strong U.S. backing for Taiwan people's desire for peace and to
maintain their own lifestyles.</P>
      <P>Scores of U.S. Congressmen, including two Senators, George Allen
(R-VA) and Tim Johnson (D-SD) -- co-chairmen of the Taiwan Caucus at
the Senate, and four representatives, Steve Chabot (R-OH), Sherrod
Brown (D-OH) , Robert Wexler (D-FL) and Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) --
co-chairmen of the Taiwan Caucus at the House, were present on the
occasion.</P>
      <P>In a party they hosted in honor of Lee at the Capitol, the
Congressmen praised Lee as a hero for Taiwan's democratization and
presented a U. S. flag that had flown over the Capitol to Lee as a
gift.</P>
      <P>Lee is the first former president from Taiwan to address the U.S.
Congress. He visited Anchorage, Alaska and New York before coming to
Washington, D. C. on his current two-week U.S. swing.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by David Lee, Republic of China Representative to the
U. S., Lee also took part in a dinner banquet with more than 500
Taiwan expatriates later the same day at the Hilton Hotel.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BIRDWATCHERS TO GATHER DROPPINGS IN FIGHT AGAINST BIRD FLU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is enlisting birdwatchers in the
fight against avian influenza by asking them to collect droppings
from migratory birds in 10 cities and counties for testing, the
Council of Agriculture announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The council's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and
Quarantine said Thursday that it has asked members of the Wild Bird
Society of Taipei to collect bird droppings in the wetlands of the 10
cities and counties to be tested for the avian flu virus, H5N1.</P>
      <P>These wetlands are located in the cities of Taipei and Tainan,
and in the counties of Ilan, Changhua, Chiayi, Taichung, Tainan,
Kaohsiung, Pingtung and Penghu.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the bureau said the birdwatchers will collect
3,000 specimens of bird droppings this year, up from last year's
2,000.</P>
      <P>He added that measures are being taken at the same time to
tighten controls on stores that sell pet birds and prevent the
smuggling of birds from other countries into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to a wire report, the coast guard seized birds being
smuggled from China into Taiwan on Oct. 14 and tests confirmed that
about 1,000 of the birds were infected with the H5N1 virus, the first
time the strain had been detected on the island since late 2003.</P>
      <P>The animals were destroyed and posed no health threat, said a
health department official.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei City Government authorities urged Taipei
residents not to catch or sell wild birds, as they face a fine
between NT$60,000 and NT$300,000 under the Wildlife Conservation Act
for doing so.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington, Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By Y.C. Chen and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former ROC President Lee Teng-hui urged
the people of Taiwan Wednesday to support the government's arms
procurement package from the United States to show their resolve to
defend their country.</P>
      <P>Addressing a welcoming reception hosted by the Taiwanese
expatriate community in the U.S. capital, Lee said the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan's blocking of the procurement
has resulted in the misunderstanding that Taiwan is expecting
Americans to go to war for the island.</P>
      <P>However, Lee affirmed that regardless of whether there is any
security commitment from the United States or the international
community, the people of Taiwan will stick to their pursuit for
democracy and independence in the face of the threat posed by the
Chinese Communist regime.</P>
      <P>Lee said the Anti-Secession Law enacted by Beijing early this
year is intended as an excuse to attack Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the military capabilities of China will be the
most powerful from the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing to the 2010
Shanghai World Expo, which will make attacking Taiwan very simple.</P>
      <P>It will only take one day for China to annex Taiwan if a
pro-China government is elected in 2008 in Taiwan, Lee predicted,
calling on the people to monitor the government closely and to
support the continuation of a democratic, pro-Taiwan government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he expressed his disapproval of the belief that China
will start democratization when its economy develops to a certain
extent, saying that the strong economic power of China will only pose
a greater threat to the world.</P>
      <P>Washington is the third leg of Lee's two-week U.S. visit, which
has already taken him to Alaska and New York. Lee delivered a speech
on Capitol Hill earlier Wednesday and is scheduled to give another
speech at the National Press Club on Thursday before flying to Los

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
has sent a letter to his South Korean counterpart expressing Taiwan's
stance that the country should be given the same rights as that of
other member economies of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum.</P>
      <P>According to Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Michel
Lu, South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Ban Ki-moon
said at a news conference in Seoul Thursday that it will be in
conformity with APEC's spirit and previous practices if Taiwan can
send an official responsible for economic affairs to attend the
annual informal leadership summit to be held in the South Korean port
city of Busan Nov. 18-19.</P>
      <P>Ban made the remarks following Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian's decision to designate Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng to attend the leadership summit on his behalf several days
ago, a decision that China strongly opposes.</P>
      <P>ROC presidents have had to name his special envoys to attend the
APEC summit since 1993 due to the objections of China to his
participation in the meeting in person.</P>
      <P>Lu revealed that the foreign minister has sent a letter to Ban
reaffirming the country's position that Taiwan should enjoy the same
rights as that of other APEC members to have its top leader attend
the summit.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that Taiwan has been fighting with other APEC members
against this unusual situation for many years. However, the efforts
have failed again and again because of strong opposition from
Beijing, Lu added.</P>
      <P>Although the host country of this year's APEC leadership summit
has expressed its stance in this regard, Taiwan will continue
soliciting support from other APEC members to gain a solution which
is to the greatest benefit of Taiwan, Lu stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T CAN'T FORCE KMT TO RETURN IMPROPERLY OBTAINED ASSETS: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Finance Minister Lee Ruey-tsang said
Thursday that barring the legislation of a party asset bill, the
government can only try to persuade, instead of forcing, the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to return their improperly obtained party
assets.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks when he was invited by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) to report on the handling of KMT assets.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the ministry can only check the real estate and not
the liquidity of the KMT. The KMT has used illegal means during its
five decades in power to obtain around 144 hectares of real estate,
which is worth around NT$21.9 billion (US$653.73 million) in market
value, Lee said.</P>
      <P>So far, the KMT has returned 1.8 hectares, or around NT$1.2
billion in market value, accounting for 1.7 percent of the total
amount of the total it should return.</P>
      <P>As for the five theaters with a market value of between NT$1
billion and NT$1.2 billion, which the KMT had originally agreed to
return, the government had hoped to see either the return of the
property or the equivalent in cash, but the KMT is only willing to
return NT$300 million in cash and has sold only one of the theaters,
Lee said.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Hsu Kuo-yung said that the KMT is sitting on a
gold mine, but is only willing to return a fraction of its ill-gotten
assets. He is asking the party to think about the feelings of the
public, and that the Ministry of Finance should use all its resources
to go after the KMT's assets.</P>
      <P>William Lai, a DPP caucus whip in the legislature, said that KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou has repeatedly said that it is continuously
returning the assets to the nation, but in reality, the amount is
less than 2 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ma said that the KMT will return party assets but on
the other hand he is obstructing the passage of a party asset bill,
which clearly shows "he lacks sincerity," Lai claimed.</P>
      <P>In response, Ma said that if the DPP has any allegations
regarding the KMT's handling of its party assets, they should
"produce evidence, " instead of "just shouting slogans."</P>
      <P>Chang Tzer-cheng, the KMT's deputy secretary-general, said that
all KMT assets were "legally obtained."</P>
      <P>Chang noted that Lee has based his calculations on information
since 1949 when the KMT administration retreated to Taiwan after
losing the Chinese civil war, saying that this was a "purge."</P>
      <P>He questioned Lee's wording of "illegal means," claiming that all
assets under the name of the KMT are backed by lawful certificates to
prove that they were obtained legally.</P>
      <P>He also said that the KMT has so far returned over 100 pieces of
land, and Lee's remarks that the KMT has only returned 1.8
hectares is "very unreasonable."</P>

    <HEADLINE>H5N1-INFECTED BIRDS SEIZED, TAIWAN REMAINS BIRD FLU-FREE: COA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan remains avian flu-free despite cages
of birds smuggled from China that tested positive for H5N1 -- the
avian flu strain that poses the greatest threat of mutating into a
form that could ignite a human pandemic -- officials from the Council
of Agriculture (COA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>COA experts confirmed Thursday that 270 out of some 1,000
smuggled birds discovered in a Panama-registered freighter anchored
in Taichung Harbor, central Taiwan Oct. 14 were believed to be
infected with H5N1.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held to address the crackdown on the
largest-ever smuggling of birds to Taiwan from China, officials from
the COA Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine
said that most of the 1,000 birds, of 19 species, were dead when
they were discovered by Coast Guard officials in Taichung Harbor.</P>
      <P>Of the 19 species, three kinds -- Gracula religiosa, Oriolus
chinensis and Leiothrix lutea -- were assumed to be H5N1 positive, as
nine of the birds randomly selected from the three kinds, numbering
about 270, tested H5N1 positive, the officials said.</P>
      <P>All of the smuggled birds were destroyed by burning, the
officials said, adding that another some 500 pet mice and tortoises
also discovered in the same raid on the same freighter were also
destroyed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to the COA officials, the second mate of the
freighter, a Chinese national, has been detained and kept under
medical watch since he was the sole mastermind behind the smuggling
and all of the smuggled animals were found in his cabin.</P>
      <P>Health examination results showed that the second officer had not
contracted bird flu. The officer, however, has been receiving doses
of Tamiflu prescribed for him. He will be off the Tamiflu doses as of
Oct. 25 if he shows no bird flu symptoms by then, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The other 24 crew members were repatriated to Fuzhou in China,
where the freighter departed for Taiwan via Ishigaki Island in
Japan's Okinawa Prefecture around Oct. 12, the officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOONG CLAIMS HE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO SUE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>James Soong, chairman of the opposition
People First Party (PFP), claimed Thursday that he has been left with
no choice but to sue President Chen Shui-bian for alleging that he
met with a ranking Chinese official in secret early this year in the
United States.</P>
      <P>Soong stressed that he did not meet with Chen Yun-lin, director
of the Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council, during his
visit to the United States, rebutting Chen's allegation made during a
TV program May 8.</P>
      <P>According to Soong, if he had not taken legal action, people
would take it to mean a tacit acknowledgement from him that he did
meet with the Chinese official.</P>
      <P>The PFP chairman said he had offered the president a way out from
the situation in a TV interview May 18, saying that he understood
that the vast amount of information a national leader receives every
day might not always be true and that he would not pursue the case if
the president apologized after discovering that he had been wrongly
informed.</P>
      <P>He said he could not "let this thing pass, " although he claimed
he did not like to be involved in a lawsuit with the president.</P>
      <P>Soong filed a lawsuit June 3, seeking a symbolic NT$1 in
compensation for defamation of his reputation, plus an apology in
writing in the form of an advertisement in major newspapers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, after the president renewed the allegation in a TV talk
show Oct. 18, Soong filed a second lawsuit, changing the charge to
"aggravated defamation" and raising the damages he is seeking to
NT$50 million.</P>
      <P>The second lawsuit also demands that the president place apology
advertisements in major Taiwan and foreign newspapers for three
consecutive days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NTD-RENMINBI CURRENCY EXCHANGE SERVICES MULLED FOR TAIWAN PROPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh has promised to
seriously consider allowing for new Taiwan dollar-renminbi currency
exchange services to be implemented on Taiwan proper as soon as
possible, a business leader said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce Chairman
Theodore M.H. Huang quoted Hsieh as saying that the government is
mulling the possibility of introducing the service into Taiwan proper
based on a trial that has been put in place on the outlying islands
of Kinmen and Matsu since early this month.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks following a breakfast gathering attended
by the premier and business community representatives.</P>
      <P>Liao Yao-tsung, director of the Performance Evaluation and
Overall Planning Department under the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development, said later the same day that no
timetable has been set to that end and that amendments to the law
will be needed to make the service possible in Taiwan due to the
delicate relationship between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>According to Liao, Taiwan and China must first work out and agree
upon a set of currency settlement mechanisms to secure long-term and
stable currency exchange services.</P>
      <P>The NTD-renminbi currency exchange services that began on Oct. 4
on Kinmen and Matsu islands on a trial basis have gained warm public
response, helping Taiwan people avoid having to convert the local
currency to renminbi on the Chinese black market where fake notes are
rampant.</P>

      <P>China has made necessary preparations for
allowing Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan and hopes to start
bilateral talks on the issue as soon as possible, a Kuomintang (KMT)
official said Thursday in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, head of the KMT's Policy Executive Committee

earlier to help push for tourism exchanges across the Taiwan Strait,
made the remarks at a news conference following a meeting with

      <P>According to Tseng, the Chinese tourism authorities have made
full preparations for the opening and they hope that private-sector
bodies from the two sides can launch negotiations as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator John Chiang said that China has come up with a
detailed program and has urged the Taiwan authorities to quickly
respond to the development by appointing a civic organization to hold
talks with the Chinese side.</P>
      <P>Shao Qiwei, director of the Chinese National Tourism

Chiang said, expressing his hope that they will be allowed to enter

      <P>KMT Mainland Affairs Department Director Chang Jung-kung called
for a swift opening by Taiwan to Chinese tourists, as part of the
government's drive to double the number of tourist arrivals.</P>

clear the way for follow-up talks, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN REMAINS AVIAN FLU-FREE: EXECUTIVE YUAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan remained avian flu-free as of
Thursday, six days after cages of birds smuggled from China tested
positive for H5N1 -- the avian flu strain that poses the greatest
threat of mutating into a form that could ignite a human pandemic --
an Executive Yuan spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>None of the H5N1-infected birds made it onto Taiwan soil and none
of the 40 Taiwan personnel who took part in a crackdown on bird
smuggling Oct. 14 had shown any bird flu symptoms as of Thursday,
said Executive Yuan Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai.</P>
      <P>The personnel included 31 coast guard officers, six from the
Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine under the
Council of Agriculture (COA) , and three from the Center for Disease
Control under the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>All of them, however, have been asked to begin a 10-day
self-health monitoring program just in case.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cho said, the administration has raised the cash
reward for tipoffs on animal or meat smuggling to NT$20 million
(US$595,238) to encourage more people from all walks of life to join
the nationwide pandemic-prevention drive.</P>
      <P>Smugglers or related violators, if nabbed, will face three-year
prison terms, Cho added.</P>
      <P>COA experts confirmed Thursday that 270 out of some 1,000
smuggled birds discovered hidden aboard a Panama-registered freighter
anchored in Taichung Harbor, central Taiwan Oct. 14 were believed to
be infected with H5N1.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held to address the crackdown on the

nine of the birds randomly selected from the three kinds, numbering
about 270, tested H5N1 positive, the officials said, adding that all
of the smuggled birds were destroyed by burning.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the confirmation of H5N1 infection among smuggled
birds that would otherwise have entered in Taiwan if they had not
been seized, Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the COA's Bureau of
Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, said that judging
from the high percentage of H5N1-infection among the destroyed birds
smuggled from Fuzhou, southern China, it is safe to predict that the
avian flu epidemic is more serious around China than the Chinese
authorities have reported and that the epidemic is not confined to
Inner Mongolia and the northwestern province of Qinghai, as the
Chinese authorities have claimed.</P>
      <P>Shih called for all Taiwan citizens who travel frequently across
the Taiwan Strait to heighten their vigilance against flu.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, the second mate of the freighter, a Chinese
national, has been detained in a Taichung jail and kept under medical
watch, since he was the sole mastermind behind the smuggling and all
of the smuggled animals were found in his cabin.</P>
      <P>Health examination results show that the second officer has not

He will be taken off the Tamiflu doses as of Oct. 25 if he shows no

      <P>The other 24 crew members were repatriated to Fuzhou, where the
freighter departed for Taiwan via Ishigaki Island in Japan's Okinawa
Prefecture around Oct. 12, Shih said.</P>
      <P>He added that currently, passengers from Indonesia, Thailand,
Vietnam and Cambodia are asked upon arrival to conduct a 10-day
self-health monitoring program after entering Taiwan, while
passengers from China are asked to be mindful of their health
condition.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOUTH KOREA URGED NOT TO SUCCUMB TO CHINA'S PRESSURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
officials urged South Korea Thursday not to succumb to China's
pressure on opposing Taiwan's designated envoy to this year's
leadership summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum to be held in the South Korean port city of Busan in November.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Li Yi-yang said that Taiwan, a formal
member of APEC, has the right to participate in APEC-related
activities and the right to name an envoy to attend the leadership
summit on behalf of the country's head of state.</P>
      <P>Li's remarks came after South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs
and Trade Ban Ki-moon said at a news conference in Seoul earlier that
day that it will conform with APEC's previous practices if Taiwan can
send an official responsible for economic affairs to attend the APEC
annual informal leadership summit.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has named Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jin-pyng to attend this year's APEC leadership summit on his
behalf, a decision China strongly opposes.</P>
      <P>Li stressed that as the organizer of this year's leadership
summit, South Korea should treat all the member economies equally and
should not impose different criteria on different members.</P>
      <P>"The DPP expresses regret that South Korea has not demonstrated
courage by resisting the pressure from China," Li said.</P>
      <P>Li noted that China's repression of Taiwan in APEC proves that
its promise to help Taiwan participate in international organizations
following visits to China by Taiwan opposition leaders earlier this
year was a lie.</P>
      <P>"China is using a carrot-and-stick strategy against Taiwan by
promising a gift of pandas and allowing fruit imports from Taiwan
while squeezing Taiwan's development in the international community,
" Li said, adding that a proposed economic forum to be organized
jointly by the opposition Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China
is not expected to serve as a bridge in promoting cross-Taiwan Strait
ties, but is just for show.</P>
      <P>According to Li, Chang Jung-kung, director of the KMT's Mainland
Affairs Department, had said that Wang may attend the APEC summit as
long as Chen steps down. Chen is considered by China as a separatist
and a pro-independence advocate.</P>
      <P>Li said that China is increasing its hegemonic behavior with the
support of Taiwan's opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, William C.T. Lai, the DPP caucus whip in the
legislature, said Ban's remarks are the result of pressure from China
and he urged the opposition parties not to dance to Beijing's tune
but to try and help Wang attend the summit.</P>

      <P>A father who for 16 years had taken loving
care of his two disabled son and encouraged them to live normal
lives, took his own life Thursday after losing both sons in less than
two years to a rare inherited disease -- Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</P>
      <P>Li Tien-yu, a professor at the Department of Information and
Computer Education of National Taiwan Normal University in Taipei,
jumped to his death from his 11th-floor apartment in Panchiao, Taipei
County, shortly after the death of his 20-year-old younger son
Chih-wei earlier that day.</P>
      <P>Barely two years ago in December 2003, his first son, 22-year-old
Chih-jen, died of the same disease. Both sons suffered from the
inherited disorder, which began to affect them from age of five or
six with progressive muscle weakness.</P>
      <P>Li and his wife Wang Mei-ying did everything possible to give
their two sons a normal life, taking them to school every day and
encouraging them to live life to the full.</P>
      <P>They attended to every detail in the lives of their sons, and the
family's love for life and strong will to fight the rare disease won
a number of awards from both the government and the private sector,
including the 2003 Presidential Education Award for Chih-jen upon his
death.</P>
      <P>Armed with their experience in taking care of their own sons, the
couple even found time to join charity organizations to fight for the
rights of other disabled children. Their unselfish love earned them
the "Great Love Award" for parents of physically and mentally
challenged children.</P>
      <P>Li's wife also tried to kill herself but was prevented from doing
so by firefighters.</P>

      <P>Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General James Huang made the

Ki-moon said at a news conference in Seoul earlier that day that it
will conform with APEC practice if Taiwan sends an official
responsible for economic affairs to attend the summit to be held in
the South Korean port city of Busan Nov. 18-19.</P>
      <P>Huang said that although President Chen Shui-bian had expressed
his strong wish to attend the summit in person, he named Legislative
Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng to attend on his behalf as "a gesture of
goodwill" toward China.</P>
      <P>Republic of China presidents have had to name special envoys to
attend APEC summits since 1993 due to the objections of China to the
participation of the country's head of state.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Lee Yuan-tseh, a Nobel laureate in chemistry
and president of Academic Sinica, has represented Chen at APEC
summits for three years, and like Wang, has no background in

      <P>Huang said the government had informed South Korea and the United
States on the representative of Taiwan at the summit in advance, and
did not receive a negative response from either country.</P>
      <P>The change of South Korea's attitude was unveiled after China
expressed its strong opposition to Wang's participation, Huang said.</P>
      <P>As to whether there are any other candidates who could attend the

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou renewed calls
Thursday for the opening of direct transportation links across the
Taiwan Strait to help accelerate Taiwan's economic and trade
development.</P>
      <P>Speaking about the development of the Taipei Sci-tech Corridor
and the future of Taiwan's industrial development in a lecture chair
program sponsored by the Taipei-based Chinese National Association of
Industry and Commerce, Ma said he has believed for years that Taiwan
can turn itself into a global operations center for Taiwanese
businessmen operating in China and an Asian operations hub for
foreign corporations.</P>
      <P>Ma said that although Taiwan still has many advantages over other
countries, the country needs to catch up, particularly in developing
a skilled and knowledge-based workforce, if it intends to become a
world IT design and research hub.</P>
      <P>To reach that goal, Ma said, Taiwan must maintain fast-track
connections with the world, including China. Only by maintaining such
links can Taiwan compete with other countries, he said.</P>
      <P>He lamented that membership of the American Chamber of Commerce
in Taiwan and the European Chamber of Commerce Taipei has continued
to slide. These members have pointed out that if direct cross-strait
transportation links remained blocked, Taiwan will lose its
international competitiveness, Ma said, adding that under those
circumstances, American and European businessmen see Taiwan as at
best a "local market" rather than a "regional operations center."</P>
      <P>Ma said he made the call for opening cross-strait direct air and
shipping links purely for the benefit of Taiwan, without any
political consideration.</P>
      <P>Strengthening Taiwan's international competitiveness is the
responsibility of all government officials, he added.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
urged China Thursday to maintain transparency about its avian flu
situation and avoid a repeat of its initial coverup of the severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003.</P>
      <P>The ministry made the appeal after Council of Agriculture
officials said that 270 out of some 1,000 birds smuggled from China
and discovered aboard a Panama-registered freighter anchored at
Taichung Harbor, central Taiwan Oct. 14 were believed to be infected
with H5N1.</P>
      <P>It was the second time in a year that smuggled birds from China
had tested H5N1-positive.</P>
      <P>H5N1 is the flu strain in birds that is most likely to mutate
into a form that may easily spread from person to person, causing a
pandemic.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said the seizure of the infected birds indicates
that there may be an avian flu outbreak in China.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that China can honestly publish comprehensive
information about its avian flu situation to facilitate global
cooperation in averting any possible outbreak of the disease," a MOFA
official said, adding that the World Health Organization should
initiate a field survey in China.</P>
      <P>In 2003, China initially tried to cover up a SARS outbreak in the
southern Chinese province of Guangdong, which later led to outbreaks
in several neighboring countries, including Taiwan, and claimed
hundreds of lives.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. State Department on Thursday
reiterated that its policy of opposing a change to Taiwan's official
name remains unaltered.</P>
      <P>In response to a question raised at a regular press briefing
regarding remarks made earlier in the day by former ROC President Lee
Teng-hui that Taiwan should change its official name from the
"Republic of China" to the "Republic of Taiwan, " State Department
spokesman Sean McCormack said that there's been "no change in our
policy."</P>
      <P>Lee said after addressing the National Press Club that as the
international community has failed to recognize the ROC, the nation
should change its official name in order to gain the acceptance of
other countries.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, he had done all he could during his time as
president to gain international recognition for the country, but to
no avail.</P>
      <P>"The international community does not only refuse to recognize
the ROC, it also confuses the name of the People's Republic of China
with that of the Republic of China, or even considers that Taiwan is
part of the PRC, " he added.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Washington Post which was carried by the
newspaper Wednesday, Lee said that Taiwan is already an independent
country and that all that is required now is for the country to
change its official name to reflect reality.</P>
      <P>The U.S. State Department also made it clear Thursday that it
does not support Taiwan independence, nor any actions that might
represent a unilateral change to the current status quo in the Taiwan
Strait, including a change to Taiwan's official name.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S TOP TOURISM OFFICIAL TO VISIT TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's National Tourism Administration
(NTA) Director Shao Qiwei will travel to Taiwan for a 10-day visit
later this month, Taiwan's Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) confirmed Friday.</P>
      <P>MAC officials said that Shao, at the invitation of Taiwan's
Travel Agent Association, will lead a 66-member delegation, including
NTA deputy directors, tourism officials from various provinces, and
representatives of major travel agents in China, to visit Taiwan Oct.
28 to Nov. 6.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the delegation's visit is mainly to inspect the
scenic spots and related tourism facilities in Taiwan, and there are
no other activities on the itinerary, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun denied that the Chinese
government has officially relaxed rules to allow its citizens to go
to Taiwan for tourism.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks during a public hearing on opening Taiwan up
to mainland Chinese tourists to help boost Taiwan's economy. The
public hearing was jointly held by Tseng Yung-chuan, executive
director of the Kuomintang's (KMT's) Policy Committee, and KMT
Legislator John Chiang.</P>
      <P>Tseng said in the hearing that China's Taiwan Affairs Office
under its State Council confirmed that China decided to allow
citizens to take pleasure trips to Taiwan on May 3 when former KMT
Chairman Lien Chan concluded his visit to China. Tseng urged the
government to consult on this matter as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>However, Liu said that he has checked the information on Chinese
Web sites, and the latest updated information on Sept. 15 showed that
Taiwan is not included in its tourism destinations, even if Taiwan is
counted as a region of China as Hong Kong and Macau are.</P>
      <P>China even notified its travel agents to ban Chinese citizens
from traveling to Taiwan for tourism, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who together with Tseng called on Chen Yunlin, director
of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council in Beijing
Wednesday during their just concluded trip, said that there is a gap
between China's views and the MAC's perceptions.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that China does not view Taiwan as a nation, and this
is why it is not listed in the tourism destinations, but Chen told
them in person that he hopes Taiwan will commission a private party
to engage in related consultations as soon as possible, adding that
China has made all the preparations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>There are five to ten pharmaceutical
companies in Taiwan that have the technical capability to produce
Tamifu, according to pharmaceutical industry sources.</P>
      <P>Tamiflu, which is used to treat influenza, has been in short
supply as countries have raced to stock up on the medicine amid fears
of a looming bird flu pandemic. Roche, the only producer of Tamiflu,
has been unable to keep up with the global demand for the medicine.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been seeking authorization from Roche to produce the
medicine on the island.</P>
      <P>Sinphar Pharmaceutical Co., which is one of the local
pharmaceutical companies listed by the sources as capable of
producing Tamiflu, confirmed Friday that its subsidiary in China and
its Taiwan factory are both capable of manufacturing the medicine.</P>

    <HEADLINE>E.U. URGED TO PLAY MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN TAIWAN STRAIT MATTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Brussels,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By Y.S. Lo and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Republic of China scholar called for
the European Union Thursday to play a more active role in maintaining
security in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ming-yeng, an assistant professor at National Chung Hsing
University, made the appeal while attending a seminar on
"Taiwan-China Relations: What Role Can the European Union Play? "
which is currently being held by the European Institute for Asian
Studies (EIAS) in Brussels with about 50 China and Taiwan-problem
experts from various countries around the world, E.U. officials and
media representatives taking part.</P>
      <P>The scholar also urged the E.U. to maintain its arms exports ban
on China and to establish a new framework for its relations with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the E.U. should be able to play a more active role in
dealing with matters across the Taiwan Strait, Tsai said that by
doing so, the union will not only help maintain security in East Asia
but will also better safeguard its own interests in the region.</P>
      <P>In response to the scholar's appeal, a European Commission
official said that the E.U. has made two statements regarding the
Taiwan Strait since the beginning of this year, with one being issued
when Taiwan and China launched direct Lunar New Year charter flight
services, and the other being issued when Beijing passed its
"Anti-Secession Law" in March.</P>
      <P>"The E.U.'s longstanding stance is to urge both sides (of the
strait) to engage in a peaceful dialogue. The E.U. at least has
expressed its stance on the cross-strait issue and will probably talk
more about the issue in the future," the official said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Huang Wei-Feng, vice chairman of the ROC's Council
of Mainland Affairs, who also attended the gathering, said that
although Taiwan has always welcomed suggestions to engage in a
dialogue with China, Beijing's refusal to give up the preconditions
it has made for cross-strait talks has prevented Taiwan from taking
further steps to hold negotiations with the mainland.</P>
      <P>"Abandoning political preconditions will allow the two sides to
negotiate and cooperate on a practical and functional basis, " he
said, adding that the "launching of direct charter flight services
has set a good precedent."</P>
      <P>Echoing Hwang's remarks, Chang Wei-wei, a senior research fellow
from the Research Center for Comtemporay Asian Studies in Geneva,
said that China and Taiwan should jointly create economic and other
interests for themselves by developing practical and functional
cooperative relations.</P>

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) on
Friday urged laborers and other personnel in the poultry farming and
marketing industry to wear protective gear during work and to more
thoroughly wash after work to prevent the spread of avian flu.</P>
      <P>Officials from the CLA Institute of Occupational Safety and
Health urged workers and personnel on poultry farms and at
slaughterhouses, as well as veterinarians and public health workers
to step up measures to protect themselves against bird flu.</P>
      <P>With fears growing around the world of a possible bird flu
pandemic, CLA officials said that owners of poultry farms or
slaughterhouses should provide protective gear and related cleaning
equipment to workers so as to help prevent the workers from coming
into direct contact with birds which might be carriers of the deadly
H5N1 strain of the avian flu virus.</P>
      <P>The officials said that members of the high-risk groups mentioned
above should head to hospital immediately if they develop influenza
symptoms, such as fever, respiratory problems or eye infection.</P>
      <P>They should also avoid coming into direct contact with bird
droppings and avoid uncooked meat and eggs, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials from the CLA Employment and Vocational
Training Administration said that bird flu prevention literature will
be translated into several languages for distribution to foreign
workers in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PRESIDENT SAYS HE HAS NEVER PROMOTED TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui said
Thursday that he has never promoted independence for Taiwan because
Taiwan is already an independent country.</P>
      <P>Instead, what he has been promoting is to make Taiwan "a normal
country," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee was responding to a question on how he would promote Taiwan
independence, after giving a speech on "The Path of Taiwan Democracy"
at the National Press Club in the U.S. capital.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the campaign calling for changing Taiwan's
official name and for enacting a new Constitution for the country is
not aimed at declaring independence.</P>
      <P>Lee said the government of Taiwan does not even have a "correct
name, " pointing out that the name "Republic of China" is recognized
by none, not even the United States, and that everyone calls Taiwan
"Taiwan," and not "the Republic of China."</P>
      <P>Also, a new Constitution is required because the ROC Constitution
currently in use in Taiwan does not cover Taiwan and offers no
protection for the people of the island, Lee continued.</P>
      <P>The former president noted that he made every possible effort but
failed to have the international community recognize the country
during the 12 years of his presidency.</P>
      <P>The international community always confuses the "Republic of
China" with the "People's Republic of China" and even thinks the
"Republic of China" is part of the "People's Republic of China, " he
said.</P>
      <P>In the face of this predicament, he suggested, there are two
options for Taiwan: one is to continue to request that the world
recognize the name "Republic of China" and the other is to change the
name to make it acceptable to the international community.</P>
      <P>However, he said, only the second option will work because the
first is totally infeasible, pointing out that during his current
visit in the United States, everyone has been calling him a former
president from Taiwan, instead of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Asked if he has met with any U.S. officials during the trip, Lee
said that this is a private visit and that he has not met and has no
plans to meet any U.S. officials.</P>
      <P>Lee said the main purpose of the trip is to observe the
operations of U.S. democracy.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Lee mentioned that the ethnic confrontation that
started in the 1940s in Taiwan began to be resolved in the process of
democratic development.</P>
      <P>However, such confrontation has been reignited and worsened to
become a conflict of national identity as a result of vicious
struggles between the ruling and opposition parties after the
Democratic Progressive Party came to power in 2000, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He said that in light of this problem, he has put forth the
concept of "new era Taiwanese, " which he said means that all 23
million people now living in Taiwan are Taiwanese regardless of
whether their ancestors came to Taiwan 400 years ago or just 50 years
ago.</P>
      <P>The differences in terms of national identity are the greatest
problem that the country needs to resolve to protect its democracy,
he said.</P>
      <P>He alleged that some politicians who have been rejected by the
voters are trying to divide Taiwan society and are allying with the
communist Chinese regime against Taiwan, which he said has
intensified the crisis facing the country.</P>
      <P>Washington is the third leg of Lee's two-week U.S. visit, which
has already taken him to Alaska and New York. Lee flew to Los Angeles
Thursday for the final leg of his trip after wrapping up his visit to
Washington, D.C. Thursday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>43% SAY LEGISLATURE SHOULD SCREEN CONTROL YUAN NOMINEES SOON: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Forty-three percent of respondents to a
poll commissioned by the Control Yuan said the Legislative Yuan
should screen President Chen Shui-bian's nomination list for the
Control Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog body, as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>The legislature has stalled the confirmation of the list mainly
because opposition legislators are dissatisfied with the nominees,
especially Clement C.P. Chang, who has been named as Control Yuan
president. The opposition lawmakers demand that the president make a
new list.</P>
      <P>The positions of the Control Yuan have been left unfulfilled
since the six-year term of the last Control Yuan expired at the end
of January.</P>
      <P>Tu Shan-liang, secretary-general of the Control Yuan, said that
President Chen was anxious about the situation, and hopes that the
Control Yuan members can be confirmed quickly so that they can start
to look into the public's complaints and major derelictions by civil
servants and give him an "objective report."</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan-commissioned survey, released Friday, collected
1,069 effective samples and had a margin of error of 3.06 percent.</P>
      <P>On the effects on the protection of human rights and monitoring
the government, the survey showed that 52.8 percent of the people
said it will have an effect, compared with 28.3 percent who said this
would have no effect.</P>
      <P>On who should bear the most responsibility for not being able to
produce members for the Control Yuan, 35.8 percent of the public said
the president should bear the greater responsibility, followed by the
Legislative Yuan (22 percent), and the Executive Yuan (4.3 percent),
the opposition parties (0.9 percent) , and the ruling party (0.7
percent) and the Control Yuan members (0.2 percent).</P>
      <P>Around 43 percent said that the legislature should screen the
nominations as soon as possible, but not to confirm those who are
unqualified for the posts. Almost 29 percent said that the
legislature should return the list to the Presidential Office for a
new one.</P>
      <P>Five precent of the polled also said that the legislature should
review them as soon as possible and confirm them all, while 2.3
percent said the legislature should screen them as soon as possible,
but reject them all.</P>
      <P>But if the public discovers major problems with civil servants,
58.4 percent said they don't know where to report to. Around 9
percent said they would report to the Ministry of the Interior, 6.7
percent said they would report to the superiors of the related civil
servants, next would be ethic departments of various levels (5.7
percent), and the Control Yuan (5.3 percent).</P>

      <P>A Kuomintang (KMT) think-tank will submit
an application with the administration shortly for permission for a
high-ranking Beijing official to come to Taiwan to take part in a
cross-strait economic forum scheduled to be held in December, a KMT

mid-December, said Chang Jung-kung, director of the KMT Mainland
Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>Chang declined to speculate whether Lien Chan, the honorary
chairman of the KMT, who is currently visiting in China, has extended
an invitation to Jia Qinglin, chairman of the Chinese People's

forum -- the first of its kind co-sponsored by the KMT and the
Communist Party of China (CPC) since the KMT fled to Taiwan in 1949.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said the other day that the holding of
the KMT-CPC economic cooperation forum is part of efforts to
materialize the "five consensuses" that former KMT Chairman Lien Chan
reached with CPC General-Secretary Hu Jintao in Beijing during Lien's
historic "journey of peace" to China from late April to early May
when he was still the KMT chairman.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several Ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) legislators said on Friday that they will propose a revision of
the law to scrap inheritance taxes.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Huang Chien-hui pointed out that between 2000 and
2004, the ratio of inheritance taxes to total tax revenues has been
averaging less than 2 percent.</P>
      <P>Moreover, rich conglomerates often do everything they can to
evade tax payments, and the government has failed to collect
inheritance taxes from their top executives, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The government currently can only go after the inheritance taxes
of the middle-class, which he termed as being unfair, adding that
Hong Kong and Canada have stopped collecting inheritance tax, and
the United States is going to scrap it in 2010. The inheritance tax
in Singapore is only 5 precent, showing that the scrapping of
inheritance tax is a world trend.</P>
      <P>Huang stressed that after Singapore adjusted it inheritance tax
downward, more money was available in the country as wealthy people
did not have to "hide" their money overseas, which has reinvigorated
its capital market and helped the development of various industries.</P>
      <P>Two other DPP legislators, Hsueh Ling and Wu Fu-quei, also said
that Taiwan could turn into a capital haven in Asia if the government
does not tax money coming into the country as it would help
investment and capital markets in Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taichung County, Oct.  21 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Forty people who dealt with birds
smuggled into Taiwan recently -- eight of which were found to be
carrying the avian influenza virus -- are being monitored, but none
of them have shown any signs of flu, a government health official
said Friday.</P>
      <P>The official acknowledged that some of the men did not wear
protective clothing during the mission to seize the birds smuggled in
a Panama-registered cargo ship in Taichung Harbor a week ago.
However, he added, they were not in direct contact with the 1,037
smuggled birds from China, which were destroyed after eight of the
276 dead birds were found to be infected with the H5N1 avian flu
virus.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said health authorities are watching the conditions
of the workers closely and that so far none of them has developed any
flu symptoms.</P>
      <P>The 40 men are from the Coast Guard Administration, the Center
for Disease Control under the Department of Health, and the Bureau of
Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine under the Council
of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has remained avian flu-free despite the seizure of
smuggled birds that tested positive for H5N1. The 1,037 birds
destroyed consisted of 19 species and were part of the smuggled
shipment aboard the Panama-registered ship.</P>
      <P>A Chinese second mate on the ship admitted that he had
transported the birds and other animals from Fuzhou, Fujian in
southeastern China. The Taichung Prosecutors' Office is charging him
with smuggling and violating laws governing wildlife conservation and
prevention of infectious disease from animals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SAYS MRT SUPERVISION  MAY HAVE BEEN LAX, BUT NOT SCANDALOUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh admitted Friday that it
was possible that he might have been negligent in his supervision of
some Kaohsiung City Government agencies regarding the construction of
the mass rapid transit (MRT) project in Kaohsiung, but this would not
constitute a "scandal."</P>
      <P>Hsieh was Kaohsiung mayor until he assumed the premiership this
February. He was referring to the Bureau of Labor Affairs and the
Department of Rapid Transit System in the city government.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks as acting Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh Chu-lan was
about to unveil the investigation results of a five-member team on
the administrative responsibility of the MRT project later in the
day. The project has aroused serious concerns after a series of
irregularities were revealed following a riot on Aug. 21 by Thai
laborers working for the MRT system to protest unreasonable treatment
and exploitation.</P>
      <P>In a question-and-answer session in the Legislative Yuan, Hsieh
said that documents containing the formulation process of the MRT
project can be dated back six or seven years, and that he had no
access to them now.</P>
      <P>"It is good that Yeh's team can examine all related documents, "
Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The premier stressed that at that time, the central as well as
local governments were pushing for the BOT (build-operate-transfer)
model, or the private sector building and operating a construction
project before transferring it to the government after a certain
period of time, and that the public should not see this in a negative
light.</P>
      <P>Media reports said Yeh's investigation will find former Kaohsiung
mayors Wu Den-yih -- now a legislator of the opposition Kuomintang --
and Hsieh were guilty of "some flaws" in the formulation of the BOT
model, but these are not to be construed as administrative
negligence.</P>
      <P>However, discipline might be dispensed to Chou Li-liang, former
director of the Department of Rapid Transit System, and Fang
Lai-chin, the former director of the Bureau of Labor Affairs of the
Kaohsiung City Government.</P>

Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh Chu-lan unveiled its investigation report on the

Friday.</P>

turned over for further judicial investigation, including six public
bids on the project as well as matters pertaining to train door
specifications.</P>
      <P>On the part of management flaws of the Thai laborers, whose riot
on Aug. 21 to protest harsh treatment and exploitation revealed a
series of irregularities in the project, reportedly involving Taiwan
and Thai officials and labor brokerage firms, the team said that it
will pursue the responsibility of those officials who were in charge.</P>
      <P>As for the formulation of the BOT (build-operate-transfer) model
to construct the system, the team said that it has found no kickbacks
surrounding the project, and whether or not to use BOT should be part
of the government's public policy.</P>
      <P>Yeh stressed that for those agencies involved in administrative
responsibility, there will be a personnel review meeting to dispense

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Taiwan Solitary Union (TSU)
legislators issued an ultimatum Friday to the government, claiming it
will seek to cut budgets of the ministries of finance and justice
should the government fail to reclaim the country's assets "illegally
seized" by the major opposition Kuomintang (KMT) during its years of
rule.</P>
      <P>The TSU's legislative caucus invited officials of both the
ministries of finance and justice to report their handling of the
KMT's alleged ill-gotten party assets at the caucus office at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Vice Finance Minister Lee Ruey-tsang indicated that the KMT has
used illegal means during its five decades in power to obtain around
144 hectares of real estate, worth about NT$21.9 billion (US$653.73
million) in market value.</P>
      <P>So far, the KMT has returned 1.8 hectares, or over NT$1.2 billion
in market value, accounting for 1.7 percent of the total amount of
what it should return.</P>
      <P>Lee said since the legislature has failed to pass a draft bill on
statutes governing ill-gotten party assets, his ministry possesses no
weapons to back its move to force the KMT to return their improperly
obtained party assets.</P>
      <P>The existing Land Act protects the rights of the KMT, which has
land in its name that "belongs to the country," he added.</P>
      <P>A TSU caucus whip, Ho Min-hao, said he believes there are plenty
of existing laws for the government to take advantage of in handling
the issue. However, the government has shown weakness on the issue
since the KMT and its political ally, the People First Party, jointly
control a slim majority in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>"The government has been advocating reforms, and the party assets
issue is the best start for it to push for reforms, " Ho said, urging
the government to "do something" in demanding the KMT to return
"ill-gotten" party assets as soon as possible; otherwise, the TSU
will act to force the government to include seeking to cut the
budgets of relevant authorities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SURGEON DISCIPLINED DURING SARS OUTBREAKS SUES FOR  COMPENSATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A surgeon who was disciplined in 2003
during the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) for
failing to undertaking quarantine measures required by the Taipei
City Government filed a civil suit against Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and the
city government Friday, asking for NT$21.25 million (US$640,629) in
compensation.</P>
      <P>Chou Ching-kai, a former surgeon of the Taipei Municipal Hoping
Hospital, accompanied by his wife and lawyer, filed the suit with the
Taipei District Court against Ma and his government, claiming that
his career was ruined after being branded by the city as the surgeon
who deserted his post at the Hoping Hospital.</P>
      <P>As a result, Chou claimed, he could neither land a job as a
surgeon at any hospital nor attract patients in private practice.</P>
      <P>The dispute dates back to April 24, 2003, when a cluster of SARS
cases were found in Hoping Hospital, and the then-health chief of
Taipei City Chiu Shu-ti, ordered the closure of the hospital and the
quarantine of all medical staff and patients in the hospital.</P>
      <P>As a leading surgeon at Hoping, Chou refused to subject himself
to quarantine; rather, he went into hiding until May 1 when the city
authorities asked police to help locate him.</P>
      <P>Afterward, Chou was fired by the hospital and was forbidden by a
medical council to practice medicine.</P>
      <P>Chou, who argued that he didn't return to the hospital for
quarantine as requested because the hospital was not equipped for

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN INSISTS ON SENDING WANG TO APEC SUMMIT: AIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian remains firm in
his determination to send Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng to
present him at this year's APEC summit meeting, and the government
will talk to South Korea over the issue despite Seoul's rejection of
Wang a day earlier, a presidential aide said Friday.</P>
      <P>James Huang, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office,
said that the Presidential Office will continue seeking support from
South Korea for Wang's attendance as the president's envoy at the
APEC summit meeting slated for Nov. 18-19 in Busan, stressing that
the president's choice of Wang is "suitable and appropriate" and that
Beijing has no right to meddle.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, South Korea turned down President Chen's initiative
to have Wang take part in the upcoming informal APEC leadership
meeting on his behalf, requesting Taiwan instead to send an economic
official in compliance with APEC's spirit, functions and precedents.</P>
      <P>Noting that Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh has served as
Chen's envoy three times at the annual APEC summit meeting, Huang
said that Lee is not and has never been an economic official. The
APEC memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed in 1991 by Taiwan, Hong
Kong and China has no power over the summit meetings that began in
1993.</P>
      <P>With assistance from South Korea, the three sides agreed to enter
APEC in 1992 under a set of terms documented in the MOU, with one of
the terms stipulating that Taiwan shall be represented at ministerial
meetings only by a minister or ministers in charge of APEC-related
economic affairs, while its "foreign minister" or "vice foreign
minister" should not attend APEC meetings. </P>
      <P>Answering questions from reporters at the Legislative Yuan the
same day, Wang said that he will try to relay his willingness to
participate in the APEC summit to South Korea and expressed his
belief that President Chen will adequately handle the issue should he
be banned from taking part.</P>
      <P>"I believe that President Chen will deal with the matter properly
to secure Taiwan's presence in the high-profile international
activity, " he said, adding that he is quite familiar with economic
issues after having served at the Legislative Yuan for more than 20
years. The reason for rejection given by South Korea can be fairly
commented on by the public, he argued.</P>
      <P>To coordinate inter-ministerial efforts to tackle suppression
from Beijing, officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the
Ministry of Economic Affairs briefed Wang on possible countermeasures
earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>Relevant government agencies have prepared for the worst-case
scenario in this regard, but the government will not let go any
opportunity to make every possible effort, government officials said.</P>
      <P>William C.T. Lai, caucus leader of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) at the Legislative Yuan, said that the DPP
will introduce a proposal to garner support from opposition parties
for Wang's attendance at the APEC summit.</P>
      <P>As a veteran at the Legislative Yuan, Wang, the leader of
Taiwan's top lawmaking body, has deep knowledge of the country's
economic policies and laws, Lai said, adding that Wang's
participation at the meeting will undoubtedly help APEC move ahead.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO REINITIATE DESALINATION PLANT PLAN FOR HIGH-TECH PARK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a bid to stabilize water supply for the
Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park (HSIP) in northern Taiwan, the
government has decided to reinitiate a plan to build a desalination
plant for Taiwan's leading high-tech park, according to government
officials.</P>
      <P>According to officials of the Water Resources Administration
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the administration will try
to persuade companies based at the park to agree to the plan, which
has failed to win total support due to the higher water fees involved
and fears that a higher degree of borax contained in desalinated
water might affect their manufacturing.</P>
      <P>The plan was almost set to be finalized last year with completion
slated for the end of 2008, but it came to a halt as a result of the
two aforementioned factors, the officials said, adding that the
administration is now determined to reinitiate the project to ensure
water supply during the dry seasons.</P>
      <P>The plant will be able to increase water supply by between 30,000
tons and 90,000 tons per day for the park, but the cost of each water
reading will be at least NT$0.5 higher, the officials explained,
adding that the plant will be of great help after the park's third
expansion has been completed when the park's daily water consumption
is expected to grow to 175,000 tons from the current level of 123,000
tons.</P>
      <P>The HSIP is Taiwan's most representative high-tech park, which
heavily relies on stable water supply to maintain smooth operations
of the companies, mainly in the semiconductor and computer-related
sectors.</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Friday
requested consultations with Chinese authorities on the possible

to attend an economic and trade forum hosted by the party.</P>
      <P>According to MAC Vice Chairman Johnnason Liu, the government

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
officials accused members of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Friday
of acting like "bandits" and "rascals" for refusing to return the
party's ill-gotten assets to the national coffer.</P>
      <P>They said KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou was lying when he claimed
that the sale of the land occupied by the KMT's National Development
Institute (NDI), the party's school for nurturing future leaders, was
completely lawful.</P>
      <P>The DPP has argued that the KMT has no right to sell the land
because like many other properties now owned by the KMT, the piece of
land is supposed to belong to the government.</P>
      <P>Citing data from the Ministry of Finance, DPP Deputy
Secretary-General Yen Wan-chin said the KMT has obtained 679 pieces
of land with a total area of more than 144 hectares with a listed
value of NT$21.9 billion (US$651.78 million) through improper means.</P>
      <P>However, the party has only returned 57 pieces totalling eight
hectares worth NT$1.2 billion, according to Yen.</P>
      <P>For 118 hectares out of these 144 hectares of land in question,
the KMT has either transferred the ownership or gotten compensated
for a requisition, Yen said.</P>
      <P>As to the five theaters with a combined listed value of nearly
NT$900 million, the KMT is only willing to return NT$300 million in
cash, he said.</P>
      <P>He said by selling the piece of NDI-occupied land, the KMT was
acting like a thief who was "selling their stolen goods quickly after
the theft was uncovered."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan said the purchase of the
land now occupied by the KMT headquarters may look lawful, but the
KMT actually bought the land at a price equal to 10 percent of its
market value.</P>
      <P>Also, Cheng pointed out, while the land is designated for
official use, the KMT is obviously not a government agency.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) official said Friday that the party will set
up 11 ad hoc groups to push for various reforms, which may include
the reduction in the lifetime pensions for former heads of state.</P>
      <P>William C.T. Lai, the DPP caucus whip in the legislature, said at
a news conference after convening a meeting of the legislative caucus
that the DPP fully supports the 11 reforms, including six that were
outlined by President Chen Shui-bian recently and five being promoted
by the caucus.</P>
      <P>Lai noted that the DPP will set up ad hoc groups responsible for
financial reform; tax reform; changes to the preferential interest
rate of 18 percent for retired military personnel, civil servants
and teachers; media reform; investigation into properties
inappropriately seized by political parties; and constitutional
reform as outlined by President Chen.</P>
      <P>The party will also establish five groups to review the bonus
system for government officials in enterprises with government
shares, avoid the "double-dipping" situation in which some retired
government officials still receive pay or pensions from various
after-retirement posts in addition to pensions from their original
jobs, promote legislative reform, as well as review the salary
structure of senior advisers to the president and national policy
advisors to the president and the lifetime pensions for former
presidents and vice presidents.</P>
      <P>Chao Yung-chin, a whip of DPP's legislative caucus, noted that
the various ad hoc groups may come up with concrete projects for
those reforms within two weeks.</P>
      <P>Chao added that the DPP legislative caucus will fully cooperate
with the administrative sector to carry out those reforms.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Support is growing across party lines for
Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng to be the president's
representative at the informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) in November, William Lai, a whip of
the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative caucus, said on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Lai said that lawmakers of the largest opposition Kuomintang, the
People First Party and the Taiwan Solitary Union are behind the
DPP-drafted proposal to pass a resolution in support of Wang's
attendance at the upcoming APEC summit as President Chen Shui-bian's
envoy.</P>
      <P>Efforts are being made to get the support of independent
legislators, Lai added. </P>
      <P>The DPP proposal says that as a full APEC member, Taiwan enjoys
the same rights as those of other members, including the right for it
to have its head-of-state attend the annual informal summit. However,
out of respect to the meeting's host, the ROC president had never
attended the event, but has had a representative take part.</P>
      <P>The 2005 APEC leadership meeting will take place in Busan, South
Korea, which has delivered an invitation to President Chen out of
international protocol. Chen has designated Wang to attend the
meeting on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The DPP-drafted proposal says that Wang, as the leader of
Taiwan's law-making institution, is the most qualified person for the
APEC meeting since he has managed many bills concerning economic and
trade affairs, and has also been involved in the formation of many
economic and trade policies of the country.</P>
      <P>South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Ban Ki-moon
expressed a day earlier that he affirms Taiwan's commissioning a
person with an economic background for the Busan meeting, saying such
a move is in line with APEC's ideas and conventions.</P>
      <P>Because of China opposition, Taiwan's president has been barred
from APEC Summit, and has had to name a proxy to attend on his

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT, PRIVATE SECTOR MIXED ON GROWTH RATE FORECASTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government and the private sector had
mixed reactions Friday to economic growth rate forecasts released
earlier the same day by the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic
Research, with the private sector showing less optimism for Taiwan's
economy.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-liang, a researcher at the Fubon Financial Holdings
Corp., said that he predicts that the domestic economy will expand
only a little more than 3 percent this year due to sliding exports of
memory chips and compact discs in recent years.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Taiwan's fourth quarter exports have been
estimated to improve, he said that it takes more time to observe
whether the trend will continue.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the Chinese economy is expected to cool off
next year and that international oil prices are likely to continue to
remain at high levels, Chen said that the two factors will negatively
affect Taiwan's economy, although he acknowledged that he does not
know to what extent.</P>
      <P>The Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research made public
earlier Friday its forecasts for Taiwan's economy -- a 3.53 percent
growth rate for all of 2005 and a 4.02 percent expansion for 2006.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Hung Ruey-pin, director of the Economic Research
Department under the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development, argued that the predictions are somewhat underestimated,
basing his optimism on the government's incentives to prop up
business conditions. For instance, tourist arrivals to Taiwan are
likely to be over three million this year, he added.</P>
      <P>Lu Chih-min, a section chief at the Bank of Taiwan was in the
middle, claiming that he is optimistic about Taiwan's economy this
year sustained by brisk exports in the second half thanks to the
strong U.S. economic performance.</P>
      <P>However, Lu also voiced concern over Taiwan's long-term economic
development. Mass relocations by Taiwan companies to China and their
successful integration and transformation there have taken their toll
on suppliers of semi-finished products remaining at home, he said.</P>

      <P>An official from the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) on Friday urged the public to be alert for avian
influenza during visits to China.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Johnnason Liu made the appeal after eight of
some 1,000 birds smuggled into the country on a freighter from China
were confirmed to have been infected with the H5N1 avian flu virus.</P>
      <P>The eight were from 270 dead birds that Taiwan quarantine agents
found on the Panama-registered cargo ship anchored in Taichung Harbor
last week.</P>
      <P>The more than 1,000 smuggled birds were all destroyed.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that the quarantine efforts by the Coast Guard
Administration, the Department of Health and the Council of
Agriculture are proving effective in preventing the N5N1 virus from
entering Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, the crew members are from Fuzhou, China, and
the mastermind of the smuggling was detained, with the others
innocent of smuggling the birds and the cargo ship being repatriated
to China.</P>
      <P>As the H5N1-infected birds came from China and there were cases
of bird flu infection among birds in Inner Mongolia, Liu urged the
public to keep on high alert and take sufficient prevention measures
during their China visits.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has informed mainland authorities about the case in
conformity with the regulations of the World Health Organization, and
has also passed the information to various Taiwanese trade
associations scattered in the mainland, Liu said</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, being a member economy of the Asia-Pacific Economic
and Cooperation (APEC) forum, Taiwan has also informed other APEC
member countries about the bird flu case.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of opposition Kaohsiung City
councilors said Friday they were disappointed at a newly released
investigation report on suspected irregularities or scandals
involving the half-built mass rapid transit (MRT) system in the
southern Taiwan port city.</P>
      <P>The city councilors from the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) said the report prepared by a five-member team
was too sketchy and failed to clarify controversies surrounding the
hiring of Thai laborers to work on MRT project.</P>
      <P>The city councilors, including Lin Kuo-cheng of the KMT and Kuo
chien-ming of the TSU, claimed that the skimpy report reflected the
team's critical weakness -- lacking in comprehensive understanding of
the utterly complicated project.</P>
      <P>The five-member team was formed two weeks ago at the instruction
of President Chen Shui-bian to look into snowballing allegations tied
to the MRT project.</P>
      <P>Acting Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh Chu-lan served as the convener of the
team and its four other members included her two deputies -- Cheng
Wen-lung and Tang Chin-chuan -- as well as Secretary-General of the
Kaohsiung City Government Hao Chien-sheng and Department of Civil
Service Ethics Director Hwang Sheng-yih.</P>
      <P>After two weeks of intensive work, Yeh unveiled the team's
findings at a news conference held at the city headquarters at 3 p.m.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the team will transfer its findings about four of the
seven key points subject to inquiry to judicial authorities for
further investigations.</P>
      <P>The seven items included management of the Thai laborers; open
tenders for six civil engineering bids; suspected price rigging in
Kaoshiung Rapid Transit Corp.'s (KRTC's) premixed concrete
procurement; MRT train carriage door specifications; price
adjustments; public art installations and formulation of the BOT
(build-operate-transfer) formula for the MRT construction.</P>
      <P>"Our findings regarding the first four items will require further
judicial probes to determine whether any kickbacks or irregularities
were involved," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Yeh said the team found that the city government's
Bureau of Labor Affairs should be held responsible for lax
supervision of the KRTC's labor management flaws and irregularities.</P>
      <P>While judicial authorities are pursuing whether any Taiwan
officials were involved in exploitation of Thai laborers working for
KRTC and other irregularities coming to light in the wake of the
Aug. 21 riot, Yeh said the city government will call a personnel
review meeting next week to dispense discipline for labor affairs
administrators in terms of the team's findings for their lax
supervision.</P>

      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday if the
government is to open the door to Chinese investments, the frontline
island of Kinmen should be the first to be selected to experiment
with such a policy.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks during a Legislative Yuan interpellation
session where opposition New Party Legislator Wu Chen-tien from the
Kinmen constituency asked about the government's stance on allowing
Chinese investments in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the government may consider the issue in the future
and that if it decides to lift the ban on inbound Chinese
investments, he would propose experimenting the measure in Kinmen
before the open-door measure is implemented on Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>Noting that Kinmen, which lies closer to China's Fujian province
than to Taiwan, has played a special role in cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, Hsieh said the government will consider the feasibility of
allowing Chinese investments in Kinmen on an experimental basis to
help boost the island's development.</P>
      <P>For decades, Kinmen has relied heavily on military personnel
stationed on the island for its economic activities.</P>
      <P>Under a military restructuring and troops-reduction plan, Hsieh
said, the number of military personnel stationed on Kinmen will be
trimmed substantially in the coming years.</P>

has expressed strong opposition to his attendance at the meeting to
be held in the South Korean port city of Busan Nov. 18-19.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that Taiwan's delegation at last year's APEC meetings
had presented measures against avian influenza; however, the
proposals did not get much attention.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan, which has experience in dealing with severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS), can increase global cooperation against
bird flu at this year's APEC summit, it will increase the country's
position in the international community, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Concerning the remarks by South Korean Minister of Foreign
Affairs and Trade Ban Ki-moon Thursday that it will conform with APEC
practice if Taiwan sends an official responsible for economic affairs
to attend the summit, Wang noted that China is South Korea's largest
trading partner, and it would be difficult for South Korea to resist
Beijing's pressure in this matter.</P>
      <P>Republic of China presidents have had to name special envoys to
attend APEC summits since 1993 due to the objections of China to the
participation of the country's head of state.</P>

    <HEADLINE>YEH CALLS FOR FAIR REVIEW OF MRT INVESTIGATIVE REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Acting Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh Chu-lan said
Friday she hopes local politicians and ordinary citizens as well can
give a fair review of a newly released investigation report on
suspected scandals involving the half-built mass rapid transit (MRT)
system in the southern Taiwan port city.</P>
      <P>Yeh, who led the five-member team that authored the investigation
report, said the main purpose of forming the special task force two
weeks ago to look into controversies surrounding the MRT project was
to present facts for public judgment.</P>
      <P>"Since the Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers working for the city's
MRT system against harsh treatment by their employers, the project
has been scandalized due to snowballing allegations involving the
project's building formula, construction bidding and hiring of
foreign laborers, " Yeh lamented. The team has presented its findings
after two weeks of hard work in an impartial, objective and
non-partisan manner, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>"We didn't have any bottom line, preset stance or political
consideration," Yeh stressed.</P>
      <P>As the team didn't have judicial power, Yeh said, it is not in a
position to criminalize any person. Yeh said the team will transfer
its findings about four items subject to inquiry to judicial
authorities for further investigation.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the investigative report, former Kaohsiung Mayor Wu
Duen-yi, who is now an opposition Kuomintang legislator, said the
report failed to live up to public expectations.</P>
      <P>"The report has deliberately skipped critical points,
particularly those involving suspected bidding scandals. Yeh has let
down me. She is incompetent, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party Legislator Chang Hsien-yao echoed
Wu's views, claiming that Yeh is not sincere in finding the truth.
Chang said the report didn't give a detailed account about the
application of the Government Procurement Law in various MRT
procurement projects and serious flaws in employing Thai laborers for
the project.</P>
      <P>Some observers said they wonder why the report didn't mention
whether Premier Frank Hsieh, who was Kaohsiung mayor before assuming
the premiership this February, was negligent or derelict in his
duties in supervising the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC)
operations.</P>
      <P>Responding to this, Hsieh said he welcomes further
investigations.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian directed Yeh to look into snowballing
allegations tied to the MRT project two weeks ago.</P>
      <P>Yeh Chu-lan served as the convener of the team and its four other
members included her two deputies -- Cheng Wen-lung and Tang
Chin-chuan -- as well as Secretary-General of the Kaohsiung City
Government Hao Chien-sheng and Department of Civil Service Ethics
Director Hwang Sheng-yih.</P>
      <P>After two weeks of intensive work, Yeh unveiled the team's
findings at a news conference held at the city headquarters at 3 p.m.</P>
      <P>The seven items subject to probes included management of the Thai
laborers; open tenders for six civil engineering bids; suspected
price rigging in Kaoshiung Rapid Transit Corp.'s (KRTC's) premixed
concrete procurement; MRT train carriage door specifications; price
adjustments; public art installations and formulation of the BOT
(build-operate-transfer) formula for the MRT construction.</P>
      <P>"Our findings regarding the first four items will require further
judicial probes to determine whether any kickbacks or irregularities
were involved," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Yeh said the team found that the city government's
Bureau of Labor Affairs should be held responsible for lax
supervision of the KRTC's labor management flaws and irregularities.</P>
      <P>While judicial authorities are pursuing whether any Taiwan
officials were involved in exploitation of Thai laborers working for
KRTC and other irregularities coming to light in the wake of the Aug.
21 riot, Yeh said the city government will call a personnel review
meeting next week to dispense discipline for labor affairs
administrators in terms of the team's findings for their lax
supervision.</P>
      <P>A group of opposition Kaohsiung City councilors said Friday they
were disappointed at a newly released investigation report on
suspected irregularities or scandals involving the half-built mass
rapid transit (MRT) system in the southern Taiwan port city.</P>
      <P>The city councilors from the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) said the report prepared by a five-member team
was too sketchy and failed to clarify controversies surrounding the
hiring of Thai laborers to work on MRT project.</P>
      <P>The city councilors, including Lin Kuo-cheng of the KMT and Kuo
chien-ming of the TSU, claimed that the skimpy report reflected the
team's critical weakness -- lacking in comprehensive understanding of
the utterly complicated project.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOO EARLY FOR EXPERTS TO BE SENT TO TAIWAN:  U.S. CDC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By J.L. Che and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is still too early to say whether the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will send
experts to Taiwan to help prevent the island from being affected by
avian influenza, a spokeswoman of the center said Friday.</P>
      <P>Christine Pearson made the comments in response to a question
raised by the Central News Agency regarding whether the center will
dispatch experts to Taiwan if the island sees an outbreak of the bird
flu.</P>
      <P>The CDC sent several of its experts to Taiwan during the
outbreaks in 2003 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).</P>
      <P>According to the spokeswoman, the CDC has sent its experts to
various disease-affected areas around the world to help prevent
further expansion of disease.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the world is paying much attention to the
possible outbreak of bird flu in Asia, Pearson said that it is
difficult to predict now the situations regarding any future
outbreaks and expansion of bird flu in the region; therefore, it is
still premature to talk about whether the center will send anyone to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wild birds are the hosts of the H5N1 virus that transmits the
disease. Although the virus does not typically infect humans, in
1997, however, the first instance of direct bird-to-human case was
documented during an outbreak of avian influenza among poultry in
Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>According to the center, from Dec. 30, 2004 to March 17, 2004, 12
confirmed human cases of avian influenza were reported in Thailand
and 23 in Vietnam, resulting in 23 deaths.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT CALLS FOR FAIRNESS IN CUTTING EX-PRESIDENTS' BENEFITS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu urged lawmakers
Saturday to be fair and just in seeking to cut back on the benefits
enjoyed by former presidents and vice presidents.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that President Chen Shui-bian and herself agreed to
a reduction of their salaries soon after they took office, Lu called
on those who are promoting the reforms to set a good example by
reducing their own pay first.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) has proposed amending the law governing benefits for former
presidents and vice presidents to reduce their pensions.</P>
      <P>The proposal has won the support of opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Under the current law, a former president and vice president
together get an annual pension of NT$52 million (US$1.54 million) .
The DPP is arguing that the situation is unreasonable compared with
that of the United States, where only former presidents are paid a
pension and former vice presidents do not get more than a seven-month
relocation allowance.</P>
      <P>Also on Saturday, DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang blamed the former
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , which pushed the law through the
legislature, for deliberately including former vice presidents.</P>
      <P>As a result, former vice president Lien Chan, now honorary
chairman of the KMT, has been receiving NT$470,000 a month in
retirement benefits, including NT$220,000 generated under a
preferential 18-percent annual interest rate for government
employees, Su noted.</P>
      <P>The amount is much higher than that received by the incumbent and
retired presidents, Su pointed out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT KICKS OFF 'TRAIN OF HOPE' TOUR IN SOUTHERN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's round-the-island
tour on a mobile stage kicked off in southern Taiwan Saturday to drum
up support for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP)
candidates in the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Officials from the DPP's Chiayi Chapter said that the "train of
hope" was converted from a 6.5 tonne truck. The president's first
stop is the parking lot behind the railway station in Talin, Chiayi.</P>
      <P>The president will elaborate on the government's policies and the
determination to pursue reforms in a 40-minute speech starting at
4:20 p.m. party officials said.</P>
      <P>They noted that the president hopes the use of the truck will
resonate with grassroots voters as this type of vehicle is identified
with local campaigning.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has a lot of experience in campaigning, held several
large rallies with magnificent sound and light shows in the run-up to
the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>For this year's campaign, however, he has decided to adopt a more
modest, low-key approach, hoping to highlight the government's
determination to pursue reforms, they said.</P>
      <P>Before President Chen's speech, DPP candidates for Chiayi County
magistrate and township will canvass votes in the area.</P>
      <P>President Chen's barnstorming approach is actually a follow-up to
a series of local seminars held in the wake of China opening to
Taiwan's agricultural products in August, when the president visited
rural areas to talk with local DPP officials on the government's
stance, advising them not to fall into the trap of China's "charm
offensive," which is said to have been effective.</P>
      <P>His more-than 30-stop barnstorming tour will then proceed to
Tainan city and county, and will continue to Hualien County, and
Taichung city and county Sunday.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu on Saturday urged
the government to accelerate the establishment of a National Human
Rights Commission, saying that the Presidential Office's Human Rights
Board has been pushing for this for several years.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while addressing the opening of the two-day
Conference on National Human Rights in the Asia-Pacific, which was
co-hosted by the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy and the Taiwan
Society of International Law at the Taipei-based Civil Service

      <P>Lu, doubling as the board's chairwoman, said Taiwan acquired its
freedom and democracy after a long period of struggle. Despite the
fact that it has being barred from the United Nations due to its
controversial political position, Taiwan still follows the U.N.'s
"Paris Principles, " which feature the ideas and importance in the
promotion of human rights commissions of all countries around the
world.</P>
      <P>In August, 2002, the board finished drafting the organic law and
the duties enforcement act of Taiwan's National Human Rights
Commission, Lu noted.</P>
      <P>Under the draft, the commission is authorized to map out relevant
regulations and policies regarding human rights, to oversee human
rights measures of government agencies and civil organizations, to
engage in investigations into human rights violations, to release the
country's annual report on human rights, to promote human rights
education and publicize human rights ideas, and to push for exchanges

      <P>Exporters had hoped that exports for 2006 could be increased to
100 tons, but for the sake of steady growth and familiarizing farmers

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T REFORMS, DOMESTIC INVESTMENT KEY TO 2006 GROWTH: THINK TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Successful government reforms and increased
domestic investments could drive up Taiwan's 2006 economic growth
rate to 4.51 percent from the current forecast of 4.02 percent,
according to the Chung Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER)
Saturday.</P>
      <P>If reforms and investments do not materialize or if Taiwan fails
to sign regional free trade agreements (FTA) , the economic growth
will drop to 3.65 percent, the institution said. The 2005 economic
growth rate was estimated at 3.53 percent.</P>
      <P>CIER's Center for Economic Forecasting Director Chou Chi said
there are many factors making up the calculation, each of which is
capable of effecting the economic development of Taiwan in the coming
year. They include high gasoline prices, the year-end local
elections, cross-strait exchanges, and the most influential -- the
possible outbreak of an avian influenza pandemic.</P>
      <P>Chou indicated that his center has built two different scenarios
to foresee Taiwan's economic activities in 2006. The first assumes
that " government reforms are implemented well, domestic investment
willingness is growing, global economic growth is on the rise, and
technology industrial giants act to expand their operational lines on
the island."</P>
      <P>Under this scenario, domestic investment will record a growth of
NT$10 billion (US$297.6 million) each quarter, beginning from the
first quarter of 2006, while a similar growth will also be registered
in exports.</P>
      <P>Chou said based on these calculations, civilian consumption
growth in 2006 is expected to increase to 3.04 percent from the
original forecast of 2.81 percent, while the growth rate of domestic
investments will expand to 8.74 percent from 6.54 percent.</P>
      <P>As to the second scenario, the researcher noted the assumption is
that Taiwan fails to enter regional FTA zones. Under this situation,
its 2006 exports will suffer a drop of NT$10 billion per quarter,
likewise with domestic investments.</P>
      <P>Therefore, civilian consumption growth is expected to drop from
2.81 percent to 2.63 percent, while the domestic investment growth
would be expected to move lower to 6.31 percent from 6.54 percent,
Chou added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL WOMEN'S LEAGUE OF ROC TO RETURN OFFICE LAND TO MILITARY</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Women's League of the Republic
of China will relocate and return the land it currently occupies to
the military, league chairwoman Cecilia Koo said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Koo made the remarks at a memorial service held to mark the
second anniversary of the passing of Soong Mayling, also known as
Madame Chiang Kai-shek, who helped found the league in 1950 in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Up until 1964, the league was called the Chinese Women's
Anti-Aggression League.</P>
      <P>Koo said that the establishment of the league aimed to serve
military personnel, and that it helped sew millions of military
uniforms and set up nurseries for the children of military personnel
over the years.</P>
      <P>But she noted that nowadays the living conditions for those in
the military are good, and that the league can do little in the way
of assistance. There is no more reason to occupy the land owned by
the military to use as a league office, she said.</P>
      <P>The league will relocate to Chingtao East Road from its current
premise at Changsha Street by the end of this year, Koo said.</P>
      <P>The office desk and chairs used by Madame Chiang will also be
moved to the new site for memory's sake, she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PRESIDENT URGES ASIAN DEMOCRACIES TO RESIST CHINA'S ENSLAVEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles,  Oct.  21 (CNA)
(By Y.C. Chen and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former ROC President Lee Teng-hui
called on democratic countries in Asia Friday to enhance their
cooperation to counter the system of enslavement enforced by
Communist China and to "push the flame of freedom to the darkest
corner in Asia."</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks while delivering a keynote address on "A
Strategy for Freedom in Asia" at the Formosa Foundation in Los
Angeles, the final leg of his two-week U.S. visit.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, as the wave of democratization moves toward the
Asia-Pacific region, China -- the last fortress of communist
enslavement -- is also rising in Asia, making the region the focal
point where freedom confronts enslavement.</P>
      <P>As to whether the rise of China will be peaceful or military will
depend on the choice of the Chinese government and its people and on
what strategy is adopted by the governments of free and democratic
countries, especially the United States, towards the future
development of China and the region, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee argued that free countries in the Asia-Pacific region lack a
concerted strategy towards the rise of China mainly because Beijing
has followed a strategy different from that of the former Soviet
Union -- which took an anti-America position and advocated the burial
of capitalism.</P>
      <P>Instead, China has established "constructive cooperation" with
the United States and is absorbing U.S. and international capital to
expand the economic, military, technological and diplomatic power of
its enslavement system, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that free and democratic countries enjoy an
advantage over those embracing enslavement, with China and North
Korea being the two isolated islands in the ocean of freedom and
democracy in the region.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the concept of "multi-polarity" promoted by China
is aimed at driving a wedge between democratic countries to isolate
the United States -- the leader of these free countries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has emerged as a fledging democracy in the third global
wave of democratization, amid the military threat from China and the
obstruction by the remnants of an alien power, he said.</P>
      <P>While the people of Taiwan will fight for their freedom, they
need the support of the United States and of all free people around
the world, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee said people in Asia are expecting the United States to form a
strategic alliance with Asian democracies such as India, Japan,
Taiwan and South Korea to open a new era of cooperation.</P>
      <P>The alliance should work together to resist the expansion of
China's military hegemony and to support the Chinese people to
struggle for freedom and against enslavement to force Beijing to
reform its politics and terminate the tyranny in China, he added.</P>
      <P>Also on Friday, Lee encouraged the people in Taiwan to enhance
their national identity and stick to their pursuit of democracy. He
was addressing a welcome reception hosted by Wei Wu-lien, director of
the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>Comparing the present situation in Taiwan to the 40-year exile of
the Israeli people following their exodus from Egypt, as recorded in
the Bible, Lee said a number of people in Taiwan are disoriented and
are thinking about going back to slavery in China, just like the
Israeli people back then.</P>
      <P>While it took 40 years for the Israeli people to reach their
promised land, Taiwan cannot wait another 40 years, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Having been ruled by foreign powers for more than 300 years,
Taiwan must stand firm to its belief that "Taiwan is Taiwan, not a
part of China" in order to secure its autonomy, he asserted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A seminar on strategies for urban renewal
and the Asian experience in practice will be held next month, the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Council officials said that the seminar, to be co-sponsored by
the CEPD and the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) , will invite
scholars, experts and figures from private enterprises at home and
overseas for the Nov. 10-11 seminar.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, a consensus can be forged on the strategy of urban
renewal in Taiwan through the exchanges of the participants, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>They noted that Taiwan will undergo dramatic changes in
population growth and living environment in the next 50 years. To
enhance the living quality in cities, use urban land wisely and
achieve the goals of sustainable development, the CEPD has worked
with the MOI to propose an urban renewal project in which it was
decided that not only will the central government create a specific
agency to see to the matter, but it will also work with the private
sector.</P>
      <P>They noted that urban renewal will bring huge benefits to the
nation, including the development of idle lands, increase revenues
from national assets, promote key industries, reinvigorate the
real estate market, upgrade the living quality of the people and
beautify the urban landscape.</P>
      <P>Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and other neighboring countries have
set good examples in this regard, they added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Jason Hu, mayor of Taichung City,
inaugurated his reelection campaign office with hoopla Saturday,
vowing to make the city a metropolis matching Taipei if he wins
another term.</P>
      <P>Touting the advancements the city has made during his past four
years in office, Hu said he has fulfilled only half of his 2001
campaign promise of making the city a rival of Kaohsiung and Taipei,
the two special municipalities of the country, as Taichung has
already caught up with Kaohsiung in the last four years in terms of
infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Now, the city is on its way to catching up with Taipei, the
former foreign minister said, asking the voters in the city to give
him another four years to fulfill his promise by making Taichung a
city that will hold its own against not only Taipei but any other
international metropolis.</P>
      <P>The inauguration attracted many of Hu's supporters, including
Lien Sheng-wen, the son of KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan,
Legislator Lai Shyh-bao, and Hsu Li-nung, the former leader of the
minnow New Party.</P>
      <P>Lien Sheng-wen congratulated Hu on behalf of his father, who is
currently visiting the mainland.</P>
      <P>The inauguration ceremony was rounded off by an appearance by KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who arrived a little behind schedule because
of his tight itinerary, and many of the spectators waited patiently
just for a glimpse of the KMT political star.</P>
      <P>Ma heaped praise upon Hu for his achievements over the last four
years, not least his efforts to cast the city into the international
limelight.</P>
      <P>Although Hu leads his rivals in the race in opinion polls, Ma
cautioned Hu's supporters not to take any chances and be sure to do
their best to help Hu win another four-year term, adding that
"supporting Hu is supporting me, because we are of the same group."</P>
      <P>The election of city and county chiefs is set for Dec. 3 and will
be held together with two other local elections.</P>

      <P>Taiwan women, regardless of their age,
occupation, status, education and working hours are more tired than
men, according to a survey released Saturday.</P>
      <P>The survey, jointly conducted by the Institute of Health Policy
and Management of National Taiwan University and the Council of Labor
Affairs, also found that young employed women, especially
those under the age of 45, are the most tired group of people,
probably because women in this age group have parents and children to
care for.</P>
      <P>By the same token, men of this age group are on average more
tired than their counterparts in other age groups.</P>
      <P>Also, the more education the women have, and the higher their
status in the office, the more tired they say they are, according to
the survey released Saturday in a seminar on public health.</P>
      <P>In general, people of either gender who have to work more than 49
hours a week, or have old people or small children to care for at
home, are most vulnerable to tiredness, the author of the survey
said. </P>
      <P>The survey conducted among 8,906 men and 6,382 women between the
ages of 25 and 65, asked the interviewed to rank their tiredness on a
scale from zero to 100, with 100 representing the most tired. It was
found that women are on average two to three points more tired than
men.</P>

in the U.S.-Japan security arrangements in the Asia-Pacific region, a
researcher with the private policy research institute Taiwan
Thinktank said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lai I-chung, director of Taiwan Thinktank's International Affairs
Department, said that Taiwan should not simply envisage that a
U.S.-Japan-Taiwan triangular structure can form a security bloc
against China. Instead, he opined, Taiwan should actively help
implement the U.S.-Japan security arrangements so that an
Asia-Pacific strategic order conducive to the development of maritime
democracies can be built in the region.</P>
      <P>Once a new Asia-Pacific strategic order is built, Taiwan can
engage in exchanges with other countries in the region more freely,
which will in turn help deepen Taiwan's democratization and
accelerate economic and social reforms at the same time, Lai said.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, Taiwan Thinktank, which is patterned after the
U.S. Rand Corp., has successfully integrated opinions in Taiwan and
led the common attention on a "U.S.-China-Taiwan" triangular
relations framework in the past to a new "U.S.-Japan-Taiwan"
strategic vision.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan Thinktank is working on a two-year program
aimed at working out a three-side cooperation agenda among Taiwan,
Japan and the United States after the establishment of the U.S.-Japan
Security Consultative Committee late last year, Lai said.</P>
      <P>The program is aimed at establishing areas for cooperation among
the three potential strategic partners; finding out ways to build a
composite security consultative mechanism; and tapping the
possibility of such cooperation, Lai added.</P>
      <P>Lai said that Taiwan Thinktank is scheduled to sponsor a
symposium, entitled "U.S.-Japan-Taiwan Strategic Dialogue, " at the
Westin Taipei Monday and Tuesday, to allow strategists from the three
countries to exchange views on U.S.-Japan-Taiwan alliance relations
in the wake of the establishment of the U.S.-Japan Security
Consultative Committee, particularly on issues pertaining to
security, economic and political integration.</P>
      <P>Noted figures expected to attend the symposium include Randall
Schriver, formerly a U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for
East Asian Affairs; Robin Sakoda, a top aide to former U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Richard Armitage; Rupert J.N. Hammond-Chambers,
president of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council: John Tkacik Jr., a
research fellow in China policy with the Heritage Foundation;
Hisahiko Okazaki, former Japanese ambassador to Thailand; and
Sumihiko Kawamura, a retired general with Japan's Defense Agency.</P>
      <P>In the Asia-Pacific security area, Lai said that with China's
increasing military expansion toward the western Pacific, the
military imbalance in the Taiwan Strait has become even more obvious.
He added, however, that the U.S. military presence in the
Asia-Pacific region plus the stepped-up U.S.-Japan security alliance
have created new opportunities and challenges regarding the prospects
of U.S.-Japan-Taiwan security cooperation.</P>
      <P>In the Asia-Pacific economic cooperation area, Lai said, the
economic alliance landscape in the region has been reshaped sharply
since China began actively taking part in regional economic groupings
in early 2005. With a new economic order facing Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum member countries, the rebuilding of economic
structures in the region would be a challenging issue for the
U.S.-Japan-Taiwan cooperation, he added.</P>
      <P>In the area of Asia-Pacific politics, he added that in the face
of Taiwan's constitutional re-engineering and Japan's new
constitutional agenda, as well as the leadership changes in Taiwan
and the United States in 2008, the United States, Japan and Taiwan
need to build mutual trust via institutional systems the sooner the
better.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANDIDATES SHOULD FOCUS ON PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOOD: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh lambasted Taiwan's
print media and opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
Sunday while calling on campaigning candidates in the year-end city
and county elections to focus their attention on proposing good
policies rather than on the ideologies of their political parties.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's print media need assistance, otherwise they will attempt
to "council" the president and the premier as to how to rule the
country, Hsieh said while stumping for ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) candidate for Taipei County magistrate, Lo Wen-jia, at
his campaign headquarters.</P>
      <P>By giving assistance to the print media, Hsieh said he meant
readers should read more than just one or two newspapers so they can
grasp the full picture of important happenings. Otherwise, they will
be misled by each newspapers's biased reports, he noted.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Taiwan's major newspapers can only keep their "old
readers, " and as a result, they have lost their competitive edge
against a Hong Kong newspaper. In making the comment, Hsieh did not
directly name the China Times and the United Daily News, two Taiwan
major dailies that have lost market share to Apple Daily from Hong
Kong.</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that when he told the Legislative Yuan that Taiwan's
unemployment rate in September hit a five-year low of 4.14 percent,
no newspapers reported it.</P>
      <P>He claimed that Taiwan's newspapers have become kind of like
"propaganda fliers" because they dare not carry stories that their
"old readers" may not like, and as a result, they are losing market
share to "the daily from Hong Kong" which at least carries more news
photos.</P>
      <P>The premier said Taiwan's Legislative Yuan has achieved nothing
in terms of passing any bills since June 1, and foreign media have
focused on the lawmakers' recent "school yard brawls" at the
legislature.</P>
      <P>In fact, there has been positive news in Taiwan, such as its
ability to produce Tamiflu, a drug capable of fighting avian flu, and
the declining jobless rate, according to the premier.</P>
      <P>If the lawmakers really want to serve the people, Hsieh said,
they should pass his special budget bill for flood control.</P>
      <P>The premier said that the lawmakers must put the people's
livelihood above all else, including their own party's fortunes.
"What does trying to win the local elections simply for the purpose
of boosting the chances of their respective parties in the 2008
presidential election have to do with the people's livelihood? " he
asked.</P>
      <P>In response to a KMT legislators' accusation that the
government's flood-control bill represents "pork barrel" politics,
Hsieh asked what the connection is between the bill and so-called
pork-barreling.</P>
      <P>If his administrative bills can be questioned, Hsieh said, then
he can also question KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's actions. "Why did
Ma, as mayor of Taipei, sell the Taipei Bank to Fubon group? Why
wasn't there a public bidding? Why did Ma go to a luxury club to
enjoy a shark's fin banquet? Why did he make the decision (to sell
the city-run bank) in spite of the bank union's opposition? And why
did he fire the union's leader?" Hsieh asked.</P>
      <P>The supreme court has just ruled that the union leader won his
suit against the city government, "so we can keep lambasting Chairman
Ma for a whole day. But we know this won't do anything to help
resolve the issue. As a member of the ruling party, we don't want to
do that," the premier said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh called on candidates in the county and city elections to
focus their attention on the people's livelihood and to put aside the
ideologies of their political parties. After all, the county and city
elections do not necessarily have anything to do with the next
presidential election which is more than two years away, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP, KMT CONTINUE BICKERING OVER BUDGET FOR FLOOD CONTROL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct.  23 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) reiterated its claim Sunday that the NT$80 billion
(US$2.54 billion) special budget in the Cabinet-proposed eight-year
flood-control bill is "pork-barreling" intended to boost the ruling
party's chances in the year-end county magistrate and mayor
elections.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lo Shih-hsiung told a press conference that at
least 19 categories in a detailed plan submitted by the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) government for the use of NT$12 billion of
the proposed budget are not related directly to flood control.</P>
      <P>These categories are mainly about planting trees to improve the
views and ecology along some of the river banks and providing
driveways and rest areas for motorists, Lo said, adding that the DPP
apparently is trying to use the budget to curry favor with the
voters.</P>
      <P>Pan Wei-kang, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus, said the
opposition is asking the Cabinet to rewrite its plan and that at the
same time, the KMT will also introduce its own version of a flood
control plan.</P>
      <P>In response to the KMT claim, the Water Resources Agency under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs denied that the money set aside for
improving the views and ecology along river banks amounts to pork
barrelling, saying that the spending will account for only 10 percent
of the total budget.</P>
      <P>At a separate press conference, DPP Legislator Cheng Yun-peng
acknowledged that 63 percent of the total budget will be spent on
flood control in DPP-controlled cities and counties. He explained
that this is simply due to the fact that most of the flood-plagued
areas in Taiwan are in the central and southern parts of the country,
where the DPP happens to have more voter support.</P>

Taipei City's Jenai Road, the Presidential Office reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Presidential Office Department of Public Affairs

(By Chao Yen, S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Education is increasingly regarded as a
service industry in the free market, so the government should open up
the market and refrain from planning out or interfering in its
development, former Education Minister Kuo Wei-fan said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Kuo, one of the 51 Taiwan participants in the 2005 cross-Taiwan
Strait basic education forum being held in Shanghai, made the remarks
while speaking on "Social Changes and School Leadership." A total of
400 scholars and experts were in attendance for Kuo's speech.</P>
      <P>He said the trends of trade and educational globalization have
resulted in increased cross-border flows of education personnel as
more and more students and professors have been visiting other
countries on study or exchange programs, becoming so-called
"knowledge migrants."</P>
      <P>He noted that since 2002, when Taiwan and China joined the World
Trade Organization, education has been regarded as a kind of service
industry. He suggested that education officials and school leaders
make policies and strategies from the standpoint of "education
globalization."</P>
      <P>While advising the government authorities not to meddle in the
development and operations of higher education institutions, Kuo also
warned against running higher education like a pure enterprise.</P>
      <P>He cited the example of some well-known universities that have
been trying hard to lure top students by hiring world-class
professors and offering handsome scholarships and that have
consequently given people the perception of "corruption at higher

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MEDICAL MISSION HELPS SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE CONTROL MALARIA</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> 
By Sofia Wu
CNA Staff Writer</P>
      <P>Taipei, Oct. 23 (CNA) The Republic of China medical mission
stationed in Sao Tome and Principe deserves credit for helping bring
malaria under control in the West African state, the Sao Tomean
ambassador to Taipei said over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Speaking in an interview with CNA, Ambassador Ladislau F.
Dalmeida said he had fallen victim to malaria numerous times since
childhood, but never after 2003 when a new campaign against the
life-threatening vector-borne disease was launched in his country
with assistance from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During ROC President Chen Shui-bian's state visit to Sao Tome and
Principe in July 2002, he promised to assist in ridding the African
ally of malaria. Diplomatic and public health officials from both
countries then began working on a viable collaborative program to
that end.</P>
      <P>Located in the Gulf of Guinea near the equator, Sao Tome and
Principe boasts beautiful scenery and is one of the world's major
cocoa producers. But malaria has persistently presented obstacles to
its social and economic development.</P>
      <P>In the summer of 2003, Lien Jih-ching, a National Taiwan
University medical professor versed in malaria control, traveled to
Sao Tome and Principe to assist in combating malaria.</P>
      <P>Besides spraying alphacypermethrin -- a highly active broad
spectrum insecticide, Lien also employed smoke and insect growth
regulators (IGR) to inhibit larval mosquitoes from growing to
maturity. Some mosquitoes are capable of transmitting malaria, so
larvae control is very important in malaria eradication.</P>
      <P>The three-way approach had amazing results. By November of that
year, a 35-bed hospital in Principe which had always been packed with
malaria patients, was empty of patients. The extraordinary event
caused a stir throughout Africa at the time.</P>
      <P>Between 1980 and 1982, the World Health Organization (WHO)
conducted a disinfection program in Sao Tome by spraying DDT. The
program indeed helped cut the malaria incidence rate from 19.2
percent to 0.6 percent. However, the program had a horrific
side-effect -- nearly all poultry raised by the country's residents
died after eating DDT-contaminated "American cockroaches, " as did
cats which ate DDT-contaminated mice. The residents were so scared
that they refused to accept further DDT spraying.</P>
      <P>In the late 1990s, Sao Tome and Principe joined a "Roll Back
Malaria" project co-sponsored by the WHO and several other
U.N.-affiliated organizations to help all African countries reduce
the human and socio-economic costs of malaria. The WHO's goal is to
cutting the malaria incidence and death rates by half by 2010.</P>
      <P>However, the WHO campaign didn't seem to deliver on its promises.
By 2002, the incidence rate in Sao Tome was even higher than before.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the differences between the WHO-sponsored and
Taiwan-invented malaria-fighting programs in his country, Dalmeida
said WHO medical experts couldn't stay long enough to assist in the
implementation of practical programs.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Dalmeida said, Taiwan medical professionals have
taken up residence in the country on a long-term basis. They joined
the efforts at the grass-roots level, conducting field surveys,
disinfecting all corners of the country, controlling the growth of
vector insects, and prescribing medication to in-patients and
out-patients.</P>
      <P>"Before I traveled to Taipei to take up my post, I toured the
Taiwan medical mission's laboratory. I was surprised to find there
were live vector mosquitoes in specially designed cases for
experimentation. I think that superior professional expertise and
wholehearted devotion are the factors behind the Taiwan medical
team's success," Dalmeida said.</P>
      <P>With malaria brought under control, Dalmeida said Sao Tome and
Principe has seen significant progress in its tourism and economic
development.</P>
      <P>"We have seen the return of European tourists. Our people have
become healthier and are now strong enough to work. Job opportunities
have increased, as have incomes. Child mortality has dropped and the
survival rate is up. They can safely go to school. All these are good
things and benefits that come with the control of malaria, " Dalmeida
said.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that his country is set to explore the rich oil
reserves beneath its territorial waters. The country is also pulling
out all the stops to attract foreign investment to boost the
development of financial and banking services, power generation,
telecommunications, tourism and the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>"Foreign investors no longer have to face the risk of coming down
with malaria. Without the control of malaria, our economic take-off
program would have always remained just a dream," Dalmeida said.</P>
      <P>Professor Lien, who is currently in Taipei, echoed Dalmeida's
view, saying that the control of malaria has brought tremendous
economic benefits to Sao Tome and Principe, which consists of two
main volcanic islands and several small islets.</P>
      <P>"When I made my first visit to Sao Tome, there were few cars in
the streets. But now, taxi cabs are everywhere. The room rate at Sao
Tomean hotels was about 50 euros a night in the past, but the rate
has surged to 85 euros. The Sao Tomean government is planning to
build a five-star tourist hotel to attract more foreign visitors.
This was beyond imagination just a few years ago, " Lien said.</P>
      <P>Noting that malaria is a centuries-old infectious disease, Lien
said that science still has no silver bullet for it and that many
doubt whether there ever will be one. Nevertheless, effective
low-cost strategies are available for treatment, prevention and
control of malaria, Lien explained.</P>
      <P>With their bitter memories of the DDT disinfection program, Sao
Tomeans were initially skeptical about his malaria-control measures.
"Once the effectiveness became evident, Sao Tomeans developed respect
and affection for all of our medical mission members. They now call
us 'amigo' (friend) whenever they meet us, " Lien said.</P>
      <P>According to Lien, Sao Tomeans are receptive to his
malaria-control methods because the insecticides used are not
detrimental to the health of poultry and other animals.</P>
      <P>Since an additional nationwide disinfection campaign in Sao Tome
and Principe in 2004, Lien said, the number of hospitalized malaria
patients has dropped further.</P>
      <P>Touching on the Taiwan media mission's future work goals, Lien
said he hopes the malaria incidence rate among Sao Tomeans younger
than nine years of age can be cut to 1 percent from the current 10
percent by 2006 and that all present malaria patients can be cured.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO TRACES OF BIRD FLU VIRUS FOUND IN WILD BIRD DROPPINGS TESTED TO DATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>None of the wild bird dropping samples
tested in Taiwan so far this year have tested positive for the
presence of the bird flu virus, an official with the Wild Bird
Society of Taipei said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Wild Bird Society of Taipei has been commissioned by the
government since 1997 to monitor wild or migratory birds visiting
Taiwan for the purpose of keeping avian flu and other fowl diseases
at bay after 18 people in Hong Kong were infected with the H5N1
strain of the bird flu virus that year, said Ho I-hsien, a quarantine
expert with the wild bird society.</P>
      <P>During the 1997 bird flu outbreak, six out of the 18 people died
as a result of being infected, Ho said, adding that some 1.5 million
birds were destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, Ho said, the Wild Bird Society of Taipei has each
year hired 40 volunteers to collect more than 2,000 wild bird
dropping samples islandwide, testing samples three times per month.</P>
      <P>This year, the Tamshui Livestock Disease Control Center under the
Council of Agriculture has adopted even high standards, with samples
being sent to the center for testing four times a month and the
annual total being boosted to 3,000 samples.</P>
      <P>Liu Hsin-pai, president of the society, called for the Taiwan
public to refrain from having direct contact with birds, freeing
birds into the wild, purchasing poultry meat of unknown origin,
coming into contact with poultry meat, and visiting crowded public
places.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu said, people should also get into the habit of
washing theirs hands more frequently, as well as receive a flu shot
and closely monitor their own health.</P>

    <DATELINE>Shanghai,  Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As China gradually opens up its cultural
market, Taiwan, with its advantages in such areas as creativity and
software design, should seize the opportunity to enter that vast
market full of potential, the founding president of Fo Guang (Buddha
Light) University said in Shanghai Sunday.</P>
      <P>Kung Peng-cheng made the remarks at a cross-Taiwan Strait
cultural industry development forum attended by more than 50
specialists and officials, including Su Chung, a department director
of Taiwan's Council for Cultural Affairs.</P>
      <P>Kung said China's cultural market is being opened up, including
its printing and retail sectors, adding that for those sectors not
yet liberalized, Taiwan could try to break into them by forming joint
ventures with Chinese partners.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's businesspeople have a chance to enter China's cultural
market if they want to develop their own brands or run their
businesses independently, he said, noting that the only taboo right
now is ideology.</P>
      <P>He envisioned a day when China will take a more open attitude
toward its cultural industry, at which time Taiwan's cultural
businesses may move to China.</P>
      <P>"This is nothing to worry about, " he said, citing the example of
the U.S. cultural industry within which "publishers do not all
operate inside the United States."</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's cultural industry will be able to "keep its own
style" when operating in China, as long as it can keep its advantages
in creativity, information and software design.</P>
      <P>Asked if Taiwan's prospects of making inroads into China's
cultural market would be affected by the so-called "de-sinicization"
campaign espoused by some people on the island, Kung said that it
would pose only a "temporary obstacle" as "people would think for
themselves and find a way out."</P>
      <P>Those trying to stop Taiwan's cultural industry from "going west"
should look at the future from the standpoints of cultural and
industrial development, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC REVAMP CRITICAL TO TAIWAN'S FUTURE: FORMER PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles,  Oct.  22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting former ROC President Lee
Teng-hui said Saturday that economic reinvigoration is critical to
Taiwan's future and survival in the face of China's ambition to annex
the country.</P>
      <P>Addressing more than 2,000 Taiwan expatriates attending a dinner
party held in his honor in Los Angeles, Lee said Taiwan's present
predicament is due to three factors -- a lack of strong national
identity among its people, an ignorance of China's true nature, and
the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration's inability to
end the opposition camp's boycott against its policy initiatives at
every turn.</P>
      <P>Lee, an outspoken advocate of rectifying Taiwan's official title
-- the Republic of China -- to substantiate its separate national
identity, reminded the DPP administration that if it cannot improve
the economy, it won't be able to enhance the Taiwan people's national
identity.</P>
      <P>Lee, the first Taiwan-born ROC president, said he is worried
about the prospects of Taiwan's "native regime" -- referring to the
DPP administration -- in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Quoting forecasts by a Taiwan research institute, Lee said
Taiwan's economic growth rate is estimated at a mere 3.5 percent for
this year. In terms of Taiwan's economic strength and its past
records, Lee said the growth rate should reach 6 percent or 7
percent.</P>
      <P>Lee said the DPP administration should make an overall review of
its economic development policy and make necessary amendments in
order to rev up the sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>Touching on China's "magnetic effect" in attracting foreign
capital, Lee criticized the DPP administration's replacing his
administration's "no haste, be patient" policy on China-bound
investments with a "proactive opening, effective management" one.
"The DPP administration, while actively liberalizing China-bound
investments, fails to effectively manage such activities, resulting
in a massive exodus of various Taiwan industries," Lee said.</P>
      <P>In the future, Lee said, Taiwan should restrict outbound
relocation of high value-added and high-tech industries while
investing heavily in "star industries of tomorrow" by integrating
optoelectronics, laser and semiconductor technologies.</P>
      <P>After five years in power, Lee said, the DPP can no longer claim
it is inexperienced in managing the nation's economy.</P>
      <P>"The DPP should sort out a new direction for Taiwan's economic
development. So long as Taiwan can consolidate its young democracy
and revitalize its economy, China would have little chance of annex
Taiwan," Lee said.</P>
      <P>While China has deployed 700-plus missiles against Taiwan, Lee
said he doesn't think that China would launch a large-scale
amphibious attack on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It is most likely to launch a surprise attack on Taiwan similar
to the strategy used by Japan in attacking Pearl Harbor during World
War II," Lee said.</P>
      <P>More worrisome is that China is adopting a "divide-and-conquer"
strategy by "colluding" with Taiwan's opposition parties to obstruct
the DPP administration's major policy initiatives.</P>
      <P>"For instance, the opposition 'pan-blue alliance' has gained an
initial success in blocking the passage of an arms procurement
package in the legislature, " Lee said, adding that Beijing now is
stepping up efforts to tempting Taiwan's legislators and city/county
councilors into cooperating with it to sway Taiwan's policy lines.</P>
      <P>Lee said China can now even influence Taiwan's news media, citing
as proof that major Taiwan media outlets have refrained from giving
prominent coverage of his current U.S. visit.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Lee delivered a speech on Taiwan's future at
a seminar held at the Pasadena Convention Center.</P>
      <P>Following the end of the Cold War in the 20th century, Lee said
the world is shaping a new order. It is possible that a new cold war
may come forth. In his view, Lee said, the tide of democracy should
be in favor of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan, at the forefront of the fight against China, will face
unprecedented challenges and tests. We should carefully monitor
international situation, the U.S. global strategy and China's Asia
strategy in order to work out feasible countermeasures," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Los Angeles is the fourth and last leg of Lee's current two-week
U.S. visit which already took him to Anchorage, New York and
Washington, D.C. He is scheduled to depart for home Sunday.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   23  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Education Ministry Employees
Association was formed Sunday with more than 1,200 members who will
be able to negotiate terms of working conditions and to participate
in policy making at the units they are working at.</P>
      <P>Of the 1,200 members, more than 300 work at National Taiwan
University, over 100 at National Taiwan Normal University, with the
rest coming from other national universities and high schools.</P>
      <P>Minister Tu Cheng-sheng said, previously, public service
employees' rights and duties had been regulated from top down, now
the process is reversed. "As long as rights and duties are clearly
defined, the association should be a positive force in promoting the
ministry's administrative work," he added.</P>
      <P>Chu Nan-hsien, director of personnel of the education ministry,
said that in addition to the National Teachers' Union, the ministry
now has one more "counterpart" group to talk with. He said he hopes
the association will forward grass-roots messages to the ministry.</P>
      <P>Within 30 days of launching, the association should call a board
of directors and supervisors meeting and register itself with the
government, following which it will have the power to negotiate and
put forward policy proposals to the ministry.</P>
      <P>If the negotiations break down, the association can ask for
mediation; if mediation also fails, it can ask for a dispute
arbitration. Arbitration will be binding on the association as well
as the government agencies.</P>
      <P>If the arbitration is not honored, the Ministry of Public Service
under the Examination Yuan will send the case to the Control Yuan,
which is responsible for disciplining rule-breaking public
functionaries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T URGED TO ADOPT POSITIVE STANCE ON CHINESE OFFICIAL'S VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official in charge of national security
affairs suggested Sunday that the government adopt a positive stance
on a senior Chinese official's proposed visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was referring
to a planned visit to Taiwan by Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan
Affairs Office under China's State Council.</P>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Friday it will invite
Chen Yunlin to attend an economic forum to be sponsored by the party
and its adversary-turned-partner -- the Communist Party of China
(CPC) -- in Taipei in December. If the invitation materializes, Chen
Yunlin will be the highest-ranking Chinese official ever to visit
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The KMT's announcement came amid a new low ebb in cross-Taiwan
Strait relations due to Beijing's opposition to President Chen
Shui-bian's decision to name Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
to attend the upcoming informal leadership meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum on his behalf.</P>
      <P>According to the national security official, there are pros and
cons within the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to Chen
Yunlin's visit. "The government has yet to make a final decision on
the issue," he said.</P>
      <P>As for his personal opinion, the official said the DPP
administration's international image would be tainted if it rejects
Chen Yunlin's visa application.</P>
      <P>"And if the government accepts his visit, it would bring Taiwan
into the limelight in international media coverage and glorify the
government's open and liberal image," the official said.</P>
      <P>The visit will also enable Chen Yunlin to see for himself
Taiwan's pluralistic society in action as both proponents and
opponents would definitely swarm to Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport to welcome or protest Chen his arrival.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT HAILS IMPROVEMENT IN CRIME RATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday that
thanks to police officers' concerted efforts, Taiwan has made
progress in lowering crime rate and improving public order.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while attending a garden party organized by
the Ministry of the Interior at the Presidential Office plaza in down
Taipei to promote healthy living and accentuate its determination to
crack down on crime and create a safe, secure living environment.</P>
      <P>With the arrests of several notorious fugitives in the past year,
Chen said Taiwan's crime rate has declined. Nevertheless, he said,
the government will not be complacent about its current achievements
and will even redouble its efforts to fight criminal activities.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Chen continued his nationwide barnstorming
campaign tour to stump for ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP's) candidates for the Dec. 3 "three-in-one" elections for
city/county chiefs, city/county councilors and township chiefs.</P>
      <P>Chen took advantage of a campaign rally in Taichung County in
central Taiwan to criticize an opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
advertisement in which the former ruling party "claims to win back
Taiwan" in 2008 by winning the year-end elections as the first step.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the KMT advertisement depicts Taiwan's current
situation in a negative perspective, Chen said Taiwan has actually
obtained good ratings in various international surveys, including
ranking fifth in the global growth competitiveness and topping the
list of government digitalization.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, U.S., JAPAN URGED TO WORK TOGETHER FOR REGIONAL SECURITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>At a time when the Asia-Pacific region is
in a fluid state, it is imperative for Taiwan, Japan and the United
States to work together to form a triangular dialogue mechanism,
President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is clear about its responsibility as part of the
Asia-Pacific region and hopes that the United States, Japan and
Taiwan strengthen their integration in the security, political and
economic areas to work together to promote peace, security and
stability in the region, " Yu Shyi-kun, Presidential Office
secretary-general, said during a keynote speech at the opening of a
symposium on "U.S.-Japan-Taiwan Strategic Dialogue" at the Westin
Taipei Monday.</P>
      <P>The geopolitical landscape of the Asia-Pacific region has been
changing drastically over the last decade, with new variables popping
up one after another, such as the rise of China and India, Taiwan's
power transition, South Korea's new strategic position, the end of
the Cold War in North Korea, and so on, Yu said.</P>
      <P>He cited U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick as having
said recently that China "will not necessarily rise peacefully, " and
concurred with the high-ranking U.S. official's comment that China
will not earn the respect of the international community unless it
democratizes and becomes more transparent and takes up more
responsibilities in the world.</P>
      <P>China is the biggest security challenge to Taiwan, Yu said,
adding that the crux of the cross-Taiwan Strait issue is not
"independence" versus "unification, " but instead whether the regime
in Beijing is willing to end one-party totalitarian rule and whether
it will respect the reality of the existence of the 23 million people
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yu stressed that besides maintaining military and security
strength, seeking economic security is the most crucial task for
Taiwan at present.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, he pointed out, working out how to enhance
economic cooperation among Japan, Taiwan and United States; helping
Taiwan integrate into other economic and regional groupings in the
region; and signing U.S.-Taiwan and Taiwan-Japan free trade pacts
have become the most pressing missions of the envisaged
U.S.-Japan-Taiwan security arrangement.</P>
      <P>Yu called for the United States, Japan and Taiwan to accelerate
their security, political and economic cooperation.</P>
      <P>In security, he suggested that the three sides engage in deeper
discussions in several areas, including military training and
intelligence information exchanges as well as integration of warfare
and military strategies.</P>
      <P>In the area of economics, he suggested that the three sides meet
and discuss response measures to the impact on the regional economic
order of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, the
prospective East Asia Summit, and the "ASEAN plus three" process.</P>
      <P>As for political cooperation, he suggested that the three sides
build mutual trust via institutional systems, discuss the building of
a regular, single-track strategic dialogue mechanism or exchange
views on whether to help Taiwan integrate into the
U.S.-Japan-Australia strategic dialogue mechanism.</P>
      <P>The "U.S.-Japan-Taiwan Strategic Dialogue" symposium opened at
the Westin Taipei Monday under the sponsorship of the private policy
research institute Taiwan Thinktank.</P>
      <P>Noted personalities taking part in the two-day symposium include
Randall Schriver, formerly a U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state
for East Asian Affairs; Robin Sakoda, a top aide to former U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage; Rupert J.N.

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CAPABLE OF MASS PRODUCING TAMIFLU WITHIN 3 TO 5 MONTHS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is capable of beginning mass
production of Tamiflu, a drug used to treat influenza, within three
to five months at the earliest, a researcher from the National Health
Research Institutes (NHRI) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang Chung-ming, director of NHRI Domestic Research Department,
told a public hearing organized by the legislative caucus of the
Democratic Progressive Party that it usually takes 15 months to mass
produce an new drug.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the NHRI had successfully synthesized 20 grams of
Tamiflu in a laboratory in 18 days, Chang said the obstacles to the
mass production of the drug lie in getting enough shikimic acid, one
of the raw materials used to make the drug, and finding
pharmaceutical firms with international accreditation to produce it.</P>
      <P>With these two problems solved, Chang said, it would be possible
to mass produce the drug in three to five months.</P>
      <P>In the same hearing, Vice Minister of the Department of Health
(DOH) Chen Tsai-ching said the DOH is working on a set of policies to
help set up a vaccine producing industry in Taiwan in light of the
emergence of a several new contagious diseases in recent years.</P>
      <P>According to the policy in the works, Chen said, the government
will offer vaccine producers tax breaks, licenses to produce, and
guaranteed purchases of their product at set prices, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The vice minister also said the DOH is planning to set up a pilot
vaccine factory which will transfer technology to local firms in five
years to grab a slice of the vaccine production pie which at present
is virtually monopolized by foreign producers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INFLUENZA VACCINE NOT EFFECTIVE AGAINST AVIAN FLU: HEALTH OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The influenza vaccine currently available
on the market can't ward off avian flu which is transmitted through
contact with birds, Vice Minister of Department of Health Chen
Tsai-ching said Monday.</P>
      <P>Noting that growing fears of a possible avian flu pandemic has
sent local people scrambling to get flu shots, Chen said the vaccine
is useless against the H5N1 strain of the avian flu virus.</P>
      <P>The government has for years offered free flu vaccinations to
people over the age of 65 and under the age of two and to anyone
suffering from a serious disease. However, the flu vaccine is
ineffective against bird flu.</P>
      <P>Bird flu spreads quickly among poultry partly because of the
farming system in which the animals are kept in small enclosed spaces
and because of the unhygienic methods used to slaughter the animals,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Before these two problems are solved, Chen said, avian flu can
hardly be wiped out.</P>

The leading edge of Hurricane Wilma was expected to strike the
Gulf Coast of Florida shortly after midnight as a Category 3 storm,
with the eye moving ashore near dawn. The storm was expected to
rapidly move northeast across the state, reaching the Atlantic Ocean
east of Lake Okeechobee. As hundreds of thousands of people prepared
for Hurricane Wilma, another tropical system dumped torrential rain
on Haiti and the Dominican Republic on Sunday.

Wall Street Journal: Novel Way to Assess School Competition Stirs
Academic Row

Five years ago Harvard's Caroline Hoxby, a rising star in
economics, wrote a paper that reached an unusual conclusion: Cities
with more streams tended to have schools with higher test scores. In
the fierce national debate over free-market competition in public
schools, Hoxby is challenged by Jesse Rothstein, a young professor at
Princeton, who says her study is full of flaws. The debate has
spotlighted the challenges economists face as they study possible
solutions to one of the United States' most pressing problems: the
poor performance of some public schools. Despite a vast array of
statistical tools, economists have had a very hard time coming up
with clear answers.</TEXT>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture has prepared 70
million doses of avian vaccines to address possible avian influenza
outbreaks, council Minister Lee Chin-lung said Monday.</P>
      <P>Mandatory vaccinations will be given in a radius of three
kilometers of an avian-flu-affected farm or area that is expanding,
Lee told lawmakers while giving a report at the Legislative Yuan's
Committee of Economics and Energy on the council's measures to
prevent and control an avian flu pandemic.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the council "has done its best to prepare for the
worst." However, he underscored that mandatory vaccinations will not
be implemented until an outbreak begins to expand.</P>
      <P>Song Hua-tsung, head of the council's Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine, explained that the cordon
vaccinations would be based on common international methods in
dealing with pandemic outbreak in animal populations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's poultry industry is worth about NT$25 billion (US$740.96
million) a year. Lee said his council has also organized a series of
seminars and lectures as part of its efforts to equip local breeders
and relevant business operators with knowledge and know-how in the
prevention of an avian flu pandemic.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that so far Taiwan is still a non-avian flu country and
its poultry is perfectly safe for human consumption. He suggested
poultry be cooked at 100 degree Celsius or more for one minute before
serving since viruses can be killed at this temperature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'MINI LINKS' PASSENGERS MAY START SELF-HEALTH MONITORING: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen, Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Passengers entering the Taiwan-held islands
of Kinmen and Matsu from China will probably be asked to start a
10-day, self-health monitoring program, Taiwan's top health official
said here Monday.</P>
      <P>Department of Health Minister Hou Sheng-mou said that as soon as
new cases of humans testing positive for bird flu are reported from
China, passengers from the mainland will be asked to start 10 days of
self-health monitoring upon their arrival in Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Hou, who traveled to Kinmen Sunday and inspected operations of
the health department's Center for Disease Control at Kinmen's
Shuitou Seaport Monday, said that Kinmen and Matsu, the two frontline
islands located nearest the Chinese mainland, are also on the
forefront in the battle against epidemics such as avian flu.</P>
      <P>Kinmen and Matsu are two ROC islands authorized to engage in
direct trade, post and shipping links with Xiamen and Mawei of
China's Fujian province, commonly known as the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>Since Kinmen and Matsu are so close to China, they are being
watched closely after birds were found to have been smuggled from
China 10 days ago and were seized in Taichung, central Taiwan that
tested positive for H5N1 -- the avian flu strain that poses the
greatest threat of mutating into a form that could ignite a human
pandemic, Hou said.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Council of Agriculture confirmed Oct. 20 that
270 out of some 1,000 smuggled birds discovered hidden aboard a
Panama-registered freighter anchored in Taichung Harbor Oct. 14, 19
species of birds, including -- hill mynahs (Gracula religiosa) ,
black-naped orioles (Oriolus chinensis) and Pekin robins, also known
as Chinese nightingales (Leiothrix lutea) -- were assumed to be H5N1
positive, as eight of the birds randomly selected from the three
kinds tested H5N1 positive, the officials said, adding that all of
the smuggled birds were destroyed by burning.</P>
      <P>None of the H5N1-infected birds made it onto Taiwan soil and none
of the 40 Taiwan personnel who took part in an operation involving
the birds have shown any flu symptoms as of Monday.</P>
      <P>The health department's Center for Disease Control, which has
implemented temperature-taking measures at Kinmen's Shuitou Seaport
since April 2003 after an outbreak of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) , is preparing to make some 14,000 copies of
self-health monitoring forms available to the public, according to
health department officials.</P>
      <P>Currently, passengers from Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and
Cambodia are asked upon arrival in Taiwan to conduct a 10-day
self-health monitoring program as part of Taiwan's bird flu-response
policy.</P>
      <P>Also on Monday, Hou visited Kinmen Hospital, which was upgraded
from a county-level hospital to a medical institution under the
direct jurisdiction of the health department Oct. 1.</P>
      <P>Hou promised to see to it that facilities at Kinmen Hospital are
further increased and upgraded to help raise the standards of the
hospital's medical services.</P>
      <P>Yen Chung-cheng, head of the Kinmen local government, who was
also present at the occasion, expressed his hope that services at
Kinmen Hospital will continue to be expanded so that the hospital can
accord medical services to not just the civilian and military
patients from Kinmen alone, but also to Taiwan business people
operating in China and patients from China's Fujian province.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT VICE CHAIRMAN LEADS GROUP TO CHINA FOR TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) group of
think tank members and lawmakers will head for China Tuesday, where
they will hold a series of talks with Chinese officials on the
protection of Taiwan business interests.</P>
      <P>KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang, who will lead the group, made the
announcement at the KMT headquarters Monday while explaining the
group's itinerary at a news conference prior to the trip.</P>
      <P>The mission will first visit Yangzhou and Wuxi in Jiangsu
province and Shanghai to hold seminars with Taiwan businessmen, while
it will take part in working meetings with Chinese officials from the
Ministry of Information Industry and the Taiwan Affairs Office under
the State Council late this month in Beijing to exchange views in
bettering personal safety, tax incentives and soft loans for Taiwan
investors.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that they will present some actual problem cases that
Taiwan businessmen have encountered in China to find solutions.</P>
      <P>In response to questions from reporters that they might be
attacked by the pro-independence "pan green" camp, which favors no
contact with China, Chiang said that the KMT is willing to do its
best to help better take care of China-based Taiwan businessmen
because "Taiwan also gets hurt should Taiwan business interests be
damaged in China."</P>
      <P>China has been the top investment destination for Taiwan, but the
many Taiwan investors there have long lacked adequate protection, he
pointed out.</P>
      <P>KMT Policy Executive Committee Director Tseng Yung-chuan, who
returned to Taiwan from China over the weekend after having talks on
tourists entering Taiwan with Chinese officials in Beijing, said that
the KMT has forged ahead in promoting cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges
since former KMT Chairman Lien Chan concluded a landmark "journey of
peace" to China from April 26 to May 3.</P>
      <P>Evidence can be seen in that China immediately announced its
decision to allow Chinese tourists to sightsee in Taiwan the same day
shortly prior to Lien's departure for Taiwan on May 3 and that
Chinese National Tourism Administration Director Shao Qiwei will
visit Taiwan this week to study local tourist spots and facilities,
Tseng said.</P>
      <P>The KMT also set up a Taiwan businessmen's service center in
early August, which is directed by Chiang.</P>

      <P>Taiwan-Panama diplomatic ties remain stable
despite some hearsay and speculation circulating in recent weeks,
government officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Michel Lu reiterated
that relations between the two countries are solid, and he called
recent media reports that bilateral diplomatic ties could be severed
"groundless."</P>
      <P>Lu's remarks came after a Panamanian daily newspaper, La Prensa,
reported last Friday that a former Panamanian foreign minister and a
legislative leader had asked President Martin Torrijos to cut
diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the report, their request might have had something
to do with President Chen Shui-bian's talks at the summit meeting
between the Republic of China and its Central American and Caribbean
diplomatic allies held in late September in Nicaragua.</P>
      <P>Citing explanations by Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan San Chen,
Lu told the Central News Agency that opinions within the Panamanian
government have been divided over shifting diplomatic recognition
from Taiwan to Beijing and that it is normal in a democratic society
that differences sometimes emerge on some issues. It is unnecessary
for the outside world to speculate over this issue, Lu quoted Chen as
saying.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general of the Presidential Office, also

      <P>A department chief at the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) tendered his resignation
Monday to take responsibility for a railway reconstruction site
accident that caused the derailment of a cargo train between Sungshan
and Nankang in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Answering questions at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
Communications Committee, Minister of Transportation and
Communications Lin Ling-san said Hsieh Chao-yi, chief of the Railway
Reconstruction Bureau, had tendered his resignation orally, and that
the resignation will be accepted.</P>
      <P>Lin also apologized to railway passengers for the inconvenience
the derailment caused them.</P>
      <P>The accident occurred at 4: 40 a.m. Monday when the steel wire of
a cantilever crane working on the Nankang railway reconstruction
project snapped, causing the cantilever to collapse onto the
railway's electric wires.</P>
      <P>A cargo train that happened to pass the scene at the time
derailed, disrupting both north-bound and south-bound train services
between the Sungshan district in Taipei City and Shihchih City in
Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Repair work began immediately but it took about 12 hours for the
railway service to return to normal.</P>
      <P>The Railway Reconstruction Bureau has been a target of criticism
recently because of a number of construction accidents that forced
the Taiwan Railway Bureau to alter its train schedule and caused
great inconvenience to passengers.</P>
      <P>Lin said the Nankang reconstruction project had been halted,
pending an overall review of its safety led by his deputy, Ho
Nuan-hsuan, who will present a report on the results of the review in

    <HEADLINE>NO NT$-RENMINBI EXCHANGE SERVICE ON TAIWAN PROPER AS YET: MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is premature to talk about implementing
new Taiwan dollar-renminbi currency exchange services on Taiwan
proper, as a trial service has just recently begun on the outlying
islands of Kinmen and Matsu, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu said Monday.</P>
      <P>The government is still assessing the currency exchange service
that kicked off early this month on a trial basis on the two
Taiwan-controlled islands and no policy adjustments have been made to
extend the service to Taiwan proper, Wu said, adding that a final
decision must be made jointly by the MAC and National Security
Council based on a comprehensive evaluation.</P>
      <P>"We have so far not received any instructions from the Executive
Yuan about the issue and it is important to closely watch how the
service fares on the two islands before making the next move, " Wu
said, dismissing a media report that the government has linked the
issue to a planned opening to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said earlier the same day at a financial
industry meeting that the currency exchange service may be put in
place in Taiwan as long as the trial on Kinmen and Matsu proves
successful.</P>
      <P>The absence of a currency exchange service between Taiwan and
China has resulted in rampant black market trading and increased
management difficulties for the government, Hsieh said, pointing out,
however, that a service through a government channel will benefit
both the government and the public.</P>
      <P>For instance, he explained, the public will not have problems
with being given fake notes, while the government will be able to
earn some extra revenue.</P>
      <P>But to make the service possible in Taiwan, the two sides need to
first set up a set of currency settlement mechanisms in case of large
scale operations, he added.</P>
      <P>It was the second time the premier had made remarks about the
issue within a week. He first mentioned the issue last Thursday
during a breakfast gathering sponsored by the Chinese National
Association of Industry and Commerce with business leaders, in which
he promised to seriously consider allowing the practice in Taiwan as
soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai told a legislative
committee that the premier did not spell out a timetable or deadline
for the implementation of the service in Taiwan at the meeting.</P>

      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Monday urged Chen Min-hsien, the former vice
chairman of the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) suspected of
involvement in the KRTC profiteering scandal, to turn public
prosecutors' witness and reveal everything he knows about the case.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Huang Chao-shun, who heads a KMT task force trying
to investigate the KRTC scandal, told reporters that the report
issued by a five-member team led by acting Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh
Chu-lan Oct. 21 after a two-week administrative investigation did not
touch the core problems of the scandal and appeared to blame Chen for
most of the scandal.</P>
      <P>Huang alleged that it appears to be a damage control tactic on
the part of President Chen Shui-bian to sacrifice Chen Min-hsien and
she urged the former KRTC vice chairman to turn state witness.</P>
      <P>Chen Min-hsien, chairman of the Southeast Cement Corp., is under
judicial investigation for suspected illegal profiteering from the
Kaohsiung rapid transit railway project and from the hiring of Thai
laborers for the construction project. He resigned his post as KRTC
vice chairman in September after the irregularities were brought to
light by an Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers protesting their
maltreatment by the KTRC employers and the Huapan Administration
Consultant Co., which managed the workers.</P>
      <P>The report issued by the acting Kaohsiung mayor and her team
hints that Chen was the "influential figure" behind all KRTC
operations. It suggested judicial probes into management of the Thai
laborers, open tenders for six civil engineering bids, suspected
price rigging in KRTC's premixed concrete procurement, and MRT train
carriage door specifications, to determine whether whether any
kickbacks or irregularities were involved.</P>
      <P>In advertisements placed in three mass-circulation newspapers
Monday as a rebuttal to the report, Chen denied that he was the
influential figure mentioned in the report and he accused the
Kaohsiung city government of using an "untrue" report to add to the
disturbance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO HOLD HEARING ON PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE ORGANIZATIONAL RULES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will hold a public hearing on
issues regarding the Presidential Office organizational rules, a
caucus spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman made the remarks after the caucus held a meeting on
the gist of Article 15 of the Presidential Office Organizational Law,
which is concerned with the appointment of senior advisers and
national policy advisers to the president.</P>
      <P>In addition to DPP lawmakers, relevant Presidential Office
personnel administrators also attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>During the discussion, Legislator Lin Cho-shui suggested that the
Presidential Office install a special adviser exclusively in charge
of policy coordination between the Presidential Office and the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Under the Constitution, Lin said, the nation's political system
is a semi-presidential one. Therefore, he said, the Presidential
Office needs an adviser to take charge of policy coordination with
the Executive Yuan to ensure consistency and the practicality of
major policy initiatives.</P>
      <P>Lin said the ranking of the proposed policy coordination adviser
can be equivalent to that of a vice minister.</P>
      <P>With a view to soliciting opinions from a broad spectrum of
society, the DPP caucus will also invite political scientists and
legal experts and scholars to a public hearing on the issue.</P>
      <P>The topics to be addressed at the hearing will include whether
incumbent senior advisers and national policy advisers should all be
unpaid positions. According to existing regulations, the roster
includes both paid and unpaid advisers.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lin Tai-hua came up with a proposal last week
calling for turning all presidential adviser posts into unpaid jobs
and said Monday that she will go ahead with her plan to initiate a
proposal to cull the budget for all presidential advisers from fiscal
2006.</P>
      <P>"Despite differing views among my colleagues, I'll continue to
seek endorsements for my proposal," she said.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former U.S. official suggested Monday
that Taiwan should make greater efforts diplomatically to tell the
international community that it wants to play the role of a member of
the global community.</P>
      <P>Randall Schriver, former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state
in charge of East Asia and Pacific affairs, made the suggestion while
giving a speech at a U.S.-Japan-Taiwan Trilogue seminar held by the
Taiwan Thinktank in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Schriver was invited by the think tank to visit Taiwan for the
Oct. 23-25 event.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan should not just set diplomatic goals of increasing
the number of its foreign allies or striving for proper treatment for
its head of state while visiting foreign countries.</P>
      <P>He praised Taiwan's democracy and noted that it is also an ideal
shared by the United States. However, he said he hopes Taiwan will
avoid making its democracy into nothing but a propaganda slogan and
suggested that Taiwan take more concrete action to deepen and
consolidate its young democracy.</P>
      <P>Schriver also spoke of Taiwan's "unique" political situation,
including the inter-party rivalry between the "pan-green camp" headed
by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the "pan-blue
alliance" led by the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GIO ASKS FOREIGN MEDIA TO CORRECT MISLEADING REPORT ABOUT BIRD FLU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Government Information Office (GIO)
said Monday it has asked British news media to correct misleading
reports that a South American parrot infected with the deadly H5N1
strain of avian flu picked up the virus from Taiwanese birds in
British quarantine.</P>
      <P>"The GIO staff stationed in London have issued clarifications and
have asked British news media to publish corrections, " GIO Minister
Pasuya Yao said, adding that the GIO will raise the level of its
protest if relevant British news media fail to make the demanded
corrections.</P>
      <P>The British news media quoted British veterinary officials as
claiming Sunday that the parrot imported from Suriname had tested
positive for H5N1. But with no cases of H5N1 yet discovered in South
America, British veterinary experts were quoted as saying they
suspected that the parrot was infected when it was exposed to birds
from Taiwan while being kept in mandatory quarantine.</P>
      <P>Yao said that the British officials were "irresponsible" to make
such hypothesis or speculation.</P>
      <P>"Our staff in London will push British animal health officials to
further check the origins of the infected parrot," Yao said.</P>
      <P>Quoting Council of Agriculture (COA) officials, Yao said the
birds from Taiwan were held in the same room, but not in the same
cage, as the Suriname parrot at British customs.</P>
      <P>H5N1 is the most virulent strain of bird flu and has killed more
than 60 people in Asia since 2003. Experts are closely watching the
disease for fear that it could mutate into a form easily transmitted
among humans and cause a pandemic that could kill millions.</P>
      <P>Stressing that quarantine and public health agencies are on full
alert against the disease, Yao said the GIO has directed its overseas
staff to monitor international media reports about the bird flu
outbreaks in countries around the world as well as information about
foreign governments' preventive and precautionary measures and
relevant international cooperative programs.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, the Council of Agriculture (COA) discounted the
British health officials' speculation that a batch of birds from
Taiwan might have passed avian flu to the parrot shipped to Britain
when they were quarantined in British customs.</P>
      <P>Watson Sung, director of the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine, said the death of the Suriname
parrot has nothing to do with the Taiwanese birds because they were
not held in the same cage at the British customs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yeh Ying, the bureau's deputy director, said it is
very dangerous and irresponsible for the British officials to make a
statement implicating another country as a possible source of avian
flu without solid evidence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ASKS BRITAIN TO CLARIFY AVIAN FLU ALLEGATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's representative office in Britain
asked the British Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(DEFRA) Monday to explain why birds from different countries were not
quarantined separately.</P>
      <P>According to world animal quarantine regulations, birds from
different countries should be quarantined at different places.</P>
      <P>"We want to know why the batch of birds imported to Britain from
Taiwan Sept. 27 were quarantined at the same place as a batch of
parrots from Suriname Sept. 16," Lin Yi-hsiung, the Republic of China
representative to Britain, said.</P>
      <P>Lin said the representative office posed the question in a letter
to the DEFRA.</P>
      <P>The representative office took the move after British veterinary
officials said a parrot imported from Suriname had tested positive
for H5N1. But with no cases of H5N1 yet discovered in South America,
British veterinary experts said they suspected that the parrot was
infected when it was exposed to birds from Taiwan while being kept in
mandatory quarantine.</P>
      <P>According to ROC government export records, the birds exported to
Britain in late September numbered 185. But DEFRA officials put the
number at 216.</P>
      <P>"We hope to know the exact number and how many Taiwan birds have
died in British quarantine, " Lin said. "We ask the DEFRA to furnish
us with an official investigation report."</P>
      <P>Lin said the representative office told the DEFRA that a batch of
H5N1-infected birds smuggled from China and caught at a Taiwan port
have all died and that Taiwan's avian flu-free status remains
unchanged.</P>
      <P>In its letter the DEFRA, the ROC representative office said DEFRA
chief veterinarian Debby Reynolds' claim that Taiwan birds might
bring the avian flu virus to Britain has hurt Taiwan's international
image and dealt a severe blow to its unrelenting efforts upgrade its
public health and tourism. The representative office pushed the DEFRA
to come up with a detailed report as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Avian flu is a highly infectious virus among both wild and
domestic birds. H5N1 is the most virulent strain of bird flu and has
killed more than 60 people in Asia since 2003. Experts are closely
watching the disease for fear that it could mutate into a form easily
transmitted among humans and cause a pandemic that could kill
millions. Taiwan's quarantine and public health agencies have been on
full alert against the disease.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OIE AFFIRMS TAIWAN'S MOVE TO NOTIFY ORGANIZATION OF H5N1 CASES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct.  24 (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.c.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The World Organization for Animal Health
(OIE) on Monday affirmed Taiwan's move to notify the organization
that several birds smuggled into the country from China were found to
have been infected with the H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus.</P>
      <P>The OIE made the affirmation at a time when Taiwan's image has
been hit hard by recent international media reports that a parrot
exported last week from Suriname to Britain contracted avian flu from
the birds that the European country imported from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>An OIE spokesman said that as OIE members have no obligation to
notify the organization of the number of cases of a particular
disease found in animals under quarantine, it was not necessary for
Taiwan to inform the OIE of the discovery of the H5N1 infected birds.</P>
      <P>However, the spokesman said that Taiwan's decision to notify the
organization was certainly in the interests of upgrading transparency
in the fight against epidemic diseases.</P>
      <P>According to the OIE regulations, any avian flu cases discovered
in animals under quarantine are not categorized as "official cases."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Council of Agriculture notified the OIE last Friday of
the discovery Oct. 19 of avian flu in several birds smuggled in from
China, through Chang Tien-Jye, Taiwan's representative to the
organization. Chang is the dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine
at National Chung Hsing University.</P>
      <P>The British government announced recently that a parrot imported
from Suriname died of avian flu during quarantine, saying that the
parrot's death could possibly be related to the birds imported from
Taiwan which were also put in quarantine in the same place.</P>
      <P>The announcement was reported by the international media, leading
many in the international community to mistakenly believe that Taiwan
is a bird flu-affected area.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Government Information Office (GIO) requested Sunday
that the media organizations that made the inaccurate reports should
issue notices of correction as soon as possible. GIO Director-General
Yao Wen-chih also warned that his office will issue a stronger
protest against any media organizations that refuse to do so.</P>
      <P>Neither the OIE nor the World Trade Organization's records have
shown any official cases of avian flu in birds or humans in Taiwan to
date.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN URGES U.S., JAPAN TO CONSIDER SIGNING FTAS WITH TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Tuesday urged
the United States and Japan to consider signing free trade agreements
with Taiwan, saying that only by having such agreements in place can
the island's economy stand without heavily depending on China and can
security and peace in the Asia-Pacific region be maintained.</P>
      <P>The president made the appeal while receiving at the Presidential
Office representatives from the United States and Japan who are in
Taiwan to take part in the symposium on "U.S.-Taiwan-Japan Strategic
Dialogue" being held at the Westin Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that he feels great regret that Taiwan's head of
state has been excluded from participating in the non-political
economic summit of the Asian-Pacific Economic and Cooperation (APEC)
forum in Busan, South Korea Nov. 18-19 as "APEC is an important
cooperation mechanism in the region."</P>
      <P>According to Chen, even though Taiwan has sent its
representatives to take part in the APEC informal summit meeting,
Beijing can still veto their participation.</P>
      <P>"This is unbelievable since APEC belongs to all of its members
rather than China," he added.</P>
      <P>Talking about U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick's
remarks made in a speech he delivered last month at a U.S. think tank
that China should serve as an "interested party" in the international
mechanism, the president said that "Taiwan affirms and supports what
Zoellick said about the role China should play in the international
mechanism."</P>
      <P>However, Chen added that China's rise must be peaceful and
accompanied by democratic development, saying that only then can
China serve as an "interested party" in the international community.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that he doesn't want to see Taiwan become the only
country not to have an FTA with the United States, the president
called for the United States and Japan to consider signing such
agreements with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Touching on issues related to cooperation among the three
countries, Chen expressed his gratitude for what the United States
and Japan did during their Security Consultation Committee meeting
held in Washington, D.C. in February of this year to include "
issues concerning the Taiwan Strait as one of their common strategic
goals.</P>
      <P>Concluding the meeting, the U.S. and Japan officials had listed
"encouraging the peaceful resolution of issues concerning the Taiwan
Strait through dialogue" in their join statement as part of their
common strategic objectives in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan appreciates and supports what the United States and Japan
did and will fully cooperate with them, " he further said, adding
that "it is therefore important for Taiwan to contemplate ways of how
to reinforce its cooperation with the United States and Japan in
order to establish a normal mechanism of collective security dialogue
among the three nations."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said that the Anti-Secession Law passed by China in
March of this year as well as the European Union's consideration of
lifting its ban on arms exports to China go against the common
strategic goals of the U.S.-Japan Security Consultation
Commitee meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RANKING FSC OFFICIAL AND 4 OTHERS CHARGED IN INSIDER TRADING CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecution authorities charged former
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) director Lee Chin-cheng and
four others Tuesday with leaking official information and insider
trading offenses in what the chief prosecutor claimed to be "the
foulest" case that he has ever handled.</P>
      <P>Lee, former director of the FSC's Examination Bureau, was charged
with leaking information to his stock-trader friend Lin Ming-ta and
others, enabling them to make illicit profits. Prosecutors have
demanded an eight-year prison sentence for Lee in the
much-talked-about "Vultures case."</P>
      <P>The prosecution also asked the court to sentence Lin, Taiwan
Stock Exchange official Chang Hsi-kuan, stock trader Chen Chun-chi
and Chen Yung-cheng, chairman of a broker house, to at least one year
in jail on charges of violating the stock trading law, illegal use of
computers, leaking information, profiteering, and perjury.</P>
      <P>The anti-corruption center, which is working with the prosecution
in probing the case, has questioned more than 160 people between June
and October of this year.</P>
      <P>Chief prosecutor Chen Jui-jen said this is the "foulest" case
that he has ever witnessed in terms of the "unprecedented complexity
of the suspected crime syndicate" and the members' "delicate ways of
committing the crime."</P>
      <P>He and other prosecutors said it has been extremely difficult to
probe the case as the official in charge of maintaining stock trading
order was involved and the case has been depicted by the media as
intra-bureaucracy fighting between financial inspection and judicial
investigation authorities.</P>
      <P>The chief suspect in the scandal, Lee Chin-cheng, has been
transferred from his director's post to the position of counselor at
the FSC since investigations began into his role in the scandal,
indicating his "good connections" with the top leadership of the FSC.</P>
      <P>The most damning evidence against Lee is that he met with stock
traders Lin Ming-ta and Chen Chun-chi 36 times at various restaurants
or clubs between Jan. 7 and June 7 this year, 27 of which took place
after March 10, when investigators were ready to investigate
companies and individuals suspected of involvement in insider
trading.</P>
      <P>It was during these meetings, according to the prosecution, that
Lee leaked critical financial inspection and prosecution
investigation information to Lin Ming-ta, reminding him that he had
been targeted by investigators.</P>
      <P>Lee also allegedly leaked the sensitive information to Kao
Nien-yi, a reporter at the United Daily News, on March 15. Kao's
article the next day affected the stock price of Power Quotient
International (PQI) , a well-known computer flash memory card maker,
helping Lin and his cohorts to make NT$13 million in illicit profits.</P>
      <P>In its indictment, the prosecution said Lee was supposed to be
responsible for creating a clean and fair environment for the
nation's securities, banking and insurance industry, but he used his
position to help his own friends make illicit profits and to alert
them of pending investigations.</P>
      <P>Such behavior "has immensely damaged the government's image, "
the prosecutors said in the indictment.</P>
      <P>FSC spokesman Lin Chung-cheng said, according to law, the FSC
cannot dismiss Lee unless he is being detained by police, is wanted
for a suspected crime, or has been sentenced to a prison term. "If we
were to dismiss him now, we would be violating the law, " the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Although public functionaries are protected by Article Three of
the law on disciplining, which the spokesman cited, Article Four of
the same law says that if a suspect is involved in "a major criminal
case," his superior can suspend the suspect from his official duties.</P>
      <P>Article 19 of the law also stipulates that leading suspects whose
offenses are to be probed by the Control Yuan or the Public
Functionaries Disciplinary Committee should be suspended from their
current jobs.</P>
      <P>Lee Chin-cheng, as a FSC counselor, has not been making any major
decisions concerning financial supervision.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) cheered
the prosecution and the anti-corruption center for laying the
charges, and urged them to charge other suspects as the involvement
of more companies in the Stock Vultures case has come to light.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Cabinet-level Department of Health
(DOH) and Vietnam's Commission for Population, Family and Children
jointly held a celebration Tuesday in Taipei to mark the 10th
anniversary of cooperation between the two countries in a family
planning program in Vietnam.</P>
      <P>The DOH and the Vietnamese state-run commission signed a
memorandum in December 1995 on cooperation on issues concerning
family planning and children's welfare.</P>
      <P>Since then, Taiwan has invited representatives of Vietnamese
government agencies and civil organizations to visit the island every
year as part of its efforts to assist the developing country in
learning more about effective population control policies.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Deputy DOH Minister Wang Hsiu-hung said
that through long-term efforts, Vietnam has made remarkable
achievements in the promotion of family planning. He cited statistics
showing that Vietnam's birth rate dropped from 30.04 births per 1,000
population in 1993 to 19.90 in 1999, while the country's population
growth declined from 2.1 percent to 1.43 percent during the same
period.</P>
      <P>In 1999, the United Nations conferred the Population Award on the
Vietnamese commission in recognition of its sustained efforts in the
areas of population and development, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the number of Vietnamese spouses in Taiwan has been
increasing in recent years, Wang said that future Taiwan-Vietnam
cooperation will include making efforts to assist the Vietnamese
living on the island to adapt to local life.</P>
      <P>From this year, the DOH will also organize groups of experts and
scholars in family planning and women's and children's health care to
pay visits to Vietnam, transferring their knowledge and experience to
relevant Vietnamese units through the holding of seminars, Wang
added.</P>
      <P>During the celebration, the Vietnamese national commission
awarded 15 Taiwanese personnel and government agencies for their
contributions to Vietnam's population control and child health care
efforts. They included former DOH Minister Chang Po-ya and former DOH
official Tsai Jung-fu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO PURCHASED KIDD-CLASS DESTROYERS TO ARRIVE IN TAIWAN IN DECEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> Taipei, Oct. 25 (CMA) Two of the four Kidd-class destroyers
Taiwan has purchased from the United States are expected to arrive in
the country in December and to be commissioned at Suao, Ilan in
northeastern Taiwan, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) spokesman
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In view of a resolution passed by the Legislative Yuan that the
names of the new destroyers be related to Taiwan, the warships will
be renamed "Keelung," "Suao," "Tsoyin" and "Makung," the spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan purchased the four destroyers at a cost of NT$24 billion
in June 2003. Taiwan naval officers and seed instructors, as well as
repair and maintenance technicians have received training in the
United States to prepare for the vessels' delivery.</P>
      <P>Two of the destroyers are expected to be handed over to the ROC
Navy on the east coast of the United States at the end of this month.
The other two are expected to be handed over in March 2007.</P>
      <P>The Navy said it hopes that the four destroyers will form the
"outer peripheral" of the fleet, while its Perry-class, Knox-class
and Lafayette-class frigates will play an "inner circle role."</P>
      <P>The Kidd-class destroyers will be used to target enemy planes
that have fired missiles, leaving other vessels to deal with the
incoming missiles.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan authorities submitted a shopping list in 2001 that
included top-of-the-line U.S. Arleigh Burke-class destroyers equipped
with the Aegis radar system. However, the Bush administration only
approved the sale of the much older Kidd-class destroyers.</P>
      <P>The purchase led to a fierce debate in Taiwan. Opponents of the
purchase included members of the legislature's powerful defense
committee, which made several attempts to block the sale. Critics
cited the ships' age -- they were built in the late 1970s -- and
their high cost, and suggested that Taiwan should push the U.S. to
release the Aegis system sooner.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In a bid to prevent the spread of avian flu
into Taiwan, the Department of Health (DOH) announced Tuesday that
travellers from China will be asked to monitor their health
conditions for 10 days from the time of their arrival in the country.</P>
      <P>The new policy will begin at midnight Tuesday and will affect
travellers entering Taiwan from China via Hong Kong, Macau, Kinmen or
Matsu, DOH officials said.</P>
      <P>Under the policy, travellers displaying flu-like symptoms, such
as fever, cough or soar throat, will be asked to fill in a
questionnaire and notify airport quarantine staff of their condition.
Also, all tourists from China will be requested to check their body
temperatures twice a day during a 10-day period. If their temperature
exceeds 38 degrees Celsius, they will be required to wear a surgical
mask and report to local health authorities, who will assist them in
seeking medical treatment.</P>
      <P>A similar measure was adopted Oct. 10 for travellers from
Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Cambodia. China was added to the
list after birds smuggled from the country into Taiwan tested
positive for the H5N1 strain of the avian flu virus. The H5N1 strain
poses the greatest threat of mutating into a form that could trigger
a human pandemic.</P>
      <P>According to DOH Minister Hou Sheng-mou, the H5N1-infected birds
may have come from Fuzhou, Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>Although China has not reported any cases of H5N1 infection in
humans, Hou said, it is necessary for Taiwan to stay alert in light

the government should work out measures to compensate and take care
of leprosy patients who might have been wrongly quarantined by the
previous Kuomintang government.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after a Tokyo District Court judge ruled in

rule of Taiwan from 1895 to 1945. The judge said the Taiwan
complainants are eligible for compensation from the Japanese
authorities</P>
      <P>However, according to a CNA report from Tokyo, another judge
ruled against 117 Korean plaintiffs making similar claims, so the
Japanese government might appeal the ruling on the Taiwanese.</P>

president was delighted to learn of the favorable ruling for the

provinces, has been recognized by China's authorities and is expected
to enjoy enhanced protection of its intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>Lin Chien-hsiung, president of Yungho Soy Milk's international

"well-known trademark" status by the Trademark Bureau under the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce is a recognition of his
company's reputation and efforts in expanding operations in China in

      <P>He said that because counterfeiting is still a serious problem in

filing lawsuits in different cities and provinces.</P>
      <P>However, he added, after being recognized as a well-known

    <HEADLINE>NEW TAIWAN DOLLAR TO CONTINUE SLIDING AGAINST GREENBACK: EXPERTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The new Taiwan dollar is likely to continue
depreciating in the coming months due to eroding investor confidence,
as evidenced by capital flight and a lackluster domestic stock
market, according to foreign currency dealers.</P>
      <P>They said that the local currency could dip to 34 against the
U. S. dollar by the end of this year, when the U. S. Federal Reserve
is expected to raise interest rates again, leading to fresh outflows
of capital from Asian countries, including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This situation has put stronger pressure on Asian currencies to
depreciate, they said, noting that the Japanese yen has already
dropped to 116 against the greenback.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's sluggish stock market is another factor driving capital
out of the country in quest of profits, they said, pointing out that
the domestic insurance industry has also sent out large amounts of
remittance for investment overseas.</P>
      <P>Cheng Cheng-mount, a leading economist at Citibank Taiwan,
brushed aside negative sentiments and said that investors don't have
to worry about the stock market or the foreign currency exchange as
fourth-quarter economic figures will show marked improvements, noting
that the final quarter of the year is traditionally a peak season.</P>
      <P>According to the latest tallies made public Monday by the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , foreign orders worth a record
high of US$23.78 billion were placed with Taiwan companies in
September, up by 21.96 percent year on year. Export orders totaled
US$182.5 billion for the January-September period, marking an annual
increase of 17.57 percent.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials attributed the growth to a weakened new Taiwan
dollar and stronger demand for information industry products.</P>
      <P>In the face of a sliding new Taiwan dollar, Central Bank of China
(CBC) Governor Perng Fai-nan told the business community last week
that the value of the local currency should be decided by the market.</P>
      <P>The new Taiwan dollar closed at 33.77 against the U. S. unit
Monday on the Taipei foreign currency exchange market, a drop of
NT$0.137 from last Friday's finish. It regained NT$0.029 Tuesday to
end at 33.741.</P>
      <P>Although the new Taiwan dollar is expected to continue
depreciating for a while, CBC officials claimed that the local
currency is relatively stable compared to other major Asian
currencies.</P>
      <P>For instance, CBC officials said, the local unit was 0.08 percent
higher in value against the U. S. dollar Monday compared with the
same day the previous year, while the South Korean won and the
Japanese yen were up 7.81 by percent and by 7.01 percent,
respectively, in value against the greenback.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the results of a recent survey published by the Taiwan
Institute of Economic Research show that 57.7 percent of Taiwan
companies think that business conditions in the coming six months
will remain about the same, while 31.3 percent believe that they will
improve, and only 11 percent have a pessimistic outlook.</P>
      <P>Echoing the CBC view, the institute said that the new Taiwan
dollar will remain stable in value in the short term despite trends
showing that the U. S. dollar will get stronger thanks to higher U.
S. interest rates and despite the fact that Taiwan's trade surplus
for the first nine months was only US$1.94 billion, down by 69.5
percent year on year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAX CUT FOR RICE WINE, LIQUOR UNDECIDED:  PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that it
has not been decided if the Cabinet will adjust downwards its tax on
rice wine and other liquor.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was responding to news reports that the Cabinet is mulling
tax cuts to help stem the rampant bootleg rice wine production.</P>
      <P>The premier said the government will have to consider if it is
feasible to cut taxes for local as well as for imported products
under the present World Trade Organization mechanism.</P>
      <P>He said that because rice wine currently sells for what the
public considers a hefty price, bootleg rice wine making is rampant,
while the problem of private rice wine distilleries evading taxes is
also serious.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Finance officials said they are consulting with the
Board of Foreign Trade to ascertain whether or not an adjustment of
the taxes will require negotiations under the WTO framework.</P>
      <P>The officials also pointed out that even if the tax cut decision
is made, it will still need approval from the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>In line with the terms for entry to the World Trade Organization
in 2002, Taiwan raised the tax on rice wine because it is listed as a
distillery product and therefore subject to a high tax bracket. This
has driven the price of Taiwanese rice wine from NT$21 per bottle to
NT$130.</P>
      <P>Winter is traditionally high season for rice wine because it is a
major ingredient in many winter stews. Some bootleggers have been
selling their rice wine at "extraordinarily low" prices, according to
reports.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO ADVOCATE COMMUNITY BUILDING AT APEC CONFERENCE: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 25  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will emphasize the concept of
community building at the annual conference of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Busan, South Korea next month, a
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chung, director of the MOFA's Department for International
Affairs, said in a news briefings that the theme of the conference
set by the host this year is "Toward One Community."</P>
      <P>In order to flesh out the concept of community, Chen said, Taiwan
will raise the idea of community building, calling for the
involvement of community leaders, not only officials and experts, in
APEC activities.</P>
      <P>Chen said the conference will begin with a meeting of senior
officials from Nov. 12-13.</P>
      <P>During this meeting, the officials will discuss ways to support
the conclusions of the Doha Round of talks under the World Trade
Organization, and take stock of the progress they have made toward
the goals spelled out in the Doha Round.</P>
      <P>After this meeting, there will be a ministerial-level meeting
from Nov. 15-16, and finally an informal summit of economic leaders
from Nov. 18-19.</P>
      <P>Trade liberalization, counter terrorism and health security are
dominant topics on the agenda of the summit, not least the avian flu
poised to break out around the world with Asia as its epicenter, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>The official said the senior official meeting is expected to work
out conclusions about precautionary measures against avian flu, which
will be submitted to the ministerial meeting and then the informal
leadership summit for approval.</P>
      <P>As to Taiwan's representative at the summit, the official said
MOFA is still working to have Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
attend, even though the host country has already said this would be
inappropriate.</P>
      <P>Taiwan used to be represented at the summit by a minister
responsible for economy before 2000 because of Beijing's refusal to
allow the country's head of state to attend in person.</P>
      <P>President Chen named Academica Sinica head Lee Yuan-tse as his
envoy to the summit in the last three years, and named Wang this year
, which drew opposition from Beijing and put Seoul on the spot.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POULTRY FARMS TO GET SUBSIDIES FOR NETS AGAINST MIGRATORY BIRDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taoyuan,  Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will earmark NT$1 billion
(US$29.67 million) to subsidize local poultry farms for nets around
their facilities to prevent the incursion of migratory birds --
potential carriers of avian flu -- Premier Frank Hsieh announced
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Making the announcement during an inspection of a chicken farm in
Yangmei, in northern Taoyuan County, Hsieh said Taiwan is one of the
few countries that has so far remained free of bird flu infection and
must take precautionary measures to block the spread of the disease
into the country.</P>
      <P>To this end, the government will encourage poultry farms to set
up protective nets around their facilities, in addition to continuing
to monitor migratory birds, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also urged poultry farmers to improve their sanitation,
pointing out that all birds in a farm will be slaughtered if even one
is infected with the disease, which will mean great losses for the
farmer and the country.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to boost the local poultry sector, which has seen
chicken prices drop almost 30 percent amid the bird flu scare, the
premier said the government is trying to prevent the disease using
the highest standards, and he urged the public not to be afraid of
eating chicken.</P>
      <P>He noted that many countries, including Japan, are importing
chicken from Taiwan because they want to avoid the bird flu epidemic
areas.</P>
      <P>Some foreign media that previously mistakenly pointed the finger
at Taiwan as an epidemic area of bird flu have corrected their
errors, he pointed out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO FORM ANTI-CORRUPTION COMMISSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
decided in a Central Standing Committee meeting Tuesday to form what
it calls an anti-corruption commission.</P>
      <P>The anti-graft commission will monitor DPP members serving in
major party or public office posts, including the president, the vice
president, mayors of special municipalities and city and county
chiefs and councilmen, as well as presidential appointees and those
who represent the government in state-owned enterprises.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian recently demanded the formation of such
a commission in view of the snowballing mass rapid transit
profiteering construction scandal in Kaohsiung, hoping to highlight
his determination to pursue reforms.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang said the commission will be
comprised of five to seven members nominated by party chairman. The
members -- either professionals who have legal practice experience or
those who are highly respected for their clean image -- will be
confirmed by DPP Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang said that if party or public
office holders are suspected of being involved in graft, corruption,
organized crime or money laundering, the commission will handle their
cases and will have the authority to investigate them without
consulting the Central Standing Committee first.</P>
      <P>The commission can report to the DPP Central Standing Committee
after completing its investigation and can suggest the dispensation
of a warning, suspension of rights or removal of party membership for
violations.</P>
      <P>As for an investigation team set up within the party to look into
whether Chen Tze-nan, a former deputy secretary-general of the
president, is involved in Kaohsiung MRT scandal, Su said the party
has put no pressure on the team and that the investigation report
will be sent to the Central Standing Committee, although the contents
will not be published during the course of the investigation process.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 70 percent of the residents of
Kaohsiung who responded to a recent survey still have confidence in
the city's mass rapid transit railway project, despite an ongoing
judicial investigation into alleged profiteering involving the
project, according to the survey results released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by Taiwan Real Survey Co. Oct. 19-21 at
the request of the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission
under the Kaohsiung city government. The information was obtained
from 1,071 respondents with a margin of error of 3 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that 86.7 percent of the respondents want
the MRT construction to continue, with 69.6 percent saying they will
use the system once it is completed.</P>
      <P>Almost 50 percent of the respondents believe the profiteering
scandal under investigation will affect the safety of the MRT system,
but 50.6 percent say they are confident that a thorough examination
of the structural safety of the system by a task force will be
helpful in enhancing the safety of the network.</P>
      <P>The profiteering scandal exposed by an Aug. 21 riot by Thai
laborers to protest their maltreatment by KRTC and Huapan
Administration Consultant Co. has led to the resignations of Council
of Labor Affairs Chairwoman Chen Chu, acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen
Chi-mai, his father Chen Che-nan, who is a national policy adviser to
President Chen Shui-bian, and Chen Min-hsien, an adviser to the
president.</P>
      <P>Both the Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Justice and
the Public Prosecutors's Office in Kaohsiung are pursuing the case,
probing possible irregularities, including kickbacks, money

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE PASSES NCC BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a surprising turn of events, the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party representatives ceased their physical
assaults in the Legislative Yuan Tuesday and allowed the passage of
the organic bill of the National Communications Commission (NCC)
Tuesday, agreeing that its 13 members will have to go through two
ballots by a review committee formed in accordance with proportional
representation.</P>
      <P>This means the opposition "pan-blue alliance" prevailed, although
the DPP legislative caucus said it would consider requesting a
constitutional interpretation of the legitimacy of the NCC law.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People
First Party (PFP), which form the "pan-blue alliance, " declared the
bill's passage a "victory of the media, for freedom of speech and for
the people."</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" and the "pan-green" camp, which include
the DPP and Taiwan Solidarity Union, had battled fiercely over the
method of selecting NCC members. Legislators of the two sides had
engaged in two days of scuffles in the legislature, leading to
bloodshed, international ridicule and cries of "shame."</P>
      <P>Under the NCC law, 15 members will be nominated by the
legislature according to the share of seats held by each political
party, and the Executive Yuan will recommend three. The commission's
13 members will be selected from among the 18 nominees by the review
committee through open votes.</P>
      <P>Successful candidates will be named by the premier, who will send
the namelist to the legislature for approval before officially
appointing them.</P>
      <P>As to the composition of the review committee, its 11 members,
all of whom will be professional experts and scholars, will be
recommended by political parties again based on proportional
representation.</P>
      <P>A commission member must win 60 percent or more of the review
committee ballots and if fewer than 13 are selected in this way, the
shortfall should be made up by those who win over half of the 11
votes in the review committee.</P>
      <P>NCC members must not participate in political party activities,
work for any other government agency or state-run enterprises, or act
as their advisers. They are also banned from taking full-time or
part-time jobs at any communications business or lobby group.</P>
      <P>Within three years of leaving the NCC, former members cannot
serve as a board member or supervisor, manager, or adviser of a
profit-making organization whose main business is directly related to
the members' area of duties in the five years before he left the NCC.</P>
      <P>In these three years, a former NCC member must not contact the
institutions in which he or she served in the previous five years
either for personal gain or for the benefit of others.</P>
      <P>The NCC will make resolutions with a simple majority vote. A
member can present a consenting or dissenting view on each
resolution. These views, as well as the resolutions, must be
published.</P>
      <P>As the mandate of the NCC covers a wide range of media and
telecommunications businesses that are at present governed by the
Government Information Office (GIO) and the Ministry of Transport and
Communications (MOTC) , the two will hand over all related duties to
the NCC.</P>
      <P>The NCC's mandate includes making, amending, abolishing and
implementing telecommunications policies and regulations; supervising
the operations of the communication businesses, including approval of
operating licenses and checking equipment; mediating in major
disputes between rival businesses and protecting consumer interests;
promoting international cooperation; meting out punishments; and
cracking down on lawbreakers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet claimed Tuesday that the
National Communications Commission (NCC) law that passed the
legislature earlier in the day will be "extremely difficult to
implement" and that it will therefore seek "remedial measures."</P>
      <P>Cho Jung-tai, spokesman for the Executive Yuan, claimed that the

military influences from the media, while the method of selecting NCC
members is "regrettable."</P>
      <P>He did not say whether the government will seek a Council of
Grand Justices constitutional interpretation of the legitimacy of the
law but the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative
caucus said it will consider doing so.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office (GIO) Director-General Pasuya Yao
said the law contains provisions that could overthrow GIO decisions
about radio frequencies and TV channels, provisions that are
"unacceptable" to the GIO.</P>
      <P>Yao also expressed his dissatisfaction over Article Four of the
NCC law, which allows political parties to nominate NCC members as
well as members for the review committee that would decide which
nominees can sit as NCC members.</P>
      <P>Cho explained that in voting for the members, the review
committee needs just a simple majority vote in the second round,
indicating that the opposition "pan-blue alliance" can dominate the
nomination process.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SEEKS TO RENAME RETROCESSION DAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
it is necessary for the people in Taiwan to rethink and review the
use of the word "retrocession" to refer to the handover of Taiwan
from the Japanese colonial rulers to the Kuomintang-led Republic of
China government in 1945.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a reception held in the Taiwan
provincial government headquarters in central Nantou County to mark
the 60th anniversary of the handover, which is celebrated as
Retrocession Day.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, to some people in Taiwan, "retrocession" means
the beginning of pain and suffering because what followed soon after
that were the 228 Incident and the declaration of martial law.</P>
      <P>Calling "retrocession" a word that carries specific political
implications, Chen said it will be unhelpful to Taiwan's unity and
will be against the mainstream value of "Taiwan first" if such a term
remains highlighted.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the "true meaning" of Taiwan's retrocession
does not lie in the complicated historical relations between Taiwan
and China but in the right of the people in Taiwan to be their own
masters.</P>
      <P>He noted that the people of Taiwan, who supposedly are the most
important part of the nation, were repeatedly excluded and dominated
by outsiders, making them unable to determine their own destiny.</P>
      <P>While the wish of the Taiwan people to determine their own
destiny gave momentum in motivating Taiwan's development during the
period of Japanese colonial rule, their aspirations for democracy,
freedom and self-determination were not achieved after the
retrocession, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Instead, the foundation of democracy was damaged, and democratic
activists were suppressed and persecuted, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the people of Taiwan learn from history and
interpret the meaning of Retrocession Day anew, using the historical
perspective of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>As there are some people in Taiwan who disagree with the term
"retrocession" and cannot accept it emotionally, Taiwan society needs
to review the use of the term to define the historical status of the
occasion in an objective manner, he said.</P>
      <P>He said history interpreted by the past authoritarian rulers does
not represent truth and that the people should redefine and reassess
historial events in order to mend the rift between the victims and
their persecutors.</P>
      <P>He said the history of Taiwan belongs to its people and must not
be monopolized or interpreted in a one-sided manner by a minority of
rulers.</P>
      <P>However, he admitted that it will be difficult to find a uniform
historical perspective of all 23 million of Taiwan or to shrug off
the historical burden left by the past authoritarian rulers.</P>
      <P>The president expressed his disapproval of those people who
equate Taiwan's retrocession with the restoration of Hong Kong to
China, saying these people are celebrating the occasion using the
"greater China mentality" and are prepared to give Taiwan away to
China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BILL ON COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION SETS STAGE FOR PROTRACTED CONFLICT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
passed a bill on the organization of the national communications
commission (NCC) Tuesday, but the controversy surrounding it seemed
to be far from over, with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(TSU) and its political ally the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
refusing to accept it.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chao Yung-ching, the DPP legislative caucus whip, said
the difference between his party and the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
and the People First Party (PFP) lies in the appointment of
the members of the proposed commission.</P>
      <P>Under the enacted bill, the 13 members of the commission will be
chosen by a panel from 18 candidates--with 15 nominated by political
parties in proportion to the number of seats they hold in the
legislature, and three by the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The panel in charge of picking the commission members will
consist of 11 scholars and experts, also appointed by political
parties according to the proportional representation model.</P>
      <P>The panel must make its choice through a three-fifths vote, but
candidates who receive only a simple majority vote from the panel may
also serve on the NCC if the number of candidates who won
three-fifths of the votes falls short of 13.</P>
      <P>Chao said his party insisted on having at least seven commission
members selected by a three-fifths vote, but this was rejected by the
KMT and PFP, which command a slim majority between them in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Kao Chih-peng branded the bill unconstitutional
claiming that it trespasses on the authority of the Executive branch
and opens the door for political party leverage on the NCC by giving
the legislature the power to name the members.</P>
      <P>Kao said the DPP legislative caucus might appeal to the Council
of Grand Justices for an annulment of the bill.</P>
      <P>The TSU echoed the DPP's position by demanding that the Executive
Yuan return the bill to the legislature for reconsideration,
threatening a boycott of the Executive Yuan's budget if it does not.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the bill's sponsor, the KMT and PFP, touted the
enactment as a milestone in the country's history, claiming that it
offers the best guarantee of freedom of the press.</P>
      <P>Jubilant lawmakers of the two parties congratulated the country's
journalists in a news conference after the enactment of the bill,
claiming that they are now free from meddling by the government,
because the government, after being stripped of its authority to
grant licenses to broadcast stations and newspapers, is no longer
capable of controlling the media.</P>
      <P>However, a private self-appointed media-reform group did not
share the opposition's joy, claiming that the method of NCC
appointment has obviously given politics a role to play.</P>
      <P>The group nonetheless praised the political parties for
consulting non-partisan groups during the process of the enactment in
an attempt to break a political impasse over the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENT TO CUT BENEFITS FOR RETIRED PRESIDENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) introduced legislation Tuesday aimed at drastically reducing
the pensions and benefits enjoyed by retired presidents and vice
presidents under the existing law.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed by Legislator Tsai Cheng-yuan was endorsed
by scores of his colleagues from the legislative caucuses of both the
KMT and its ally, the People First Party.</P>
      <P>The law has been a target of criticism as it provides for the use
of taxpayers' money to pay for lifetime preferential treatment for
former presidents and vice presidents.</P>
      <P>For example, the government's annual budget for former President
Lee Teng-hui, so-called "spiritual leader" of the minor opposition
Taiwan Solidarity Union, amounts to NT$68.5 million (US$2.03
million) , twice that of former U.S. President Bill Clinton. The
pension has an annual 3 percent growth adjusted for inflation.</P>
      <P>In addition, retired presidents and vice presidents are entitled
to government-provided housing, offices and unspecified numbers of
cars, chauffeurs, security guards and office personnel. Lee has six
cars, six chauffeurs, eight domestic servants and 60 security
personnel.</P>
      <P>The amendment would reduce the preferential treatment for retired
presidents from lifetime to 10 years, while abolishing the pensions
benefits for retired vice presidents completely. It would cut the
housing benefit for former presidents and provide him with only one
car and one chauffeur, plus two secretaries and two or three security
guards.</P>
      <P>The amendment would also stipulate that the monthly pension for a
retired president should not exceed the monthly salary for the
premier.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(by Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Randall Schriver, former U.S. deputy
assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said
Wednesday that he is happy to hear that a high-ranking Chinese
official will visit Taiwan later this year and will have the chance
to feel the air of freedom on the island.</P>
      <P>Schriver made the remarks at a breakfast meeting held by the
Taiwan Thinktank. Schriver was one the speakers at the Oct. 23-25
U.S.-Japan-Taiwan Trilogue symposium held by the think tank.</P>
      <P>He was referring to the expected visit by Chen Yunlin, director
of the Taiwan Affairs Office under the State Council, at the
invitation of Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang to take part in a
cross-Taiwan Strait economic forum scheduled to be held in December.</P>
      <P>Schriver said that he appreciates Chen's upcoming visit as it
will allow the ranking official to feel the freedom and democracy in
Taiwan first-hand.</P>
      <P>However, Schriver also expressed concerns that Chen's visit could
create division within Taiwan and that the Chinese official will only
be exposed to the narrow views of a few instead of the overall views
of the Taiwan public.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, John Tkacik Jr., a research fellow in China policy
with the Heritage Foundation and one of the participants in the just
concluded symposium, said that if Chen visits Taiwan, Taiwan should
also request reciprocal treatment and ask that Joseph Wu, chairman of
the Mainland Affairs Council, be allowed to visit China.</P>
      <P>"Let Taiwan's top China policy charter meet the leader of that
country's opposition party to exchange views, " Tkacik said
tongue-in-cheek.</P>
      <P>He said that unless China agrees to give reciprocal treatment and
allow a Taiwan official of the same level as Chen to visit China,
Taipei shouldn't approve Chen's application to come to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RANKS 3RD IN ASIA IN BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has been ranked third in Asia in
terms of business environment by the London-based Economist
Intelligence Unit (EIU), Premier Frank Hsieh said at a weekly Cabinet
meeting Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Quoting the EIU's survey, the premier said Taiwan's overall
rating has improved from "good" to "excellent."</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the rankings are based on the business prospects over
the next four to five years of the countries surveyed. He said that
Taiwan's overall ranking would be higher if its political
environment, ranked 23rd in Aisa, were better.</P>
      <P>The premier noted that Taiwan ranked ahead of Japan in the
survey, the details of which he didn't reveal.</P>
      <P>Instead, he boasted about Taiwan's economic performance in
September, saying that exports reached US$2.38 million, marking a
single-month record high for the second straight month. He also
pointed to the unemployment rate of 4.14 percent, which was lower
than the previous month's level as well as that for the same month
over the last five years.</P>
      <P>Hsieh predicted that the unemployment rate would drop to below 4
percent for this month, which he said would make it lower than the
jobless rates in Japan, the United States and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The premier said that Taiwan, which has pursued balanced
development in various economic sectors, has outperformed its
neighbors overall, although the island may lag behind some countries
in individual sectors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN EXPECTS TO COOPERATE WITH BRITAIN IN BIRD FLU BATTLE: ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Oct.  25 (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan expects to cooperate with the
British government in efforts to prevent a possible avian flu
pandemic, Taiwan's representative in the United Kingdom said during
an interview with the BBC Tuesday.</P>
      <P>During a live interview with BBC Radio, Lin Chun-yi said that the
government of Taiwan has attached great importance to public health
and epidemic prevention issues and that to date, no cases of avian
flu have been reported anywhere in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It is regretful that an official with the British Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) charged without solid
evidence Oct. 23 that imported birds from Taiwan were infected with
the deadly H5N1 virus, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin once again clarified that Taiwan is presently bird flu-free
and that DEFRA official's accusation was "groundless, " particularly
since DEFRA has not issued any investigation reports on the birds
imported from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin's representative office in London wrote a letter to DEFRA
Monday asking for a clarification after DEFRA chief veterinarian
Debby Reynolds claimed Oct. 23 that two parrots imported from
Suriname had tested positive for H5N1. With no cases of H5N1 yet
discovered in South America, she said that experts from her office
suspected that the parrots had been infected when they were exposed
to birds from Taiwan while being kept in quarantine.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Lin had two questions for DEFRA. Firstly, he
asked, how could the Taiwan birds, which arrived in England Sept. 27,
have infected the South American parrots, which died Sept. 19.</P>
      <P>Secondly, Lin said, the Taiwan birds and the South American birds
were kept in separate cages. He said there was no way to tell which
birds were infected with H5N1 and which birds infected which other
birds.</P>
      <P>In Lin's letter to DEFRA, the Taiwan representative also said
that DEFRA's claim that the Taiwan birds may have brought the avian
flu virus to Britain has hurt Taiwan's international image and dealt
a severe blow to its unrelenting efforts to upgrade its public health
and tourism.</P>
      <P>In the letter, Taiwan officials also asked DEFRA to explain why
birds from different countries were not quarantined separately.
According to world animal quarantine regulations, birds from
different countries should be quarantined at different places.</P>
      <P>"We want to know why the batch of birds imported to Britain from
Taiwan Sept. 27 were quarantined at the same place as a batch of
parrots from Suriname Sept. 16, " the letter said. According to ROC
government export records, the birds exported to Britain in late
September numbered 185. But DEFRA officials put the number at 216.</P>
      <P>"We hope to know the exact number and how many Taiwan birds have
died in British quarantine, " Lin said. "We ask DEFRA to furnish us
with an official investigation report." Lin added.</P>
      <P>Lin stressed in the interview with BBC Radio that his office has
told the DEFRA that a batch of H5N1-infected birds smuggled from
China and seized at a Taiwan port have all died and that Taiwan's
avian flu-free status remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>He added that under a stepped-up avian flu-response policy,
Taiwan has asked passengers entering the country from China, Hong
Kong and Macau to conduct a 10-day self-health monitoring program,
including daily temperature taking, after arrival.</P>
      <P>He said that it is indeed a challenge trying to keep avian flu
from China out of Taiwan as increasing numbers of bird flu cases have
been reported in China and as Taiwan lies so close to China.</P>
      <P>Lin also emphasized Taiwan's difficulties in obtaining access to
avian flu prevention and other medical information in the absence of
membership in the World Health Organization, particularly at a time
when fears have been growing around the world of a possible bird flu
pandemic.</P>
      <P>Avian flu is highly infectious among both wild and domestic
birds. H5N1 is the most virulent strain of bird flu. It has killed
more than 60 people in Asia since 2003. Experts fear the H5N1 strain
could mutate into one that is easily transmittable among humans which
could spark a global pandemic.</P>
      <P>Lin's BBC Radio interview marked the second time in two days that
he made Taiwan's stance clear to British media. He was interviewed by
BBC's Asia Today a day earlier.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLA HEAD ASKS FOR 1 YEAR TO PROVE HE CAN DO THE JOB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Council of Labor Affairs Chairman Lee
Ying-yuan on Wednesday asked for one year to prove he can do the job,
saying that he will step down if opinion surveys on local laborers at
that time reveal that they think he is unfit for the post.</P>
      <P>Lee, who served as secretary-general of the Executive Yuan before
assuming his current post last month, made the remarks while
reporting on the CLA's plans and budget for the next fiscal year.</P>
      <P>Legislator Ho Tsai-feng of the opposition Kuomintang questioned
him about his announcement to relax restrictions on hiring foreign
caregivers, asking if he is the head of local laborers or foreign
laborers.</P>
      <P>Lee responded by saying that "everything I do is based on the
principle of promoting the employment of local laborers."</P>
      <P>He said that his labor policy will stand up to local laborers'
review, adding that if his policy results in higher unemployment, he
will step down.</P>
      <P>Lee announced earlier this month that the council will scrap the
strict Barthel index used to determine whether a local family can
hire a foreign caregiver. The Barthel index assesses the degree of
disability in a particular individual. From now on, certificates
issued by medical authorities will be used, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, he said the new review system will be put into place
as soon as possible to remedy the situation of people with seriously
ill family members having to cajole doctors into fudging medical
reports so that they can qualify to employ a foreign caregiver.</P>
      <P>In addition, the CLA will provide training to local people
wishing to be caregivers and advertise for local workers when the
need arises. The council is also studying the feasibility of
subsidizing locals wishing to hire Taiwanese to work as caregivers to
cover the difference in cost between employing local caregivers and
employing foreign ones.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINTAINING SHARPNESS CHALLENGE FOR IC ASSEMBLY, TEST INDUSTRYBy Elizabeth Hsu CNA Staff Reporter </HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan semiconductor companies in the field
of back-end packaging and testing are under double pressure in
maintaining their world's leading position in the industry, facing a
growing demand for improved technology while a rising China threatens
to seize global market share.</P>
      <P>The packaging and testing industry plays a key role in back-end
semiconductor manufacture. With improving technologies pushing the
front-end silicon wafer manufacturing process from 0.25 micrometers
to 90 nanometers and even to 60nm and 45nm, the sector in Taiwan is
also faced with the challenge of technological improvement.</P>
      <P>It is already essential for companies that do not want to be
knocked out of the business to overcome their technological barriers
and take advantage of the demand for "fine pitch" packaging services
from leading wafer fabricators.</P>
      <P>The existence and market prospects of the packaging and test
sector -- an indispensable back-end semiconductor manufacture process
-- is closely bound up with integrated circuit (IC) production.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled in the Industrial Technology
Intelligence Services (ITIS) program of the Department of Industrial
Technology under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the output value
of Taiwan's IC industry broke the NT$1 trillion (US$30.09 billion)
mark to reach NT$1.99 trillion in 2004, representing growth of 34.2
percent over the previous year.</P>
      <P>Some NT$156.5 billion of that amount was the output value of the
IC assembly industry, while NT$57.7 billion was from the test sector.
The two figures recorded year-on-year growth of 33 percent and 41
percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>It has been assessed that the output value of Taiwan's IC
manufacturing industry will surge to NT$1.279 trillion in 2005, while
that of the packaging sector will rise to NT$178.1 billion at an
expected annual growth rate of 13.8 percent, and that of the test
sector will increase to NT$67 billion at a growth rate of 16 percent.</P>
      <P>Historically, semiconductor companies designed, manufactured,
packaged and tested IC chips in their own integrated device
manufacture (IDM) facilities. As the industry expands under strong
market demand, a trend is also growing for these companies to
outsource stages of the manufacturing process, enabling them to focus
on their core competencies such as design and integration, and meet
increasing demand.</P>
      <P>After development of nearly two decades, a complete up-mid-down
stream of supply chain system was formed in Taiwan's semiconductor
manufacturing industry. However, in the economic recession between
2000 and 2001, a large-scale company reshuffle occurred in the
back-end packaging and test market, during which weak companies were
either integrated or bought out by foreign or domestic enterprises.</P>
      <P>Thus, professional and international IC assembly and test service
providers emerged. The Kaohsiung-headquartered Advanced Semiconductor
Engineering Inc. (ASE) replaced the U.S.-based Amkor Technology Inc.
to become the world's largest supplier of outsourced semiconductor
interconnect services in 2003. It has contracts with over 200 IDM and
fabless factories from around the world, including Motorola, IBM,
ATI, 3DFX, nVidia and AMD.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's second-largest company dedicated to IC design, assembly
and testing -- Siliconware Precision Industries Co. Ltd. (SPIL) --
trailed behind with revenue surpassing US$1 billion in 2003 for the
first time since its establishment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, thanks to fast expansion of the industry in the
manufacture of thin film transistor-liquid crystal displays
(TFT-LCDs) , the demand for driver ICs has surged in the past few
years, leading to a boom in orders for driver IC packaging and test
services. Driver ICs are one of basic key components of LCD displays.</P>
      <P>It has been assessed that Taiwan's leading suppliers of driver IC
packaging and test services, including Chipmos Technologies Inc.,
International Semiconductor Technology Ltd., Chipbond Corp. and SPIL,
will cover more than 60 percent of global demand for some 2.2 billion
large panel-used driver ICs this year.</P>
      <P>With international IDM giants and semiconductor makers forced to
outsource back-end lines to preserve their core competitiveness due
to the evolution of the semiconductor manufacturing process toward
the more sophisticated and delicate "nano" level, a market worth
billions of US dollars exists for Taiwanese providers of packaging
and test services.</P>
      <P>According to corporate statistics, in 2004, the global market for
semiconductor test and packaging services was worth approximately
US$350 billion. Around 40.4 percent of the market was taken by
professional packaging and test companies, representing a growth of 6
percentage points over the previous year. The ratio is expected to
surge to 44.4 percent in 2006 and 46.2 percent in 2007.</P>
      <P>Like the front-end manufacturers, the back-end businesses have
also been seeking high-end and environmentally friendly lead-free
packaging technologies to keep their clients.</P>
      <P>However, for domestic providers of test and packaging services,
their common concerns are not over the technological challenges but
the government, which bans the sector from investing in China -- one
of the world's largest economies.</P>
      <P>A corporate source said local companies are worried that if they
do not mark their territories in the Chinese market now, they will
never be able to do so once China builds its own test and packaging
lines for semiconductor products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER ORDERS DOH TO SET UP BIRD FLU INFORMATION CENTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh ordered the Department
of Health (DOH) on Wednesday to set up an information center to
provide the media with accurate and updated news related to any avian
flu outbreaks at home or abroad to avoid public panic.</P>
      <P>Giving the directive during a weekly Cabinet meeting, Hsieh said
that bird flu outbreaks are a global problem and that the public can
easily be scared by the daily media reports on the issue, especially
when the information is confused.</P>
      <P>As an example, Hsieh pointed out that British authorities
recently said they suspected a Suriname-imported parrot infected with
the H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus picked up the virus from
Taiwanese birds in British quarantine and that the misleading
information was widely reported by international media, including AFP
and BBC.</P>
      <P>While the birds from Taiwan were determined by quarantine
authorities to be healthy before they were exported to Britain, there
was no evidence showing the sick parrot contracted the virus from the
Taiwan birds, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>These media organizations have made corrections at Taiwan's
request, Hsieh added.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, if Taiwan becomes a bird flu-affected area,
this will affect Taiwan's exports and image and undermine its
interests.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the premier instructed the DOH to prepare pamphlets to
provide the public with basic knowledge about bird flu and to
instruct them on how to monitor their own health condition.</P>
      <P>He urged the people to take proper precautionary measures against
bird flu and to avoid visiting China, saying that Beijing has failed
to be transparent in its battle against bird flu outbreaks which have
been reported in several Chinese provinces.</P>

      <P>"There are many areas that need to be reviewed, and I'm largely
to blame," Chen added.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that he is fully prepared to step down anytime to
take responsibility.</P>
      <P>Senegalese Foreign Minister Cheikh Tidiane Gadio signed a
communique with his Chinese counterpart Li Zhaoxing in Beijing
Tuesday on the resumption of diplomatic ties between their two
countries. Senegal switched its diplomatic recognition from Beijing
to Taipei in 1996.</P>
      <P>The communique did not reveal whether Senegal had broken off
diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but it did state that Senegal
acknowledges Beijing as the sole legitimate ruler of China, of which
Taiwan is a part, a claim which Taiwan rejects.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the notion expressed by the Senegalese government
recently that "there are no friends, only interests, in the
international community, " Chen said that in the past, there were
often many rumors about an imminent breaking off of diplomatic
relations between Taiwan and Senegal but that they all proved in the
end to be "erroneous."</P>
      <P>This time around, however, the rumors proved to be true, Chen
said, claiming that his ministry was "fooled, " rather than "being
slow" in grasping related developments.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsueh Shih-min, director of the National Security
Bureau, also offered Wednesday to take responsibility for the
severance of relations, saying at the Legislative Yuan that his
bureau failed to grasp the significance of related intelligence
information in time.</P>
      <P>Hsueh made the offer after Premier Frank Hsieh said earlier in
the day that relevant government agencies should look into whether
their efforts in gathering intelligence information regarding
diplomatic ties need to be reinforced.</P>
      <P>Hsueh said that the National Security Bureau had always issued
warnings in previous years whenever it discovered negative signs
regarding the state of Taiwan-Senegal diplomatic relations, and that
all the warnings were heeded and used to remedy the situation.</P>
      <P>This time around, however, Hsueh said, his bureau failed to
detect negative signs early enough to issue any warnings.</P>
      <P>"I will take responsibility for the failure and do not hesitate
in seeing other lower-ranking foreign affairs and security officials
also disciplined if required," he said.</P>
      <P>He added that the information his office has gathered to date
does not indicate that the severance of Taiwan-Senegal diplomatic
ties will cause a "domino effect."</P>
      <P>He admitted that in the face of Beijing's "stepped up 'dollar
diplomacy' schemes, " Taiwan is having an increasingly difficult time
in maintaining normal ties with its diplomatic allies, now numbering
25 in total following the severance of formal ties with Senegal.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's diplomatic ties with the Holy See
are "in a bit of danger, " Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen
admitted at the Legislative Yuan Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In response to wire service reports earlier the same day that the
Holy See is interested in resuming diplomatic relations with Beijing
if the latter agrees to its terms, Chen told lawmakers that his
ministry understands that Pope Benedict XVI is eager to start
dialogue with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan's ambassador to the Vatican "has been watchful
everyday for any signs of a worsening in bilateral ties" and is aware
that the pope is interested in forging diplomatic relations with
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's diplomats in the Vatican are so concerned about the
issue that "some of them can't sleep well at night, " the minister
said.</P>
      <P>Chen, however, refused to speculate on when a re-establishment of
formal ties between China and the Vatican might occur, saying only
that Taiwan's diplomats will do their best to dissuade the Vatican
from hurting Taiwan while reaching out to Beijing and to keep
Taiwan-Vatican ties intact for as long as possible.</P>
      <P>The media reports came one day after Taiwan severed diplomatic
relations with Senegal. On Tuesday, Senegal re-established diplomatic
ties with Beijing.</P>
      <P>When opposition lawmakers asked Chen whether he should resign to
take responsibility for the end of formal diplomatic relations with
Senegal, Chen said that he hasn't offered to do so but is "ready to
step down at anytime."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) unveiled
Wednesday a plan to promote smoke-free workplaces which is aimed at
reducing non-smokers' exposure to second-hand smoke by 10 percent in
five years.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by the DOH's Bureau of Health
Promotion, five million workers in Taiwan, or 25 percent of the
country's total workforce, are smokers, with male white-collar
workers accounting for 37 percent, male blue-collar workers
accounting 46 percent, and female workers accounting for 5 percent to
6 percent.</P>
      <P>However, most workplaces have not designated smoking zones to
protect non-smokers from exposure to second-hand smoke.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that 75 percent of the workers work in places
that are not regulated by the Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act. Only
13.8 percent of workplaces are required by law to be non-smoking,
while only 10.4 percent are required to set up smoking zones.</P>
      <P>A total of 36.8 percent of the respondents said they smell smoke
at their workplaces often or everyday, and 47.5 percent said they
smell smoke occasionally. Only 15.8 percent said they are not exposed
to second-hand smoke.</P>
      <P>Su Hsin-yu, an official at the bureau's Community Health
Division, pointed out that the Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act has
very limited bonding effect on private workplaces and that unless
company owners take the initiative to adopt a smoke-free policy, it
will be difficult to reduce tobacco hazards in workplaces.</P>
      <P>For example, Su said, Japan has banned smoking within three
meters of office buildings to protect the right of non-smokers, and
the Taipei City Government has also forbidden police officers from
smoking while on duty.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 50 percent of workers surveyed last year expressed
their support for banning smoking at workplaces, Su noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WILL NOT BE ABSENT FROM APEC LEADERSHIP SUMMIT: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will not be absent from the informal
leadership summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum to be held in Busan, South Korea next month, Minister of
Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Chen said that the
government is still making arrangements for Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng to attend the Busan summit as President Chen Shui-bian
has appointed Wang as his proxy for the meeting.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will not be absent from the summit even if all of its
efforts to have Wang attend the meeting fail due to Beijing's
obstruction, the foreign minister said.</P>
      <P>Beijing has said that it is opposed to Wang's attendance as he is
not an official in charge of APEC-related affairs.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after opposition Kuomintang Legislator John
Chiang called for President Chen to make sure someone attends the
summit on his behalf to represent Taiwan. Chiang said that the
Legislative Yuan will file for impeachment of President Chen for not
protecting Taiwan's national interests if he fails to have someone
attend the summit.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsiao Bi-khim from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party echoed his colleague's calls, saying that Taiwan should not be
absent from the APEC summit like it was in 2001.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should strive to have a representative at the meeting even
in the face of Beijing's strong opposition, Hsiao stressed, adding
that Taiwan's absence from the summit is not acceptable to the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>In 2001, President Chen appointed former Vice President Li
Yuan-zu to represent him at the informal leadership summit in
Shanghai that year. Because of Beijing's refusal to accept Li as
Chen's representative, Taiwan was absent from the two-day summit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN 'HOODWINKED' BY SENEGAL: FOREIGN MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen
admitted Wednesday that Taiwan had been "hoodwinked" by Senegal, an
African ally that announced the establishment of diplomatic relations
with China Tuesday without informing Taiwan in advance.</P>
      <P>Five hours after Senegal's announcement, Taipei said it was
terminating all aid programs to the African country.</P>
      <P>In the face of mounting criticism from the legislative floor,
Chen said Senegal had repeatedly reassured him that "there would be
no such thing (as a severing of ties with Taiwan in favor of China),"
and that "economics is one thing, while politics is another."</P>
      <P>"Yes, this time we have been hoodwinked," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Senegal's move could create a domino effect, Chen
said he has instructed Taiwan's diplomats to beef up communications
with the nation's allies.</P>
      <P>In response to lawmakers jeering that the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs was "the last to know" of Senegal's move to establish
diplomatic ties with China, Chen said there are indeed many things
that his ministry could improve on, "and certainly I must take a big
share of the responsibility."</P>
      <P>He said that if anybody in the government resigns over the
diplomatic failure, "I myself will quit," and not the director of the
Department of African Affairs, Lee Chen-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Lee acknowledged that it had been "rather difficult to maintain
ties with Senegal over the past few years," and whenever an emergency
occurred in bilateral relations, "a lot of manpower and resources had
to be mobilized" to maintain the formal ties which were established
in 1996.</P>
      <P>Just recently, Senegalese officials were visiting Taiwan, and
whenever Taiwan officials tried to confirm whether Senegal and China
were planning to establish formal ties, the Senegalese would say "no
such thing," Lee claimed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Foreign Minister Huang Lung-yuan said that under pressure
from and allured by China, Senegal announced the re-establishment of
diplomatic ties with China at 5: 30 p.m. Tuesday Taipei time. His
ministry ended all aid programs to Senegal hours later.</P>
      <P>Huang briefed Premier Frank Hsieh on the latest diplomatic
setback Wednesday morning. Hsieh commented that the ministry should
investigate and review why it did not have any "good information" and
thus failed to gain any prior knowledge of Senegal's move.</P>
      <P>At the legislature's Foreign Affairs Committee, one legislator
after another lashed out at the ruling party and the government for
being cheated by Senegal.</P>
      <P>"Senegal is the first country that President Chen Shui-bian
visited during his African tour, and he openly claimed that no allies
he has visited have severed ties with Taiwan, " Kuomintang (KMT)
Legislator Lai Shyh-bao said.</P>
      <P>Since the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) came to power in
2000, the foreign ministry has accumulated US$130 million (NT$4.1
billion) in debt -- presumably gone into secret aid to Third World
allies, and "that makes people feel hurt," Lai said.</P>
      <P>Legislator John Chiang, also of the KMT and a former foreign
minister, expressed concerns that if the government does not change
its policy, the total number of Taiwan's diplomatic allies could fall
to below 20 by 2008. The figure currently stands at 25 following the
severance of ties with Senegal. "Dollar diplomacy won't work, " he
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Bi-kim Hsiao of DPP said she does not think
Minister Chen should step down for losing an important African ally,
but added that his ministry must make improvements in its information
gathering.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Tung-jung of the DPP said that compared with the
KMT government, which on average lost one diplomatic ally per year,
the DPP government has lost only four allies in over five years,
adding that it "deserves a citation."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's top agriculture official
reaffirmed Wednesday that the Taiwan birds exported to Britain
tested negative for the avian flu virus, saying the results have been
relayed to Taiwan's overseas missions to clear the island's name.</P>
      <P>Lee Chin-lung, chairman of the Council of Agriculture (COA), made
the remarks during an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan
in the wake of reports that an official with the British Department
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) had claimed that
imported birds from Taiwan were infected with the deadly H5N1 strain
of the bird flu virus.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that the DEFRA official claimed Oct. 23 that two
parrots imported from Suriname had tested positive for H5N1. With no
cases of H5N1 yet discovered in South America, the official said that
experts suspected that the parrots had been infected when they were
exposed to birds from Taiwan while being kept in quarantine. It was
discovered later that the Taiwan birds arrived in England Sept. 27,
more than a week after the South American parrots died.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the COA sent experts to the farm that exported the
Taiwan birds to collect specimens Tuesday and that the results of the
tests were negative.</P>
      <P>The COA has supplied information related to the number, category,
and quarantine certificate of the Taiwan birds to the representative
office in Britain to show that they were exported after meeting the
quarantine requirements of the British side, Sung Hua-tsung, director
of COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine,
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee said that he has full confidence about preventing
avian flu from spreading to Taiwan, adding that the nation will
nevertheless make the "best possible preparations to deal with a
worst case scenario."</P>
      <P>Lee noted that an international risk rating company has assessed
that Japan, Australia and Taiwan have been the best Asian countries
in terms of quarantine controls, adding that Taiwan has maintained
its bird flu-free status for years.</P>
      <P>Sung also said that the COA has asked the Coast Guard
Administration and customs officials to step up their efforts against
smuggling to stop birds from avian flu-affected areas from making
their way into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, the COA has asked wild bird societies to step up
monitoring of bird droppings in 10 wetland areas as part of efforts
to prevent the spread of bird flu to Taiwan via migratory birds. The
number of specimens being tested has been increased from 2,000 per
year to 3,000 per year.</P>

      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau of the

cracked a fraud ring that had tried to extort ransom payments from
victims by telling them via mobile phone that their relatives on
overseas trips had been kidnapped.</P>
      <P>The bureau began investigating the case only six days ago after
learning from news reports that the mother of a professor at a
private university was so shocked by two phone calls from the fraud
ring in August about the kidnap of her son during his visit to the
United Kingdom that she died from a stroke.</P>
      <P>In one of the phone calls, the fraudsters threatened the
60-year-old woman that if she did not pay them NT$500,000 her son

      <P>Police detectives working on the case screened mobile phone
companies' records of more than 37,000 suspected phone calls from

students of science and technology universities do not even meet the
academic requirements for graduates of junior high schools, a
lawmaker of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) claimed
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>TSU lawmaker Chen Cheng-lung claimed he tested "about 2,000"
students from private science and technology universities with
examination papers catering to junior high school students and found
that only 2.1 percent of them reached a passing grade in English and
7.6 percent reached a passing grade in mathematics, which works out
at an average pass rate of 4.8 percent.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker claimed his findings vindicate a general public
feeling that the academic achievements of students in science and
technology universities that have sprouted in Taiwan over the last 10
years are declining rapidly.</P>
      <P>In order to "cross-verify his findings, " Chen said he tested 50
junior high school graduates with question papers used by the Joint

    <HEADLINE>GIO HEAD CLAIMS NCC BILL WILL ADD VALUE TO OPPOSITION PARTY'S ASSETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister
Pasuya Yao claimed Wednesday that the passing of a bill on the
organization of a National Communications Commission (NCC) will add
several billion-worth of value to the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's)
assets.</P>
      <P>Noting that Article 16 of the bill deals with a retroactive
clause, Yao claimed that this is basically a "resurrection" and
"value-protection" article for the assets of the KMT, in view of the
current media environment.</P>
      <P>He claimed that whether the KMT assets are ill-gotten will be
"decided by the public, " but added that it affects the sale of its
media assets such as the China Television Company and the
Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC).</P>
      <P>He pointed out especially that the BCC has taken nearly 40
percent of the available broadcast frequencies and that the GIO's
efforts to streamline the frequencies so as to conform to the
principle of fairness and justice might be disrupted because of this
retroactive clause. Other reports, however, said the BCC will not be
able to take advantage of the retroactive clause because it
stipulates that those who have taken remedial measures will not be
able to cite the clause and that the BCC is known to have filed
complaints to the related agencies.</P>
      <P>Yao said that the passing of the NCC bill will be tantamount to a
"guarantee" for post-sale service, adding that the KMT will use its
dominant NCC representation to guarantee related media transactions.</P>
      <P>Quoting media reports, Yao said that after the passing of the
bill, the transaction of the KMT assets could be increased by several
billions of dollars.</P>
      <P>Under the bill, the 13 members of the NCC will be chosen by a
panel from among 18 candidates -- with 15 nominated by political
parties according to proportional representation and three by the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The panel in charge of picking the commission members will
consist of 11 scholars and experts, also appointed by political
parties according to the proportional representation model.</P>
      <P>The panel must make its choice through a three-fifths vote, but
candidates who receive only a simple majority vote from the panel may
also serve on the NCC if the number of candidates who won
three-fifths of the votes falls short of 13.</P>
      <P>Yao reaffirmed his opposition to the bill, claiming it will
definitely be difficult to implement because it has turned against
the tide of freeing the media from interference from military,
partisan and government forces.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will consult with the legislative caucus of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party to decide whether to ask the
Council of Grand Justices for an interpretation of the bill's
constitutionality or to return the bill to the legislature for
reconsideration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER SUGGESTS FOCUSING ON WEST, JAPAN FOLLOWING SENEGAL DEBACLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition lawmaker suggested Wednesday
that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) shift its focus to Japan,
the United States and the European Union in the diplomatic battle
against China following a diplomatic setback a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislator Lo Chih-ming issued the call
during an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan and urged
the MOFA to place even more emphasis on these countries when seeking
to explore international space for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huge economic benefits rather than friendship between the peoples
of the two countries are the main reason behind Senegal's decision to
cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan and shift its recognition to China,
Lo said.</P>
      <P>He also questioned Foreign Affairs Minister Tan San Chen as to
whether Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under the
Chinese State Council, should be allowed to take part in a forum here
with Taiwan's opposition parties in December at a time when China is
imperiously "digging at the walls of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>MOFA announced the severance of bilateral diplomatic ties with
Senegal late Tuesday after being notified by Senegal President
Abdoulaye Wade earlier the same day of his decision to set up
diplomatic relations with China, bringing the number of Taiwan's
diplomatic allies down to 25.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chen seemed to agree with Lo's idea, saying that
"it might be a solution (to Taiwan's diplomatic wrangling with China)
as long as national consensus is forged on doing so."</P>
      <P>Chen also said he is willing to resign to take responsibility for
Senegal's cutting ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) also harshly
attacked MOFA for its failure to get information about Senegal's move
at an earlier time, claiming that Wade's last-minute notice
constituted an "insult" to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator John Chiang warned MOFA of a possible "domino
effect, " expressing worry that the number of Taiwan's diplomatic
partners might fall to fewer than 20 in the coming years if no policy
adjustments are made. "Taiwan's diplomatic war against China cannot
be simplified to just a race of dollar diplomacy," he argued.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao said President Chen Shui-bian has
tossed away nearly US$130 million in "diplomatic bad loans" since he
first came to power in 2000, which has deeply hurt the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Chen embarked on a tour of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Africa
in 2002, and Senegal was the first leg of that trip.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTRY UNDER ATTACK OVER SENEGAL TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two lawmakers from the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) demanded Wednesday that Foreign Affairs Minister Tan
Sun Chen resign to take responsibility over what they called the
"humiliating process" involving the severance of diplomatic relations
between the Republic of China and Senegal.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced a day earlier
the government's decision to cut diplomatic ties with Senegal, hours
after the African nation restored diplomatic relations with the
People's Republic of China. Ministry officials admitted that they
were not informed beforehand of the development.</P>
      <P>According to KMT Legislator John Chiang, a former foreign
minister, the incident is the cruelest and the most disrespectful he
has ever seen. He criticized the ministry for failing to react
properly to the embarrassing situation by immediately recalling the
ROC ambassador and aid missions to Senegal.</P>
      <P>Accusing the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government
of adopting an erroneous foreign policy, Chiang warned that the
incident will trigger a chain reaction and predicted that the number
of the country's diplomatic allies will fall below 20 by the time
President Chen Shui-bian steps down in 2008.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Su Chi, who is a former chairman of the Mainland
Affairs Council, said the incident has exposed the "intelligence
failure" of the National Security Council and the MOFA and that both
should be held responsible for the humiliating diplomatic debacle.</P>
      <P>Echoing the KMT's opinions, Huang Yi-chiao, convener of the
opposition People First Party's legislative caucus, urged the
government to review its foreign policy and to "stop using checkbook
diplomacy to win over allies."</P>
      <P>Huang said that the financial aid offered by Taiwan and its
democratic system have been two advantages enjoyed by Taiwan in
expanding its foreign relations, but Taiwan is no longer in an
advantageous position following the rise of China's economy and what
he claimed is the "regression of Taiwan's democracy."</P>
      <P>Instead of continuing to waste taxpayers' money in a diplomatic
game with Beijing, the government should prioritize stabilizing its
relations with China, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>However, DPP legislators dismissed the claims by the KMT and PFP
and condemned Beijing for continuing its double-handed strategy
toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>William Lai, a leader of the DPP legislative caucus, said
honorary KMT Chairman and former ROC Vice President Lien Chan, who is
currently on a visit to China, should protest to Beijing or leave
China immediately to express his anger.</P>
      <P>Lai pointed out that Beijing celebrated Tuesday the 60th
anniversary of Taiwan's retrocession from Japan as if Taiwan is one of
its provinces, but the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT, PFP and New
Party did not voice a protest.</P>
      <P>Pro-unification New Party Chairman Yok Mu-ming even joined
Beijing in the celebration, Lai noted.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Tien Chiu-chin accused "pan-blue" politicians of
kowtowing to Beijing by making 26 visits to China between July 2004
and September 2005, disregarding the fact that Taiwan was forced to
withdraw from the United Nations 34 years ago because of the rivalry
with China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan Solidarity Union legislative caucus convener Ho
Min-hao joined the DPP in condemning Lien for not protesting to
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Ho also demanded that the government retaliate against Beijing's
suppression of Taiwan by rejecting a possible visit to Taiwan by Chen
Yunlin, director of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, and scrapping its
plan to recognize Chinese academic degrees.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AVERAGE SALARY FOR OFFICE WORKERS UP 9% THIS YEAR: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The average monthly salary for domestic
office workers with five years of experience reached NT$32,850
(US$976) this year, with people in information and sciences topping
the list at an average of NT$36,874, according to a recent survey.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey, conducted by 1111 Job Bank, show that
the average salary for new office workers this year represented a
growth of 9 percent over NT$30,207 registered last year.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted between May 20 and Oct. 20, received 7,374
valid responses with a margin of error of 1.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, statistics compiled by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics show that the average salary for
all spectrums of workers in Taiwan totalled NT$35,590 as of August
this year, a slight growth over NT$35,333 registered last year.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows that workers in the commercial consulting
sector earned the second-largest monthly salary of NT$35,440, with
media and advertising workers receiving the third-largest salary of
NT$33,532.</P>
      <P>The average salary for the retail industry was bottom of the list

      <P>Among detailed job categories, system software developers topped
the list with NT$41,130 per month, followed by engineering
researchers with NT$40,211 and marketing planners with NT$39,830.</P>
      <P>Newcomers in the job market received an average of NT$25,129 for
their first jobs this year, a slight growth over NT$25,070 registered
last year. The figure is much lower than the NT$40,000 for South
Korean college graduates, NT$58,000 for Japanese graduates and
NT$140,817 for American graduates, according to information from
manpower data banks of these countries.</P>
      <P>Wu Ruey-ying, a spokesman for 1111 Job Bank, said new college
graduates should not pay much attention to the salary of their first
jobs, but should instead focus on whether they can get promotion or
pursue growth in their jobs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S NOTEBOOK OUTPUT SEEN TO TOP US$9 BILLION IN Q4</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has shipped 13.35 million notebook
personal computers in the third quarter of this year, an 84.4 percent
share of the global market and a figure that is expected to rise to
84.8 percent with 15.15 million units, worth US$9.08 billion, in the
fourth quarter, the Institute for Information Industry (III) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>III's Market Intelligence Center (MIC) estimated that in 2005, a
total of 59 million notebook PCs will be sold on the world market, 49
million of which will be made in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>MIC Deputy Director Chin Su-hsia said big brands such as Dell, HP
and Acer have been pouring entry-level notebooks into the market,
speeding up the effect of notebooks replacing desktops. As the market
grows, Taiwan's OEM/ODM manufacturers are benefiting from the
expansion.</P>
      <P>Japanese brands such as Toshiba have also been supplying the
market with low-priced notebooks, increasing the share of Taiwan's
OEM/ODM output in the third quarter. Taiwan's Q3 share of the global
notebook market showed a whopping 51.6 percent growth from the same
quarter of last year and a 22.1 percent increase from the previous
quarter, Chin noted.</P>
      <P>The shining performance was not as impressive in terms of total
output value because the famous brand names have cut their unit
prices to an average of US$607, so the total value reached US$8.1
billion in the third quarter of 2005, up only 40.9 percent from the
same period of last year.</P>
      <P>With the approach of the Christmas holidays and as major
manufacturers plan to stimulate the market with lower-priced
products, shipments of notebooks are expected to remain brisk in Q4.
In Taiwan, the notebook industry is forecast to ship 15.18 million
units in this quarter, up 42.2 percent from the same period of last
year and 13.7 percent up from the previous quarter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO NT$-RENMINBI EXCHANGE SERVICE ON TAIWAN PROPER: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is still premature to begin new Taiwan
dollar-renminbi currency exchange services on Taiwan proper as it
involves too many complicated issues, Mainland Affairs Council
Chairman Joseph Wu said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>At a tea-party with local and foreign journalists, Wu noted that
the government implemented NT$-renminbi currency exchange services on
the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu on a trial basis early this
month and needs more time to evaluate the new measure.</P>
      <P>The government inaugurated the currency exchange services Oct. 4,
with travelers using the "mini three links" between Kinmen, Matsu and
several mainland Chinese ports showing warm response to the policy,
as they no longer have to exchange their renminbi on the black
market.</P>
      <P>Although many people believe that NT$-renminbi exchange services
should be implemented on Taiwan proper due to frequent cross-Taiwan
Strait economic and trade exchanges, Wu said the issue needs more
negotiation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and that it
might also need a revision to Taiwan's regulations that govern
cross-strait ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION LAWMAKERS WANT TO INCREASE CASH ALLOWANCE FOR AGED FARMERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   26  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition legislators introduced
legislation Wednesday aiming to increase the monthly cash allowance
for farmers aged 65 and over from the current NT$4,000 to NT$5,000.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party
(PFP) told a press conference at the Legislative Yuan that the move
was made in line with a recent announcement by President Chen
Shui-bian that the government will take better care of the welfare of
elderly farmers.</P>
      <P>They introduced an amendment to the current "temporary
regulations governing welfare and allowances for aged farmers," which
would ask the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) to raise the
monthly cash allowance to NT$5,000 for elderly farmers from Jan. 1
next year.</P>
      <P>The opposition legislators estimated that there is no need to
increase the COA's total budget for fiscal 2006, which stands at
about NT$100 billion, and that all the COA needs to do is adjust the
priorities in the budget plan.</P>
      <P>The amendment would ask the COA to resubmit its budget plan
within one week.</P>
      <P>In reaction, legislators of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) claimed that the move is "clearly unconstitutional"
because the opposition lawmakers are trying to block the COA's budget
in the name of the welfare of elderly farmers.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Ker Chien-min said the DPP legislative caucus will
also introduce a proposal next week to increase the monthly cash
allowance to NT$5,000.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, COA Chairman Lee Ching-lung ruled out the possibility
of the COA rewriting its budget plan.</P>
      <P>He estimated that the increased allowances for some 700,000
elderly farmers will add a financial burden of NT$8.4 billion to the
COA's annual budget and affect other priorities, such as the
prevention of avian influenza and mud flows in mountainous areas.</P>
      <P>Lee said the COA will not consider resubmitting its fiscal 2006
budget before the source of the funds is secured.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu ruled out Wednesday the possibility of a tradeoff between a
senior Chinese official's visit to Taiwan and Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng's attendance at the upcoming informal
leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum as President Chen Shui-bian's proxy.</P>
      <P>Speaking during an informal meeting with local and foreign
journalists, Wu said that as an APEC formal member, Taiwan has the
legitimate right to send a representative to attend the annual APEC
summit.</P>
      <P>"China is not in a position to dictate by whom Taiwan should be
represented on the occasion, " Wu claimed, despite the fact that
because of China's obstinate opposition, Taiwan's head of state has
been barred from attending the APEC summit in person and has had to
name a proxy to attend on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Chen has appointed Wang to represent him at the 2005 APEC summit
to be held in Busan, South Korea Nov. 18-19, but China has voiced
blunt opposition and has demanded that Taiwan be represented by an
economic official.</P>
      <P>Reporters had speculated that the government might allow Chen
Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's State
Council, to attend a seminar in Taiwan in December in exchange for
China's consent to Wang's APEC attendance.</P>
      <P>"The reports are not true. A so-called tradeoff is out of the
question," Wu said.</P>
      <P>He confirmed that the main opposition Kuomintang had filed an
application with the Immigration Bureau inviting Chen Yunlin and
several other Chinese officials and experts to attend a seminar in
Taipei in December.</P>
      <P>Given Chen Yulin's special status in the Chinese government, Wu
said, China should send working-level officials to Taiwan to flesh
out technical details regarding such an unprecedented visit.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) and its Chinese counterpart -- the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- negotiated for the late SEF
Chairman Koo Chen-fu to visit China in the past, Wu said the MAC will
decide whether to approve Chen Yulin's visit in terms of the results
of SEF-ARATS negotiations.</P>
      <P>The KMT and its adversary-turned-partner, the Communist Party of
China are scheduled to co-sponsor a seminar in Taipei in December.
Under the present political circumstances, Wu said, it is
inappropriate for any unauthorized political party or group to
claim that it can represent the Chinese government to negotiate with
the Taiwan government on political affairs.</P>
      <P>Even though China's passage of its anti-secession law against
Taiwan and its latest success in tempting the West African nation of
Senegal to switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing have
had a negative impact on cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Wu said the
government is still willing to discuss with China the opening of
direct cross-strait charter passenger and cargo flights and allowing
Chinese citizens to sightsee in Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Chamber of Commerce Taipei
(ECCT) suggested Wednesday in its annual report that Taiwan ease
government regulations and improve its ties with China as a means of
staying competitive regionally and globally.</P>
      <P>The two negative factors have driven many multinationals out of
Taiwan despite the fact that Taiwan is a good place to make money,
ECCT Chairman Sager Dirk said, expressing worry that many European
companies may opt to invest in other countries should Taiwan fail to
address the problems in time.</P>
      <P>For the time being, investments by ECCT member companies here
have almost all come to a halt, evidence in Taiwan's lackluster
economic indexes and flagging foreign direct investment in recent
years, Dirk said, pointing to Taiwan's awkward and excessive laws and
regulations and the country's abnormal relations with China as the
key hurdles.</P>
      <P>Many hindrances also arise from Taiwan's uncertain and peculiar
political relations with China, the ECCT chairman said, noting that
Taiwan's resistance to opening up to Chinese products -- as many as
around 2,400 items so far -- not only violates its own promise made
upon entering the World Trade Organization but has also caused marked
losses for many foreign companies.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, European retail business has suffered
losses of more than US$100 million in Taiwan as a result of Taiwan's
ban on imports from China, which is a major manufacturing powerhouse
around the world.</P>
      <P>In addition, he pointed out, Taiwan's delays in joining the WTO
Government Procurement Agreement have also frustrated many European
enterprises, eventually driving them out of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has been trying to transform from a manufacturing
power to a service-oriented economy, he noted that the relevant
environments and infrastructures have yet to be built to serve that
end.</P>
      <P>The ECCT chairman said that while Taiwan is still a good
destination for foreign investors to make money, it needs to be
better, stronger and more competitive.</P>

      <P>A number of ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) legislators demanded Wednesday that the Financial
Supervisory Commission (FSC) chairman and vice chairman step down to
take political responsibility for the "vultures" insider trading
scandal.</P>
      <P>Former FSC Examination Bureau Chairman Lee Chin-cheng was
indicted on charges of leaking classified information to his stock
trading friends who used the information make illicit profits from
the stock market. Prosecutors demanded an eight-year jail term for
Lee and a minimum of one year for four others Tuesday.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Kuo Cheng-liang said a number of DPP lawmakers in
the legislative caucus' financial policy group demanded that FSC
Chairman Kong Jaw-sheng and Vice Chairman Lu Tung-ying resign for
"using the wrong person" and "failing to supervise a key official."</P>
      <P>Kuo said the scandal has become international news because the
regulator of the nation's financial industry had broken the law he
was supposed to impose on the whole industry. Likening Taiwan to a

      <P>DPP Legislator Lin Chung-mo said that somebody should take the
administrative and political responsibility for the scandal.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Chiang Chao-yi pointed out that when a lawmaker
alerted the FSC of a possible irregularity inside the commission in
March, the FSC took no action until the end of June and Vice Chairman
Lu Tung-ying even praised Lee Chin-cheng as "a great asset" of the
FSC, which Chiang claimed was an "obvious attempt to cover up his
crime."</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Wang Shih-chien said that if Kong does not quit, he
will initiate a petition at the legislature to demand that the

      <P>Lee, as a financial regulator, has helped his friends steal

      <P>The Cabinet passed a draft bill at its
weekly meeting Wednesday on the establishment of an anti-corruption
bureau as part of its efforts to achieve clean politics.</P>
      <P>According to the draft bill, the new anti-corruption bureau will
be put under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) . The
bill still needs to be referred to the Legislative Yuan for approval.</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Shih Mao-lin said the proposed new bureau will
"cooperate and compete" with the MOJ's Investigation Bureau to
upgrade the efficiency in anti-corruption operations.</P>
      <P>"We believe that the multichannel operations will facilitate the
campaign against official corruption, " Shih said, adding that he
hopes the two bureaus will maintain both "partnership and
competitive" relations in their fight against corruption and the
pursuit of clean politics.</P>
      <P>According to the MOJ plan, the new bureau will set up
investigative centers in northern, central and southern parts of the
island, to be manned by officials from existing government ethics
units. The staff of the new bureaus will be accorded "judicial

the Investigation Bureau and the new anti-corruption bureau are

Iraqi Officials Declare Charter Has Been Passed

Iraqi electoral officials officially
announced Tuesday that voters had passed a new
constitution, paving the way for parliamentary
elections in December. But the constitution
narrowly escaped defeat, as Sunni Arabs turned
out in large numbers to vote against it. While
Sunni Arabs appear willing to participate, they
remain hostile to Shiite and Kurdish rule. The
Sun ni groups appear to be mobilizing for a
large turnout in elections for the National
Assembly in December, in order to make major
changes to the constitution and to obstruct the
aims of Shiites and Kurds by having a Sunni Arab
voice in the government.

Wall Street Journal: Farmers, Charities Join

American humanitarian groups, armed with
food donated by the U.S. government, have fed
millions of starving people around the world
over the past half-century. Starting next year,
t he White House wants to spend one-quarter of
its food-aid budget to buy overseas goods to
feed starving foreigners. The charities are
opposing the shift because, for years, their

Thursday and they did not know anything about Chen's reported visit
to the casino at Sheraton Walker-Hill Hotel in Seoul Nov. 2, 2002.</P>
      <P>Major newspapers carried a photo showing Chen Chen-nan and Chen
Min-hsien, former vice chairman of the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp.
(KRTC) , at a gambling table together in the casino in the South
Korean capital. Both were suspected of being involved in the
Kaohsiung mass rapid transit scandal.</P>
      <P>Chen Min-hsien is the leader of Southeast Cement Corp. in
Kaohsiung. His secretary said he could not be reached for comment on
the report.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh, who has apologized for his role as a former

      <P>Ma said he was not surprised that "new evidence" would continue
to emerge after acting Kaohisung Mayor Yeh Chu-lan completed an

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office said Thursday that
it does not have any record of former Presidential Office Deputy
Secretary-General Chen Che-nan having asked for a leave or visiting a
foreign country in November 2002.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office's Department of Public Affairs made the
statement in response to media reports that Chen and Chen Min-hsien,
former vice chairman of Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) , were
seen sitting together at a casino table at a Seoul, South Korea hotel
Nov. 2, 2002.</P>
      <P>Neither the office nor the president knew of Chen Che-nan's
foreign visit, and there had never been any "inspection report on the
foreign labor situation" allegedly presented to the president by Chen
following his foreign visit, said Chen Wen-tzung, director of the
department.</P>
      <P>The director called on the public not to speculate on or play up
the reports. "If you have any evidence, just refer it to the
prosecution authorities so they can investigate, " Chen Wen-tzung
said.</P>
      <P>He reiterated President Chen Shui-bian's determination to uncover
all the facts regarding the KRTC scandal. The president has also
pledged that if he is found to have been illegally involved or to
have covered up anything, he will gladly give up presidential
immunity and step down as president, Chen Wen-tzung added.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung, Chen Min-hsien, who was being probed by
investigators, said he and his good friend Chen Che-nan did tour
Cheju Island in South Korea in November 2002, pointing out that the
media reports only prove that they were "enjoying a legal
recreational activity."</P>
      <P>"Chen Che-nan and I are good friends. We went to a recreational
area, purely for tourism purposes. It's nothing. It has nothing to do
with the KRTC scandal," he told the media.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Chung Chung-hsiao of Kaohsiung District Court said the
photo would not change the direction of his investigation, which he
said was focusing on the flow of money and funds.</P>
      <P>The prosecution will try to determine whether the two Chens were
being treated by the KRTC during their Korean trip, Chung said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, acting Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh Chu-lan urged the media and
the public not to "overstretch" their imagination about her city
government's administrative investigation into the KRTC scandal.</P>
      <P>In her special report on the incident, an anonymous letter was
appended which claimed that Chen Min-hsien demanded NT$100 million in
"public relations fees" from contractors interested in winning KRTC
construction contracts.</P>
      <P>Chen told them that he was responsible for collecting NT$5
billion in election campaign funds for President Chen Shui-bian,
according to the letter.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, Chen Wen-tzung categorically refuted the letter's
allegations.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the letter became part of her report because
investigators had looked into the allegations and city council
members had questioned the government about its credibility.</P>
      <P>"We should present facts as they are and say nothing if we cannot
support our statements with solid evidence," she said, calling on the
people not to look at the report from "unhealthy" standpoints.</P>
      <P>Yeh emphasized that she included that letter in her report to
show that she has not hidden anything. The letter is not evidence,
she asserted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ENVOY REGRETS BRITISH OFFICIAL'S REMARKS ON BIRD FLU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London, Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By J.J. Hwang and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top envoy in London said Wednesday
that he feels great regret about a high-ranking British official's
remarks that Taiwan birds might have infected two parrots imported
from Suriname which later died of avian flu.</P>
      <P>Edgar Lin, Taiwan's representative to Britain, expressed his
regret in a letter he sent to Margaret Beckett, secretary of state of
the U.K. Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs (DEFRA).</P>
      <P>Beckett reported the same day to the British Parliament that two
parrots imported from the South American country of Suriname died
after being infected with the H5N1 virus which they possibly had
contracted from birds imported from Taiwan. The Taiwan birds and the
parrots had been kept in quarantine together. Beckett provided no
proof for her claims.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the secretary's remarks "obviously went against
the facts," Lin said in the letter that so far, it still has not been
proven that the Taiwan birds were carrying the avian flu virus.</P>
      <P>He also told Beckett that currently, Taiwan is not a bird
flu-affected area, stressing that any comments suggesting without
evidence that the birds were infected with H5N1 could be harmful to
the island's image and its reputation of attaching great importance
to public health.</P>
      <P>"In the interests of the two countries, I hope that the DEFRA can
make relevant comments in accordance with facts and fairness, " he
added.</P>
      <P>In response to the British government's comments on the Suriname
parrots, Lin further said that the island's Council of Agriculture
sent a veteranarian Tuesday to the bird-raiser in Taichung, Taiwan
who had sold the birds. The vet tested the birds raised there.</P>
      <P>"The tests showed that all of the birds were in good health and
did not have avian flu, " Lin said in the letter, adding that this
"clearly shows that the death of parrots in Britain were not related
to the birds from Taiwan."</P>

      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Su Tseng-chang said Thursday that his party has set up a task force
that will "find out in the shortest possible time any law breakers
who have attempted to lie to the public" with respect to the
Kaohsiung rapid transit scandal.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks in the wake of media reports carrying a photo
that shows former Presidential Deputy Secretary-General Chen Che-nan
and former Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) Vice Chairman Chen
Min-hsien together at a casino in Seoul, South Korea. Both Chens are
suspected of involvement in the KRTC scandal.</P>
      <P>The scandal erupted after Thai laborers helping to build the
rapid transit system rioted in protest against what they called poor
living conditions and maltreatment by consultant companies contracted
in August by the KRTC to manage foreign workers.</P>
      <P>Su said the DPP task force will not limit itself when
investigating the incident, which has damaged the ruling party's
image as a clean and reforming political force.</P>
      <P>Su made his remarks while stumping for Luo Wen-jia, DPP candidate

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S TOP TOURISM OFFICIAL'S VISIT SIMPLY TO CHECK OUT SITES: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's top tourism administrator's
upcoming visit to Taiwan will simply be to see first-hand the scenic
spots and tourism facilities around Taiwan, Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The government has no plans to try to arrange any official
meetings with the visiting Chinese official, the MAC chief said.</P>
      <P>Wu was referring to Shao Qiwei, director of the National Tourism
Administration under China's State Council, at an interpellation
session at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Shao will be travelling to Taiwan for a 10-day visit in his
capacity as president of the Chinese Tourism Association in line with
Beijing's policy of no official contact with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shao's visit was arranged by private groups, and both sides
agreed that the visit would be based on the "principle of
simplicity, " Wu noted, adding that "if we ask for talks or meetings
with him, it will mess things up."</P>
      <P>On opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislator David Huang's
claim that it is "cozying up" to China to allow Shao's visit in the
wake of Beijing's luring of Taiwan's African ally Senegal to severe
diplomatic relations with Taipei, Wu responded that cross-strait
policy should not be embroiled in an endless and senseless
"tit-for-tat, " which he said would not be conducive to better
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"Since opening up to Chinese tourists is an established policy
and since Shao's visit will help the development of cross-strait
tourism, " Wu said that the MAC will continue to promote the matter
while weighing the benefits to the nation.</P>
      <P>Wu expressed the hope that Shao's visit will lay a good
foundation and pave the way for future consultations between Taiwan
and China on tourism.</P>
      <P>Shao will be accompanied by a 66-member delegation made up of
senior executives of travel associations and tourist agencies in
various Chinese provinces and cities.</P>
      <P>The delegation is scheduled to stay in Taipei for three days
before heading to the central, southern and eastern parts of Taiwan
for two days in each region. It is scheduled to depart Taiwan Nov. 6.</P>
      <P>The visit is widely seen as a prelude to China allowing its
citizens to make sightseeing trips to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the legislative interpellation session, Minister
of Transportation and Communications Lin Ling-san said that he would
welcome a meeting with Shao if the latter were to express a desire
for one.</P>
      <P>However, Lin said that China has asked Shao to keep as low a
profile as possible during his visit and that the officials he meets
in Taiwan should not be higher than ministerial-level ones.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait charter flights during the Chinese New Year
holiday in 2006, Wu said that "barring a veto by China, there should
be no problem."</P>
      <P>Wu said that Taiwan is currently in contact with China regarding
cross-strait cargo and passenger charter flight consultations, but if
the consultations are too lengthy, the government will first deal
with charter flights during Chinese New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>Wu said that in the past, only China-based Taiwan businesspeople
were allowed to use the Chinese New Year holiday cross-strait charter
flight services. He said the government will weigh whether to allow
foreign nationals to also use the flight services.</P>
      <P>He said that this and other issues, such as the flight
destinations and the allocation of flights and routes, will all have
to be determined in further consultations with China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will not restrict its people from
traveling to China even though Hunan Province has reported an avian
flu outbreak which has killed hundreds of chickens and ducks, Premier
Frank Hsieh said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"One province hit by avian flu does not mean other areas of China
have been hit too," Hsieh said, urging China to truthfully report all
avian flu cases to the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>He also urged the Taiwan public not to panic, pointing out that
the government has not issued an advisory against travel to other
Chinese provinces.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said it is not clear whether the Hunan outbreak has been
caused by birds or by humans, and "it is a question that we must try
to understand further."</P>
      <P>If it is confirmed that bird flu has begun to spread among
humans, that "would be a serious matter for people around the world
because we now live in a global village," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the premier announced that the government has
negotiated a good price to purchase three tons of raw materials that
can be used to make enough Tamiflu for 2.3 million people, or
one-tenth of Taiwan's population.</P>
      <P>Now, the government will try to gain authorization to mass
produce Tamiflu from its patent holder, Roche Pharmaceuticals, he
said, setting a timetable to mass produce the influenza medicine from

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan fishermen are banned from catching
whale sharks from now through the end of this year based on a yearly
quota control system implemented by the government in line with
international efforts to protect the biggest fish.</P>
      <P>According to a notice issued Oct. 24 by the Cabinet-level Council
of Agriculture (COA) , Taiwan fishermen have caught a total of 65
whale sharks since the beginning of this year, reaching the cap
imposed by the COA on local fisherman for this year.</P>
      <P>The yearly quota control system was set up in July 2002 by the
COA in conjunction with a global conservation drive and marine
resources management efforts. The COA first initiated a whale shark
catch tracking system in 2001, requiring Taiwan fishermen to report
their catch of whale sharks to the council.</P>
      <P>From now through Dec. 31, Taiwan fishermen will not be able to
catch, possess, sell or dispose of the fish, and those who
accidentally catch whale sharks will have to set them back in the
sea, live or dead. Fishermen who violate the rule will be sentenced

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT PLEDGES TO REALIZE 'DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian pledged Thursday
that the second phase of constitutional reforms will be carried out
according to the concept of "deliberative democracy" to facilitate
extensive citizen participation in the process.</P>
      <P>Chen was speaking to a foreign delegation visiting Taiwan for an
international conference on constitutional re-engineering, which has
been organized by a Presidential Office panel promoting
constitutional reforms.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that the country achieved the first phase of
constitutional reforms on June 7 by abolishing the National Assembly
to allow for public referendums on future constitutional amendments,
which will give the people the final say in any proposed amendments.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Taiwan may seem to have practiced
constitutional democracy for more than 50 years, but as a matter of
fact, the system has only been in practice for no more than 20 years
because of the 38-year martial law period which followed soon after
the Republic of China Constitution was promulgated in 1947.</P>
      <P>Although seven rounds of constitutional reforms have been
launched over the past 14 years, the people are still not satisfied
with the results of the reforms, he claimed.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that most of these seven rounds of reforms were
motivated by political purposes and not participated in by the
people.</P>
      <P>As a result of such changes, the constitutional system in Taiwan
appears "outlandish, " Chen claimed. He noted that the system is
neither a presidential system, semi-presidential system nor
parliamentary system, a situation that he said has led to political
instability in the country.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he stressed, the second phase of reforms is necessary
in order to maintain national stability and competitiveness, and the
concept of deliberative democracy should be employed in the next
round of reforms to realize "true democracy."</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that constitutional reforms are
especially difficult to accomplish in Taiwan because people tend to
link them with the issue of independence or unification. Even the
government's plan to hold 10,000 seminars to invite public discussion
on the reforms has been mistaken for promoting "populism," he said.</P>
      <P>However, none of these accusations is true, he asserted, saying
he believes the second phase of reforms will succeed with the support
of the people.</P>
      <P>The next phase of reforms is expected to address issues such as
whether to change the country's political system to a presidential
system or parliamentary system; lowering the voting age from 20 to
18; and adopting a voluntary military service system.</P>
      <P>Officials have promised that the reforms will not involve
sensitive issues such as changes to the country's status, territorial
boundaries or official designation.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Thursday that it
would not be helpful for Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen to
resign over the severance of diplomatic ties between Taiwan and
Senegal.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks on the sidelines while attending a press
conference to promote the Hakka Arts Festival.</P>
      <P>Chen said Wednesday that he is prepared to step down anytime to
take responsibility for the severance of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Senegalese Foreign Minister Cheikh Tidiane Gadio signed a
communique with his Chinese counterpart Li Zhaoxing in Beijing
Tuesday on the resumption of diplomatic ties between their two
countries. Senegal switched its diplomatic recognition from Beijing
to Taipei in 1996.</P>
      <P>The premier said that officials "don't have to resign for
everything," adding that "it is not the most correct approach."</P>
      <P>"The more urgent task is to pinpoint the political
responsibility," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said his Cabinet will first investigate to see whether any
officials are responsible for negligence leading to the severance of
diplomatic ties or if there are any flaws in policy-making.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Michel Lu said
that ROC Ambassador to Senegal Huang Yun-cheh will return home in
three days.</P>
      <P>Lu said that in line with international practice, the two
countries will close their embassies within one month.</P>
      <P>After cutting diplomatic relations with Senegal, the ministry has
asked Taiwan's overseas missions to be on high alert against China's
efforts to "undermine" Taiwan's relations with its other diplomatic
allies, Lu added.</P>

      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh presided over a
ceremony to introduce the 2005 A-Ha Hakka Arts Festival Thursday,
which will include a series of Hakka art performances around the
island over the next month.</P>
      <P>Lee Yung-teh, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Hakka
Affairs, noted that the organizer of this year's Hakka art festival
will also invite world-renowned violinist Lin Cho-liang to play the
newest Hakka music written by composer Chen Chien-tai.</P>
      <P>This year's Hakka art festival, the third of its kind, will
feature some 115 performing groups touring Taiwan to put on shows at
some 25 locations around the island.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the Hakka arts festival will not only focus on
Hakka art, noting that it will also serve as a platform for different
ethnic groups to appreciate one another's cultures.</P>
      <P>Lee also revealed that Premier Hsieh has applied to participate
in a Hakka language certification test, a move that Lee said shows
"the premier's appreciation for Hakka culture."</P>
      <P>The Chen Shui-bian administration has attached much importance to
the development of the island's various cultures, including those of
the Hakka and aboriginal people, since his first inauguration in
2000. The country's first television station broadcast entirely in
the Hakka dialect began operations in July 2003, and the first
television station for Taiwan's indigenous people went on air in July
this year.</P>
      <P>At the opening ceremony, Hsieh noted that the artistic level of
the Hakka people is quite high. He later played a Hakka traditional
song with a flute.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the "2005 A-Ha Hakka Arts Festival" will begin
with a performance by several Hakka singers, bands and dance troupes
in Pingtung, southern Taiwan, Nov. 5, while a performance by
violinist Lin cho-liang and Evergreen Symphony Orchestra will

    <HEADLINE>PFP TRYING TO AMEND LAW ON LEGISLATIVE POWER TO QUESTION PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shu-bian and former
Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Chen Che-nan could be
called to the legislature for questioning about their roles in the
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) scandal if the People First
Party succeeds in amending a law governing the Legislative Yuan's
investigative power.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus convener Huang Yi-chiao said Thursday that
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng has agreed to let lawmakers
deliberate his party's proposal to amend the law governing the
legislature's investigative power on Nov. 8.</P>
      <P>According to a decision by the Council of Grand Justices on Dec.
15, 2004, the legislature has the authority to call witnesses and
read all related documents when investigating a major scandal, Huang
said.</P>
      <P>He quoted "quite a number of TV critics" as alleging that Chen
Shui-bian, his family and close aides have been suspected of taking
bribes or being involved in other corruption cases, adding that the
Presidential Office has reacted as if nothing has happened.</P>
      <P>Huang said the Kuomintang (KMT) has agreed to support the PFP
motion to amend the law governing the legislature's exercise of
power. He added that his caucus is seeking support from the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
which form the "pan-green camp."</P>
      <P>If the "pan-green" parties try to block the amendment efforts,
they will be reasonably suspected of attempting to cover up a long
series of high-level corruption cases, Huang added.</P>
      <P>Once the legislature is given the power to call witnesses for
questioning, the president, Chen Che-nan, Premier Frank Hsieh and
former Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yih, now a KMT legislator, will be
invited to answer questions at the legislature regarding their roles
in the KRTC scandal, he said.</P>
      <P>When Huang and his PFP colleagues called at the DPP caucus, they
were greeted by Lee Chin-yi, director of the caucus office, who said
he could not promise anything.</P>
      <P>The PFP caucus received better treatment at the caucus office of
the TSU, whose convener Ho Min-hao and deputy convener Huang
Shih-chuo greeted them with oranges, urging the "orange" party
(referring to the PFP whose logo is orange-colored) to "turn green"
and agree to the TSU's proposal for amending the constitution by
changing the official name of the country from "the Republic of
China" to "the Republic of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Ho said the TSU supports any effort to investigate corruption
cases and strike at criminals, but the legislature's investigative
power should be granted in the context of a new constitutional
framework.</P>
      <P>Prior to that, the PFP should agree to review the president's
nominations of Control Yuan members so that the Control Yuan can work
normally, including probing corruption cases involving ranking
officials, Ho added.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Hsieh Kuo-liang said it would have been easy for
judicial investigators to check the exit and entry records to find
out how many times Chen Che-nan and other suspects have gone abroad,
and yet Chen kept lying about the matter while the prosecution dared
not question him on it.</P>
      <P>The legislator called on the prosecution and police authorities
to protect independent lawmaker Chiu Yi and TV talk show host Lee Tao
because they had unveiled alleged "evidence" showing that Chen had
lied and, he claimed, the authorities might attempt to assassinate
them.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The launch of Asia's first radio frequency
identification (RFID) testing facilities in Taiwan is expected to
reinforce the country's pivotal position in the Asia-Pacific supply
chains and enhance the international competitiveness of Taiwan's RFID
industry, officials said.</P>
      <P>The Pacific RFID Performance Solutions, established by the
Hsinchu-based Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) to test
the readability of products tagged with the electronic product code
(EPC), started operations on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>It is one of the first four testing facilities, and the only one
in Asia, that has been accredited by EPCglobal Inc., the U.S.-based
non-profit organization that promotes the commercial adoption of the
EPC in global supply chains.</P>
      <P>RFID is an automatic identification method that relies on storing
and remotely retrieving data using devices called RFID tags.</P>
      <P>According to ITRI President Johnsee Lee, Taiwan has gained an
edge over its competitors in the region following the establishment
of the testing center, and the center will participate in the
enactment of international standards on RFID applications in the

world.</P>
      <P>Chang Po-kuang, head of the Avionics Systems Department under the

    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Thursday that the DPP insists that
official or government-authorized cross-strait dialogue be held on a
possible visit to Taiwan by Beijing's top official in charge of
Taiwan affairs, Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>Chen, director of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, has been invited
by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to visit Taiwan in mid-December to
attend an economic and trade forum hosted by the party.</P>
      <P>DPP Deputy Secretary-General Andes Yen said that Chen could be
the highest-ranking Chinese official in charge of relations with
Taiwan to ever visit to Taiwan and therefore the issue should not be
considered as a simple event involving just the KMT and Communist
Party of China (CPC).</P>
      <P>Instead, Yen said, Chen's visit will be a matter of great
security and safety concern, necessitating official consultations
across the strait or at least prior arrangements made by
government-authorized intermediary bodies such as Taipei's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Beijing's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Yen said that if a Chinese official as high-ranking as Chen is to
visit Taiwan, the government will certainly accord high-level
security protection to him and should prevent a similar accident from
recurring as the one involving the death of a Beijing official in
Taipei in September. Zhu Xiangdong, a deputy director of China's
National Bureau of Statistics, died of heart failure while taking a
hot spring bath on Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei Sept. 2.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yen questioned the appropriateness of the KMT's
invitation to Chen for the KMT-CPC forum, an event the KMT claims as
"between parties." Quoting the Statute Governing the Relations
Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, Yen said
that "party-to-party exchanges" as claimed by the KMT is not listed
in the 19 "professional exchanges" programs stipulated in the
statute.</P>
      <P>This means that the holding of the KMT-CPC forum in Taiwan might
be illegal, Yen said.</P>
      <P>Yen added that the KMT's willingness to be "a Taiwan agent of the
CPC" is one thing but Taiwan's dealing with such a visit according to
the law is another. He called for the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
-- Taiwan's top China policy planner -- not to budge on Taiwan's
stance on Chen's visit.</P>
      <P>A KMT spokesman said last week that the KMT-run National Policy
Foundation is expected to file for a permit from the MAC shortly to
pave the way for Chen and some 50 others from China to take part in
the economic cooperation forum slated to be held in Taipei in
mid-December.</P>
      <P>The forum will be the first of its kind co-sponsored by the KMT
and the CPC since the KMT fled to Taiwan in 1949.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) has urgently
purchased three tons of shikimic acid, a raw material made in China
used to produce the avian influenza-fighting drug Tamiflu.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Ho Sheng-mao said that with the rising global alarm
over bird flu, Tamiflu is in short supply and the price of shikimic
acid has also soared, adding that this batch of shikimic acid was
double the price of the last one and could be even higher in the
future.</P>
      <P>Ho made the remarks after Premier Frank Hsieh revealed earlier in
the day that the government has negotiated a good price to purchase 
three tons of raw materials that can be used to make enough Tamiflu
for 2.3 million people, or about 10 percent of Taiwan's population.</P>
      <P>The government will now try to gain authorization to mass produce
Tamiflu from its patent holder, Roche Pharmaceuticals, Hsieh said,
setting a timetable to mass produce the influenza medicine from the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chao Yu-chu, father of President Chen
Shui-bian's son-in-law, went to the Taipei Prosecutor's Office
Thursday to file defamation suits against an independent lawmaker and
a political commentator.</P>
      <P>Chao, a retired school principal, went to court after Legislator
Chiu Yi claimed that Chen Che-nan, a former Presidential Office
deputy secretary-general, went with a "retired school principal who
is closely related to the Presidential Office" to Thailand in
November 2004, and that the principal is the "influential figure" in
the suspected Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) profiteering
scandal.
</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan is currently in hot water due to his
alleged involvement in the snowballing scandal involving the mass
rapid transit system in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.
</P>
      <P>Chiu and a political commentator, Hu Chung-hsin, have for several
days been casting allegations in a TV talk show. They displayed a
photo Wednesday showing Chen Che-nan and Chen Min-hsien, former
KRTC vice chairman, gambling in a South Korean casino Nov. 2, 2002.</P>
      <P>Chao claimed that he never went with Chen Che-nan to Thailand and
that if Chiu has lied, he should step down to take responsibility.</P>
      <P>Chao also delivered a three-point statement after filing the
lawsuit.</P>
      <P>Chao said that he is not the retired principal in question and
that he has never gone overseas with Chen Che-nan, nor has he spoken
with former Council of Labor Affairs Chen Chu. He said he "filed the
lawsuit because he can no longer tolerate their frivolous
accusations." Chen Chu reportedly said that an "influential figure"
was involved in the hiring of foreign laborers for the MRT system.</P>
      <P>The MRT construction scandal came to light in the wake of a
series of irregularities exposed after Thai laborers working for the
project rioted Aug. 21 to protest against their harsh management and
exploitation.</P>
      <P>A Supreme Prosecutor Office's investigation found that Chen
Che-nan entered Thailand July 6, 2002 and Nov. 11, 2004.</P>

      <P>In response to foreign business community
criticism of excessive government regulations, an official said
Wednesday that the government is willing to review its policy and
urged the European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) to come forth
with details.</P>
      <P>Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Vice
Chairman Thomas M.F. Yeh made the comment after the ECCT said in its
annual position paper issued earlier the same day that excessive
government regulations have hindered Taiwan's economic development
and undermined the country's competitiveness regionally and globally.</P>
      <P>The government is happy to hear proposals by foreign companies,
but they should point out and elaborate on what they called excessive
government regulations or on which agencies have over-regulated to
the extent that they have affected the country's economic
development, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Citing the latest survey made recently by the Business
Environment Risk Intelligence (BERI) , Yeh said that Taiwan is the
world's fifth-best in terms of overall investment climate, after
Switzerland, Singapore, Holland and Japan, among the 50 countries
surveyed.</P>
      <P>The BERI report also ranks Taiwan in the 1A category, which Yeh
said means that investment and currency exchange risks in Taiwan are
low and that the country is a good place in which to invest.</P>
      <P>ECCT Chairman Sager Dirk said that he is worried that many
European companies are choosing to move out of Taiwan and that should
its government fail to address key issues in time to maintain its
competitive edges, such as excessive government regulations and
Taiwan's abnormal trade and economic relations with China, it will
lose even more.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's representative office in Japan has
been negotiating with the Japanese authorities over a Taiwanese
fishing boat that allegedly operated in disputed waters northeast of
a Japanese island group, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman
Michel Lu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lu said the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) has also sent a
patrol boat to meet up with the Taiwanese fishing boat Tsengchinshun
No. 168, which was finally intercepted by a Japanese patrol ship
around 4: 25 p.m. Thursday for interrogation after being chased for
more than two days in the North Pacific for fishing in waters 240
nautical miles northeast of Japan's Ogasawara Archipelago.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan have been in a long-running dispute over their
overlapping economic zones, with many Taiwanese fishing boats being
chased away or detained while operating in waters outside the
temporary demarcation line.</P>
      <P>CGA officials said they will try to protect the safety of the
fishermen aboard the Tsengchinshun No. 168 without making concessions
or causing conflict with the Japanese side, while urging both
governments to maintain rationality in future fishing conferences.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Yueh-ying, an official of the Suao Fishery
Association in Ilan County, strongly criticized what she described as
the "hegemonic behavior" of the Japanese patrol ship, as the
Tsengchinshun No. 168 was still chased after leaving the disputed
waters.</P>
      <P>Lin expressed hope that MOFA will lodge a protest with the
Japanese government against this behavior.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is forecast to exceed South Korea in
the output volume of LCD TVs for the first time this year, with an
estimated annual output of 5.61 million units compared to Korea's
4.12 million units, according to the newest tallies released by the
Institute for Information Industry (III).</P>
      <P>Taiwan's third-quarter production volume jumped by 282 percent
over the year-earlier level, although the average Q3 unit price grew
by only 0.6 percent over the Q2 average as a result of falling prices
of flat displays globally, III statistics show.</P>
      <P>In terms of production value, Q3 level reached US$790 million, a
242 percent expansion year on year and a 47 percent rise over Q2,
thanks to a marked increase in the output of large flat displays, the
same tallies show. Q3 shipments of 32-inch flat displays grew
several-fold compared to the levels of the previous two quarters.</P>
      <P>The III predicted that the world's overall output of LCD TVs for
2005 will hit 18.73 million units, up by 124.6 percent over the 2004
level. The figure will grow to 30.55 million for 2006, accounting for
some 15 percent of the entire world's television sets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANONYMOUS LETTER FUELS SPECULATION ON DPP CAMPAIGN FUNDING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An anonymous letter included in an Oct. 21
report by a five-member team of the Kaohsiung city government on
irregularities involving the Kaohsiung rapid transit railway project
is fueling speculation over how the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) obtained its campaign funding for the 2004 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>The letter, received by the civil service ethics office of the
Kaohsiung city government Dec. 2, 2002, claims that Chen Min-hsien,
vice chairman of the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) at the
time, demanded NT$100 million in "public relations fees" from each
contractor in return for helping them win their contracts, because he
wanted to muster NT$5 billion to fund President Chen Shu-bian's
election campaign.</P>
      <P>The letter further claims that the Hwang Chang General Contractor
Co. won the contract for one of the projects because the company paid
Chen Min-hsien NT$2 million in "PR fees" before the bidding. A record
of the bidding process shows that Hwang Chang's bid was 99.9 percent
accurate compared with the base price.</P>
      <P>Wang Lin-chiao, a member of the Kaohsiung city council, told
reporters Thursday that she requested a photocopy of the letter from
the ethics office but was denied.</P>
      <P>Wang said that while acting Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh Chu-lan had
assured that she would publicize all information about her
investigation into the KRTC scandal, she was actually doing
otherwise.</P>
      <P>The city councilor said she believes that what was said in the
letter is "highly credible."</P>
      <P>Yeh, who headed the five-member team during the two-week
investigation at the instruction of the president, said Thursday that
the letter has been included in the team's Oct. 21 report because the
team had investigated the matter and wanted to present the whole
picture of the investigative process.</P>
      <P>Yeh pointed out that the very presence of the letter in the
report shows that she and her team have nothing to hide. However, she
added, the public should not consider the letter as evidence of the
KRTC scandal.</P>
      <P>The irregularities involving the Kaohsiung rapid transit railway
project were exposed by an Aug. 21 riot in Kaohsiung County by Thai
laborers working on the project in protest of their maltreatment by
their employers, the KRTC, and their management, Huapan
Administration Consultant Co.</P>

tires. Both companies say Formula One helps them
sell more regular tires. But from a marketing

Bridgestone more than US$100 million, people

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of legislators from the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) pushed Thursday for a halt to the
selling of poultry either live or just slaughtered in traditional
marketplaces.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislators Cheng Yun-peng and Lin Dai-hua called for the
government to ban the culling, handling and marketing of live birds
in traditional marketplaces as one of the measures to prevent an
avian flu epidemic in Taiwan, with fears growing around the world of
a possible bird flu pandemic.</P>
      <P>Showing a video tape recording the marketing of poultry in a
Taipei traditional marketplace at a press conference, the legislators
said that the poultry trade -- in which dealers slaughter, handle and
market the poultry without wearing a face mask or any protective gear
and no refrigeration -- could be an opening for a bird flu epidemic.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that around 350 million chickens are killed and sold
in Taiwan each year and about 80 percent of these are properly
processed in slaughterhouses where refrigeration is available.</P>
      <P>Although only about 20 percent of the poultry is sold live or
just slaughtered in traditional marketplaces, they could pose an
opening in Taiwan's bird flu-response network, Cheng warned.</P>
      <P>Responding to the DPP legislators' call, Lee Yi-chian, an
official with the Animal Industry Department under the Cabinet-level
Council of Agriculture, said that the council will make efforts in
this regard and at the same time call for consumers to change their
preference for warm freshly killed poultry.</P>

      <P>An opposition Kuomintang legislator urged
the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) Thursday to study the
feasibility of allowing private companies to operate commercial
airports in an effort to help the government balance its books.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang Yu-ting proposed at a joint-committee session at
the Legislative Yuan that the CAA conduct research and come up with a
plan in six months to allow private companies to operate airports
that are only for commercial air traffic around the country,
currently numbering 18.</P>
      <P>Of the 18 airports, according to Wang, only the Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport and Kaohsiung's Hsiao-kang Airport are
profit-making, while Taipei's Sungshan Airport barely breaks even.
The rest, mostly located in offshore areas, operate in the red, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>Wang said that for security reasons, the money-losing airports
could be run by private investors while areas pertaining to public
authority power, including navigation and control towers, airport
security and quarantine affairs, could be still managed by the CAA.</P>
      <P>Wang suggested that the CAA lease one or two money-losing
airports to private operators for a period of time on a trial basis

      <P>Chen made an open apology because he did not report to President

      <P>He explained that his trip to South Korea with Chen Min-hsien,

    <HEADLINE>DPP QUESTIONS RATIONALITY OF PENSION PAYOUTS FOR EX-KMT CADRES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) lawmakers questioned Thursday the rationality of the
pension coverage for some retired civil servants for their years of
service in the Kuomintang (KMT) , which ruled Taiwan for more than
five decades until May 2000.</P>
      <P>The legislators from the DPP's Justice Alliance faction said the
previous practice of converting KMT cadres' years of service in party
posts into years of government work was a tactic designed to siphon
taxpayers' money into the KMT's coffers.</P>
      <P>Legislator Jaw Yung-ching said the Examination Yuan passed a set
of rules in 1971 to allow for the conversion of years of service in
the then-ruling KMT and its affiliates, such as the China Youth
Corps, into years of service in the government, for the benefit of
its cadres who were later transferred to government posts. The
preferential rules remained valid until 1987.</P>
      <P>"Such provisions were remnants of the previous KMT authoritarian
rule," Jaw said.</P>
      <P>Among the numerous beneficiaries of those preferential rules is
incumbent KMT Vice Chairman John Kuan, Jaw said.</P>
      <P>"When Kuan retired from public service, his 10 years of service
in the KMT was calculated into his years of service in the
government. As such, the government has to pay out millions of
additional dollars for his pension," Jaw said.</P>
      <P>Jaw said he will ask the Ministry of Civil Service under the
Examination Yuan to make an overall review of how many former KMT
officials enjoy the same privilege.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Civil Service Wu Tsung-cheng said KMT cadres who
were transferred to government posts after the above-mentioned rules
were abolished in 1987 are not eligible to receive the "conversion"
privilege.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the government handles 300-400 civil servant
retirement cases each year. Among them, only a very few are qualified
for the "conversion" privilege.</P>
      <P>In line with the principle of policy continuity or the
"non-retroactiveness" principle, Wu said, the government must still
give pension coverage for ex-KMT cadres who transferred to government
posts prior to 1987.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's corporations are more pessimistic
toward their business prospects for the next three months than before
due to seasonal factors and mostly out of fear of a possible bird flu
pandemic, the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a recent council survey of the private business and industrial
sectors' business prospects for the next three months, CEPD officials
found that only 9 percent of the respondents predicted that their
business prospects will improve in the following three months,
against 19 percent posted in July.</P>
      <P>A total of 66 percent of the respondents said the business
climate is expected to remain unchanged for the next quarter, as
compared with 65 percent who responded in this way in the July
survey.</P>
      <P>The number of respondents who anticipated that their businesses
will decline rose to 25 percent from 16 percent posted in July, CEPD
officials said, adding that the 25-percent level marked a new high
since May 2003.</P>
      <P>As a result, they added, the number of pessimists was 16
percentage points higher than the number of optimists, representing a
new high since October 2001.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials attributed the gloomy prospects to a variety of
reasons, including the anticipation of an end to the high season and
spiralling commodity and raw material prices, as well as fears of a
possible bird flu pandemic worldwide.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that most of Taiwan's private corporations
enjoyed better business performance, including sales, orders,
equipment utility and profit margins, in September compared to
August, the officials said.</P>

Oct. 25 when it was allegedly fishing in waters 240 nautical miles
northeast of Japan's Ogasawara Archipelago.</P>
      <P>"It requires further checks to determine whether the
Tsengchinshun was truly operating in Japan's economic zone, " the
official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan have been embroiled in a long-running dispute
over their overlapping economic zones, with many Taiwanese fishing
boats being chased away or detained while operating in waters outside
a temporary "demarcation line."</P>
      <P>Coast Guard Administration officials said they will try to
protect the safety of the fishermen aboard the Tsengchinshun without
making concessions or causing conflict with the Japanese side, while
urging both governments to maintain rationality in future fishery
conferences.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CASINO MAY NOT BE 'INAPPROPRIATE PLACE' FOR PUBLIC SERVANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Personnel Administration (CPA)
under the Cabinet declined to specify Thursday whether public
servants should avoid visiting casinos when they are on overseas
trips, although the Civic Service Law prohibits such functionaries
from going to "inappropriate places."</P>
      <P>Chien Shih-chung, general secretary of the CPA, pointed out that
the Civic Service Law does not provide a clear definition of
"inappropriate places."</P>
      <P>Nor does the Ministry of Civil Service under the Examination Yuan
provide any guidelines on what constitutes an "inappropriate place, "
he said.</P>
      <P>Chien expressed concern that disputes could arise if tourist
casinos, where people on sightseeing trips go for pleasure, are
deemed "inappropriate places" according to the law.</P>
      <P>The question of whether public servants are breaking the law if
they visit a casino became a subject of debate after newspapers
carried a picture Thursday showing two officials of the Presidential
Office sitting at a gambling table in a casino on Cheju Island, South
Korea, in November 2002.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO PROPOSE LAW REVISIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE INVESTIGATIVE SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will come up with draft law
revisions to forge a framework for the Legislative Yuan to exercise
its "investigative power," a DPP lawmaker said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Ker Chien-ming, who concurrently heads the DPP's
policy coordination department, said the DPP respects the spirit of a
Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) constitutional ruling of Dec. 15, 2004
that allows for the Legislative Yuan to investigate certain cases
with the consent of a majority of lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Ker said, many laws must be revised before such a
ruling can be put into practice; otherwise, he said, the
investigative power would become yet another tool for partisan
wrangling and could even infringe upon many people's human rights.</P>
      <P>If the legislature exercises the so-called "investigative power,"
Ker said, a number of statutes, including the law governing the
legislature's exercise of power, the lawmakers' code of conduct and
the law requiring public functionaries to avoid conflicts of
interest, must be amended. If all goes well, Ker said, the DPP caucus
can present a formal proposal next Monday to pave the way for
revisions to all relevant laws to regulate the Legislative Yuan's
exercise of "investigative power."</P>
      <P>According to the Constitution, "investigative power" has
traditionally rested with the Control Yuan, not the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Quoting the CGJ's No. 585 Constitutional Ruling, opposition
People First Party legislative caucus whip Huang Yi-chiao said
earlier in the day that the legislature has the authority to call
witnesses and read all related documents when investigating a major
scandal.</P>
      <P>Huang further said that Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
has agreed to let lawmakers deliberate his party's proposal to amend
the law governing the legislature's exercise of its powers Nov. 8 in
order to substantiate its "investigative power" as defined by the CGJ
in its No. 585 constitutional ruling.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>National security authorities have stepped
up preparations for the arrival of China's top tourism administrator,
industry sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shao Qiwei, director of the National Tourism Administration under
China's State Council, is scheduled to arrive in Taipei Friday for a
10-day market inspection tour.</P>
      <P>Travel sources said the National Security Council invited
officials from the Mainland Affairs Council, the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications and other relevant government
agencies to a meeting a few days ago to discuss security measures and
emergency response programs.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, security authorities would pull out all
the stops to ensure that Shao's visit proceed smoothly and safely.</P>
      <P>Shao will be visiting Taiwan in the name of president of the
Chinese National Travel Association in line with China's stance of no
official contact with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He will be accompanied by a 66-member delegation composed of
senior executives of travel associations and tourist agencies in
various Chinese provinces and cities.</P>
      <P>Shao's visit was arranged by the Taiwan Visitors Association
which has invited Taiwan's Tourism Bureau Director Hsu Wen-sheng to
attend a dinner party in honor of Shao's mission Friday evening. Hsu
will be the only Taiwan official that Shao would meet during his
visit, the association said.</P>
      <P>Shao's visit is widely seen a prelude to China allowing its
citizens to make sightseeing trips to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, travel sources said national security officials are
treating Shao's visit as a drill for a proposed visit by an even
higher-ranking Chinese official-- Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan
Affairs Office under China's State Council -- in mid-December.</P>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has filed an application for

    <HEADLINE>SWITZERLAND TO OFFER TAIWAN JUDICIAL AID IN LAFAYETTE SCANDAL PROBES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Swiss Federal Commission approved
Thursday the handover of bank files to foreign judicial authorities
concerning the controversial sale of French warships to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Swiss commission rejected an appeal by fugitive Taiwanese
arms broker Andrew Wang -- who is suspected of organizing massive
rake-offs -- to stop judicial cooperation with Taiwan, France, and
Liechtenstein.</P>
      <P>A French judicial investigation was opened in 2001 into claims
that a large part of the US$2.8 billion paid by Taiwan for the six
Lafayette-class frigates in 1991 went on commissions to middlemen,
politicians and military officers in Taiwan, China and France.</P>
      <P>Wang, who fled Taiwan more than 10 years ago, had claimed that
Switzerland's national interest was at stake when he argued against
allowing foreign authorities to study Swiss bank documents related to
the case.</P>
      <P>But the seven-member Swiss governing commission said that failing
to cooperate was not in Switzerland's interests.</P>
      <P>Noting that all three countries had ongoing investigations into
the Lafayette deal, the Swiss Federal Commission ruled that it was
vital for Switzerland to ensure that its financial sector was not
used for criminal purposes.</P>
      <P>The commission's decision will open the way for judicial
exchanges between Switzerland and Taiwan. It will be the first
Taiwan-Switzerland judicial aid case. For fear of offending China,
the commission said its decision doesn't constitute a diplomatic
recognition of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Last year, Switzerland's highest court decided that there was
sufficient evidence to implicate Wang in the affair and overruled his
bid to keep the bank documents under wraps.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 6 this year, the Swiss court further ruled that bank
documents relating to the Lafayette kickback case should be turned
over to Taiwan's government because its has guaranteed that it will
not invoke the death penalty against Andrew.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh gave the "no death penalty" assurances Aug.
26 and the Swiss court was satisfied, enabling the transfer of the
documents.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has charged Wang with murder, corruption, money laundering
and fraud. He was an agent in Taiwan for Thomson-CSF, the French
company that sold the frigates to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang fled Taiwan following the death of ROC Navy Captain Yin
Ching-feng, who was widely believed to have been murdered when he was
about to blow the whistle on colleagues for allegedly taking
kickbacks in the deal.</P>
      <P>The ships had all been delivered to Taiwan by the mid-1990s, and
both Switzerland and Liechtenstein have frozen funds in Wang's and
his son's accounts that are allegedly linked to the case.</P>
      <P>The investigations began when the Taiwanese authorities concluded
from the inflated price that the deal constituted a serious case of
international corruption.</P>
      <P>France, Liechtenstein and Taiwan, investigating whether the case
had violated their laws, asked the Swiss authorities to hand over the
bank documents to facilitate their investigations.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, some US$500 million remains frozen in
46 accounts with different banks in Switzerland as part of a Swiss
investigation into alleged money laundering linked to the case.
Authorities in neighboring Liechtenstein have frozen around US$27
million as part of their own investigations, the reports said.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Lee Ching-hua said earlier this
month that the government should have Wang extradited back to Taiwan
to serve as asuspect-turned-prosecution-witness to facilitate the
probe into whether any Taiwan politicians or military officials
obtained illegal kickbacks from the Lafayette deal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SAYS HE IS BEST MAN TO PUSH FOR CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
he is the best man to push for constitutional reforms as the world's
experience has shown that a re-elected president who no longer has
the pressure of running for re-election is best suited to promote
such reforms.</P>
      <P>President Chen made the remarks while attending the opening of an
international seminar on "Constitutional Re-engineering in New
Democracies -- Taiwan and the World" in Taipei. More than 200
scholars and experts at home and abroad are attending the two-day
event, which has been organized by a Presidential Office panel
promoting constitutional reforms.</P>
      <P>Chen, serving his second term since May 20, 2004, said he himself
has no pressure of running again and "regardless of who serves as the
next president in 2008, the timing to promote constitutional reforms
couldn't be better than the present."</P>
      <P>In the next two years, he will make every effort to be a
constitutional reform crusader, noting that the government will
recruit seed instructors, and hold 10,000 seminars to invite public
discussion by 2007 in a constitutional reform awareness campaign to
generate the highest level of social consensus on the scope and
procedure of the constitutional reform.</P>
      <P>He stressed the importance of his next stage of constitutional
reform, adding that he will have no preset stance on the direction of
reforms, and that he will give full support to whatever reforms
supported by the majority of the people.</P>
      <P>"By the time I complete my presidency in 2008, I hope to hand to
Taiwan a new version of our Constitution -- one that is timely,
relevant and viable," he reaffirmed.</P>
      <P>He noted that since the beginning of 1990, at least 30 countries,
including South Africa, Mongolia and Thailand have crafted new
constitutions or amended their constitutions and upgraded their
governance through constitutional re-engineering.</P>
      <P>He said that after past rounds of constitutional amendments in
1994 and 1996, the election system of the president has been changed
to popular election, and the president can appoint the premier
without the consent of the Legislative Yuan. The nation's government
system has tilted toward a presidential one, but the president has no
right to veto bills passed by the legislature and can only dissolve
the legislature after the legislature topples the Cabinet, he said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said that if the president and the majority party
in the legislature belong to two rival parties, the government could
face total paralysis.</P>
      <P>Citing the past five years which have seen endless squabbling
between the ruling and the opposition parties as an example, he said
that the nation's governance has stalled, which he asserted is
"definitely related to our Constitution which can't provide a legal
mechanism to solve political stalemates."</P>
      <P>The president stressed that there are flaws and deficiencies in
the present Constitution even after seven rounds of constitutional
amendments over more than a decade.</P>
      <P>He said the next phase of reforms is expected to address issues
such as whether to change the country's political system to a
presidential system or parliamentary system; protection of basic
human rights and the rights of the disadvantaged; defining the rights
and obligations of the central and the local governments;
streamlining the government agencies; lowering the voting age from 20
to 18; and adopting a voluntary military service system.</P>
      <P>"Even according to the most conservative estimates, more than
two-thirds of the 175 articles in the Constitution need amendment, "
he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will
pitch in with avian flu-response work in the event of an outbreak in
Taiwan, an official with Taiwan's top charter of mainland policy said
Friday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Johnnason Liu said that currently, as Taiwan is
bird flu-free but is preparing to battle a possible bird flu
pandemic, the Council of Agriculture is handling all related matters.</P>
      <P>In the event of an avian flu outbreak in Taiwan, the Department
of Health will take the helm in the bird flu-response work, with the
MAC pitching in any way that it can, Liu noted.</P>
      <P>Liu quoted reports from China as indicating that so far, bird flu
cases have been reported in Tibet, Inner Mongolia autonomous region
and six Chinese provinces including Hunan, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangsu,
Qinghai and Xinjiang.</P>
      <P>Liu added that in a bid to keep bird flu at bay, Taiwan began on
Oct. 26 to require that passengers from China, Hong Kong and Macau as
well as people entering the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu from
Fujian Province conduct a 10-day self-health monitoring program,
including daily temperature taking, after their arrival.</P>

by Swiss authorities to the island as "a tougher challenge."</P>
      <P>Wang Shih-rong, Taiwan's representative to Switzerland, made the
remarks after the Swiss Federal Council approved providing Taiwan
with legal assistance.</P>
      <P>In a press release it issued earlier in the day, the council
agreed to hand over documents to the judicial authorities of Taiwan,
France and Liechtenstein regarding the scandal. The Swiss government
also rejected Taiwan businessman Andrew Wang's administrative appeal
attempting to stop judicial cooperation among the three nations.</P>
      <P>Andrew Wang, a major suspect in the scandal, said that providing
legal assistance could go against the interests of the Central
European country.</P>
      <P>Refuting the businessman's claims, the council said that the
Swiss financial center is not used for criminal purposes, but for
improving the transparency of commercial transactions. It further
said that the scandal involves money laundering, fraud and homicide,
and also involves a criminal organization.</P>
      <P>Saying that he "feels greatly relieved" after the Swiss
government approved the hand over of documents to Taiwan, the
Republic of China diplomat also expressed his highest respect for the
Swiss government and its judicial body's spirit of venerating the law
and putting the law above politics.</P>
      <P>However, he said that the council's decision only represents the
completion of the administrative and judicial organs' procedures,
adding that the work of the next stage will be focused on how to
carry out the judicial cooperation between Taiwan and Switzerland as
well as on how to obtain evidence of Andrew Wang's crime in
connection with the scandal.</P>
      <P>As to Andrew Wang and his family members' deposit of about US$495
million in Swiss banks, which has been frozen on order by the Swiss
judges, the envoy said that "getting the illegal commissions back is
also the goal of future efforts, which will certainly be a tougher
mission."</P>
      <P>The representative also said that he will discuss with Swiss
officials on how to carry out matters related to the legal assistance
and will arrange for members of Taiwan's State Public Prosecutor
General's Office under the Ministry of Justice to discuss with their
Swiss counterparts details of implementing such assistance.</P>
      <P>Wu Ying-chao, state public prosecutor general, has said that
although his office has yet to receive official notification from the
Swiss government, it can send its prosecutors to Switzerland any time
to retrieve the relevant documents.</P>
      <P>The French company Thomson closed a deal in 1991 with Taiwan for
the sale of six frigates at a price of around US$2.5 billion.</P>
      <P>According to the Swiss judicial authorities, although a clause in
the contract expressly forbids the payment of commission, the
Taiwanese authorities concluded from the inflated price that the deal
constituted a serious case of international corruption.</P>
      <P>Taiwan submitted on Nov. 6, 2001 a request for legal assistance
from Switzerland in connection with the case on the grounds that it
involved fraud, money laundering and corruption, also according to
the Swiss judicial authorities.</P>

Wall Street Journal: Telecom Giant Gets Demands As It Negotiates
TV Deals; Cameras for Santa's Visit Lining Up 10,000 Contracts

All over the United States, Verizon is squaring off against local
governments, as it embarks on a high-stakes upgrade of much of its
network. Aiming to offer Internet, phone and tele vision services,
Verizon plans to spend up to $20 billion to lay thousands of miles of
fiber- optic wires across its East Coast service area from Maine to
Florida and into parts of Texas, California and elsewhere.
Budget-strapped local officials, who have the final say over granting
cable-TV-service franchises, are greeting the phone giant with
expensive and detailed demands. In New York state, Verizon faces
requests for seed money for wildflowers and a video hookup for
Christmas celebrations. The battle is crucial for Verizon, which is
rapidly losing its traditional customers in a new telecommunications
free-for-all. The rivals include wireless phone companies, cable
companies offering low-priced phone service, and Web companies such
as Google Inc. offering voice services via the Internet.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>SIMPLO'S BATTERY PACKS FOR NB COMPUTERS TO BECOME WORLD NO. 1 PRODUCTBy Lilian WuCNA staff writer </HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although small, Taiwan has seen quite a few
of its products make it to No. 1 on the international stage, and
Simplo Technology Co. -- a leading manufacturer of battery packs for
notebook (NB) computers -- is expected to join the ranks of Taiwan's
No. 1 products in 2006.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began to actively produce NB battery packs in the 1980s.
Because of the low threshold for capital and technology required, the
number of manufacturers mushroomed to more than 100 at one time. A
lot of smaller manufactures were eventually squeezed out because of
steep competition and the remaining, bigger manufacturers now enjoy
handsome profits.</P>
      <P>Analysts have attributed the fast growth of Taiwan's NB battery
pack manufacturers to low cost, flexibility, comprehensive service,
and logistics management, and Simplo Technology has been outstanding
in all of these.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan's NB battery packs expected to reach a more than 50
percent world market share next year, Simplo is expected to reach a
world market share of around 25 percent in 2006 from the estimated 20
percent this year, replacing Sanyo of Japan to become the No. 1 in the
world.</P>
      <P>Simplo, which until 1998 was a money-losing company, has seen its
drastic transformation in a short time due to a number of key
factors, including its high quality, punctual delivery, flexible
production support and overall service, and last but not least, its
president and chairman, Raymond Sung.</P>
      <P>Sung, 56, worked at several U.S. companies, including Ampex
Electronics, AST and Kingston Technology, for a quarter of a century,
before joining Simplo.</P>
      <P>Being content with "playing second-fiddle," Sung said that he had
never thought of serving in his present position until "a good friend
of mine came with the offer and I accepted it with the intention of
testing my limits."</P>
      <P>Sung said that when he came to the company in 1998, he found that
the company has a solid basis in terms of battery pack technology,
what seemed to be lacking, however, was a systematic management
approach, and which "happened to be my advantage."</P>
      <P>Sung often told his staff that they should not say that something
is " impossible," adding, "I'm a man who can accept trial and error,
but they should never say impossible before trying something."</P>
      <P>Before entering Simplo, Sung said that he had mostly dealt with
Japanese customers, and he said that Simplo's entrepreneurial culture
must be the "efficiency of Americans and work ethnic of the
Japanese."</P>
      <P>He pointed out two major turning points in the company, saying
that before 1999, the company had focused on original equipment
manufacturering (OEM), mainly for Matsushita of Japan. But he knew at
the time that if the company stuck to OEM, it would have limited
growth and development.</P>
      <P>This was why Simplo set up a research and development team in
1999 and moved toward original design manufacturering (ODM). In 2000,
Simplo obtained orders from local second-tier NB computer
manufacturers, laying a solid basis for getting orders from the
top-notch NB computer manufacturers such as Acer and Quanta.</P>
      <P>The second turning point for Simplo was receiving orders from HP
in the fourth quarter of 2002, which was a major milestone, Sung
said, because it symbolized the recognition of an internationally
renowned company. Dell then joined HP to be Simplo's leading
customers, he said.</P>
      <P>In view of growing demands as well as cutting production costs,
Simplo has moved its assembly lines to China. Its Shanghai complex
began construction in early 2002 and the second factory in the
complex was completed last year.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the revenues of Simplo have continued to grow,
topping NT$1.1 billion in September, or a new high for three
consecutive months. The revenues in the first nine months have
totaled NT$7.75 billion (US$2.31 billion), up 18 percent from
the same period the previous year and far ahead of its financial
estimate.</P>
      <P>Japan and Taiwan have been two strongholds of battery packs for
global NB computers. Taiwan's production of battery packs for NB
computers accounts for a global market share of around 40 percent
this year, still lower than 60 percent for Japan.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the production of Taiwan manufacturers will
continue to grow, and will account for a world market share of more
than 50 percent, while Japan will slip to below 50 percent.</P>
      <P>Simplo has set the goal of producing 11 million units of battery
packs for this year, and 15 million units next year, with a world
market share of 25 percent in 2006.</P>
      <P>The nation's Industrial Technology Research Institute has
estimated that Taiwan will produce between 56 million and 58 million
units of NB computers this year, and 68 million units next year.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the steady growth of the NB computer industry, battery
pack manufacturers are expected to continue to prosper, industrial
analysts said.</P>

      <P>The Presidential Office will refer Chen
Che-nan, one of its former deputy secretary-generals, to the Control
Yuan for punishment for visiting South Korea in 2002 without asking
for leave, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun said that Chen
might have violated the Public Service Act.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, President Chen Shui-bian is very unhappy with
Chen Che-nan's behavior, which the president has said is unlawful and
especially inappropriate for a political appointee.</P>
      <P>At the center of a profiteering scandal surrounding the hiring of
Thai workers for the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit project, Chen
Che-nan admitted Thursday that he traveled to Cheju, South Korea in
November 2002 with Chen Min-hsien, then vice chairman of the
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC).</P>
      <P>However, Chen Che-nan denied the trip was related to the KRTC's
plan to make use of Korean experience in hiring Thai workers.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan, who had previously denied having traveled overseas
with KRTC officials, made the confession following the broadcasting
on local TV of a picture showing him and Chen Min-hsien appearing in
a casino on Cheju island on Nov. 2,
2002.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan became a national policy adviser to the president in
2004, while Chen Min-hsien had been an adviser to the president since
2002. Both resigned from their posts on Oct. 5 after judicial
authorities launched a probe into their roles in the scandal, which
surfaced in the wake of a Aug. 21 riot by a group of Thai workers
against exploitation and ill-treatment by their management.</P>
      <P>Also on Friday, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Su Tseng-chang said the party's Central Standing Committee
will meet Saturday night to discuss what disciplinary measures to
take against Chen Che-nan.</P>
      <P>Su said that the DPP will deal with the case with the highest
standards and will consider handing down the sternest possible
punishment, namely an expulsion.</P>
      <P>Su said any party members who broke the law or behaved
dishonestly would blemish the DPP's image.</P>
      <P>The party's investigative panel is expected to release its report
on the case in a couple of days, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a group of DPP legislators demanded that Chen Che-nan
voluntarily resign from the party ahead of the investigative
proceedings to protect the party's image.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun, a leader of the DPP legislative caucus, said the
DPP adopted the highest moral standards towards its members and that
Chen Che-nan must be responsible to his own behavior.</P>
      <P>He also said the former presidential aide should make a public
explanation and apology for visiting a casino.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of HIV carriers aged between 15
and 24 in Taiwan has been increasing on a year-on-year basis, posing
an increasing challenge toward the country's AIDS prevention efforts,
officials from the National Youth Commission said Friday.</P>
      <P>The HIV incidence rate among those aged between 15 and 24 in 1989
was 0.0008 percent, but the proportion had increased to 0.2081
percent by 2002, Youth Commission officials said.</P>
      <P>By 2002, the number of HIV carriers aged between 15 and 24
constituted roughly one-fifth of all HIV carriers in Taiwan, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>Ninety-eight percent of those found HIV positive aged between 15
and 24 said that they had become infected via sexual intercourse and
most of them were heterosexual, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>The statistics showed that sex education and gender relations
were some of the most pressing issues facing the country's young men
and women, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials quoted results of a recent opinion poll conducted
by the commission which indicated that the average age for first-time
sex was 17 in the Taiwan area, with nearly 50 percent of this group
having taken no safe-sex or birth-control precautions.</P>
      <P>Also quoting results of a recent survey conducted by the Ministry
of the Interior, the officials said that some 24,000 young women aged
below 20 and unmarried, had abortions in 2002, with about half of
them using RU486 to induce early-term abortions.</P>

      <P>The scale of Taiwan's online shopping
market stood at NT$38.9 billion (US$1.158 billion) in 2004, and the
figure is likely to exceed NT$90 billion for 2006, according to the
Market Intelligence Center under the Institute for Information

      <P>The top three most popular items purchased over the Internet are
books and magazines, computers and other hi-tech products and beauty
care goods, the center reported, adding that on-line shops have
become very popular in Taiwan in recent years thanks to cheaper
product prices, easy and convenient access and home delivery
services.</P>
      <P>The public are also gaining greater confidence in online
shopping, as more and more "bricks and mortar" shops have opened
on-line branches and as supply logistics for the online shops have
increasingly come of age, a business insider said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TEAM READY TO GO TO SWITZERLAND OVER FRIGATE  SALE INFORMATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>State Public Prosecutor General Wu
Ying-chao said Friday that he has yet to receive formal notification
from Switzerland concerning the handover of bank files concerning the
controversial sale of French warships to Taiwan, but his team is
ready to pick up the information at any time.</P>
      <P>Wu, who is leading a team investigating the case,
made the remarks upon hearing the news that the Swiss Federal
Council approved Thursday the handover of files and rejected
an appeal by fugitive Taiwanese arms agent Andrew Wang to stop
judicial cooperation with Taiwan, France, and Liechtenstein.</P>
      <P>Wang was an agent in Taiwan for Thomson-CSF, the French firm that
sold six Lafayette frigates to Taiwan for US$2. 8 billion. He fled
Taiwan following the death of an R.O.C. Navy captain, Yin Ching-feng,
who was widely believed to have been murdered when he was about to
blow the whistle on colleagues for allegedly taking kickbacks in the
deal.</P>
      <P> d</P>
      <P>Noting that Premier Frank Hsieh had assured the Swiss in August
that Wang would not face the death penalty as a result of any
prosecution in the case, which had enabled the transfer of the
documents, Wu said that his task force has since been preparing to
travel to Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Though there is no extradition agreement between Taiwan and
Switzerland, Taiwan is not ruling out the possibility of extraditing
Wang back to Taiwan for trial, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has charged Wang with murder, corruption, money laundering
and fraud. Both Switzerland and Liechtenstein have frozen funds in
Wang's and his son's accounts that are allegedly linked to the case.</P>
      <P> d</P>
      <P>The investigations began when the Taiwanese authorities concluded
from the inflated price that the deal constituted a serious case of
international corruption.</P>
      <P>France, Liechtenstein and Taiwan, investigating whether the case
had violated their laws, asked the Swiss authorities to hand over the
bank documents to facilitate their investigations.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, nearly US$500 million remains frozen
in 46 accounts with different banks in Switzerland as part of a Swiss
investigation into alleged money laundering linked to the case.
Authorities in neighboring Liechtenstein have frozen around US$27
million as part of their own investigations, the reports said.</P>
      <P>A French judicial investigation was opened in 2001 into claims
that a large part of the US$2. 8 billion paid by Taiwan for the six
Lafayette-class frigates in 1991 went on commissions to middlemen,
politicians and military officers in Taiwan, China and France.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR TO DE-LINK SISTER CITY TIES FROM DIPLOMATIC TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that
Taipei will try to maintain sister city relations with foreign cities
regardless of whether there are diplomatic ties between Taiwan and
the concerned countries.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at a press conference held on the 2005 Taipei
International Healthy Cities Conference, which is set to take place
Oct. 29-31.</P>
      <P>Leaders of nearly 50 cities are expected to attend the event, who
include the vice mayor of the Senegalese capital of Dakar.</P>
      <P>Taiwan severed diplomatic relations with Senegal on Tuesday after
the African nation restored diplomatic ties with China.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, sister city relations should be separate from
diplomatic relations so that Taipei can win more friends.</P>
      <P>Ma also said he had been promoting exchanges between Taipei and
foreign cities but had not expanded the number of Taipei's sister
cities because he believed the establishment of sister city relations
was not the only way to enhance exchanges.</P>
      <P>For example, Ma said, Taipei maintains close relations with Tokyo
and Yokohama although they are not Taipei's sister cities.</P>
      <P>Asked why no leaders from Chinese cities has been invited to
participate in the conference, Teng Su-wen, deputy head of Taipei's
Department of Health, said the city government had asked if Shanghai
and Suzhou were interested in the event but both cities said it might
not be convenient for them to attend.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that China tends to avoid taking part in
multilateral activities in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TVBS TO BE FINED FOR NOT REPORTING CHANGES OF STOCK OWNERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One day after a local cable station exposed
former adviser to the president Chen Che-nan as a liar, it was fined
for failing to report a change in its stock ownership in time.</P>
      <P>On Thursday a photo, which appeared to be of Chen Che-nan visiting a
casino on Cheju island in South Korea in 2002, was aired by TVBS a
cable TV broadcaster, causing great embarrassment for the government
and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) after Chen Che-nan had
denied making a visit to South Korea at the time.</P>
      <P>On Friday, Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Pasuya
Yao announced that the station was facing a fine for failing to
notify changes in its ownership when it applied for renewal of its
licence in Taiwan earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The amount of the fine would be NT$200,000 (US$5,951).</P>
      <P>If, however, TVBS had been found to be deliberately keeping the
GIO in dark about the change of its ownership, Yao said the GIO might
even suspend its licence to operate in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also said he would consult the Mainland Affairs Council about
the question of whether Leung Nai Pang, a retired official of the
Hong Kong government, could serve as TVBS' chairman. Yao made the
statement after two DPP lawmakers accused TVBS of being financed
totally by capital from China and harboring a design to topple the
DPP administration.</P>
      <P>They also claimed Leung, as a retired Hong Kong government
official, was not qualified to serve as the chairman of a company in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>TVBS has irritated DPP lawmakers for aggressively investigating
the scandal surrounding construction of the Kaohsiung mass rapid
transit in which Chen Che-nan is involved.</P>
      <P>As an former confidant of President Chen Shui-bian, Chen Che-nan
has been accused by his critics of playing a leading role in the
scandal. It has been alleged that his trip to Cheju was at the
expense of businessmen who profited from corruption in the
construction project.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TO HOLD TOP-LEVEL MEETING ON AVIAN FLU NEXT WEEK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
he will convene a National Security Council meeting next week to map
out strategies against apossible avian influenza pandemic.</P>
      <P>Chen unveiled the plan when receiving American Enterprise
Institute President Christopher DeMuth at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>That will be the second meeting of its kind in the past three
months after avian flu began to be seen as a serious public health
threat after taking many lives in other countries, especially in
Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was badly damaged by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS) outbreaks in 2003, Chen said, noting that the painful lesson
learned then was the reason why he called a top-level national
security meeting in mid-August to discuss ways to strengthen the
nation's preparations against a possible avian flu outbreak.</P>
      <P>Chen added that how to fight avian flu effectively has become the
world's No. 1 public health issue.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan's representative to the 2004 informal leadership
meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, Lee
Yuan-tseh, brought up the avian flu issue during the meeting, but it
received little attention then.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has appointed Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
to attend this year's APEC summit on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Wang is expected to bring up the issue when the summit convenes
in Busan, South Korea Nov. 18-19, the president said.</P>
      <P>Against the backdrop, Chen said he will invite Wang to take part
in the next week's meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKER URGES PRESIDENT TO STOP TALKING AND LISTEN TO SUPPORTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  28  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Friday urged President Chen Shui-bian to stop
giving campaign speeches from his bullet-proof truck and instead
begin listening to the voices of discontent and impatience from DPP
supporters concerning the nation's current state of affairs.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Weng-chung, whose statement calling for
self-reflection won support from more than 70 DPP lawmakers earlier
this month, stressed at a press conference that the self-reflection
process must begin with heeding what the people have to say.</P>
      <P>Lee made the appeal to the president amid wide publicity about a
profiteering scandal that has implicated Presidential Office Deputy
Secretary-General Chen Che-nan, who resigned early this month over
his role in controversial hiring practices and exploitation of Thai
workers by companies involved in the construction of the Kaohsiung
mass rapid transit system.</P>
      <P>Despite Chen Che-nan's repeated denials of his involvement in the
scandal, a photo publicized by news media Thursday provided hard
evidence of his close relationship with the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit
Corp. (KRTC) and manpower brokers who hired more than 1,400 Thai
laborers for the KRTC.</P>
      <P>Lee demanded an apology from those in power who gave Chen Che-nan
the Presidential Office post. Although the DPP legislator did not
specify who should apologize to the nation, he was obviously
referring to the president.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the DPP's anti-corruption commission and
central advisory committee should take swift actions about Chen
Che-nan's role in the scandal.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Chen Che-nan should be stripped of his DPP
membership, Lee said he was not opposed to the idea, but added that
it was up to the Central Advisory Committee to make the decision.</P>
      <P>Lee acknowledged that the new evidence about Chen Che-nan's close
relationship with labor brokers was making it even more difficult for
DPP candidates to fight an already uphill campaign for the Dec. 3
elections of mayors, magistrates, city and county councilors, and
township chiefs.</P>
      <P>He urged the government and the DPP to each promulgate a strict
code of conduct governing the behavior of government officials and
DPP office holders in their association with businesspeople.</P>
      <P>In his statement on Oct. 5, Lee supported a new DPP movement to
revive the party's core values amid public criticism that the DPP was
becoming corrupt faster than the Kuomintang it replaced as the ruling
party in 2000. The movement failed to materialize after the DPP
leadership backed a reform agenda announced by the president.</P>
      <P>The DPP government is plagued by a number of its officials being
involved in corruption scandals, including stock market insider
trading by the head of the Financial Supervisory Commission, who also
leaked information to his stock-trader friends, and the profiteering
scandal brought to light by the Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers working
on the Kaohsiung rapid transit project in protest at inhumane
treatment by their employers and management.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA TIMES EXPRESS TO CLOSE AT END OF THIS MONTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China Times Express, one of the two major
evening newspapers in Taiwan, will close at the end of this month
after more than 17 years in the media market, its president Chen
Kuo-hsiung announced Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the evening newspaper has been suffering from
financial difficulties since last year and has tried every possible
method to try to boost revenues.</P>
      <P>It even negotiated a merger with its main rival -- the United
Evening News -- to try to save it, Chen said, but due to a lack of
confidence in the prospects for evening newspapers, as well as a
sluggish stock market and economy, it has decided to scrap the
cooperation deal and close the newspaper, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The management of the China Times Group called all Express
employees to attend an afternoon meeting where group chairman
Yu Chien-hsin announced the paper's closure and explained the
preferential severance package for the staff.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the various departments in the group will do their
best to accommodate some of the newspaper's staff, adding that 55
percent of the staff at the editorial department of the China Times
Express will remain in the group.</P>
      <P>The last edition of the Express will roll off the presses for the
last time on Oct. 31 with a commemorative retrospective issue.</P>
      <P>China Times Express was founded March 5, 1988, and saw its
glory days during the years of the stock market boom when
a wide readership was eager to see the latest stock news in
the evening newspaper after the stock market closed at 1:30 p.m.</P>
      <P>But in recent years, the newspaper has seen its position
erode because of steep competition from electronic media which
can provide real-time information as well as the onslaught of
tabloid-style newspapers.</P>
      <P>Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairman Lee Ying-yuan said Friday
that the CLA will keep close tabs on developments surrounding the
closure of the newspaper.</P>
      <P>Lee was responding to questions by Legislator Hsu Shao-ping of
the opposition Kuomintang concerning whether the abrupt announcement
by the China Times Group has violated the regulation concerning
large-scale layoffs, asking the CLA to assure the rights of those
staff who are not leaving voluntarily.</P>
      <P>Lee said that as far as he knew, exchanges between the
management and labor representatives seemed to be amiable so far, and
the Council hoped that both sides could work out differences.

If there were disputes, it was up to the Taipei City
Government's Bureau of Labor Affairs to intervene in the first
instance, Lee said, adding that the CLA would "follow closely the
future development of the matter."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday that he has
ordered the Ministry of Justice to investigate allegations that
prosecutors leaked details concerning their investigation into the
suspected Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) scandal.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was responding to recent moves by independent Legislator
Chiu Yi, who has released through the media what he called evidence
relating to the scandal and claimed that he obtained the information
from prosecutorial and investigative authorities.</P>
      <P>The evidence included a picture showing former Presidential
Office Deputy Secretary-General Chen Che-nan appearing in a Casino
together with then KRTC Vice Chairman Chen Min-hsien in Cheju, South
Korea on November 2, 2002. The pair are under investigation for
alleged profiteering in the hiring of Thai workers for the Kaohsiung
mass rapid transit project.</P>
      <P>Hsieh told lawmakers during an interpolation session in the
Legislative Yuan that if what Chiu said were true, it would undermine
the credibility of the prosecutorial and investigative authorities,
which are supposed to keep their investigation secret.</P>
      <P>If the claim were false, Chiu could be charged with slander and
insulting a government agency, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin said he had assigned State
Public Prosecutor General Wu Ying-chao and Bureau of Investigation
Director Yeh Cherng-maw to look into the matter.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also accused those who had made allegations via the media
of trying to influence and interfere in the investigation now being
conducted by prosecutorial and investigative authorities</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, many legislators from the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" had also tried to peddle their influence in the
hiring of Thai workers for the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit project.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tu Wen-ching said
at least 30 legislators were involved in the case and that most of
them were from the opposition Kuomintang and People First Party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPENING TO CHINESE TOURISTS BENEFICIAL TO TAIWAN: CEPD OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opening Taiwan to Chinese tourists will
increase the country's tourist revenue and help inject momentum to
Taiwan's economy, Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) Vice Chairman Thomas M. F. Yeh said Friday.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that the government was poised to make the opening to
tourists from China and that the possible negative impact of the
measure, such as the mass absconding of Chinese tourists in Taiwan,
would be minimized as long as the government tackled the issue
cautiously.</P>
      <P>Yeh's comments came after Chinese National Tourism Administration
Director Shao Qiwei arrived in Taiwan earlier the same day for a
10-da y visit at the head of a 66-member delegation to explore
Taiwan's tourist market in preparation for the much-anticipated entry
of Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of the Taiwan Visitors Association, Shao came
here in his private capacity as Chinese National Travel Association
president in line with Beijing's stance of no official contacts with
Taiwan due to the delicate relationship between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh announced in May this year that the
government was to allow as many as 1,000 tourists per day from China
to come to Taiwan for sightseeing. In the past, only Chinese people
living abroad or coming from a third country or area were permitted
to visit Taiwan. But China has so far failed to add Taiwan to its
list of approved overseas travel destinations.</P>
      <P>In the face of the daily ceiling imposed by Taiwan, Chinese tour
operators suggested Taiwanese counterparts design fine quality tours
with versatile features for Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>As the number of potential Chinese tourists is much larger than
Taiwan's set limit, they proposed that the Taiwan tourism industry
adopt a "lean and mean" strategy to receive upscale visitors from
China.</P>
      <P>To attract top Chinese tourists over the long term, Taiwan tour
operators must provide especially designed high-end products to fend
off a price war, they contended, pointing out that "Taiwan should
show something different to Chinese tourists."</P>
      <P>Should Taiwan be capable of taking in around 400,000 tourists
from China each year, their travel experience would be extremely
important in helping Taiwan lure more and secure continued inflows of
visitors by word of mouth, they said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct.  28 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) warned Friday that if the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) government dared to shut down cable TV broadcaster TVBS
after its call-in programs exposed a number of corrupt government
officials, the KMT would launch a campaign to recall President Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Pan Wei-kang, a KMT caucus whip, said at a press conference
Friday that TVBS had been upholding justice by unearthing corruption
in its programs during the past five months.</P>
      <P>She said government talk of revoking the license of TVBS
following the network's exposure of a photo showing two Presidential
Office officials gambling in a casino in South Korea in November 2002
prompted suspicions about what the DPP government had to fear.</P>
      <P>Kuo Su-chun, another KMT legislator, pointed out that TVBS' daily
call-in programs are watched by millions of viewers, and that
allegations by the head of the Government Information Office (GIO)
that TVBS was a network fully funded by money from China was
apparently a tactic to shift the focus of attention away from the
corruption scandals involving the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit
project.</P>
      <P>Joanna C. Lei, a KMT legislator from Taipei County, pointed out
that the newly adopted legislation providing for the establishment of
a National Communications Commission is intended to prevent the GIO
and the DPP from interfering with mass media.</P>
      <P>She said that the government should not be allowed to silence the
media, as the public prosecutors investigating the scandal do not
have the people's trust.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislators held the press conference after Premier Frank
Hsieh endorsed a suggestion by the GIO chief that a probe is
necessary to find out whether TVBS should be penalized for tax
evasion or whether the TV network is under Chinese control.</P>
      <P>The GIO chief and several DPP legislators launched their attacks
on TVBS after the TV station exposed the close relationship between a
deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office and labor brokers
who brought in more than 1,400 Thai workers for the Kaohsiung Rapid
Transit Corp. but exploited and mis-treated them, resulting in their
rioting in Kaohsiung County on Aug. 21.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A medical service team
organized by Taiwan's Chiayi Christian Hospital has provided free
medical treatment at remote Philippine villages in Sorsogon in the
past few days as a move to aid less-privileged people in the country,
Taiwan officials stationed in the Philippines said Friday.</P>
      <P>The 13-member team began its two-day medical service in the
southern province of Sorsogon on Luzon Island Wednesday. Over 1,000
local people received treatment and free medicines, while at least
five patients underwent surgical operations, a member of the group,
former Chiayi Christian Hospital president Wung Juei-yi said.</P>
      <P>Wung said that most of the patients suffered from malnutrition,
influenza, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases. The team
completely used up the medicines and medical appliances it brought
with it, he said.</P>
      <P>The province suffers from a lack of medical resources while its
people live on low incomes, a situation similar to that in Taiwan
around 30 years ago, Wung said.</P>
      <P>Members of the medical team, led by Wung, include two physicians,
one pharmacist and three nurses. Hsu Pei-yung, an official of the ROC
representative office to the Philippines, served as the guide for the
charity service-oriented trip.</P>
      <P>This was the fifth free medical service trip to the Philippines
arranged by the charity group from Chiayi, southern Taiwan.
Participants were scheduled to return to Taiwan on Oct. 30.</P>
      <P>Sorsogon, located at Luzon's southern tip, is situated around 600

received a "Type Certificate" from the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA).</P>
      <P>By securing the FAA license documentation, SSAC Chairman Kuo
Ching-chiang said, the company can now start volume production of
this new type of commercial airliner.</P>
      <P>It marks the first time in nearly 42 years that the FAA has
issued such a certificate to a new type of commercial aircraft
designed by a brand new aircraft company, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>"The acquisition of the license is of great significance to Sino
Swearingen as it will help bring more business opportunities to the
company, " Kuo said, adding that the certification also marks a new
milestone in Taiwan's aviation industry development.</P>
      <P>SSAC has received orders for 280 SJ30-2s from the United States,
Canada, Britain, Germany and Switzerland, Kuo said, adding that the
company is scheduled to deliver its first airliner to a client next
spring.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan holds a more than 95 percent stake in SSAC,
Kuo said the company has set a viable model of using Taiwan's capital
and U.S. technology to upgrade Taiwan's aviation industry.</P>
      <P>SSAC senior vice president Alfred Baumbusch said the SJ30-2 is a
high-performance commercial airliner capable of flying a distance of
2,500 nautical miles without refueling.</P>
      <P>"The SJ30-2 is the world's fastest and best performing light
business jet at the world's best price value. It has a high speed
cruise above Mach 0.83. Equally important is its long range cruise
speed of Mach 0.78 -- faster than many jets' 'high speed cruise,'" he
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>F-16 JET FIGHTERS' COMBAT CAPABILITY UNDER QUESTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The combat capability of the Republic of
China Air Force's F-16 jet fighters came under question Friday after
it was revealed that two F-16s sent to sink an overturned cargo ship
carrying a load of toxic chemicals off Hsinchu Thursday fired four
laser-guided missiles but failed to accomplish their mission.</P>
      <P>Asked how he felt about the performance of the planes' pilots at
a question and answer session of the legislature, Minister of
National Defense Li Jye said he felt bad and was "embarrassed."</P>
      <P>Li said the two fighters fired four missiles, each weighing about
2,000 pounds, but scored only one hit.</P>
      <P>He said that theoretically, a bomb of such caliber could blow a
hole in a ship the size of a basketball court. However, he admitted
that the hit failed to sink the ship, which carried a harmful
chemical and posed a hazard to fishing boats operating in nearby
waters.</P>
      <P>The defense minister said military authorities will conduct a
review of the failed mission and decide who should be held
responsible.</P>
      <P>The 3,561-ton South Korean cargo ship Samho Brother capsized Oct.
10 after a collision with the 13,629-ton TS Hongkong registered in
Liberia. All 14 crewmembers were rescued.</P>
      <P>In addition to 3,140 cubic meters of benzene, the Samho Brother
was carrying 85 tons of fuel oil and 16 tons of diesel.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SPECULATION ABOUT PRESIDENT'S ROLE IN KRTC SCANDAL REBUTTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office Friday rebutted
media speculation that President Chen Shui-bian might have been
involved or at least aware of irregularities in the hiring of Thai
workers by the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC), saying such
speculation was far-fetched and incredible.</P>
      <P>A TV talk show host displayed Thursday a duplicate copy of an
official document issued by the Executive Yuan to the Council of
Labor Affairs on Jan. 10, 2003 in which the Executive Yuan said the
agreement on direct employment of Thai laborers had been approved and
the instrument would be sent to the Presidential Office for
the information of the president.</P>
      <P>Based on the document, some TV commentators speculated that
President Chen should have been be aware or might even have been
involved in the suspected profiteering scandal brought to light by
the Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers working on the Kaohsiung mass rapid
transit project. The riot grew out of protests at unfair and unjust
treatment by the workers' employers and management.</P>
      <P>"Such speculation is far-fetched and unthinkable, " said Chen
Wen-tsung, director of the Presidential Office's Public Affairs
Department.</P>
      <P>In line with government protocol, Chen Wen-tsung said, the
Executive Yuan had consistently sent instruments of all approved
agreements, treaties or memoranda of understanding with foreign
governments to the Presidential Office to be forwarded to the
president.</P>
      <P>"Since President Chen assumed office in 2000, strenuous efforts
have been made to cut red tape. Such documents are now only sent to
the president's office," Chen Wen-tsung said.</P>
      <P>He said the document concerned was received by then-Director of
the president's office Ma Yung-cheng who is now a Presidential Office
deputy secretary-general.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-tsung also said instruments of similar labor employment
agreements signed by Taiwan with Mongolia, the Philippines and
Vietnam in the past decade have all been sent to the Presidential
Office for documentation.</P>
      <P>"This practice has been in place for decades. Speculation about
this kind of official document is far-fetched," he said.</P>

he regards them as dogs and horses, they regard him as a common
citizen; when he regards them as dirt and grass, they regard him as a
robber and enemy."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu suggested
Saturday that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) make
immediate reforms to recover its image in the wake of a string of
scandals involving government officials.</P>
      <P>Lu was referring to profiteering allegations made against former
Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Chen Che-nan in the
hiring of Thai workers for the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit project,
as well as an insider stock trading scandal involving Lee Chin-cheng,
former director of the Financial Supervisory Commission's Examination
Bureau.</P>
      <P>Chen announced a day earlier his decision to quit the DPP amid
demands from within the party that he be kicked out.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, Chen "should have resigned from the DPP earlier"
in an attempt to lessen the damage that the case has done to the
party.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the principal ideals of the DPP are to make
reforms, combat corruption and uphold social fairness and justice, Lu
said any individuals who violate these ideals are not qualified to be
DPP members.</P>
      <P>However, Lu urged the public not to speculate before the
concerned individuals are convicted.</P>
      <P>As to the possible impact of the scandals on the DPP's showing in
the Dec. 3 local elections, Lu said the DPP needs to reform itself in
the remaining month before the elections.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang said the party's Central
Standing Committee will meet later in the day to discuss disciplinary
measures against Chen, regardless of his decision to quit the party.</P>
      <P>The investigative panel formed by the DPP will also release its
report on the case in the meeting, Su said.</P>
      <P>He said that as a party of ideals and discipline, the DPP will
not tolerate any illicit conduct by its members.</P>
      <P>Also Saturday, a leading DPP legislator apologized to the public
on behalf of the DPP legislative caucus for failing to monitor the
government properly and failing to meet public expectations for the
party.</P>
      <P>Caucus leader Chen Chin-jun said the DPP will accept public
scrutiny using the highest of moral standards, and he urged the

    <HEADLINE>KMT URGED TO CONFIRM CONTROL YUAN NOMINEES</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou should instruct KMT lawmakers to screen and confirm
nominees of Control Yuan members so that the ombudsmen can monitor
any irregularities, a spokesman of the Presidential Office said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The confirmation of the nominees of the Control Yuan, the
nation's highest watchdog body, is stalled in the Legislative Yuan
because of the opposition of the KMT and its ally People First Party. </P>
      <P>Chen Wen-tzung, director of the Presidential Office's Department
of Public Affairs, made the remarks after Ma questioned earlier in
the day President Chen Shui-bian's determination to crack down on
illicit practices.</P>
      <P>Ma asked if Chen was unaware that his former aide, Chen Che-nan,
was involved in the profiteering scandal involving the mass rapid
transit construction project in Kaohsiung, adding that the
snowballing scandal has made the people lose faith in the government
and the nation's leader, causing a serious national crisis.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is also mayor of Taipei, said on the sidelines of an
international conference on healthy cities that as long as the
government does not impose obstacles, the investigators and
prosecutors will find out the truth.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen Wen-tzung said the president has been
relentless in the cracking down on unlawful deeds and has openly
announced that there is no "bottom line" in the crackdown.</P>
      <P>The president told Chen Che-nan, a former Presidential Office
deputy secretary-general and a national policy adviser, to resign
from his adviser post so as to give a free hand to the prosecution
and investigative authorities in the case.</P>
      <P>On Chen Chi-nan's trip to South Korea in 2002 without taking
leave from the Presidential Office, the president also instructed
that the matter be turned over to the Control Yun for violation of
civil service regulations, Chen Wen-tzung added.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan's visit to a casino Nov. 2, 2002 came to light after
a photo of him with Chen Min-hsien, former vice chairman of the
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp., was shown on a TV program Wednesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHIEF WARNS MOVE TO SUPPRESS MEDIA WILL TRIGGER PUBLIC PROTEST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Saturday that if the government moves to kill off a
cable TV station for exposing scandals involving the government, the
public will protest.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is also Taipei's mayor, made the comment while answering
reporters' questions about a Government Information Office (GIO) move
a day earlier to fine TVBS station for failing to report a change in
its stock ownership when it applied for a renewal of its license
earlier this year.</P>
      <P>After exposing a number of corrupt government officials,
including former Presidential Office deputy secretary-general Chen
Che-nan, the media outlet was accused by GIO chief Pasuya Yao and
several lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) of
being fully funded by money from China.</P>
      <P>Quoting current regulations, Yao said if TVBS is really totally
financed by China, its license could be revoked. </P>
      <P>Ma said that the funding issue is a purely legal problem and that
the government should not manipulate the law to satisfy its political
desires.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition People First Party spokesman Hsieh
Kung-ping blasted the GIO's accusation as a tactic to shift the focus
of public attention away from the corruption scandal surrounding the
construction of the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit system, in which
Chen Che-nan is involved.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that in a democratic society, anyone has right to file
accusations based on evidence. However, he added that if a government
attempts to suppress freedom of speech by means such as suspending a
media license, it is the mark of a dictatorship.</P>
      <P>"The PFP will fight against such an system to the end, " he said.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun, a whip of the DPP caucus at the Legislative Yuan,
said the ruling party absolutely respects the rights of the media.</P>
      <P>"The fine slapped on TVBS was an effort to clarify the nation's
legal system. Is it legal to have a totally China-financed media
outlet at the moment?" Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPERT PROPOSES INDEPENDENT REGULATORY MECHANISM IN CONSTITUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A system for the formation of independent
regulatory organizations should be enshrined in the Constitution in
the next phase of constitutional reforms to provide a reliable buffer
between the country, political parties and society, a local
constitutional law expert said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The proposal was put forth by Chang Wen-chen, an assistant
professor at National Taiwan University's College of Law, during a
conference on constitutional re-engineering held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that all major public offices in Taiwan became
elected posts following the country's successful democratic
transformation in the 1990s.</P>
      <P>However, since the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the
presidency in 2000, the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -dominated
legislature has obstructed almost every major piece of legislation
and every budget proposed by the Cabinet, which has led to a
political deadlock, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Chang attributed the situation to the fact that many politicians
tend to equate the number of votes they win in elections with the
amount of political clout they should enjoy, believing that elections
are the only source of "political legitimacy."</P>
      <P>For example, Chang said, the KMT-led "pan-blue alliance" insisted
that members of the National Communications Commission be nominated
by the legislature according to the proportional representation
system, while the DPP strongly opposed this and plans to request a
constitutional interpretation by the Council of Grand Justices.</P>
      <P>As another example, Chang pointed out that the "pan-blue
alliance, " in order to secure influence in the latest round of
constitutional reforms in June, insisted on raising the passage
threshold for constitutional amendments to a three-quarters vote.</P>
      <P>Expressing worry about the phenomenon, Chang said a system should
be set up in the Constitution to govern the formation of independent
organizations to prevent political parties from taking advantage of
their majority status to take control of technical or regulatory
organizations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian apologized
Saturday for the alleged involvement of one of his former aides in a
profiteering scandal surrounding the mass rapid transport (MRT)
construction project in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The president's apology came after days of public outcry over the
role of Chen Che-nan, a former Presidential Office deputy
secretary-general and national policy adviser, in a series of
irregularities surrounding the project.</P>
      <P>During a weekend barnstorming tour to drum up support for the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chen said in Ilan,
northeastern Taiwan, that "he felt very sorry for the lack of
integrity of Chen Che-nan," who was questioned by prosecutors for the
first time over the scandal Friday.</P>
      <P>The scandal came to light in the wake of a series of
irregularities surrounding the MRT construction project that were
revealed after Thai laborers employed by the Kaohsiung Rapid
Transit Corp. (KRTC) rioted Aug. 21 to protest against harsh
management and exploitation.</P>
      <P>The president apologized to the public and to Lin Yi-hsiung,
former chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, as well
as to DPP supporters.</P>
      <P>He also said that if he himself is found to have been involved in
the scandal, he would be willing to step down, reaffirming that as
long as there is solid evidence, the government will pursue its
investigation relentlessly. He added that there is "no need to
question" the government's determination to find out the truth.</P>
      <P>He also said that "the DPP will reflect upon itself, engage in
soul-searching and seek improvement, " adding that the party will
never let down the public and asking for continued support to
accomplish its reforms.</P>
      <P>On a recently released photo showing Chen Che-nan in a casino in
Cheju, South Korea, with Chen Min-hsien, a former vice chairman of
the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp., taken Nov. 2, 2002, the president
said Chen Che-nan did not report to him on the visit and did not
request leave to make the trip, leaving him in the dark. The
president also apologized for this.</P>
      <P>The photo has cast a shadow across the ruling party as it 
establishes the close relationship between Chen Che-nan and Chen
Min-hsien, who paid for their South Korean visit and who has already
been questioned by the prosecutors four times over the scandal.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Teenage accidental deaths have declined but
suicides have been rising steadily over the past decade, the National
Youth Commission (NYC) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Quoting tallies compiled by the Department of Health, the
commission said that 49.3 out of every 100,000 15-to-19-year-olds
died in accidents in 1994, but the ratio dropped to 23 out of every
100,000 in 2003.</P>
      <P>Despite the fall in proportion, accidents remained the top killer
for this age group during the period, accounting for 51.8 percent of
total deaths. Traffic accidents and drowning were the top two causes
of teenage accidental deaths.</P>
      <P>During the same period, suicide was the No. 2 cause of death for
the 15-19 age group, accounting for 10.7 percent of the total deaths,
with cancer third at 9.28 percent.</P>
      <P>In 1994, an average of 2.74 out of every 100,000
15-to-19-year-olds committed suicide, and the ratio rose to 3.25 in
2003.</P>
      <P>During the same period, the suicide rate for the 20-24 age group
also surged from 6.17 out of every 100,000 to 8.49.</P>
      <P>Compared with figures recorded in advanced Western countries, an
NYC official said the suicide rate for the 15-24 age group was not

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local cable station should answer
questions about tax evasion and the ratio of stocks held by foreign
investors, Premier Frank Hsieh said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks on the sidelines of a campaign trail
in Taichung, central Taiwan, to drum up support for candidates of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he respects media freedom, noting that based on the
spirit of democracy, the government will not give unfair treatment to
TVBS, the cable TV station in question, simply because it criticizes
corrupt government officials, especially a former confidant of
President Chen Shui-bian, and casts the government in a negative
light.</P>
      <P>But he said that Taiwan has now developed a taste for an
"exploding revelation" in everything and since there are questions
about the TV company's taxes and the ratio of foreign investment, the
company "might as well give a detailed explanation."</P>
      <P>At issue is a prime-time call-in program that has been pursuing
almost daily the profiteering scandal surrounding the mass rapid
transit (MRT) construction project over the past two months.</P>
      <P>The program has seen its ratings soar recently, especially after
a revelation this week of a photo showing Chen Chi-nan, a former
deputy secretary-general to President Chen, and Chen Min-hsien, a
former vice chairman of the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC)
gambling at a casino in Cheju, South Korea Nov. 2, 2002, establishing
the close relations between the two.
</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan, who said repeatedly that he had never sought
profits from his position, admitted Friday during his first
interrogation by prosecutors that Chen Min-hsien paid for his South
Korean trip, but he denied that this was the case with two other
trips he made with Chen Min-hsien to Thailand.</P>
      <P>The revelation of the photo cast a long shadow across the ruling
DPP, causing great anxiety among the DPP in the run-up to the
year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Several DPP lawmakers questioned Friday if Leung Nai Pang, a
retired Hong Kong official, is suitable to serve as TVBS' chairman.
They also alleged that the company has been financed by China and is
harboring a plan to collaborate with China to topple the Taiwan
government.</P>
      <P>A spokeswoman for TVBS said Friday that the company has met the
requirements of the local media regulations that prohibit foreign
investors to hold more than half of the shares issued.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and his
counterpart from the Japanese city of Yokohama, Hiroshi Nakada, met
Saturday for talks on their ideas and efforts in city development.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he wishes that the functions of Sungshan Airport,
located in the heart of Taipei, will be separated from those of the
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in the northern county of
Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>Under his idea, Ma explained, the domestic civil aviation hub of
Sungshan Airport should be developed into a terminal concentrating on
passenger traffic, with cargo shipments restricted to lighter
high-tech goods with high added value.</P>
      <P>During a city leadership dialogue, Nakada said his city grants a
preferential 50 percent tax reduction to enterprises that relocate
their headquarters to Yokohama and stay there for at least five
years.</P>
      <P>The program, aimed at attracting business giants, has won Nissan
Motors for the city, Nakada said, adding that he hopes the program
can help attract 600 enterprises to Yokohama in three years.</P>
      <P>Speaking on Taipei's development, Ma said the best way to attract
enterprises to Taipei is to open direct with China because that would
make Taiwan into a regional springboard toward the large Chinese
market.</P>
      <P>Under those circumstances, foreign businesses would flow into
Taipei, Ma said.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan has been keeping itself away from development, Ma
said, referring to the government's long-term ban on forging direct

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Government Information Office (GIO)
will demand a local cable TV broadcaster explain its stock ownership
as reports show that it is a 100 percent Hong Kong-owned enterprise,
GIO Minister Pasuya Yao said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Quoting a National Security Bureau report and information posted
on a Web site, Yao said TVBS is fully owned by a Hong Kong company.</P>
      <P>As such, Yao said TVBS is in violation of Article 10 of the
Satellite Radio and TV Broadcasting Law which stipulates that foreign
direct investments in a local television station should not exceed 50
percent of its total stake.</P>
      <P>Yao said the GIO will ask TVBS Monday to furnish it with a report
on its stock ownership. "We'll then discuss with relevant government
agencies on how to address the issue," he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the GIO fully respects freedom of press, Yao said the
GIO's move has nothing to do with the broadcaster's call-in programs
that publicized evidence related to Kaohsiung mass rapid transit
(MRT) project scandals. "We must defend the dignity of our law, " he
stressed.</P>
      <P>Yao criticized Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as main
opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, for his warning against
the GIO's "suppression" of TVBS simply because of the broadcaster's
reports on government scandals.</P>
      <P>Ma said earlier in the day that if the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration continues to find faults with
local the media, local citizens would take to the streets to vent
their anger. Ma said the content of the media outlet's reports is
more important than its stock ownership.</P>
      <P>"It's weird for Ma, a Harvard-educated legal expert, to make such
remarks. How can we ignore a law passed by our legislature, " Yao
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, TVBS issued a four-point statement in the evening,
claiming that the GIO's demand for it to re-summit its stock
ownership data is unacceptable because it just passed a GIO
committee's license renewal screening.</P>
      <P>On Friday, the GIO slapped a NT$200,000 fine to TVBS for "not
honestly reporting the transfer and background of its shareholders."
The fine came as one of the station's talk shows exposed the close
relationship between former Presidential Office Deputy
Secretary-General Chen Che-nan and labor brokers who brought in more
than 1,400 Thai workers for the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. but
exploited and mis-treated them, resulting in their rioting in
Kaohsiung County on Aug. 21.</P>
      <P>The GIO is also investigating whether TVBS Chairman Norman Leung,
who is a former chairman of the Hong Kong Broadcasting Authority, is
eligible to hold such a high-ranking position in Taiwan's media
industry.</P>

      <P>None of the 50 influenza cases that meet

Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director Lin Ting said the CDC's Kunyang laboratory

and testing system that can complete initial testing in three hours
to determine whether a suspicious case belongs avian flu infections.</P>

      <P>Avian flu is a highly infectious virus among both wild and

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday the

visit Taiwan in line with the principles of "parity and reciprocity."</P>
      <P>Addressing a campaign rally for ruling Democratic Progressive

County, Chen said the main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's)
application for Chen Yun-lin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office
under China's State Council, to visit Taiwan will be dealt with on a
"parity and reciprocity" basis.</P>
      <P>The KMT and its adversary-turned-partner -- the Communist Party
of China (CPC) -- will co-sponsor an economic forum in Taipei in
mid-December. A KMT think tank has filed applications with the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) for Chen Yun-lin and a large number of
other Chinese officials in charge of Taiwan affairs to enter Taiwan
to attend the seminar.</P>
      <P>In his first public comment on the applications, President Chen
said China has bluntly expressed its opposition to his appointment of
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng to attend this year's informal
leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum on his behalf on the excuse that Wang doesn't have any "trade
or economic backgrounds."</P>
      <P>President Chen said he doesn't think that Chen Yunlin has any
"trade or economic background."</P>
      <P>On the principles of "parity, " Chen said the government cannot
approve Chen Yunlin's entry if Wang is barred from attending the 2005
APEC summit to be held in Busan, South Korea Nov. 18-19 simply
because of China's opposition.</P>
      <P>Due to China's opposition, ROC president has been barred from
attending the APEC summit in person and has to instead name a proxy
to attend on his behalf.</P>
      <P>President Chen further said if Chen Yunlin wants to visit Taiwan,
China should allow his Taiwan counterpart -- MAC Chairman Joseph Wu
-- to visit China to meet with Chinese dissidents or pro-democracy
activists in accordance with the principle of reciprocity.</P>

Secretary-General Chen Che-nan and labor brokers who brought in more
than 1,400 Thai workers for the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. but
exploited and mis-treated them, resulting in their rioting in
Kaohsiung County on Aug. 21.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Su Tseng-chang apologized Saturday for a former senior government
official's alleged involvement in a profiteering scandal surrounding
the mass rapid transport (MRT) construction project in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Su made the apology after a provisional meeting of the DPP
Central Standing Committee during which all participants agreed to
ask the party's disciplinary committee to expel Chen Che-nan, a
former Presidential Office deputy secretary-general, for his alleged
role in the Kaohsiung MRT scandal. Chen was indicted Thursday on
charges of corruption and profiteering.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP has pursued reform and clean politics, Su
said the party is very sorry for Chen Che-nan's "lack of integrity."</P>
      <P>"His inappropriate actions have seriously tarnished the party's
image and impaired the public's trust in the DPP," Su said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a DPP official said the party's Central Advisory
Committee will hold a meeting Sunday to make a formal decision to
expel Chen.</P>
      <P>During a weekend barnstorming tour to drum up support for DPP

    <HEADLINE>CHINA IMPORTING TAIWAN FRUIT A CONSPIRACY: VICE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,  southern Taiwan, Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu
urged the country Sunday not to be fooled by Beijing's allowing fruit
from Taiwan to be exported to China, calling the gesture a
conspiracy.</P>
      <P>During a barnstorming tour to drum up support for Tainan county
chief Su Huan-chih, who is seeking a second term in elections in
December, Lu said that Taiwan's fruit, much of which is produced in
Tainan County, is of world-class quality and that such produce should
be exported to Japan, Europe and the United States, instead of China.</P>
      <P>Lu said that shipping Taiwan fruit to China provided China's
agriculture sector with opportunities to conduct research on the
superior Taiwan produce with the intention of cultivating similar
products over much larger areas at much cheaper cost and dumping them
in the Taiwan market before long.</P>
      <P>Lu called Beijing's decision to allow Taiwanese fruit to be
exported to China a political conspiracy. The decision was made after
opposition leaders visited China earlier this year, with the
knowledge that most of the farmers in southern Taiwan are supporters
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lu said, counterfeit products claiming to be
high-priced Taiwanese fruit have appeared on the market in China,
resulting in both in Chinese consumers being cheated and Taiwan's
reputation being compromised.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Lu said, Beijing's refusal to talk with Taiwan
authorities about fruit exports and allowing such talks only between
the Taiwan Provincial Farmers' Association and its mainland
counterpart appeared to be a plot to downgrade Taiwan's status to
that of a "province of China."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT'S APOLOGY IS 'CORRECT FIRST STEP': KMT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's apology Saturday
for the involvement of one of his aides in a profiteering scandal was
"the first step in the right direction," although it came a bit late,
Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ma said, however, that people want the truth about the scandal
concerning the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit project, and they would
not be satisfied unless the whole truth was uncovered.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman, who is also mayor of Taipei City, urged public
prosecutors to make a thorough investigation of the case. He also
urged all related government departments to cooperate in order to
restore the people's trust in the government.</P>
      <P>The president's apology came two days after hard evidence
surfaced showing Chen Che-nan, a former Presidential Office deputy
secretary-general, visited a casino in South Korea with labor brokers
for the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit project in November 2002. At the
time, Chen Che-nan was considered the president's right-hand man. He
became a national policy adviser to the president in 2004, but
resigned his post in early October amid wide speculation about his
involvement in the affair.</P>
      <P>The profiteering case emerged after a riot by Thai laborers on
Aug. 21 in protest against their maltreatment by their employers, the
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp., and their management, Huapan
Consultant Administration Co.</P>
      <P>A photo shown on a TV program last week showed Chen Che-nan and
Chen Min-hsien, former vice chairman of the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit
Corp. (KRTC) , gambling in a casino in South Korea. Further evidence
emerged later showing that a labor broker accompanied them on the
trip and paid for their airplane tickets and hotel expenses.</P>
      <P>The president made the apology when he addressed supporters of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party during a campaign stop in
Ilan. He also assured that if there was any evidence showing that he
himself has been involved in the scandal, he will be willing to step
down.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's "prerequisites"
for a visit to Taiwan by China's top official in charge of Taiwan
relations are not conducive to the development of Taiwan's diplomacy,
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday.</P>
      <P>President Chen said Saturday that the administration will handle
the request to visit Taiwan by Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan
Affairs Office under China's State Council, and some 50 Beijing
officials responsible for Taiwan affairs, in line with the principles
of "parity and reciprocity."</P>
      <P>President Chen said that on the principle of "parity, " the
government cannot approve Chen Yunlin's entry if Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng is barred from attending the informal
leadership summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum to be held in Busan, South Korea Nov. 18-19 as his proxy simply
because of China's opposition.</P>
      <P>President Chen also said that if Chen Yunlin wants to visit
Taiwan, China should also allow his Taiwan counterpart -- Mainland
Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu -- to visit China to meet with
Chinese dissidents or pro-democracy activists in accordance with the
principle of reciprocity.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin and the Beijing officials have been invited by the
KMT to visit Taiwan in mid-December to attend an economic and trade
forum hosted by the party.</P>
      <P>In his first public comment on the applications, President Chen
said China has bluntly expressed its opposition to his appointment of
Wang to attend this year's APEC informal leadership summit on his
behalf on the excuse that Wang doesn't have any "trade or economic
background."</P>
      <P>"I don't think Chen Yunlin has any trade or economic background
either," President Chen said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the president's remarks, Ma said that while these
"prerequisites" may serve to satisfy a desire for revenge, they were
not helpful in improving Taiwan's diplomatic climate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN CHE-NAN'S EXPULSION MEANS GARBAGE HAS BEEN CLEANED OUT: VP LU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu compared former
Presidential Office Deputy Secretary General Chen Che-nan to a piece
of garbage Sunday, saying that by expelling Chen, the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) has "swept away the garbage and is now clean
again. "</P>
      <P>Following the party's Central Standing Committee's decision to
expel Chen Saturday night, the DPP's Central Advisory Committee also
decided Sunday to kick Chen out of the party after he was questioned
by prosecutors over his suspected involvement in the Kaohsiung Rapid
Transit Corp. (KRTC) scandal.</P>
      <P>In Tainan County, where she was stumping for DPP candidate Su
Huan-chih who is seeking re-election in the December local government
elections, Lu urged voters to remain calm in the face of a barrage of
charges against the ruling party.</P>
      <P>"We should all stand on the side of President Chen Shui-bian"
who, Lu said, had apologized to the people for "something that has
happened to the DPP, " adding that everybody makes mistakes and that
"what is important is to apologize quickly and correct oneself. "</P>
      <P>Lu said a house will be clean again as long as any garbage inside
has been found and swept out.</P>
      <P>"Some people are now waiting to usurp power, and we must not feel
dejected," she said.</P>
      <P>Lu said that the president had apologized with sincerity and
determination, in addition to reassuring people that however close to
the "emperor" one may be, he or she will be treated equally before
the law.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung, Premier Frank Hsieh stressed the sincerity of his
own apology concerning the KRTC scandal, the details of which
happened during Hsieh's incumbency as Kaohsiung City's mayor.</P>
      <P>"I have offered my apology for the KRTC scandal, and I don't
think I have to repeat that apology over and over again. The
sincerity of the apology is more important, " Hsieh said, in reply to
media questions.</P>
      <P>As Chen Che-nan had been honored with a government medal on the
ground that he had "boosted the Presidential Office's clean image, "
both ruling party and opposition lawmakers saw the irony in the
awarding of the medal and issued statements demanding an explanation
from the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The DPP's legislative caucus suggested that, in future, a check
into the proposed recipient's moral character be done before deciding
to present him or her with a national medal.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) legislative caucus accused the
Presidential Office of indiscriminately giving out national awards to
reward the president's personal friends, including Chen Che-nan, DPP
Chairman Su Tseng-chang, acting Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh Chu-lan and
National Security Council Secretary General Chiu Yi-jen.</P>
      <P>In response to such criticism, the Department of Public Affairs
of the Presidential Office said were Chen Che-nan to be convicted of
a crime and deprived of his civil rights, his medal would be
"withdrawn" along with the certificate proving its authenticity.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan has repeatedly lied to the media concerning his
foreign trips to Asian countries while denying that he has in any way
been involved in the KRTC scandal.</P>
      <P>Independent Legislator Chiu Yi, who exposed a damning photo
showing Chen and former KRTC Vice Chairman Chen Min-hsien, who is
also being investigated, sitting together at a Korean casino, said
Sunday he has more evidence to show Chen Che-nan had also visited
Vietnam twice in June 2003 on what he called suspicious trips.</P>
      <P>Chiu also ridiculed the prosecution for "following the media's
footsteps in investigating the KRTC and other scandals. "</P>
      <P>The DPP's legislative caucus said the prosecution should ask Chiu
to help them investigate the case and Chiu on his part should
cooperate with the prosecutors.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Cheng Yun-peng said his party has not set any
"limit" to the probe, and nor has the prosecution. "Otherwise, the
scandal would not have grown to such a proportion," Cheng said.</P>

      <P>January-to-August two-way trade with China constituted 18.9
percent of Taiwan's entire foreign trade during that period, up one
percentage point over the year-earlier level, BOFT officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to China amounted to US$32.74 billion during the
period, up 11.7 percent on the figure posted for the same period of
2004. This amounted to 27.1 percent of Taiwan's entire export trade
in the period, marking a year-on-year increase of 1.2 percentage
points in this area.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's imports from China totaled US$12.87 billion in the same

BOFT officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan thus enjoyed a trade surplus of US$19.87 billion with

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct.  30 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh on Sunday urged
citizens of Kaohsiung, where the construction of the mass rapid
transit system has been at the center of a corruption scandal, to
move on after stepping on a heap of cow dung.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was the second Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) leader to
use figurative language to describe the mess the party is in Sunday
after Vice President Annette Lu said that by expelling former
Presidential Office deputy secretary general Chen Che-nan, the DPP
has "swept out the garbage and is now clean again."</P>
      <P>Chen is being investigated over his suspected role in a scandal
revolving around the hiring of Thai workers for the mass rapid
transit project that erupted after the workers rioted in protest of
poor living conditions and inhumane treatments.</P>
      <P>He was recently found to have been lying to the public about a
trip to South Korea he had made with labor brokers for the mass rapid
transit project.</P>
      <P>Like a mountain hiker who accidentally stepped onto a heap of cow
dung, "we've got to move on after cleaning our shoes with stones or
leaves and should not stay there to play with the dung," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>"As I have repeatedly stressed before, all the controversies will
disappear while the construction will stay; pains will go but beauty
will remain with us, " Hsieh said, adding that he believed all the
disputes surrounding Kaohsiung's various city development projects
will become a thing of the past as the citizens move on with their
lives.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks while attending a ceremony to retire
Kaohsiung Harbor's No. 13 Wharf. President Chen Shui-bian also
attended.</P>
      <P>Hsieh used the opportunity to lash out at the "pan-blue" alliance
of the opposition Kuomintang and People First Party, claiming that
the alliance, which enjoys a slim majority in the legislature, has
blocked the Executive Yuan's proposal to develop Kaohsiung Harbor 52
times in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>As a result, he said, most critics said handing over the No 13
Wharf to the city government would not happen until 2011. "But with
the help of the president and cooperation between the central and
local governments, we've moved that schedule ahead, an achievement
that no one dared anticipate," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, a former mayor of Kaohsiung, urged the city's citizens not
to lose confidence in the DPP government, telling them that they have
a friend in the central government to cheer them up.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S BULLET TRAIN PASSES TEST RUNS AT 315 KPH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The new 700T bullet train built in Japan
for the Taiwan High-Speech Rail Corp. (THSRC) passed a series of test
runs Sunday, increasing its speed to its maximum 315 kph, according to
THSRC.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the operator of Taiwan's first bullet train said
the tests had been conducted on a section of the high-speed rail
track in Kueijen township in Tainan County, and that all three tests
had run smoothly.</P>
      <P>He said the test runs at the current stage are intended to not
only check the train's ability to accelerate and brake, but also
examine the structural health of the track and other hardware and the
integration of the electric wiring and signals in relation to the
high-speed train.</P>
      <P>THSRC ordered 30 sets of the 700T rail cars from Japan and has
already taken delivery of 20 sets. Each set consists of 12 carriages
with seating capacity for a total of 986 passengers.</P>
      <P>Construction of the track and stations is about 95 percent
complete, though the start of services has yet to be decided after
THSRC postponed its planned launch in October.</P>
      <P>The 345 km railway will reduce the time for a journey between
Taiwan and Kaohsiung -- Taiwan's two largest cities -- to 90 minutes.
The cost of the project has grown to more than NT$500 billion
(US$14.9 billion).</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO PROBLEMS FACING TAIWAN'S FIGHT AGAINST AVIAN FLU: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two problems need to be addressed urgently
in Taiwan's fight against avian flu, Dr. Wong Chi-huey, chief of the
Genomics Research Center under Academia Sinica said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The first problem is to stop contacts between poultry and people;
the second is to locate drug companies or laboratories which meet the
criteria of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) to produce vaccine
against avian flu, Wong said in interview with CNA, Sunday.</P>
      <P>The current human avian flu cases reported in some Asian
countries were caused by close contact between humans and poultry
infected with the disease.</P>
      <P>There is risk that the avian flu virus, H5N1, could mutate once
entering into the body of human beings to allow human-to-human
infection, Wong said.</P>
      <P>The first line of defense in the battle against the flu is to
prevent contacts between poultry and people, thereby denying the
virus the chance to jump from birds to humans, Wong said.</P>
      <P>The second problem is to manufacture vaccine against the disease
in addition to stockpiling drugs for avian flu such as Tamiflu and
Relenza.</P>
      <P>Wong said Taiwan is technically capable of manufacturing vaccine
but unfortunately it does not have pharmaceutical companies which
meet GMP standards.</P>
      <P>Only vaccine produced by GMP-accredited pharmaceutical companies
can be used on humans, Wong said, adding that a simple way to solve
this problem would be to help private pharmaceutical companies or the
government's medical research institutes to upgrade their equipment
and manufacturing practices to meet the GMP criteria.</P>
      <P>Noting that the technology for producing vaccine is already in
place, Wong said that the country needed to acquire proper production
facilities, rather than research the way to produce vaccine from
scratch.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER HSIEH URGES TVBS TO SHOW SHAREHOLDER STRUCTURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh urged TVBS, a cable TV
channel which broadcast a political talk show exposing damning
evidence concerning a senior former presidential aid's possible
involvement in a profiteering scandal, to reveal its shareholder
structure on Sunday.</P>
      <P>If the TV company's shareholder structure violates the law, "then
it must be dealt with according to law," Hsieh said while attending a
ceremony to retire the No. 13 Wharf at Kaohsiung Harbor in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The law stipulates that foreign investors must not possess more
than 50 percent of a Taiwanese TV company; if that is felt to be
unreasonable, efforts could be made to request that the Legislative
Yuan amend the law, the premier said.</P>
      <P>However, for the time being, law enforcement authorities must
enforce the law as it is, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said initial government investigation showed a problem with
TVBS' shareholder structure.</P>
      <P>"TVBS itself should be more efficient in presenting a truthful
report about this," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) legislative
caucus also demanded that TVBS explain who were its major
shareholders.</P>
      <P>Cheng Yun-peng, a DPP legislator, said radio and TV channels are
"rare resources" that must be strictly regulated, and therefore it
must use "high standards" to explain its shareholder structure.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) legislative caucus came forward
in defence of TVBS, claiming that its Hong Kong-sourced capital
cannot be seen as Chinese capital as the government had reached a
conclusion on this issue before Hong Kong's return to China in 1997.</P>
      <P>Lian Yee Production Co. which owns several TVBS channels has been
suspected of being manipulated by China because 100 percent of Lian
Yee's capital comes from Hong Kong, the Government Information Office
has claimed.</P>
      <P>Pan Wei-kang, deputy secretary of the KMT caucus, advised the
ruling party and the government to spend their time and energy
mapping out good strategies to revive the economy and improve
cross-Taiwan Strait relations, rather than besmearing and persecuting
a TV channel.</P>

Kidd-class destroyers were handed over to Taiwan and made ready to

Asian and Pacific Affairs, International Security Affairs of the

    <HEADLINE>MUCKRAKING NO REASON FOR MEDIA TO BREAK LAW: GIO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Government Information Office (GIO)
said Sunday no media should be allowed to use "exposing scandals" as
an excuse to break the law.</P>
      <P>The GIO was referring to a controversy over the shareholder
structure of TVBS, a cable TV channel which broadcast a talk show
exposing damning evidence concerning former Presidential Office
deputy secretary general Chen Che-nan's alleged involvement in a
profiteering scandal.</P>
      <P>In the face of mounting criticism of the timing to investigate
TVBS's capital source, the GIO claimed that no matter whether the
major source of the TV station's capital comes from Hong Kong or
China, it is "foreign capital" whose share of the total investment is
clearly defined by law.</P>
      <P>No media can claim that it is not regulated by law because it is
exposing government scandals; and no media can break the law under
the excuse that it is being besmeared as a pro-Communist business,
said the GIO.</P>
      <P>It said it respects freedom of the press and freedom of
expression, and as part of the government, it is watched and
supervised by the legislature as well as by public opinion.</P>
      <P>Entrusted by the state, the GIO must not change its position of
"carrying out its administrative duties according to law" and "not
allowing anyone to enjoy legal holidays," said the GIO.</P>
      <P>The GIO accused TVBS of not replying to its demand to explain
whether it had violated Article 10 of the Satellite Radio and TV
Broadcasting Law, which says foreign direct investment in a local TV
station must not exceed 50 percent of its total stake.</P>
      <P>GIO Minister Pasuya Yao has claimed that TVBS is fully owned by a
Hong Kong company, and therefore is a 100 percent foreign-owned
enterprise. Some DPP legislators suspected that China may be behind
the stake holding company and trying to manipulate its operations.</P>
      <P>Since TVBS has obtained its operation license based on the
Satellite Radio and TV Broadcasting Law, naturally it should also be
governed by this law, including the provision regarding foreign
investment, said GIO.</P>
      <P>It said different types of media or businesses are regulated by
different laws. TVBS, as a TV broadcasting enterprise, certainly must
be regulated by the Satellite Radio and TV Broadcasting Law.</P>
      <P>It noted Apple Daily, a mass circulation newspaper in Taiwan that
is also Hong Kong-invested, has been carrying out its media duties
but apparently is not regulated by the same law as TVBS.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MEDIA GROUP RAPS GIO FOR STATEMENT ABOUT TVBS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A self-claimed Campaign for Media Reform
group rapped the Government Information Office (GIO) Sunday for what
it called bungling the case involving a local cable station, TVBS,
and making inappropriate statement about it.</P>
      <P>Wei Ti, convener of the campaign said in a statement that GIO
should not repeatedly warn that TVBS' license to operate in Taiwan
could be suspended, because a panel organized by the GIO to review
cable TV station's permits has already renewed that station's permit
in August.</P>
      <P>Even the license of TV stations could be withdrawn in case it was
granted on the basis of false information provided by the stations,
the decision should be taken by the review panel through legal
process including careful investigation, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The GIO Minister Pasuda Yao should stop repeating his warns that
TVBS' license could be taken away should it be found lying about the
changes of its ownership because it constitutes a threat to the TV
station.</P>
      <P>The Campaign for Media Reform also blamed some lawmakers of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for branding TVBS an arms
of China with the design to topple DPP administration in Taiwan,
claiming that these lawmakers are trying to influence media for
political purposes.</P>
      <P>Legislators may disagree with media's reports but should not try
to pressurize them into silence by calling them followers of
Communist Party of China, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The TVBS irritated DPP lawmakers after it covers intensively the
scandal surrounding the Kaohsiung MRT project and criticizes the DPP
administration's handle of it.</P>
      <P>Noting that TVBS was financed with capital from China, two DPP
lawmakers blamed TVBS for trying to oust DPP administration Friday
after it claimed the previous day that a former adviser to President
Chen Shui-bian played a vital role in the Kaohsiung MRT scandal.</P>
      <P>The GIO Minister Pasuya Yao stepped into the dispute that day by
announcing a fine of NT$200,000 on TVBS on the ground that it failed
to reveal the changes in its ownership, which, Yao claimed, could
cost that station its license.</P>

should be dealt with according to the law.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks after attending an event promoting
nationwide disaster-prevention efforts.</P>
      <P>Taiwan law stipulates that foreign investors cannot have more
than a 50-percent stake in a Taiwan TV company. The premier said that
if this is considered unreasonable, then efforts can be made to
request that the Legislative Yuan amend the law.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, Hsieh called for TVBS, which broadcast recently a
political talk show exposing evidence concerning a senior former
presidential aid's possible involvement in a profiteering scandal, to
reveal its shareholder structure.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Tsai
Chi-fang said at a press conference held in the Legislative Yuan
Monday that even if the TVBS shareholders are from Hong Kong instead
of from China, as claimed by TVBS general manager Lee Tao, this is
still in violation of the law.</P>
      <P>"Hong Kong capital is Chinese capital, since Hong Kong is a
special administrative region of China," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Tsai demanded that the Government Information Office (GIO) repeal
TVBS' operating license. Otherwise, he said, "the case will be remain
under the spotlight."</P>
      <P>In the face of mounting criticism about the timing of the
investigation into TVBS's source of capital, the GIO said Sunday that
regardless of whether the investors are from Hong Kong or from China,
it is still foreign capital, and the law is very clear on the
ownership issue.</P>
      <P>Members of the legislative caucus of the opposition People First
Party said Monday that if the GIO scraps TVBS' satellite broadcasting
license, the party will launch a rally of one million people to
defend freedom of speech in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>President Chen said Saturday during a public activity in Keelung,
northern Taiwan that "if Wang can't go, then Chen Yunlin can't come,"

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) submitted an
application to the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) Monday for a
"compulsory license" to allow Tamiflu, a Swiss-patented drug used to
treat influenza, to be produced in Taiwan as part of efforts to
battle a possible avian flu pandemic.</P>
      <P>Health Minister Hou Sheng-mou said that it was hoped that the IPO
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs would hand down its ruling
about the compulsory license before the end of November, legitimizing
the DOH to conditionally produce Tamiflu in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that quantities of Tamiflu can be produced locally
under a compulsory license to allow Taiwan to have enough Tamiflu
doses for 3 million people, plus existing Tamiflu stocks, in the
event of a bird flu outbreak, Hou said.</P>
      <P>According to IPO authorities, if Tamiflu is produced locally
under a compulsory license, the DOH will have to compensate Roche,
the Swiss pharmaceutical giant which is the Tamiflu patent holder.</P>
      <P>Hou said that in addition to seeking to produce Tamiflu under a
compulsory license, the DOH is also working to arrange for
consultations with Roche's management in Geneva to gain authorization
from the Tamiflu patent holder to mass-produce Tamiflu directly in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Rising global alarm over a possible bird flu pandemic has caused
a worldwide shortage of Tamiflu.</P>
      <P>Roche has recently informed the DOH that it is willing to discuss
cooperation programs with Taiwan over Tamiflu, but it is undecided so
far when the consultations will take place and what details will be
discussed, DOH officials said.</P>

Monday following his sudden collapse Sunday, according to a doctor at

following his admission. He remained in a coma had made little
improvement in the past 24 hours.</P>

patients of his age -- he is 86 -- usually have difficulty in making
a complete recovery. All doctors could do at the moment was stabilize
his breathing and heartbeat.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The military has decided to withdraw
temporarily from a mission to sink a capsized South Korean freighter
carrying a cargo of toxic benzene off Hsinchu, northern Taiwan after
conducting inter-ministry consultations, Vice Minister of National
Defense Huo Shou-yeh said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) is currently
working to come up with a more feasible plan to handle the capsized
ship and its toxic cargo, Huo said at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The military will rejoin the EPA in the mission if requested to
in the future and it is believed that military can successfully
destroy the highly flammable benzene by setting it alight, Huo said.</P>
      <P>The 3,561-ton South Korean freighter Samho Brother capsized Oct.
10 after a collision with the 13,629-ton TS Hongkong registered in
Liberia. All 14 crewmembers were rescued. In addition to 3,140 cubic
meters of benzene, the Samho Brother was carrying 85 tons of fuel oil
and 16 tons of diesel.</P>
      <P>After the mishap, the EPA decided that the benzene aboard the
Korean ship would have to be burnt to prevent it from polluting the
adjacent sea area off Taiwan's northwest coast.</P>
      <P>Discounting media reports that the combat capability of the
Republic of China Air Force and Army Aviation Force came under
question after two F-16s jet fighters and one Army helicopter were
sent to destroy the capsized ship last week but failed to accomplish
their missions, Huo said that the four laser-guided missiles fired by
the F-16s did hit the target, at both the ship's bow and stern.</P>
      <P>The missiles failed, however, to ignite the benzene because it
was carried in the hold under the deck, which the missiles did not
hit, Huo said.</P>
      <P>Huo said that, even if the missiles had hit the cargo hold, the
benzene might not have exploded because there might not have been
enough benzene vapor in the hold to facilitate an explosion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION LAWMAKERS WANT MEDALS REVOKED FROM ALLEGED PROFITEER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition lawmakers are urging the
Presidential Office to revoke two medals of honor from a former
national policy adviser to the president because of his alleged
controversial role in a profiteering scandal involving the Kaohsiung
rapid transit railway project.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan, who resigned his post as national policy adviser in
early October, was expelled from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) last week after evidence came to light showing that he
lied about his close association with a labor brokerage firm, Huapan
Administration Consult Co., whose exploitation and maltreatment of
some 1,400 Thai laborers working for the Kaohsiung rapid transit
railway project prompted their rioting on Aug. 21, denting Taiwan's
global image.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian presented Chen Che-nan with the Order of
Brilliant Star Second Class Jan. 31, 2002, and the Order of
Propitious Clouds Second Class May 19, 2004, while he was serving as
the deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office. Both medals
were awarded on the grounds that the recipient of the honor had
"enhanced the image of the Presidential Office."</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party legislators Lee Ching-an and Ku
Chung-lien, demanded Monday that the Presidential Office recall the
two medals immediately because Chen Che-nan was "clearly involved" in
the profiteering scandal.</P>
      <P>Legislator Pan Wei-kang, a whip of the legislative caucus of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , KMT Legislator Joanna Lei and
independent Legislator Chiu Yi also urged the president to demand
that Chen Che-nan return his the medals to the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers told a press conference that since the president
had already apologized to the nation for appointing an inappropriate
person to the important post, the Presidential Office should take the
medals back without delay.</P>
      <P>At a separate news conference, the DPP legislative caucus
defended the president, pointing out that the medals, awarded in
recognition of the recipient's contribution to the nation, are not a
guarantee of the recipient's integrity.</P>
      <P>However, DPP caucus leaders added that the caucus will suggest to
the president that when a medal of honor is awarded in the future, an
investigation must be made first as to the recipient's integrity.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan had previously admitted that he took two trips to
Thailand with friends but denied a close relationship with Huapan Co.
However, evidence emerged last week that he went with the owners of
Huapan and Chen Min-hsien, former vice chairman of the Kaohsiung
Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC), for a pleasure trip to a casino in South
Korea, with his travel and hotel expenses paid by the labor brokers.</P>
      <P>Chen Min-hsien is another controversial figure who resigned his
post as adviser to the president in early October amid speculation of
his involvement in the KRTC profiteering case.</P>
      <P>A photo was published in the media last week showing Chen Che-nan
and Chen Min-hsien gambling at a casino in South Korea in November
2002. Although the president said he had no prior knowledge of the
trip because Chen Che-nan did not ask for leave before his departure,
the exposure caused the approval rating of the DPP government to
plunge even further.</P>
      <P>In a campaign address last weekend, President Chen apologized to
the people for his former aides' involvement in the profiteering
scandal and urged the public prosecutors to uncover the truth about
the case.</P>
      <P>The public prosecutors office has assigned more than 20
investigators to pursue the profiteering racket in an attempt to
trace the paper trail of kickbacks, money laundering routes and other
irregularities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLICE AUTHORITIES VOICE CONCERNS ABOUT OPENING TO CHINESE TOURISTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 31 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police authorities voiced concerns Monday
about the possible impact on social order and national security of
the expected opening of Taiwan to tourists from China in the near
future.</P>
      <P>The National Police Administration (NPA) remains reserved about
the opening, as Taiwan and China are yet to come forth with a set of
cooperative mechanisms on crime fighting, ranking NPA officials said.</P>
      <P>As relevant arrangements are not in place, money laundering,
financial fraud and forgery of official documents across the Taiwan
Strait continue to be rampant, which will make it hard after the
opening to verify the identity of visiting Chinese tourists and
prevent infiltration by Chinese intelligence agents and criminals,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>At present, some 150,000 visitors from China enter Taiwan each
year, and a full opening to Chinese tourists would make the issue
even more complex and create a greater risk to Taiwan's national
security and public order, the officials said.</P>
      <P>To minimize the impact, the establishment of a special ad-hoc
group composed of immigration, police, intelligence and investigation
units is necessary to carry out the mission of safeguarding the
country following the opening to Chinese tourists, they suggested.</P>
      <P>For the time being, only Chinese people living abroad or coming
from a third country or area are allowed to visit Taiwan. Premier
Frank Hsieh said in May of this year that the government is poised to
fully open Taiwan to tourists from China in response to a Beijing
overture that China would allow its citizens to sightsee in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, China has so far failed to include Taiwan in its list of
approved outbound travel destinations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHANCES SLIM FOR 'ASEAN PLUS 3': EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The possibility of forming a bloc of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus China, South
Korea and Japan by 2010 is not very likely, Fuhwa Financial Holdings
Co. Chairman Yen Ching-chang said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yen made the comment at a seminar on global market deployment
when answering questions from local businessmen about whether Taiwan
would become an outcast at a time when trade bloc groupings are
increasingly taking shape around the world.</P>
      <P>Yen said that the chances of the formation of the so-called
"ASEAN plus 3" before 2010 were very slim due to rivalry between
China and Japan.</P>
      <P>Even were such a group formed in the near future, it would be a
loose organization, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he contended that the Closer Economic Partnership
Arrangement (CEPA) pacts China has signed with Hong Kong and Macau
have had no noticeable impact on Taiwan's economy, mainly because of
the territories' different industrial structures.</P>
      <P>For example, Taiwan has a steel industry, unlike either Hong Kong
or Macau, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long,
the economies of Taiwan and Hong Kong do not overlap in terms of
agriculture and industry.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's service-oriented businesses, such as the
banking sector, have been more affected, he said, adding that some
Taiwan-based banks have acquired Hong Kong-based banking institutions
as a means of breaking into the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an analysis published by Yang Ya-hui, a senior
researcher with the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research, in
an electronic newspaper run by the Industrial Development and
Investment Center under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said that
Taiwan-funded banks are facing a problem of client flight due to
their restricted operations in China.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan-based banks are stilled banned from opening branches in
China, the services they can provide fall far short of meeting the
needs of Taiwan businessmen there, the report said, adding that
Taiwan banking institutions have been troubled by an outflow of good
clients because of their failure to offer adequate services.</P>
      <P>Even though Taiwan banks have now been allowed to upgrade their
offices in China to the level of branches, they encounter mounting
difficulties in market exploration and sustainable development amid
fierce foreign competition seeking to seize a bigger slice of the
pie, the report said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOURISM INDUSTRY WORRIED ABOUT PRICE WAR OVER CHINESE TOURISTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's tourism industry is not worried
about the ability of local hotels and relevant authorities to handle
an expected influx of tourists from China but it is deeply concerned
about a vicious price war that could erupt in the battle for their
custom.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside speculation that Taiwan streets will be packed
with hordes of tourists from China after the government allows the
opening, Tseng Sheng-hai, secretary-general of the Travel Agent
Association (TAA) of the Republic of China, described such rhetoric
as "far-fetched."</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is expected to allow as many as 1,000 Chinese tourists
to visit Taiwan per day for a maximum stay of 10 days, only around
10,000 tourists from China would be in Taiwan on any given day, Tseng
pointed out.</P>
      <P>According to Chu Chung-hung, chairman of the Taiwan Scenic Spots
Association, there are 22 listed recreational facilities in Taiwan
that can accommodate a combined 15 million visitors per year -- a
figure that is far beyond the annual limit set by the government for
around 360,000 Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>In terms of hotel accommodation, Tseng reported that there are a
total of around 22,000 hotel rooms around the country, more than
sufficient compared to the level of about 4,000 rooms needed to house
Chinese tourists in the initial stages of the opening.</P>
      <P>Hotel owners in Taiwan's resort and tourists spots are keenly
awaiting the arrival of Chinese tourists to fill rooms that are
usually empty on weekdays.</P>
      <P>Although local tour operators are confident of receiving as many
as 400,000 tourists from China in line with the government's annual
quota, they are nevertheless concerned about a price war that could
break out to attract more Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the minimum cost of hosting one Chinese
tourist is set by the TAA at around NT$2,000 (US$60) per day, they
claimed that some tour operators are willing to drop their prices to
as low as US$28 per head.</P>
      <P>This cut-throat price is well under Taiwan's consumption level
and they added that Taiwan's image would be seriously hurt if
low-budget tours become out of control by forcing visitors to shop
around or taking them to "low-class and vulgar sites."</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The China Times Express, one of Taiwan's
major evening newspapers, closed shop Monday after 17 years in
business that saw the rise of new information technology as well as
rapid changes in Taiwan society with which the newspaper was unable
to cope.</P>
      <P>In its final edition, the daily claimed that it has "dedicated 17
splendid years to Taiwan" and that its staff members "have fought a
good war."</P>
      <P>With the closure of the paper, the United Evening News becomes
the only evening newspaper in Taiwan. The two dailies had tried to
merge, but according to a China Times Express statement, the merger
plan did not materialize because its assessment of the prospects for
evening papers was not optimistic.</P>
      <P>The staff were given the option to choose between leaving with a
severance package and moving to the China Times, which vowed to
become an even better "quality newspaper" with the injection of an
"elite group" of journalists and staff workers from its sister paper.</P>
      <P>The China Times Express was launched in 1988 when Taiwan was
still reeling from the excitement of the lifting of the decades-old
martial law imposed by the previous Kuomintang government, which fled
to Taiwan from China in 1949.</P>
      <P>The newspaper tried to play a critical role in the fast-changing
Taiwan society with what its management claimed were daring and
innovative reports and insightful academic and professional essays
and commentaries that "helped forge Taiwan's mainstream public
opinion."</P>
      <P>The daily also staged satirical activities such as its annual
"Golden Donkey Awards" presented to "outstanding" political figures
and speeches selected by readers to mirror the absurdities in
freewheeling Taiwan society, in the hope that "these donkeys would
invite people to reflect on themselves."</P>
      <P>"During the past 17 years, we have never budged in our efforts to
find truth as we insisted on the principle of social justice and
worked hard to maintain a liberal tradition, " said managing editor
Yang Tu.</P>
      <P>At its peak, the daily's circulation reached almost half a
million copies. It did not disclose its current circulation.</P>
      <P>The paper was unable to compete against the onslaught of market
forces dictated by the development of new technologies and new forms
of media such as the Internet.</P>
      <P>Even the government's economic liberalization policy that
extended the stock trading hours from noon to 1: 30 p.m. contributed
to the shrinking of the market for evening newspapers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic stagnation and the rapid rise of the Chinese
market was the straw the broke the camel's back, with changes in
Taiwan's advertising market -- worth NT$95 billion in 1999 but
declining to NT$56 billion in 2004. Of that figure, the slice for
print media was halved from NT$30 billion in 1999 to NT$15 billion
last year, making it ever-more difficult for newspapers to survive.</P>
      <P>"Financial constraints are the main reason that we have to call
it quits, " said the China Times Express in a long farewell
statement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CALLS FOR INTERNATIONAL MONITORING OF BIRD FLU IN CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the
international community Monday to jointly monitor the avian flu
situation in China to plug any possible holes in the global pandemic
alert and response system.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal at a high-level meeting on avian flu
prevention amid mounting global concern about the possibility of an
influenza pandemic.</P>
      <P>Senior officials from the Department of Health, the Council of
Agriculture and other relevant government agencies attended the
meeting -- the second of its kind held in recent weeks -- to show
government concern about the public health issue.</P>
      <P>Noting that China boasts the world's largest bird and poultry
population, Chen said the international community should jointly push
China to make its avian flu situation transparent. A week earlier,
the central Chinese province of Hunan reported an avian flu outbreak
that has killed hundreds of chickens and ducks.</P>
      <P>"The world should jointly monitor the avian flu situation in
China and push China to honestly and promptly report any outbreak to
the World Health Organization (WHO)," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has already had a taste of just how much devastation an
infectious disease can cause, Chen recalled. In 2003, SARS, or severe
acute respiratory syndrome, emerged in China and spread rapidly
across the world via air travel, killing nearly 800 people and
causing millions of dollars-worth of economic losses. Taiwan was one
of the hardest SARS-hit countries.</P>
      <P>"The devastation was caused mainly because China failed to report
the outbreak to the WHO in the first instance and even tried to cover
it up, " Chen said, adding that similar mistakes should not be
repeated.</P>
      <P>Thanks to concerted efforts of local coast guard, customs,
quarantine and public health agencies, Chen said, Taiwan has managed
to keep its avian flu-free status.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 14, coast guard officials seized more than 1,000 smuggled
birds from China aboard a Panama-registered freighter anchored at
Taichung Harbor, central Taiwan Oct. 14. Some 270 of the birds tested
H5N1 positive and all of the smuggled birds were incinerated in line
with the animal quarantine law.</P>
      <P>Avian flu is a highly infectious virus among both wild and
domestic birds. H5N1 is the most virulent strain of bird flu and has
killed more than 60 people in Asia since 2003. Experts are closely
watching the disease for fear that it could mutate into a form easily
transmitted among humans and cause a pandemic that could kill
millions. Taiwan's quarantine and public health agencies have been on
full alert against the disease.</P>
      <P>Chen said the coast guard authority deserves credit for the
seizure and that the incident should inspire relevant government
agencies to heighten alert on the possibility of animal smuggling
becoming the culprit of an avian flu spread.</P>
      <P>"We should review our regulations and make necessary updates and
improvements to deter animal smuggling by raising the penalties, "
Chen said.</P>
      <P>At the moment, 18 countries have reported avian flu outbreaks,
with China, Vietnam and Thailand listed by the WHO as high-risk
areas. Chen said the government should fulfill its responsibility of
informing local citizens bound for these three countries of the
latest epidemic situation and preventive measures to protect them
from coming down with the disease during their trips.</P>
      <P>In addition to taking part in a global avian flu-fighting
mechanism, Chen said the public health authorities should step up
public health education, the stockpiling of antiviral drugs and the
development of vaccines.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HIGH-SPEED RAIL CORP. TO PUBLISH NEW FINANCIAL PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC)
will publish its new financial plan in mid-November, THSRC
Chairperson Nita Ing told CNA Monday.</P>
      <P>She said the new financial plan will not become big news. The
major construction project, for which she is responsible, has become
a "near-scandal" after she announced a delay in the launch of
services for a whole year until the end of Oct., 2006 and the
government ordered two public foundations to pour in new money to
save the financially troubled corporation.</P>
      <P>Asked if THSRC will need further new investment before it
launches services, she did not give a clear answer, saying only that
"the financial plan is not yet finalized."</P>
      <P>The NT$7.5 billion that the government-subsidized China Aviation
Development Foundation and China Technical Consultant Inc. (CTIT)
Foundation were told to invest in the BOT (build, operation and
transfer) project became the focus of controversy, with both the
media and opposition party lawmakers questioning what happened to the
largest BOT project in Taiwan's history and some experts expressing
worry that it might become a financial abyss that the government will
be forced to fill up with taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>Ing said she knew CTIT not happy about being "forced" to make the
investment to make up for THSRC's financial shortfall.</P>
      <P>When the project started, Taiwan's stock market was doing well
and investors were confident about Taiwan's economic future, she
said. However, she added, the overall economic situation has changed
over the past few years, making it difficult for THSRC to attract new
investment.</P>
      <P>Ing said there is no urgent need to move the corporation's next
board meeting forward to discuss a reshuffle of board members.</P>
      <P>The government has asked that three seats be added to the
12-member board, with two appointed by the government and the other
chosen by consensus between the government and THSRC. The Ministry of
Transport and Communications (MOTC) has said it hopes the board
meeting can be held in November.</P>
      <P>However, Ing said it takes two months to prepare for a board
meeting and that since a regular meeting is scheduled for May, there
is "no need" to hold a provisional one.</P>
      <P>On some lawmakers' demand that she be replaced by a government
appointee, Ing claimed to have never heard of such a proposal.</P>
      <P>She said the percentage of investment by the government has not
reached a level to entitle it to take over the project and pointed
out that if the government insists on buying a corporation, the
prerequisite is that it has gone bankrupt.</P>
      <P>She added that what that actually means is that the government
would have six months to find another management team that could win
assurances from a consortium of banks.</P>
      <P>In her view, she said, the government has neither the capacity
nor the willingness to take over the high-speed rail project.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government's
Department of Rapid Transit System sent a letter to the Kaohsiung
Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) Monday, formally asking the company's
board of directors to replace its chairman, Chen Jen-yung.</P>
      <P>The letter, signed by department chief Lee Cheng-pin, said that
the change is necessary because problems arising from the KRTC's poor
management recently have prompted public suspicion about KRTC's
involvement in a profiteering scandal and have seriously damaged the
image of the Kaohsiung city government.</P>
      <P>Asked why the letter only asks for the replacement of the KRTC
chairman, Lee said it is taken for granted that KRTC President Fan
Chen-po will also have to go along with the chairman because they are
a management team.</P>
      <P>Chen, president of China Steel Corp., has been KRTC chairman
since June 2001. However, he is apparently a figurehead because
nearly all important decisions were made by KRTC Vice Chairman Chen
Min-hsien, who resigned in September after the profiteering scandal
was brought to light by the Aug. 21 riot by Thai laborers protesting
their maltreatment by the KTRC employers and a management company.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung rapid transit railway project was meant to be based
on a "build-operate-transfer" model, but of the NT$183.17 billion
(US$5.46 billion) price ticket for the project, NT$150.8 billion came
from the government.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUBSIDENCE WILL NOT THREATEN HIGH-SPEED RAIL: THSRC CHAIRWOMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 31 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Subsidence in Yunlin, central Taiwan, will
not be a danger for the high-speed train service planned for launch
Oct. 31, 2006, Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) Chairwoman Nita
Ing said Monday.</P>
      <P>Overuse of groundwater by local farmers and factory managers is
causing land to subside at an average of 10 cm per year, causing some
people to worry that the railway in Yunlin will be dangerous.</P>
      <P>During an exclusive interview with CNA, Ing claimed that the
subsidence will not affect the safety of the high-speed trains but
said that the loss of "national territory" is serious enough to merit
government attention.</P>
      <P>According to Ing, at the current speed, the land in Yunlin is
subsiding so fast that in 200 years, a whole area might simply
disappear and "that is a question much more serious than the safety
of high-speed trains."</P>
      <P>She said the engineers and workers took into account the
subsidence when they laid foundations for the railway, so there will
not be a safety hazard in Yunlin.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday he
looks forward to closer cultural and literary exchanges between
Russia and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with the curators of three
Russian literary museums dedicated to three famous Russian novelists
-- the State Memorial and Natural Preserve Leo Tolstoy Museum-Estate
Yasnaya Polyana, the Ministry of Culture of Russia State M.A.
Sholokov Museum-Reserve, and the Pushkin State Museum.</P>
      <P>Noting that Russian literature has a long and rich tradition,
Chen said he admires Russia's literary achievements. All three of the
Russian authors have many fans in Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen said the three writers had many things in common -- their
concern for ordinary people, pursuit of world peace and exploration
of the meaning of life.</P>
      <P>Like realistic Russian literature, Chen said, the mainstream of
modern Taiwan literature also attempts to describe daily life and
social conditions.</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes the three curators can come to a better
understanding of Taiwan people's true resolve to pursue peace during
their visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, Vladimir Illich Tolstoy, a great-grandson of Leo
Tolstoy (1828-1910) , presented a special Tolstoy robe to Chen as a

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
Chairwoman Chen Chu was questioned by the Investigation Bureau's
Kaohsiung office under the Ministry of Justice for 10 hours Monday as
a suspect in a profiteering scandal and the exploitation of Thai
laborers working on the Kaohsiung rapid transit railway project.</P>
      <P>Chen resigned in early September to assume political
responsibility for the Aug. 21 riot in Kaohsiung County by the
Thai laborers.</P>
      <P>She told reporters following the questioning that she did
everything according to the law while she was CLA chairwoman and that
no one had interfered in the CLA's decision to allow Thai laborers to
be brought into Taiwan to work for the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp.
(KRTC).</P>
      <P>She said that as the employers, KRTC had the right to hire Thai
laborers directly by itself or through a labor brokerage firm.</P>
      <P>Also questioned with Chen as suspects in the same case were Kuo
Fang-yu, a section chief of the CLA in charge of occupational
training; Chen Yi-min, a former deputy section chief of the CLA's
occupation training section; and CLA chief secretary Ho Jui-fan. They
also denied any involvement in the scandal.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Kaohsiung office of the Investigation Bureau
said Chen Chu and the other three will be referred to the Kaohsiung
District Public Prosecutors Office for further questioning.</P>
      <P>Media coverage of the KRTC scandal has continued unabated for
more than two months, fanning widespread speculation about a massive
profiteering racket involving government officials, KRTC executives,
construction companies contracted by KRTC and two illegal labor
brokerage firms.</P>

      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh urged the media Monday
to respect the law that prohibits the premature revelation of
criminal investigations.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the media has developed a taste for publishing
"unfounded explosive revelations" of so-called scandals, including

      <P>He said the scandal actually refers to suspected irregularities

Hsieh said, it will take time for prosecutors to get to the bottom of
the matter.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he hopes the media will refrain from making unfounded
accusations. </P>
      <P>"Irresponsible accusations are tantamount to interference with
legal investigations. If opposition lawmakers do not believe in the
merits of confidentiality in the process of criminal investigation,
