    <HEADLINE>Big flock of sacred ibises observed in southern Taiwan</HEADLINE>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Conservationists observed a flock of over 100 sacred ibises on fallow farmland
in the southern county of Tainan Tuesday, after residents reported what they
thought was a big group of black-faced spoonbills resting on the land.</P>
      <P>Tainan County has a wild bird conservation wetland where the migratory
spoonbills, an endangered species of wading bird, spend the winter every year.</P>
      <P>Chiu Yen-wu, chairman of the Tainan County Ecology Conservation Society, said
they doubted the report because it is too early in the year for the endangered
birds to appear in the county.</P>
      <P>The first spoonbills usually arrive in Taiwan from the north for wintering
between October and November and would never rest on dry land, said Chiu, who
added that they were unsurprised, therefore, to find that the birds were in fact
a flock of 126 sacred ibises, although the birds are rarely seen in such numbers
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiu said it was likely that a huge number of earthworms and insects appearing
on the farmland after typhoon rains might be the reason the ibises had arrived
in such large numbers.</P>
      <P>The sacred ibis is a wading bird of the genus threskiornis, which breeds in sub-
Saharan Africa, southeastern Iraq and formerly in Egypt, where in ancient times
it was venerated and often mummified as a symbol of the god Thoth.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, the bird was first introduced to Taiwan by a zoo in Hsinchu,
northern Taiwan, over 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>Four of the birds escaped and began to breed in the wild, and the birds are now
seen in areas between Hsinchu in the north and Tainan in the south.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Switch to Hanyu Pinyin will cost NT$216 million: Kaohsiung City</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Sept. 30 (CNA)
10/01/08  11:44:35
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung City government estimates that it will require NT$216 million
(US$6.7 million) to convert its public signs to Hanyu Pinyin, the most common
standard Mandarin romanization system, an official of the southern port city
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Li-ming,  executive  director  of the city's Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission, noted that the city government began in 2004 to romanize
all its road signs and signs at tourist spots using the Tongyong Pinyin system
which was developed by a Taiwanese and is employed only in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If the city, which is under an opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration, now decides to adopt the Hanyu Pinyin system in line with
central government policy, the price tag will be NT$216 million, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>According to the city's Maintenance Office, there are a total of 34,000 road
signs in Taiwan's largest southern city. At a cost of NT$1,500 to make one sign,
it will require NT$51 million to convert all the city's road signs to a
different romanization system, the office said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Hsu noted, road signs are only a fraction of all the public signs that
would have to be replaced.</P>
      <P>If the central government insists on Kaohsiung City changing its signs, the
local government would have to ask the central government to foot the bill, he
said.</P>
      <P>As part of efforts to bring Taiwan in line with international standards, the
Executive Yuan recently decided to standardize the transliteration of Chinese
ideograms into the Roman alphabet by replacing the Tongyong Pinyin system with
Hanyu Pinyin, which is used by the United Nations and the world community.</P>
      <P>Under the new policy, all road signs and other public signs around Taiwan will
have to be changed.</P>
      <P>However, Kaohsiung City has challenged the policy, with Mayor Chen Chu of the
DPP saying that "language should not used as a tool for political expediency,
nor should it be given a political purpose."</P>
      <P>Chen said that she thinks as long as the language system is convenient to use
and can be easily adopted in communication, it is good enough.</P>
      <P>Tongyong Pinyin was adopted by the previous pro-independent DPP administration,
which was in power for eight years before it lost to the Kuomintang in the March
22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The DPP administration was criticized as selecting the Tongyong Pinyin
romanization system for political and ideological reasons and accused of
abandoning the universal Hanyu Pinyin system mainly because it originated and is
used in China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President confident Taiwan will weather global financial crisis</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that he is confident that Taiwan will be
able to weather the current global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an award-presentation ceremony for the winners of "Taiwan's Top 20
Global Brands," Ma noted that most people in Taiwan are heavy-hearted about the
financial storm in the United States that has also adversely affected Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"This is not the first time Taiwan has encountered  such difficulties," Ma said,
adding that although the global financial environment is unfavorable, he
believes that as long as Taiwan braces itself for worse to come, it will ride
out the crisis.</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that Taiwan survived the first world oil crisis in the
1970s, the second world energy crisis in the 1980s and the Asian financial
crisis in the 1990s.</P>
      <P>He said he had visited quite a few enterprises in Taiwan recently and found
their executives to be confident about the future for Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Ma's speech came shortly after the U.S. House of Representatives voted down a
US$700 billion plan aimed at bailing out Wall Street.</P>
      <P>The rescue package -- a result of hard bargaining between the Bush
administration and lawmakers, was rejected by a vote of 228-205 in the House of
Representatives, with two-thirds of Republican lawmakers refusing to back the
plan.</P>
      <P>Reacting to the House decision, Wall Street shares nosedived, sending the
benchmark index down by 777 points -- its biggest daily points fall in history.
All major stock markets in Europe and Asia also tumbled sharply. Taiwan's stock
market shed 210.35 points, with the weighted index closing at 5,719.28.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Transparent mechanism needed for sovereign fund: vice premier</HEADLINE>

(By Steve Bercic)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung said Wednesday that creating a sovereign wealth
fund would be helpful for Taiwan's economy but that a transparent mechanism must
also be set up to manage it.</P>
      <P>Chiu made the comments ahead of a meeting to be held by the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) later the same day to discuss the feasibility of
creating such a fund.</P>
      <P>The CEPD has invited the heads of relevant ministries and agencies,  including
the Ministry  of Finance,  the Financial Supervisory Commission and the Central
Bank of the Republic of China, as well as leading academics and experts to
attend the meeting.</P>
      <P>Chiu said that if a "concrete plan" on the creation of a sovereign wealth fund
is arrived at during the meeting, the plan will be sent to the Executive Yuan
for approval.</P>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew, who serves as the convener of a new panel of
presidential economic advisers, said a day earlier that establishing a sovereign
wealth fund could serve as a tool to consolidate relevant resources.</P>
      <P>Many countries have in recent years set up sovereign wealth funds -- a state-
owned wealth fund composed of financial assets such as stocks,  bonds,
property,  precious metals or other financial instruments -- to help expand
their wealth.</P>
      <P>Such a fund could initially be financed by using part of Taiwan's US$282 billion
in foreign exchange reserves held as of the end of August.</P>
      <P>Speaking with reporters, Chiu said that such a fund would be beneficial to the
nation's economy but stressed that the most important element would be
establishing a transparent system for the fund's management.</P>
      <P>On the issue of using the existing National Stabilization Fund, Chiu said that
the government is continuing to closely monitor financial markets to decide the
most appropriate time to step in to stabilize the situation with an injection of
capital.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan-New Zealand mutual fishery check mechanism activated</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
10/01/08  14:27:16
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A mechanism between Taiwan and New Zealand to help uncover illegal, unreported
and unregulated fishing activities (IUU fishing) has been activated recently,
the Fisheries Agency under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture reported
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries Agency said that Taiwanese deep-sea fishing boats operating in the
West and Central Pacific Ocean should let New Zealand fishery officials or
police board and inspect their vessels -- after establishing that the New
Zealand authorities are genuine -- to help crack down on transboundary IUU
fishing.</P>
      <P>About 1,500 Taiwanese fishing boats are currently operating in the West and
Central Pacific Ocean areas, mainly to commercially fish tuna, sharks and
sailfish.</P>
      <P>Of the total, 100 smaller longline fishing vessels, usually used to fish tuna,
that operate in open seas or in other countries' economic zones under contract
from those countries are the most likely to be targeted for inspection, the
Fisheries Agency said.</P>
      <P>An agency official said Taiwanese vessels that don't cooperate with the
inspections or are found to have violated regulations could be banned from
fishing commercially in those areas.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese fishing boats under scrutiny are urged to have relevant documentation
and fishing logbooks ready for the inspections.</P>
      <P>They should also be properly equipped with fish size measurement gear and
monitoring  equipment that helps them avoid catching protected sea turtles or
sea birds or amassing younger fish they are not allowed to catch.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-New Zealand mutual fishery examination mechanism marked the first
time that Taiwan has participated in such inspection efforts aimed at maximizing
long term benefits from the Pacific Ocean since the West and Central Pacific
Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) passed an agreement in December 2006, the official
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is a WCPFC member.</P>
      <P>The worldwide value of IUU catches are worth up to US$9.5 billion, a World
Commission on Protected Areas' High Seas Task Force study shows. IUU catches
make up about 14 percent of the value of the global marine catch, based on
figures available for 2001.</P>
      <P>Up to 30 percent  of IUU fishing  occurs beyond national jurisdiction, where
there are fewer controls, according to the study.</P>
      <P>Sharks and deep sea fish are being caught at an unsustainable rate, and fragile
coral reefs, seamounts and sponge beds are in peril from destructive fishing
practices such as bottom trawling, according to the study.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. State Department official repeated Tuesday that pending weapons sales to
Taiwan are still being screened under an internal review process in the
executive branch, as a delay in the sales is raising deep concern in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The administration will notify Congress when the interagency process reaches a
final decision, said John Norris, acting deputy assistant secretary of state for
East Asian and Pacific affairs.</P>
      <P>Norris said he would not pay too much attention to when the notification is
issued, because the United States maintains close economic and trade relations
and civil exchanges with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is the Taiwan Relations Act that governs security issues
concerning Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Norris made the remarks when asked about the matter by Taiwanese media on the
sidelines of the 7th U.S.-Taiwan Defense Industry Conference held in
Jacksonville, Florida.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was excluded from the list when the State Department notified Congress of
its approval of six arms deals with France, Turkey, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia on
Sept. 26 -- the date when Congress was scheduled to adjourn.</P>
      <P>The adjournment has been postponed for a week due to a deadlock over a US$700
billion bailout package for Wall Street amid the collapse of venerable financial
institutions.</P>
      <P>The pending arms deals to Taiwan cover anti-tank missiles, Apache helicopters,
Patriot  PAC-3 missile batteries,  diesel-electric submarines, P3C Orion anti-
submarine aircraft, ship-launched Harpoon anti-ship missiles and Black Eagle
helicopters.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fears that if the deals are not finalized by the end of the year,
approval of the sales will be pushed to 2009 and a new U.S. administration.</P>
      <P>During  his address  to the U.S.-Taiwan  Defense  Industry Conference, David
Sedney, deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia, said the internal
review process for the arms sales was far more complicated than imagined and
that he did not know if and when notification would be given.</P>
      <P>Sedney said, however, that the U.S. government maintains its firm commitment to
the Taiwan Relations Act, under which the United States makes available items
necessary for Taiwan to maintain a sufficient defense.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government announced the launch of the free flu-shot season
Wednesday, urging all eligible residents of the southern port city to head to
the nearest hospital or clinic to receive inoculations against the disease.</P>
      <P>Among the top officials attending the press conference were Tsai Lung-chu,
deputy director of the Kaohsiung City's Department of Health, and Chang Ching-
yun, head of the Kaohsiung City Medical Association, who received flu shots as
part of the promotional effort.</P>
      <P>Those eligible for free flu shots include children aged six months to three
years, elementary students in grades 1 through 4, patients with serious
injuries, seniors aged 65 or over, medical workers, disease control personnel,
workers in the poultry industry and others at high risk of being infected.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health has distributed a total of 84,000  doses
of flu vaccine  to 285 clinics  and hospitals participating in the program
around the city.</P>
      <P>The free flu shot period will run through Nov. 30, municipal health officials
said, adding that any doses left over will be available to other residents of
the city from Dec.1.</P>
      <P>Han Yung-kuang, a division chief with Kaohsiung's Department of Health in charge
of disease control, said that in the past, the city has achieved a success rate
of about 45 percent in terms of inoculating eligible residents, adding that the
department hopes to boost that figure to over 50 percent.</P>
      <P>Noting that flu vaccine is an inactive vaccine, Han said it produces only mild
side effects at worst and that the vaccine is very safe.</P>
      <P>A small percentage of those who receive the flu shot suffer from very mild
symptoms, such as inflammation, fever or fatigue, but fully recover within one
or two days, he continued.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Plastics Group is also offering a total of 25,000 doses of
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) to Kaohsiung residents over the age of
75. PPV, also known as Pneumovax, is used to prevent pneumococcus bacteria
infections, such as pneumonia and septicaemia.</P>
      <P>Han said seniors who are examined by a doctor and found not to have a fever or
related symptoms can safely receive both the PPV and flu shots at the same time.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan-made weather satellite, the Formosat-3/COSMIC, has been transmitting
data to 47 nations as of Wednesday, two years after it was first put in space,
the National Space Program Office (NSPO) reported.</P>
      <P>The Formosat-3/COSMIC  mission has so far provided to 842 researchers  and
institutions  from 47 nations near-real  time information, including information
on the global distribution of air pressure, temperature, and water vapor of the
atmosphere, as well as the electron density of the ionosphere, NSPO Director
Jiun-jih Miau said.</P>
      <P>Data from the satellite help the various countries forecast the weather,
including dramatic changes such as typhoons, and help them determine weather
patterns and changes in the climate.</P>
      <P>The COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and
Climate) data has also been integrated into weather forecast systems of the
United States, the European Union and major countries  in Asia,  Miau  said at
the opening  of the 2008 Formosat-3/COSMIC annual science meeting which will
last from Oct. 1-3 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In the near future, the space program will strive to conduct an "intense
observation period" to perform cross data validation as well as prediction
studies of typhoon track, heavy rainfall areas, and rainfall accumulation in the
East Asia region, Miau added.</P>
      <P>The Formosat-3/COSMIC  annual science meeting  is the main international forum
for scientific discussions and interactions among those involved in the
Formosat-3/COSMIC space mission and related sciences.</P>
      <P>The meeting was held in conjunction with the fourth Asian Space Conference.</P>
      <P>Altogether, 300 scholars and specialist and students from 14 nations and the
host Taiwan are taking part in the two related events.</P>
      <P>The Formosat-3/COSMIC mission, part of the national science program's satellite
project and built in collaboration with the United States, was launched in April
2006 from a U.S. military base in California and is scheduled to be completed in
2016.</P>
      <P>Currently, the orbiting satellite FORMOSAT-3, consisting of six mini-satellites,
is conducting space-borne GPS radio occultation of atmospheric and ionospheric
sounding observations numbering up to 2000 per day.</P>

      <P>The Maokong Gondola, the city's popular cable car system, suspended operations
indefinitely Wednesday afternoon as questions lingered over the system's safety
after its foundation may have been weakened by Typhoon Jangmi.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin had assured the public on Monday the system was safe
after a landslide occurred near a support tower over the weekend,  saying the
cable car system's consultants  CECI Engineering Consultants, Inc., Taiwan, had
assessed the system and vouched for its safety.</P>
      <P>But Hau was forced to reverse his position Wednesday and shut down the system
pending further assessment.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Councilman Chuang Jui-hsiung of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, his colleagues and city government officials inspected the
mountainous area again Wednesday and found an 1.8-meter high opening under the
foundation of the No. 16 support tower that had been washed away by the typhoon.</P>
      <P>Chuang said he "was shocked" to see the serious erosion.</P>
      <P>More than a dozen city councilmen of the ruling Kuomintang then called on Hau to
ask him to suspend the cable car system's operations. Hau agreed and shut down
the system at 3 p.m.</P>
      <P>Taipei city government spokesman Yang Hsiao-tung said that engineering and
construction experts have been commissioned to inspect the scene and conduct a
safety assessment, with a conclusion expected in one month.</P>
      <P>"Before experts complete their assessment, the government will suspend the
system's operations," Yang said.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsiung-wen,  commissioner of the city's Department of Economic Development,
said that the city government has appropriated NT$50 million to shore up the
slope on which the pillar is located over the next six months.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that "it is still uncertain whether the operations of cable
system will be suspended during the six months."</P>
      <P>Torrential rains brought by Typhoon Jangmi, which hit Taiwan over the weekend,
caused a landslide on the slope near the No. 16 support tower that swept to a
nearby community on Wanshou Road.</P>
      <P>Residents and city councilmen blamed the cable car system for the landslide,
which they said was the first ever to have hit the location.</P>
      <P>The residents and elected officials have visited the site over the past three
days and urged the city government to suspend the cable car's operations, but
their appeals had been rejected by the mayor.</P>
      <P>Taipei Rapid Transit Corp., which runs the Maokong Gondola, said that over 6.1
million passengers had ridden the system as of Tuesday since its official
inauguration July 4, 2007.</P>
      <P>Company officials said that those who have bought gondola tickets could call the
24-hour hotline (02) 2181-2345 or 1999 Citizen Hotline for a refund.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President: national pension system milestone for social security</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 1 (CNA)
10/01/08  17:48:22</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou declared Wednesday, the inauguration day of the new
national pension system, that Taiwan's social security system is now more
comprehensive, setting a milestone for the country.</P>
      <P>At a press conference to launch the system, Ma said that together with the
National Health Insurance Program and other insurance programs, the new pension
system will consolidate Taiwan's social security network, ensuring that the
whole population is covered by insurance.</P>
      <P>The national pension system will be open to anyone with household registration
in Taiwan aged between 25 and 65 who is not covered by other social welfare
insurance such as farmer's health insurance, government employee insurance,
insurance for military personnel and labor insurance.</P>
      <P>Noting that the country's population is aging, Ma said that "even if there will
be fewer people to support elderly citizens in the future, we don't have to
worry, since the national system is now established."</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) , people over 65 are expected to
account for 20 percent of the country's population by 2026, and in 2030, every
senior citizen will have only three working people to support them, down from
the present seven.</P>
      <P>"From now on, Taiwan is in an era in which the entire population can be covered
by insurance, and the country's social security network is complete, " Premier
Liu Chao-shiuan said at the press conference, adding that with the new system,
the government has taken a further step in taking care of the underprivileged.</P>
      <P>In the first year of the new system's implementation, the monthly premium is
decided based on the basic minimum wage, which is NT$17,280 (US$539.5) at
present.@@</P>
      <P>The premium rate for the insurance is 6.5 percent for the first year, to be
increased by 0.5 percent in the third year and thereafter by 0.5 percent every
two years until it reaches a limit of 12 percent.</P>
      <P>The insured must pay 60 percent of the premium, while the central competent
authority will be responsible for the remaining 40 percent.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, an insured person who pays a monthly premium of NT$674
for 40 years will receive NT$8,986 every month from the age of 65 -- the
standard retirement threshold -- until death.</P>
      <P>But low-income citizens and mentally and physically disabled people can enjoy
from 55 percent to 100 percent of premium subsidies from the government,
according to the MOI.</P>
      <P>In addition, to safeguard women's right, husbands should pay the premiums for
their spouses if they are full-time housekeepers, noted Interior Minister Liau
Liou-yi.</P>
      <P>@According to the National Pension Act,  funding for the subsidized premiums and
related expenses should be appropriated by the central competent authority.
Apart from annual budget, the surplus from the public welfare lottery for the
national pension and an increase of business tax by 1 percent could also
contribute to the available funds.</P>
      <P>@The MOI said the new system will cover an estimated 4.7 million people,
including the jobless,  street vendors,  housekeepers, naturalized foreign
spouses and students older than 25.</P>
      <P>@The amendment to the National Pension Act was approved by the Legislative Yuan
in July 2008. @@ (By Emmanuelle Tzeng) @</P>

      <P>Taiwan implemented a new measure Wednesday under which inbound travelers can be
fined a minimum of NT$3,000 for failing to make an import declaration or
quarantine application for animals, animal products, plants, and plant products.</P>
      <P>The government has since Jan. 1, 2007 banned inbound travelers from bringing in
most plants and animals as well as plant and animal products, but had imposed no
penalty until Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine
(BAPHIQ) , the importation of all live animals and animal products is forbidden,
except for dogs, cats, rabbits and animal products that have cleared quarantine
inspection.</P>
      <P>In terms of plants, no fresh fruit is allowed, while live plants and other fresh
products are also banned, except for those that have cleared quarantine
inspection.</P>
      <P>BAPHIQ Deputy Director-General Huang Kuo-ching said the new measure was adopted
to strengthen the government's effort to block the entry of animals and plants
that may carry various diseases or pests, such as foot-and-mouth disease and
fruit flies, which can cause serious damage to Taiwan's agriculture sector.</P>
      <P>Shen Kuo-san, chief of the BAPHIQ's Hsinchu branch office, noted that it is
common practice for Taiwanese travelers to bring home foreign fruit, vegetables,
spices, fresh meats and processed meats. The fine was introduced to stop such
practices, he said.</P>
      <P>Individuals who have questions concerning the importation of animals and plants
can visit the BAPHIQ's Web site or contact any of the BAPHIQ's branch offices,
Shen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in light of the popular practice of foreign workers bringing to
Taiwan animal and plant products from their home countries, the BAPHIQ said it
is planning to request the Council of Labor Affairs to help promote the
regulations among labor brokers and foreign workers.</P>

      <P>The director of the American Institute in Taiwan's (AIT's) Kaohsiung Office paid
homage to late American nurse Marjorie I. Bly in Makong City on the Penghu
Islands off southwestern Taiwan, Wednesday, honoring the U.S. citizen's devotion
of her life to caring for leprosy patients.</P>
      <P>Christian M. Castro laid a bouquet of flowers at a statue of Bly, known locally
by her Chinese name of Pai Pao-chu.</P>
      <P>In his address, Castro acclaimed Bly for her lifetime devotion to caring for
leprosy patients on Penghu, where she lived for 54 years before passing away
April 8 this year.</P>
      <P>He said the devotion has not only won her the respect of the public but has also
inspired people to care for lepers.</P>
      <P>He expressed appreciation to the Penghu county government for giving the nurse
the assistance she needed to do her job and expressed hope that the spirit of
Bly's selflessness will be passed down through the generations.</P>
      <P>Bly, born in 1919 to an American missionary family, came to Taiwan at the
commission of the Lutheran Church Nov. 17, 1952 to provide care for leprosy
patients and families through an outreach clinic.</P>
      <P>In 1954, she moved to Penghu, where she continued to care for lepers. She
performed follow-up care and treatment for all leprosy patients in the county

      <P>In the midst of a food safety panic caused by tainted Chinese milk powder, The
Department of Health (DOH) announced Wednesday that all imported and local dairy
products and food products containing vegetable-based protein food additives
will be examined for the toxic chemical melamine.</P>
      <P>All imported and local food products, including creamer, milk powder and baby
formula, will have to be examined using the liquid chromatography/tandem  mass
(LC/MS/MS)  test,  DOH Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>LC/MS/MS is a sensitive analytical instrument used to detect specific chemicals.</P>
      <P>"The DOH will also enhance random examinations of such products, especially
those from `risky countries,'" said Yeh without naming the countries.</P>
      <P>At present, only 5 percent of the food products in each shipment is checked, but
20 percent of imported dairy products and foodstuffs containing vegetable-based
protein additives will be examined from now on, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>He also noted that with immediate effect, these products should be declared at
customs with a report from the exporting country on examination for melamine,
the detection limit of which should be noted in the report.</P>
      <P>As for Chinese milk power, dairy products and creamer, Yeh reiterated that the
government will continue to impose an import ban on these items.</P>
      <P>He noted that all tainted ingredients and products in Taiwan have already been
either seized or recalled, and he urged the public to have no fear of consuming
products found on store shelves, all of which have by now tested negative for
melamine.@@</P>
      <P>Due to the widespread melamine contamination in many products, food companies
and ingredient suppliers have suffered from enormous economic losses and damage
to their business images.@@</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue of melamine-tainted biscuits imported from Malaysia and
sold in the megastore Costco, Yeh said that all the contaminated biscuits had
been seized and that the Malaysian food manufacturer is suspected to have used
tainted Chinese milk powder.@</P>
      <P>China is blamed for the global melamine contamination that has killed at least
four babies in China and sickened thousands who have been fed on tainted baby

      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung asked for assistance
from China for Taiwanese businessmen based there, during a meeting with visiting
Chinese officials Wednesday, citing increasing difficulties encountered by the
island's companies.</P>
      <P>Chiang, Taiwan's top negotiator with China, called for Chinese government
attention to several major problems that many Taiwan businesses have encountered
in China, and urged it to properly address them in a meeting with a visiting
group of Chinese Communist Party officials from Suzhou City, in east China's
coastal Jiangsu Province.</P>
      <P>"The credit crisis which originated in the United States and has swept the whole
world is impacting both Taiwan and China, including Taiwanese business people
there, " Chiang said. "The crisis and changing investment environments together
have stirred up much stronger pressure on Taiwanese enterprises in China."</P>
      <P>Many of the pressures Taiwanese companies face are due to a series of austerity
measures Beijing imposed in recent years to cool its fast growing economy.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, Taiwanese businessmen operating in China have been hit hard
by difficulties in getting bank loans and land as well as problems arising from
a new labor contract law enacted by Beijing in January this year to protect
workers.</P>
      <P>The SEF chairman also asked the Suzhou city government to help Taiwanese
businessmen overcome these problems in Suzhou.</P>
      <P>Since the 1990s, Suzhou has increasingly become one of the major investment
clusters for Taiwanese businessmen in China.</P>
      <P>In response, Wang Rong, Suchou City Party Committee secretary, promised to help
Taiwanese firms get needed credit loans from the Jiangsu provincial government,
pointing out that Beijing has given its approval for local authorities to
provide loans to small businesses.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the growing difficulties in acquiring land in China, Wang said
that Chinese companies are facing the same problem as their Taiwanese
counterparts and described the tightening of land management as a "necessary
step" in China's economic development.</P>
      <P>The Suzhou city government would be willing to help private companies tackle
their difficulties in acquiring land for their businesses on a case-by-case
basis, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The  semi-official  SEF  is responsible  for dealing  with cross-Taiwan Strait
exchanges with its Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , in the absence of government-to-government contacts
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS inked two milestone accords in June in Beijing to step up two-
way tourism and transportation services.</P>

organizing their own unions is unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>The nominees for grand justices were at a meeting at the Legislative Yuan,

nominations by President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>The five nominees were asked by opposition Democratic Progressive Party

their hands on whether it is unconstitutional if teachers are prohibited from
organizing unions to defend their rights and interests.</P>
      <P>All the five nominees raised their hands to express that it is unconstitutional
if teachers are prohibited from doing so.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's current labor union law prohibits teachers from organizing their own
unions.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the five nominees also expressed unanimously that it is not against

related activities.</P>
      <P>On whether they oppose or support the notion that the death penalty should be
abolished once and for all in Taiwan and whether same-sex marriages should be

      <P>An annual government-funded flu inoculation program targeting high-risk groups
began Wednesday, bringing people flocking to the Taipei Municipal Ho Ping
Hospital in search of free flu shots.</P>
      <P>Inspecting the inoculation set-up at the hospital, Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) Deputy Director-General Lin Ting noted that flu outbreaks normally come to
a peak in late November and then gradually tail off after the Lunar New Year
holiday, which usually falls in February.</P>
      <P>As it takes around two weeks for the vaccine to produce immunity, Lin advised
people to get vaccinated before the end of October.</P>
      <P>The targets of this year's program include senior citizens aged 65 and older,
residents and workers of nursing homes, children between the ages of six months
and 3 years, and first through fourth graders.</P>
      <P>Patients suffering  from rare diseases,  major diseases or injuries, disease
prevention and control personnel at medical and health institutions, workers in
the poultry and livestock industries, and animal disease control and prevention
personnel are also among those targeted, according to the CDC.</P>
      <P>Lin said the CDC has purchased 3.2 million doses of flu vaccine to meet this
year's demand. If there are still doses left over Nov. 30 when the program
expires, they will be available to other citizens from Dec. 1, he noted.</P>
      <P>In addition to the flu shots, Lin mentioned that those aged over 75 are also
entitled this year to a free inoculation of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine
(PPV) , also known as Pneumovax, used to prevent pneumococcus bacteria
infections such as pneumonia and septicaemia.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Plastics Group, a Taiwanese conglomerate, donated nearly 580,000
doses of PPV through its social welfare charity foundation to protect the
elderly from the threat of pneumonia, which struck the group's 91-year-old
founder Wang Yung-ching several years ago.</P>
      <P>As the immunity offered by PPV can last for five years, those who have been
inoculated within the last five years were advised not to get a shot this year.</P>
      <P>The shots are available at designated medical institutions, according to the
CDC.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Imbalanced life seen as main cause of ill-health: survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A survey on people's health knowledge shows that an imbalanced life pattern is
believed by most respondents to be the top cause of ill-health, according to the
survey results released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Common Health Magazine conducted the survey via telephone among people aged 18
or over Aug. 19-24, receiving 1,087 valid responses.</P>
      <P>A similar survey carried out 10 years ago by the same magazine showed that most
respondents at that time blamed congenital problems for poor health.</P>
      <P>The new survey shows that people have made progress in health knowledge, as the
smoking population is smaller, down from 21.4 percent of respondents to 17.76
percent, while more people eat breakfast, up from 64 percent to 77 percent.</P>
      <P>In addition, 53.7 percent of respondents exercise at least three times a week,
up form the 39 percent in the previous survey, the results show.</P>
      <P>However, nearly half of the respondents said they did not know that breakfast is
the most important meal of the day, and over 30 percent of them were unaware of
their waist size, which is an indicator of one's health condition, according to
the report.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 85.65 percent of respondents said they consider themselves healthy,
higher than the previous survey's 73.9 percent. However, cancer remained the
biggest worry for respondents, the same as in the previous survey 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>More females than males expressed worry about cancer -- 32.41 percent to 22.61
percent -- even though recent medical statistics show that the number of men who
died of cancer in 2007 was 1.7 times that of the number of women who died of the
disease, the report said.</P>
      <P>About 40 percent of the male respondents were unable to describe the location of
the prostate gland. Prostate cancer ranked the fifth-most-common form of cancer
in men, with 900 people dying of the disease every year on average, higher than
the number of women who die of cervical cancer each year on average, the report
said.</P>

      <P>Taipei City police smashed the largest-ever sex ring in the greater Taipei area
Wednesday, arresting nine people, including a chief suspect, accountants, pimps
and call girls, a spokesman said.</P>
      <P>After lengthy  tracking  and investigation,  Taipei  police authorities detained
the ring leader surnamed Lee, as well as drivers and prostitutes from China and
Indonesia in a raid early Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Police also confiscated hundreds of items, such as account books, monthly
reports, records of customers' sex deals and PDAs, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>All nine suspects were handed to Taipei prosecutors for further questioning on
charges of pandering, he said.</P>
      <P>Account books seized by police showed that the ring, which maintained more than
20 brothels and hired over 1,000 local and foreign sex workers -- mostly from
China and Southeast Asian countries, made several millions of New Taiwan dollars
each week until recently, making the ring the largest of its kind in the greater
Taipei area ever smashed by police, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Taipei policemen also discovered that the ring, in a bid to prevent from being
tracked down by law enforcement authorities, had compiled a large number of
newspaper files relating to news about sex trade and human trafficking.</P>
      <P>To the policemen's surprise, all these news clippings contained detailed
information about where, when and by whom criminal suspects in the same line of
illegal business were arrested, the spokesman noted.</P>

      <P>The five successive typhoons that hit Taiwan between July and September this
year have caused 16 deaths and NT$2.89 billion (US$90 million) in damage to
agricultural crops, but the upside is that most of Taiwan's reservoirs are full
or almost full.</P>
      <P>As of the end of September, five of the 15 storms in the western Pacific this
year had swept across Taiwan. They were Typhoon Kalmaegi on July 18, Typhoon
Fung-Wong on July 28, Typhoon Sinlaku on Sept. 12, Typhoon Hagupit on Sept. 22,
and Typhoon Jangmi on Sept. 27-28.</P>
      <P>According to a news release from the Water Resources Agency under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs, most of Taiwan's reservoirs are more than 90 percent full
as a result of the heavy rains brought by the typhoons.</P>
      <P>Three of the reservoirs -- Liyutan Reservoir in Miaoli County, Renyitan
Reservoir in Chiayi County, and Nanhua Reservoir in Tainan County -- are
brimming and are being allowed to overflow naturally, while Lantan Reservoir in
the city of Chiayi and Chengkung Reservoir in Penghu, an island west of Taiwan,
are almost full.</P>
      <P>Seven other reservoirs are more than 90 percent full. They are Feitsui
Reservoir, which supplies drinking water to the Taipei area; Shihmen Reservoir
in Taoyuan County; Baoshan reservoir and the Second Baoshan Reservoir in Hsinchu
County; Mingte Reservoir in Miaoli County; Tsengwen Reservoir -- Taiwan's
largest reservoir -- located in Tainan County; and Wushantou Reservoir, also in
Tainan County.</P>
      <P>At present, only the Sinshan Reservoir in Keelung, the Techi Reservoir in
Taichung County, the Shihgang Dam Reservoir in Taichung County, and the Mudan
Reservoir in Pingtung County are still less than 80 percent full.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is an island whose short rivers and streams, flowing from steep
mountains, can hardly retain the valuable resource. The people of Taiwan rely on
abundant rainfall for a secure water supply.</P>

      <P>The nation's top financial regulator expressed optimism about the prospects of
the country's stock market Wednesday, predicting that the local bourse will
regain momentum from late his year through the coming year.</P>
      <P>Gordon S. Chen, chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) made the
remarks while reporting to the ruling Kuomintang's (KMT's) Central Standing
Committee on measures to stabilize and develop the local stock market amid a
global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the committee's weekly meeting, Chen noted that between May 21 and
Sept. 26, Taiwan's bourse fell more sharply than the stock markets in the United
States, Japan, South Korea, and China. The KMT came to power on May 20.</P>
      <P>But for the period from Jan. 1 to Sept. 26, the drop in shares on the Taiwan
market was more moderate than in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore, he said.</P>
      <P>At present, 209 listed companies in Taiwan boast a stock price-earnings (P/E)
ratio of less than 10, and 171 others with a stock P/E ratio of between 10 and
15, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>These companies account for 60 percent of the listed companies in Taiwan, which
indicates that many stock prices have fallen below reasonable levels and are
worth buying, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In view of the slumping bourse, the Executive Yuan on Sept. 5 unveiled five
measure to help boost the market, he added.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, the government is seeking to build on the country's sound
fundamentals and introduce measures to revive investor confidence; encourage
directors and supervisors to buy back their companies' stocks; encourage blue-
chip companies to buy back treasury stocks; encourage venture capital companies
to solicit equity mutual funds to invest in the local bourse; and encourage
investors to buy equity mutual funds.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has been following the progress of the five initiatives, and
"measures such as encouraging companies to buy back treasury stocks and urging
directors and supervisors to buy back their own company stocks have borne
fruit," according to Chen.</P>
      <P>He also said that the FSC has banned short selling of stocks for two weeks, a
move that is also aimed at helping boost the local stock market. Short selling
of stocks, even at prices higher than the previous trading day, will be banned
until Oct. 14, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's share prices closed higher Wednesday, with the weighted index, the
market's key barometer, moving up 44.73 points, or 0.78 percent, to close at
5,764.01.</P>

      <P>Saint Kitts and Nevis, one of Taiwan's allies in the Caribbean, held a function
Wednesday in Taipei to celebrate the country's 25th anniversary of independence.</P>
      <P>Foreign diplomats and government officials present at the event includedg
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou, Vice
Foreign Minister Javier Hou, and Nicaraguan Ambassador to the Republic of China
William M. Tapia.</P>
      <P>Jasmine Huggins, Saint Kitts and Nevis charge d'affaires to Taiwan, began her
speech by expressing condolences to the families that lost loved ones during the
passage of Typhoon Jangmi. The function was postponed from Monday to Wednesday
because of the storm.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan was the first country to establish diplomatic relations with
the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis 25 years ago, Huggins said the Republic of
China on Taiwan has proved a friend to the Caribbean country.</P>
      <P>"Over the years, our close collaboration has brought mutual benefit  to both our
nations.  Out relations  have grown and strengthened to the point we are today
because they are based on the common ideals we share,"said Huggins.</P>
      <P>Dennis Merchant, Saint Kitts attorney general and minister of Justice and Legal
Affairs, said that his country highly treasures its friendship with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The opening of our embassy in the Republic of China in January of this year,
our first and only embassy in Asia, also signals our commitment to the
strengthening of our ties and bonds of friendship," he said.</P>
      <P>Ou said that his presence at the function was of extraordinary significance
because  he was a member  of the congratulatory delegations that celebrated the
independence of Saint Kitts and Nevis 25 years ago.</P>
      <P>"I'm so happy to be here and this indicates the profound and long lasting
friendship shared by Taiwan and Saint Kitts and Nevis, " he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan became the first diplomatic ally of Saint Kitts and Nevis after its
independence on Sept. 19, 1983 and the two forged diplomatic ties on Oct. 9 that

established an embassy in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Agricultural losses due to Typhoon Jangmi had soared to NT$1.63 billion
(US$50.74 million) as of Wednesday noon, according to statistics released by the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>The COA said that Jangmi, which pummeled Taiwan Sept. 27-28, caused serious
damage to the agricultural sector in six counties, with Changhua and Taichung
counties in central Taiwan being the hardest-hit.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that damage to agricultural crops accounted for NT$1.46
billion, as 21 percent of the crops on a total of 42,486 hectares of farmland
were lost.</P>
      <P>The crops that suffered the heaviest damage included rice, grapes, persimmons,
bananas, tangerines, papayas, guavas, maize, shallots and custard apples.</P>
      <P>Some NT$5.61 million worth of poultry perished because of flooding caused by the
storm, while damage to poultry farm facilities reached NT$22.22 million.</P>
      <P>The losses suffered by the aquaculture sector totaled NT$81.89 million, with

      <P>Lotus Pond in Zuoying, a district of the southern port city of Kaohsiung, will
soon be ready for the water sports events in the 2009 World Games to be held in
Taiwan's second largest city next July, after a 10-month dredging project to
make the water at least three meters deep.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Public Works Bureau of the Kaohsiung city government said
Wednesday that they will ask the Kaohsiung Irrigation Association to begin
filling the 42-hectare lake from Oct. 5, and that it will take about two weeks
for the water to get to least three meters deep, in line with the international
standards for water skiing, wakeboarding, canoe polo, and an invitational dragon
boat race.</P>
      <P>The officials also said that to keep the water in Lotus Pond clean, they will
enforce inspections to prevent the discharge of sewage water from adjacent
neighborhoods into the lake.</P>
      <P>The dredging project, which began in December last year, was completed at a cost
of NT$155 million (US$4.83 million). Workers first had to empty the lake and
move all fish, turtles, shellfish and other water creatures to aquaculture
facilities.</P>
      <P>The bottom of the lake was then dredged, excavated and leveled to allow for a
depth of least three meters deep for the water sports.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the dredging project will increase the water storage
capacity of Lotus Pond by 370,000 cubic meters, and an added benefit will be
better flood prevention in the area during the typhoon season.</P>
      <P>Lotus Pond, called Lianchihtan in Chinese, is a well-known scenic spot in
southern Taiwan. The lake, 1.4 km long and 400 meters wide, is fed by the
Gaoping River. It once covered 75 hectares, but has shrunk to 42 hectares. The
lake is considered a sacred religious place because it is surrounded by quite a
few temples.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung, the second largest city in Taiwan, has been awarded the right to host
the next World Games July 16-26, 2009, which are expected to draw 4,600 athletes

      <P>The China government's sovereign wealth fund (SWF) will be excluded from the
categories of Chinese capital allowed to enter the Taiwan market due to its
special nature, said a senior official  of the Cabinet-level  Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chiarman Fu Dong-cheng made the statement in response to questions from
the media following a meeting held by the government earlier in the day to
discuss the feasibility of creating such a fund to help bolster Taiwan's bearish
stock market and revitalize its economy amid the U.S. financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Fu said the government's failure to meet its Sept. 30 deadline for completion of
its policy on opening Taiwan's market to Chinese investments was due to the fact
that China has not yet put Taiwan on its list of 135 countries and areas
eligible for its outbound investments.</P>
      <P>It would not be beneficial to Taiwan if it unilaterally opens its market to
Chinese capital, he said.</P>

      <P>Although a date has not yet been fixed for the planned visit to Taiwan by a key
Beijing official, issues relating to the toxic milk products imported from China
are likely to be discussed in his meeting with Taiwanese officials here,
Taiwan's top negotiator with China said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) , said the two sides are still working to reach an agreement on the date
for a visit to Taiwan by his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>There have been wide speculations that Chen might visit Taiwan in late October
in what would be a follow-up to an SEF-ARATS meeting in Beijing in June when the
two men clinched two milestone accords to step up two-way tourism and
transportation services.</P>
      <P>Asked whether  he would seek a public apology  from Chen and compensation from
the culpable Chinese companies for Taiwanese consumers over the melamine-tainted
Chinese milk powder and vegetable-based protein food addictives issue, Chiang
said that "the two sides will exchange opinions on all topics put forward in the
SEF-ARATS talks."</P>
      <P>"It has been the government's stance to discuss and settle issues pertaining to
cross-Taiwan Strait economic development via the SEF-ARATS platform," he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are expected to discuss the opening of direct cross-strait
cargo charter  flights and shipping  links,  the establishment of new passenger
charter flight routes, and joint oil exploration in the Taiwan Strait and crime-
fighting, in their next round of negotiations.</P>
      <P>"If the two sides reach agreements in these areas, it would greatly upgrade
Taiwan's competitive edge, and I believe that this is a development the Taiwan
people have long hoped for," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the recent scare in Taiwan over imports of melamine-contaminated
Chinese milk products and malt extract, Chiang said that a fact-finding
delegation composed of Taiwanese experts that visited Beijing last weekend will
contribute to future bilateral contacts and cooperation in food safety control.
The delegation returned home Monday.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen met for the first time for the initial round of SEF-ARATS
negotiations in June in Beijing, clinching two accords on the opening of direct

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's new representative to Japan John Feng expressed the hope Wednesday that
both countries would maintain friendly relations and mutual trust.</P>
      <P>Feng made the remarks at a welcome party hosted by Japan's largest pro-Taiwan
parliamentary group, Japan-ROC Dietmen's Council.</P>
      <P>More than 50 Japanese parliamentarians of the multipartisian group attended the
function. Japanese Finance Minister Shoichi Nakagawa and People's New Party
leader Tamisuke Watanuki were also present.</P>
      <P>Council head Takeo Hiranuma, in his introduction of Feng, said that the envoy
studied in Japanese elementary and junior high school for five years as Feng's
father was an ROC diplomat stationed in Japan at the time.</P>
      <P>Feng is a seasoned diplomat who is trusted by President Ma Ying-jeou, Hiranuma
noted.</P>
      <P>He further said that there are many issues between Taiwan and Japan that need to
be addressed and resolved with the help of the council, and he called for all
members to work toward promoting bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>In his address, Feng praised the council for the role it plays in promoting
bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>The boat collision incident in the disputed Tiaoyutai islands in East China Sea
earlier this year was "regrettable," Feng said.</P>
      <P>He added that President Ma, who attaches great importance to Taiwan-Japan
relations, has instructed him to resume and build on Taiwan's friendly relations
with Japan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, Japan and China all claim rights to the Tiaoyutai Islands.</P>
      <P>The controversy over the sovereignty  of the island group reignited in June when
a Taiwanese recreation fishing boat sank after it collided with a Japanese
patrol vessel on June 10 near the Tiaoyutai Islands, known as the Senkaku
Islands in Japanese.</P>
      <P>Japan has since apologized to the Taiwanese ship owner over the incident, but
talks on compensation to the boat owner have stalled.</P>
      <P>Feng expressed the hope that the council will continue to wield its influence to
strengthen the ties between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>The council, currently comprised of around 240 members, was established by
Japanese Dietmen after the ROC and Japan severed diplomatic ties in 1972.</P>
      <P>Feng later attended  a dinner party hosted by Interchange Association (Japan)
Chairman Reijiro Hattori and the association's President Atsushi Hatakenaka.</P>

Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) informed its
Taiwanese counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), earlier in the day
that none of the newly published 31 batches of dairy products manufactured by 20
Chinese companies were tested positive for melamine, a toxic chemical usually
used to make plastics.</P>
      <P>The ARATS stressed in its report that except for a shipment of 25 tons of Sanlu-
brand milk powder exported to Taiwan from China that was found in mid-September
to have been adulterated with melamine, no other tainted dairy products have
been sold to Taiwan. The intermediary body further said most of the tainted
products were produced by Sanlu Group -- the largest dairy producer in China,
and its affiliates.</P>
      <P>Wang said the ARATS report complies with the DOH's initial investigative
results. Nevertheless, he added, the DOH will make a further inspection in terms
of detailed information provided by the ARATS about corporate name list,
shipment numbers and China's examination reports to verify whether any other
tainted products have entered Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Saint Kitts and Nevis, one of Taiwan's allies in the Caribbean, held a function
Wednesday in Taipei to celebrate the country's 25th anniversary of independence.</P>
      <P>Foreign diplomats and government officials present at the event includedg
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou, Vice
Foreign Minister Javier Hou, and Nicaraguan Ambassador to the Republic of China
William M. Tapia.</P>
      <P>Jasmine Huggins, Saint Kitts and Nevis charge d'affaires to Taiwan, began her
speech by expressing condolences to the families that lost loved ones during the
passage of Typhoon Jangmi. The function was postponed from Monday to Wednesday
because of the storm.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan was the first country to establish diplomatic relations with
the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis 25 years ago, Huggins said the Republic of
China on Taiwan has proved a friend to the Caribbean country.</P>
      <P>"Over the years, our close collaboration has brought mutual benefit  to both our
nations.  Out relations  have grown and strengthened to the point we are today
because they are based on the common ideals we share,"said Huggins.</P>
      <P>Dennis Merchant, Saint Kitts attorney general and minister of Justice and Legal
Affairs, said that his country highly treasures its friendship with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The opening of our embassy in the Republic of China in January of this year,
our first and only embassy in Asia, also signals our commitment to the
strengthening of our ties and bonds of friendship," he said.</P>
      <P>Ou said that his presence at the function was of extraordinary significance
because  he was a member  of the congratulatory delegations that celebrated the
independence of Saint Kitts and Nevis 25 years ago.</P>
      <P>"I'm so happy to be here and this indicates the profound and long lasting
friendship shared by Taiwan and Saint Kitts and Nevis, " he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan became the first diplomatic ally of Saint Kitts and Nevis after its
independence on Sept. 19, 1983 and the two forged diplomatic ties on Oct. 9 that
same year. The country is the only one of Taiwan's five Caribbean allies to have
established an embassy in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Agricultural losses due to Typhoon Jangmi had soared to NT$1.63 billion
(US$50.74 million) as of Wednesday noon, according to statistics released by the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>The COA said that Jangmi, which pummeled Taiwan Sept. 27-28, caused serious
damage to the agricultural sector in six counties, with Changhua and Taichung
counties in central Taiwan being the hardest-hit.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that damage to agricultural crops accounted for NT$1.46
billion, as 21 percent of the crops on a total of 42,486 hectares of farmland
were lost.</P>
      <P>The crops that suffered the heaviest damage included rice, grapes, persimmons,
bananas, tangerines, papayas, guavas, maize, shallots and custard apples.</P>
      <P>Some NT$5.61 million worth of poultry perished because of flooding caused by the
storm, while damage to poultry farm facilities reached NT$22.22 million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kaohsiung's Lotus Pond ready for 2009 World Games water sports</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lotus Pond in Zuoying, a district of the southern port city of Kaohsiung, will
soon be ready for the water sports events in the 2009 World Games to be held in
Taiwan's second largest city next July, after a 10-month dredging project to
make the water at least three meters deep.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Public Works Bureau of the Kaohsiung city government said
Wednesday that they will ask the Kaohsiung Irrigation Association to begin
filling the 42-hectare lake from Oct. 5, and that it will take about two weeks
for the water to get to least three meters deep, in line with the international
standards for water skiing, wakeboarding, canoe polo, and an invitational dragon
boat race.</P>
      <P>The officials also said that to keep the water in Lotus Pond clean, they will
enforce inspections to prevent the discharge of sewage water from adjacent
neighborhoods into the lake.</P>
      <P>The dredging project, which began in December last year, was completed at a cost
of NT$155 million (US$4.83 million). Workers first had to empty the lake and
move all fish, turtles, shellfish and other water creatures to aquaculture
facilities.</P>
      <P>The bottom of the lake was then dredged, excavated and leveled to allow for a
depth of least three meters deep for the water sports.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the dredging project will increase the water storage
capacity of Lotus Pond by 370,000 cubic meters, and an added benefit will be
better flood prevention in the area during the typhoon season.</P>
      <P>Lotus Pond, called Lianchihtan in Chinese, is a well-known scenic spot in
southern Taiwan. The lake, 1.4 km long and 400 meters wide, is fed by the
Gaoping River. It once covered 75 hectares, but has shrunk to 42 hectares. The
lake is considered a sacred religious place because it is surrounded by quite a
few temples.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung, the second largest city in Taiwan, has been awarded the right to host
the next World Games July 16-26, 2009, which are expected to draw 4,600 athletes
from some 100 countries.</P>

      <P>The China government's sovereign wealth fund (SWF) will be excluded from the
categories of Chinese capital allowed to enter the Taiwan market due to its
special nature, said a senior official  of the Cabinet-level  Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chiarman Fu Dong-cheng made the statement in response to questions from
the media following a meeting held by the government earlier in the day to
discuss the feasibility of creating such a fund to help bolster Taiwan's bearish
stock market and revitalize its economy amid the U.S. financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Fu said the government's failure to meet its Sept. 30 deadline for completion of
its policy on opening Taiwan's market to Chinese investments was due to the fact
that China has not yet put Taiwan on its list of 135 countries and areas
eligible for its outbound investments.</P>
      <P>It would not be beneficial to Taiwan if it unilaterally opens its market to
Chinese capital, he said.</P>
      <P>A sovereign wealth fund is a state-owned investment fund composed of financial

    <HEADLINE>Foreign investors urged to use Taiwan as springboard to East Asia</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 2 (CNA)
10/02/08  14:25:41
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's industry clusters, ideal location and expanding opportunities from the
normalization of cross-strait trade relations provide a clear edge for foreign
investors looking to strengthen their presence in East Asia, Economic Affairs
Minister Yiin Chii-ming said recently.</P>
      <P>Urging multinational enterprises to invest in Taiwan, Yiin said, they can
capitalize on industry clusters, local talent and the internationalization
experience of local businesses to sharpen their competitive edge.</P>
      <P>"They could use Taiwan as a stepping stone to make inroads into East Asia, " he
said. "After all, East Asia has seen the fastest economic growth in the world."</P>
      <P>Yiin made his push for foreign investment less than two weeks before the opening
of the three-day  Taiwan Business Alliance Conference, which will highlight
Taiwan's investment opportunities for visiting world business leaders.</P>
      <P>The event will take place at the Taipei International Convention Center from
Oct. 6-7. Customized fact-finding trips will be arranged exclusively for
potential investors on October 8.</P>
      <P>Yiin noted that the conference has received an enthusiastic response so far,
with in excess of 1,000 businesspeople from more than 30 countries (including
more than 300 overseas Chinese and Taiwanese) registering for the event,
according to Department of Investment Services (DOIS) figures.</P>
      <P>Among them, around 300 entrepreneurs are from China, showing that Chinese
businesses are interested in cooperation with Taiwanese businesses, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>When asked about Taiwan's main competitive advantage at a time when the global
economy is sluggish, Yiin first cited "our excellent industry clusters."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is the supply chain center of the high-tech industry, " Yiin said. "A
lot of IC and IT products and their key parts and components are produced and
manufactured in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The strength of that supply chain is one of the main reasons why U.S.-based
Business Week featured "Why Taiwan Matters" as its May 16, 2005 cover story. The
article asserted that the global economy "couldn't function" without the island.</P>
      <P>Given their ambition to compete on the global stage, many businesses in Taiwan
also have experience in internationalizing their operations, which has spawned a
pool of talent well versed in internationalization and considerable experience
in logistics management, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>He also touted Taiwan's superb geographical location. "From Taiwan to the major
cities in Asia -- be it Tokyo, Seoul, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, or Sydney
-- the distance is the shortest and only a few hours are needed.</P>
      <P>"With surging oil prices, the control of transportation costs is especially
important, " Yiin said. "Whoever has the best location will get the most
opportunities."</P>
      <P>The government's policy to ease restrictions on commerce with China also means
that cross-strait trade is set to move along a more open and normalized course.</P>
      <P>One example cited by Yiin is the government's move to raise the cap on local
enterprises' investment in China to up to 60 percent of their net worth, from
the previous 40 percent. And those companies headquartered in Taiwan will be
exempt from such a restriction.</P>
      <P>The easing of restrictions will make it easier for companies to use Taiwan as a
springboard to China, Yiin said, and he urged foreign investors to cooperate
with Taiwanese enterprises to better harness the opportunities of the Greater
China market.</P>
      <P>Yiin noted that "we are historically and culturally linked with China and speak
the same language. We have more than 100,000 enterprises with investments in
China, and they have good connections with those in power there."</P>
      <P>The economics minister said the government is still discussing future tax reform
initiatives, but stressed that the Statute to Upgrade Industry, under which
high-tech companies investing in Taiwan can get five-year tax holidays and
various investment incentives, remains valid until the end of 2009.</P>
      <P>"Enterprises that invest by the end of next year will still be covered by the
statute and able to enjoy the incentives, " he added.</P>
      <P>Yiin said that Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has instructed the Ministry of Economic
Affairs to make attracting foreign investment its highest priority.</P>
      <P>This year's business alliance conference, he said, hopes to attract more
newcomers and not just foreign enterprises that have already invested in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During the conference, President Ma Ying-jeou will present awards to nine
foreign businesses that have made big contributions to Taiwan, and the ministry
will also sign letters of investment intent with around 14 foreign businesses,
Yiin said. More information about the upcoming conference is available at

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan working to lift study restrictions on expatriate students</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2 (CNA)
10/02/08  17:11:30

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is working to lift a restriction that discourages expatriate
students from continuing their study in Taiwan, as part of its effort to attract
more overseas talent, Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission Minister Wu Ying-
yih said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remark while delivering a report to the Legislative Yuan's Foreign
Affairs and National Defense Committee. He was referring to a rule that requires
overseas compatriots who completed their undergraduate studies in Taiwan to
remain abroad for at least two years in order to qualify for further study in
Taiwan under the designation of "overseas compatriot students."</P>
      <P>Every year, Taiwan universities allocate a certain number of places for
"overseas compatriot students" -- a category that is defined as Taiwanese who
have lived abroad for at least six years or foreign-born nationals of Chinese
ancestry.</P>
      <P>However, if students in this group wish to continue on to graduate school after
they have earned their bachelor's degrees in Taiwan, they are required to leave
the country for at least two years before they can apply for admission under the
category of "overseas compatriot students."</P>
      <P>If these students  intend to remain in the country after undergraduate study,
they are allowed to take the entrance exams, as other local students are
required to do. However, it has been observed that they tend to be at a
disadvantage because their Chinese-language ability is usually not on par with
that of other local students.</P>
      <P>According  to Wu,  the regulation  discourages  outstanding expatriate students
from remaining in Taiwan to further their studies and to work. The OCAC is
currently coordinating with the Ministry of Education to revise the related
regulations to remove this hurdle, he added.</P>
      <P>With the international movement of talent becoming a global trend, countries
such as New Zealand and Singapore have been offering various incentives in order
to recruit outstanding foreign students and to encourage them to work in those
countries after graduation, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>To encourage more expatriate students to study in Taiwan, the OCAC is planning
to enact an expatriate education law to apply the same regulations to "overseas
compatriot students" as to foreign students, he said.</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that although most "overseas compatriot students" studying in
Taiwan are foreign nationals, the regulations are less favorable to them than to
non-ethnic Chinese foreign students.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, the scholarship programs for foreign students are better
than those for "overseas compatriot students."</P>
      <P>OCAC statistics show that a total of 2,009 "overseas compatriot students" have
applied to study in Taiwan universities in the 2008-2009 academic year, an
increase of 24 percent over the previous year.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) expressed gratitude to Taiwan's
diplomatic allies that spoke in support of the country's bid to join the United
Nations at the U.N. General Assembly last month, according to a press statement
released by the MOFA Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The statement noted that 18 of Taiwan's 23 diplomatic allies in Asia-Pacific,
Latin America and Africa voiced support for Taiwan's efforts to seek "meaningful
participation" in U.N. specialized agencies, in the General Assembly's annual
session which took place in New York from Sept. 23-29.</P>
      <P>The United States, the European Union, and Japan also backed Taiwan's U.N. bid
this year, the statement said.</P>
      <P>In addition, representatives of Singapore and New Zealand said that they were
pleased to see improvements in Taiwan-China relations and they encouraged the
two sides to continue their dialogue.</P>
      <P>According to the MOFA, this level of support shows that Taiwan's bid for
meaningful participation in U.N. specialized agencies has gained approval in the
international community.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Traces of malamine found in brand name milk powder from China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) announced Thursday that six kinds of Nestle milk
powder manufactured in China were found to contain the toxic chemical melamine,
and said it will request a recall of all 20 Nestle milk products on the market,
even though the level of melamine found was too small to pose a health threat.</P>
      <P>"The quantity of the chemical was very small, so the products are still safe and
will not have any effects on health, but to protect consumers' rights and
safety, we have asked the company to pull all its milk powder products from
store shelves, " said DOH Minister Yeh Ching-chuan at a press conference.</P>
      <P>@He said that most of the questionable Nestle products can be removed from store
shelves within 24 hours.</P>
      <P>A random test conducted by local health bureaus found 0.06 ppm (parts per
million) to 0.85 ppm of melamine in the milk powder made between February 2007
and June 2008 by the Shuangcheng Nestle company located in Helongjiang province
in northern China, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Nestle, which also produces Klim milk power, is one of Taiwan's leading brands
of infant and adult milk products.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that the milk powder had tested negative for melamine before the DOH
decided to employ the most sensitive test -- liquid chromatography/tandem mass
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS).</P>
      <P>@LC/MS/MS is a high-sensitivity analytical technique used to detect and identify
specific chemicals, and can detect melamine levels as low as 0.05 ppm.@@</P>
      <P>The DOH announced Wednesday that all imported and locally made dairy products
and food containing vegetable-based proteins should be tested using LC/MS/MS,
and only those that test negative for melamine will be allowed on the market.@@</P>
      <P>Nestle milk products were previously classified as safe, as they were tested by
means of a less sensitive technique than LC/MS/MS, said Yeh, reiterating that
the products will however not cause any damage to people's health.@@</P>
      <P>Yeh also said that the DOH will invite experts from Japan, the United States and
the European Union to Taiwan to exchange views on the food safety issue before
next Sunday, in the hope that local regulations can be brought in line with
international standards.@</P>
      <P>The whole  (made-in-China  milk contamination)  issue has highlighted the urgent
need for Taiwan's meaningful participation in the Word Health Organization," Yeh
stressed.</P>
      <P>@The Nestle products were allowed on the market in late September, along with
the products of other 17 importers from China, after they were tested for
melamine. Yeh did not rule out the possibility that the other 17 companies may
face a similar problem.</P>
      <P>@The DOH had earlier altered the standard for acceptable levels of melamine
content in food to 2.5 ppm.</P>
      <P>@But the revision caused panic among consumers, who agitated for a "zero
content" standard, and led to the resignation of then-DOH Minister Lin Fang-yue
last week.@With Taiwan's safety standard for melamine content reset at
"undetectable, " products that contain from 0.05 to 2.4 ppm of the industrial
chemical may not be allowed on store shelves.</P>
      <P>Melamine can cause kidney stones and kidney failure if consumed in sufficient
quantity. Baby formula containing the toxic chemical has caused at least four
deaths and sickened more than 54,000 in China.</P>

      <P>Taiwan can learn a lot from the United Kingdom in the areas of sustainable
architecture and sustainable public construction and hopes to attract the
participation of other countries, including the U.K., in its "i-Taiwan 12
projects," Chern Jenn-chuan,  vice chairperson  of the Executive  Yuan's Public
Construction Commission (PCC), said Thursday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"Given the fact that the U.K. is well-known in the world for its expertise in
sustainable public construction and architecture, it can serve as a model for
Taiwan, " Chern said in an international seminar on "U.K. Waterfront
Regeneration and Sustainable Construction" held by the British Trade and
Cultural Office (BTCO) and the PCC.</P>
      <P>Chaired by Nigel Peters, the director of British Expertise, the seminar
attracted representatives from noted British engineering and development
companies such as Arup, Benoy, Fulcrum Consulting, Terry Farrells Group, Paul
Davies and Partners, and Mott McDonald.</P>
      <P>Chern said attracting the participation of foreign companies in public
construction projects, such as the i-Taiwan 12 projects, is one of the major
tasks of the government.</P>
      <P>"By attracting domestic, foreign and private investment, the government hopes to
increase domestic demand in the face of the global economic downturn, " he said,
adding that he hopes the companies participating the seminar would try to
solicit more interest in the i-Taiwan projects in the U.K. when they return.</P>
      <P>Describing the vision and the funding needed for the i-Taiwan projects as "truly
ambitious," BTCO Director Michael Reilly said that "development of this scale
will require a joint effort from both the public and private sectors.
International investors are able to contribute -- we hope they will do so.</P>
      <P>Reilly said that Taiwan faces exactly the same opportunities and challenges as
the U.K. Despite wanting to make their cities more attractive places to live,
neither Taiwan nor the U.K. has the luxury of vast open spaces in which to start
from the beginning, he added.</P>
      <P>He said developments do not need to be big to work and the U.K. has had some
great successes in small-scale regeneration and it is ready to share its
experiences with Taiwan -- good and not so good.</P>
      <P>The i-Taiwan national construction projects, one of Mas major economic
platforms, proposes putting US$120 billion over the next eight years into
stimulating the domestic economy and lowering the unemployment rate by creating
120,000 job opportunities each year.</P>
      <P>The i-Taiwan 12 projects include an island-wide transportation network, a free
trade zone and eco-port in Kaohsiung, a sea and air logistics hub in Taichung,
an international air city in Yaoyuan, urban and industrial zone renewal and
coastal regeneration.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung City government vowed Thursday to strengthen its screening of
factory emissions, amid concerns that a partially state-owned steel company
based in the port city may be releasing high volumes of carbon dioxide into the
air.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Councilor Wu ming-tzu said in a question-and-answer session in
the city council that China Steel Corp. emits 21.78 million metric tons of
carbon dioxide a year, accounting for 55 percent of air pollutants in the city.</P>
      <P>China Steel also emits the toxic chemical dioxin, which he said is a threat to
public health.</P>
      <P>"China Steel, as one of the leading state-owned enterprises, has not fulfilled
its social responsibilities," Wu said.</P>
      <P>He said that China Steel records a yearly surplus of NT$60 billion (US$1.875
billion), but only paid NT$385 million in taxes to Kaohsiung. The central
government allocated an additional grant of NT$1.51 billion from a tax
redistribution fund to Kaohsiung City, and China Steel donated another NT$35
million to the city as a feedback, he added.</P>
      <P>"All these figures show that most of the huge profits of the company end up in
pockets of its staff and shareholders," Wu said.</P>
      <P>He asked the city's Environmental Protection Bureau Director Xiao Yu-zheng to
purchase equipment that will be able to detect the level of air pollutants and
thus monitor state-owned enterprises such as China Steel and Taiwan Fertilizer.
In fact, both companies have been privatized, with government stakes falling
below 50 percent.</P>
      <P>"Once violations are found, the city government should impose fines on the
companies concerned," Wu suggested.</P>
      <P>For his part, Xiao said the volume of carbon dioxide emissions in the city is
39.68 million metric tons annually, accounting for around 11 percent of the
nation's emissions.</P>
      <P>Suspended particles and volatile organic compounds are also released by China
Steel, causing deterioration of the air quality in the city's Chiencheng and
Xiaokang districts, he added.</P>
      <P>Xiao promised to step up its screening of the production process of plants and
other facilities to mitigate the pollution effects.</P>

      <P>Taiwan expatriates are welcome to return home for National Day celebrations,
regardless of their political affiliation, Overseas Compatriots Affairs
Commission (OCAC) Minister Wu Ying-yih said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The government  is inviting all Taiwanese expatriates  to participate in the
Oct. 10 National Day activities at home, and each of them would be given a
subsidy of NT$3,200 (about US$100) as long as he or she joins an OCAC-designated
domestic travel tour during the festive period," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks in a legislative question-and-answer session while fielding
questions from opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers who
claimed that the OCAC, with an additional budget of NT$15 million to serve that
end, has invited only pro-Kuomintang (KMT) overseas nationals to return home for
National Day activities.</P>
      <P>"I would welcome with open arms the return of members of the Formosan
Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) to join the Oct. 10 National Day
celebrations and would treat them to something special if they are willing to do
so," he said.</P>
      <P>The FAPA is a pro-Taiwan independence group headquartered in the United States.</P>
      <P>Wu estimated that some 10,000 ROC nationals -- double the previous average --
would return to Taiwan for National Day celebrations this year. As in the past,
the OCAC will offer them a subsidy if they take any of the OCAC-organized
domestic trips during the holiday period, he said.</P>
      <P>To encourage more overseas compatriots to travel around Taiwan during their
vacation, the OCAC has added visits to local small- and medium-sized companies
and health checks at hospitals as new options, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Over 65% of workers planning to earn master's degree: survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 65 percent of workers with a bachelor's degree are planning to earn a
master's degree to try to advance their career, although a higher academic
qualification is not necessarily helpful, according to the results of a survey
released Thursday by an online employment broker.</P>
      <P>Conducted by 104 Job Bank in cooperation with Global Views Monthly, the survey
found that the most common reasons mentioned by the respondents for pursuing a
master's degree are: holding the degree will increase their chances for
promotion, enhance their professional abilities, and help them get higher pay.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 18.5 percent of the respondents said they are
concerned that "holding a bachelor's degree may not guarantee them a good job."</P>
      <P>However, the experience of respondents with a master's or doctorate degree show
that obtaining an additional diploma does not automatically lead to better
employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>Slightly more than 41 percent of master's or doctorate degree holders complained
that having high academic qualifications has not helped their employment quest,
and sometimes has even made it more difficult for them to find a job.</P>
      <P>By contrast, 58.8 percent of master's or doctorate degree holders said their
academic qualifications have made their job search easier, and 66.3 percent said
the qualifications have helped them get higher starting salaries or higher
positions.</P>
      <P>Also, 38.4 percent of the respondents said the qualifications have increased
their chances of being assigned important projects, and 37.8 percent said the
qualifications have raised their chances of entering large companies or foreign
companies.</P>
      <P>The survey found that the most popular  fields among the respondents intending
to enter a master's program are business and management; engineering; language
and humanities; political science, economics, sociology and psychology; and
mathematics and computer science.</P>
      <P>However, the sectors that businesses think have the highest demand for workers
with master's degree holders are those related to business and management,
engineering, medical and health care, industrial technology, mathematics, and
computer science.</P>
      <P>For the year to come, the positions where a master's degree is preferred include
engineering research and development personnel, software engineering personnel,
finance and insurance agents, server operators, and product or project managers,
according to the results.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted Aug. 18-25 among 1,014 businesses and 1,892 workers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP mulling street protest over melamine scandal</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Pingtung,  Oct.  2 (CNA)
10/02/08  21:06:29

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Wednesday publicly
expressed its discontent over the government's handling of the melamine tainted
food scandal, and would not rule out the possibility of staging a street protest
to demonstrate its dissatisfaction.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued Wednesday by the DPP Central Standing Committee and the
DPP-governed city and county governments, the party said it will ask
supermarkets nationwide to set up special zones for Taiwan-made products to help
consumers determine what is safe to buy.</P>
      <P>It also said it plans to collaborate with civic groups to label their products
"China-Free" in light of a recent food safety scare following the discoveries of
melamine-contaminated food imports from China.</P>
      <P>The statement was released on the sidelines of the party's Central Standing
Committee meeting held in the southernmost county of Pingtung.</P>
      <P>To show their support for local industries, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen and
party members drank domestically produced fresh milk and ate bread during the
meeting, DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang told reporters after the meeting.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the DPP will also help local companies, whose sales were affected by
the food scare,  put their products through inspections for melamine, the
chemical used to make plastics and fertilizer which has been used as a fake
protein additive in dairy products originating from China.</P>
      <P>Tsai agreed at the meeting to consider DPP Legislator William Lai's suggestion
that the party should take to the streets to protest against the government's
handling of the tainted milk powder incident regardless of whether Chen Yunlin,
president of the Beijing-based quasi-official Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), will visit Taiwan in October, according to Cheng.</P>
      <P>The tainted milk scandal has undermined public confidence in the government
since government officials flip-flopped on local standards on the maximum amount
of melamine allowable in food and failed to guarantee food safety. As a result
of the tainted milk incident, Lin Fang-yu has been forced to resign from his
position as Department of Health minister.</P>
      <P>In its statement,  the DPP also  blasted  the  Kuomintang administration for its
recent decision to adopt the Hanyu Pinyin system, a Chinese Romanization system
developed and adopted by the People's Republic of China in 1979, noting that
promoting the use of the system in Taiwan, which uses mostly the Tongyong Pinyin
system, would cost the country more than NT$4 billion, or even NT$7 billion, and
would create confusion expected to last for five to six years.</P>
      <P>The statement said the adoption of Hanyu Pinyin was based on the consideration
of ideological issues and the government's attempt to tilt towards China by
using the China-developed system.</P>
      <P>The administration, however, has said it adopted the system because  this would
enable  Taiwan  to enhance  the country's international competitiveness and to
become better connected with the rest of the world, which uses the Hanyu Pinyin
system.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai said after DPP meeting Wednesday that the party is scheduled to
finalize the nominations of its local election candidates for city and county
chiefs by the end of this year and the nominations of candidates for township
chiefs, city mayors, and city and county councilors by the end of next February.</P>
      <P>Touching on former President Chen Shui-bian's attendance at a rally Wednesday in
Sanchung City, Taipei County, organized by DPP lawmaker Yu Tian, Tsai said that
it's up to individual party members to decide whether to attend such gatherings.
She denied the party has tried to distance itself from Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen is under investigations for alleged embezzlement of public funds by using
other people's receipts to gain reimbursement from his "state affairs fund" and
for suspected money laundering by his family members.</P>

      <P>Kinmen-based coast guard patrol ships launched a crackdown on intruding Chinese
fishing boats in waters off Taiwan-controlled island of Kinmen Thursday, nabbing
four Chinese vessels and 16 people.</P>
      <P>During the crackdown -- part of the "Ching Hai" campaign aimed at preventing
poaching by Chinese fishing boats in Taiwan's territorial waters and better
protecting Taiwan's fishery resources -- 15 other Chinese fishing boats were
also chased out of Kinmen waters, the Kinmen operations of the Cabinet-level
Coast Guard Administration said.</P>
      <P>In collaboration with the Kinmen county government and the Kinmen Fishermen's
Association, the Kinmen coast guard also confiscated some 100 items of fishing
gear, including around 3,000 meters of fishing nets, the coast guard said.</P>
      <P>The "Ching Hai" campaign is also designed to clear up maritime traffic routes
between Kinmen and the Chinese province of Fujian to facilitate the
implementation of expanded shipping links between the two sides of the strait,

      <P>Agricultural losses due to Typhoon Jangmi had risen to NT$2.14 billion (US$66.5
million) as of Thursday, according to statistics released that day by the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>Typhoon Jangmi lashed Taiwan last weekend, causing serious damage to the
agricultural sector in six conties in central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The affected areas are eligible to receive cash subsidies from the central
government to help them get back on their feet.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that 22 percent of the crops on a total of 57,187 hectares
of farmland were lost.</P>
      <P>The crops that suffered the heaviest damage included rice, grapes, persimmons,
bananas, oranges, pears, maize, peanuts, papayas, guavas, shallots and bell
fruit.</P>
      <P>This year's rice production suffered an estimated reduction of 5,000 tons to
10,000 tons due to the typhoon, but those losses will not have an impact on next
year's rice price, as the country as a whole has annual production of 1.3
million tons, COA Deputy Minister Huang You-tsai said Thursday.</P>
      <P>But he added that the COA will release stored rice if necessary to ensure
sufficient supplies to maintain stable prices.</P>

      <P>The Chiayi city government in southern Taiwan is looking forward to a large
influx of visitors to the city for the Oct. 10 National Day official fireworks
display sponsored by the central government, but is worried that the capricious
weather might not cooperate.</P>
      <P>Anxious to see all Double Ten festivities proceed as planned, Chiayi Deputy
Mayor Lee Shi-jin led the city government's department heads Thursday to pray
for good weather Oct. 10.</P>
      <P>They visited four temples in the city -- the Yuhuang Temple, the Chenghuang
Temple, the Dizang Temple and the Yuan Fu Temple -- to pay homage by burning
joss sticks and praying for fine weather.</P>
      <P>Lee told reporters that the fireworks display -- the first official National Day
fireworks show to be staged in Chiayi by the central government -- is an
extremely important event and that the city cannot afford to see it spoiled by
bad weather.</P>
      <P>Noting that Oct. 10 is a Friday, Lee estimated that up to 200,000 visitors,
including tourists and Taiwanese expatriates from abroad, will flood into Chiayi
over the long weekend to attend a series of National Day celebrations, visit
spots of interest, and see what life is like in the city.</P>
      <P>The city government has selected a farm belonging to the Chiayi Agricultural
Station, which is adjacent to Chiayi Park, as the site for the fireworks
display.</P>
      <P>A giant red balloon with a diameter of five meters has been tethered 100 meters

    <TEXT>
      <P>In a bid to help police detect new types of illicit drugs, Taipei county
policemen have been ordered to gain a better knowledge  of them through drug
mules detained by law enforcement agents, a spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The prime purpose of the measure is to clamp down on new illicit drugs so as to
improve social order, as drugs are closely linked to the growing number of
burglaries, robberies and violent crimes in the county, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Several new illegal drugs such as DOB, BZP and TFMP have been increasingly
seized in raids by law enforcement agents on night clubs in Taipei County,
northern Taiwan and from passengers entering the country from New Zealand and
Australia.</P>
      <P>The three drugs, usually presented in colorful coating like candies, are often
sold to drug users as the popular club drug ecstasy (the common name for the
amphetamine MDMA) or promoted as an ecstasy alternative.</P>
      <P>BZP is a synthetic stimulant, TFMP is a hallucinogen and DOB, or Brolamfetamine,
is a psychedelic hallucinogen.</P>
      <P>"Without the latest relevant knowledge, it is very difficult for police to
detect these drugs," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, Taipei county police authorities have told policemen to familiarize
themselves with the three new drugs with the assistance of people who know them
better," he explained.</P>
      <P>BZP and TFMP are listed as first-grade medical drugs in the United States, while
DOB is banned. But in Taiwan, the use of BZP and TFMP is unrestricted, while DOB
is listed as a second-grade medical drug, possession or sale of which is
illegal.</P>
      <P>A cocktail of the three drugs, even in low doses, can cause stroke or psychosis,
according to drug experts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Precursors of summer rainstorms found by meteorologists</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 2 (CNA)
10/02/08  21:42:46
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An international meteorological survey has spotted some precursory phenomena of
summer rainstorms and by detecting these atmospheric events, a precious lead
time of two to three hours can be gained to issue warnings to the public before
damaging rainstorms begin, academic sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>However, the meteorologists noted, to identify these precursors requires
powerful weather radar that Taiwan lacks at present. Installing a new nationwide
rain radar system would take at least two years, while upgrading the four
existing weather radar systems would cost some NT$400 million (US$12 million).</P>
      <P>During Taiwan's southwest summer monsoon season, rainstorms packed with heavy
moisture occur sporadically; these storms bring torrential rainfall that cause
landslides and mudslides, as well as inducing lightning that interferes with
communication networks and sometimes damages sophisticated equipment.</P>
      <P>A project titled "SoWMEX" -- Southwest Monsoon Experiment -- was carried out in
southern Taiwan May 15-June 25, as precipitation is usually  the heaviest
during this period.  Sponsored  by the Cabinet-level National Science Council,
the survey also received assistance from the United States, Canada, the
Philippines, Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>In a press conference to report the survey's initial results, Ben Jong-dao Jou
-- the project leader and a meteorology professor at National Taiwan University
-- said eddy currents accompanying the southwest monsoons are the main culprits
behind the rainstorms.</P>
      <P>Enhanced by eddy currents, the monsoons carrying heavy moisture can easily
induce mesoscale  convective  systems,  which cause rainstorms to form, said
Jou.</P>
      <P>"By detecting the existence of eddy currents and the formation of a mesoscale
convective system, the weather forecasting agencies can predict the coming of a
rainstorm two to three hours before it hits," Jou noted.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the team can precisely spot these weather developments only
because some sophisticated, powerful radar has been deployed, including the SPOL
radar of the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research. SPOL is an S-band
polarimetric Doppler radar system and the U.S. is only country in the world that
has such complex equipment in this field.</P>
      <P>To better predict rainstorms and other atmospheric events, Jou said, the Central
Weather Bureau is hoping to upgrade the country's weather radar systems and if
the project can begin next year, the overhauled systems can go online three to
four years from now.</P>

Korea enjoying a trade surplus of more than US$7 billion.</P>
      <P>The two countries  are each other's fifth-largest  trading partners, Ma added.</P>
      <P>He noted that since Taiwan and South Korea resumed air links in 2004 after a
hiatus of more than a decade, exchanges between the two countries have become
even more close, with both countries offering visa-free privileges to each
other's citizens.</P>
      <P>Taiwan severed diplomatic ties with South Korea in 1992 after the latter

      <P>There has been press speculation that a preparatory meeting between SEF and

Liu made it clear that both sides had already agreed to hold systematic

      <P>Some of the passengers injured by turbulence aboard a Taipei-based China

    <HEADLINE>2nd suspect in ex-president's alleged money laundering case detained</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct.2 (CNA)

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A second suspect in the probe into an alleged money laundering case implicating
former President Chen Shui-bian's family was detained Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ming-tse, a younger brother of former first lady Wu Shu-jen's classmate
Tsai Mei-li, was taken into custody after the Taipei District Court agreed to
prosecutors's request for his detention.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors summoned Tsai Mei-li and her two younger brothers -- Tsai Ming-chieh
and Tsai Ming-tse -- for questioning again Thursday to determine whether they
had assisted in wiring money into overseas accounts owned by members of the
former first family.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said they have collected evidence showing that Tsai Ming-tse had
played a crucial role in the illegal money transfer over the past years, but
Tsai would not divulge any details. Prosecutors then decided to apply for his
detention to prevent him from meddling with evidence in the snowballing case.</P>
      <P>Besides granting Tsai's detention, the district court also ordered that Tsai be
held incommunicado.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ming-tse was the second witness-turned-suspect  to be detained in the
ongoing probe into the alleged money-laundering case after Chen Chen-hui, the
former president's most trusted cashier, was taken into custody Sept.25.</P>
      <P>The case came to light Aug. 13 when a local weekly reported that the former
first family had transferred large sums of money abroad and might be engaged in
money laundering.</P>
      <P>The former president admitted the following day that his wife had wired family
funds abroad without his knowledge, but insisted that all the money was clean.
According to Chen Shui-bian, the money was the balance of political
contributions for his two mayoral and two presidential bids between 1993 and
2004.</P>
      <P>Chen is also under investigation for alleged embezzlement of public funds by
using other people's receipts to gain reimbursement from his "state affairs
fund." His wife has been indicted in this case.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed his innocence, insisting that he didn't use any dime of the
discretionary "state affairs fund" to line his own pocket. Prosecutors are
investigating whether any portions of the "state affairs fund" had been wired to
the overseas bank accounts of his family members during his eight-year
presidency.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China are very likely to hold a new round of negotiations in late
October or early November as originally slated, Mainland Affairs Council Vice
Chairman Liu Te-shun said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Officials from the two quasi-official intermediary bodies still working to set
a date for a second meeting in Taiwan between the top negotiators of the two
sides, " Liu said, adding, however, that "the date will be not be fixed until as
late as the middle of this month."</P>
      <P>"There are absolutely no plans to delay the date or shorten the process of the
slated meeting between Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's semi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and Chen Yunlin, president of China's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)," Liu said.</P>
      <P>There has been press speculation that a preparatory meeting between SEF and
ARATS officials is expected to be held next week, but Liu did not address the
topic.</P>
      <P>Commenting  on objections  concerning  Chen visiting Taiwan following the
scandal of Chinese adulteration of foodstuffs with the toxic chemical melamine,
Liu made it clear that both sides had already agreed to hold systematic
negotiations in both Beijing and Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen's planned visit to Taiwan has come at a sensitive time after toxic milk
products imported from China were detected in Taiwan in recent weeks, sparking
panic among the public.</P>
      <P>Some have protested Chen's visit, have demanded that China apologize and that
Chinese companies compensate Taiwanese consumers over the melamine-tainted milk
products.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen clinched two milestone accords to step up two-way tourism and
transportation services in an ice-breaking meeting in June in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are projected to discuss the opening of direct cross-strait
cargo charter  flights and shipping  links,  the establishment of new passenger
charter flight routes, joint oil exploration in the Taiwan Strait and crime-
fighting in their next round of negotiations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Health officials of the Chiayi city government began a large-scale food safety
inspection Thursday to ensure that no milk products, non-dairy creamer or
vegetable-based protein products from China are being used by food processors in
the southern city.</P>
      <P>The officials from the Public Health Bureau took the action with the aim of
protecting the reputation of 10 delicacies designated by the city government as
typical gift items that visitors to Chiayi over the Double Ten National Day
holiday will buy to take home, according to a spokesman for the bureau.</P>
      <P>Chiayi has been given the right to host this year's National Day fireworks show
sponsored by the central government.  The city government will also hold a
series of other festivities to celebrate National Day, and hopes to attract some
200,000 visitors to the city.</P>
      <P>To allay visitors' fears that the city's renowned delicacies might contain
melamine-contaminated  products  from China,  the officials stepped up their
inspections at food manufacturers in the city to make sure that none of the
materials they use have come from China.</P>
      <P>"Visitors can feel assured that the 10 recommended gift items they might buy in
Chiayi are absolutely safe," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>He said that whenever in doubt about food safety, consumers can phone the bureau
on the special service line (03)233-8267. ENDITEM/J ED5K7104.CEP K71dR MOEA

      <P>Yiin said that "privacy is involved" and that the ministry will respect their
wishes.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks amid reports that up to 115 of the 556 board directors and

      <P>Under the new rules, the directors and supervisors of state-owned enterprises
and government-subsidized institutional organizations, along with their spouses,
are required to declare their assets.</P>
      <P>Those who are unwilling to declare their assets span the industrial and academic
sectors, reports said, citing the examples of BenQ Corp. Chairman Lee Kun-yao,
who is a board member of the Industrial Technology Research Institute and former
National Science Council Chairman Wei Che-ho, who is a board member of the
Institute for Information Industry.</P>
      <P>Yiin said that the directors and supervisors who have offered to resign account
for more than 20 percent of the total, but added that board meetings "are
generally operating normally."</P>

      <P>A haul of over 140 kg of ketamine was seized by coast guard officers Friday in
northern Taiwan, the Coastal Patrol Directorate General (CPDG) under the
Cabinet-level Coast Guard Administration announced later that day.</P>
      <P>In a pre-dawn operation off the coast of Taipei County's Danshuei township, CPDG
cutters chased and intercepted a mainland Chinese fishing boat in strong winds.
On board, the officers discovered a total of 142.6 kg of the ketamine -- a white
crystalline powder used as a general anaesthetic in human and veterinary
medicine but used in conjunction with ecstasy by drug abusers.</P>
      <P>The confiscated drug, concealed in teabags, has a street value exceeding NT$110
million (US$3.41 million), according to the CPDG.</P>
      <P>The skipper, surnamed Zhang, and two other crew members of the Chinese fishing
boat, identified as the Minxiayun F730, were later referred to the Shihlin
District Prosecutors Office for further questioning.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved Friday President Ma Ying-jeou's nominations for
five grand justices despite a boycott of the vote by opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The nominees were Huang Mao-jung, a law professor at National Taiwan University;
Chen Min, a law professor at National Chengchi University; Yeh Pai-hsiu, a judge
at the Supreme Administrative Court; Chen Chun-sheng, dean of the Law School of
National Taipei University; and Chen Hsin-min, a research fellow with the
Academia Sinica's preparatory office for the Institute of Law.</P>
      <P>They will replace four grand justices whose terms will soon expire and another
one, Peng Feng-chih, who has been tapped to serve as president of the Supreme
Administrative Court.</P>
      <P>The minority DPP refused to take part in the vote to protest against what they
described as a failure of the nominations.</P>
      <P>According to DPP Legislator Kuan Bi-ling, the nominations "failed to impress the
public" because none of the nominees -- all of whom are professors at some of
the country's most prestigious schools, judges or fellows at Taiwan's highest-
level research institute -- "enjoy prestige or a respectful status in the
academic sector."</P>
      <P>Kuan claimed that their appointments will turn the Constitutional Court into a
"conservative, reactionary" institution.</P>
      <P>"The DPP refuses such nominations to safeguard the dignity of the Constitution,"
she said.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Shu-fen, another DPP legislator, while the grand justices are
supposed to be impartial and independent, the five candidates  were nominated to
the positions  because of their relationship with the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) or
Ma.</P>
      <P>Lin said Chen Hsin-min is a recipient of the KMT-sponsored Sun Yat-sen
Scholarship, while Chen Min appeared in a campaign ad for Ma's 2008 presidential

      <P>Idaho State Governor C.L. Butch Otter will lead a delegation on a visit to
Taiwan Oct. 19 for exchanges on business and economy, a Ministry of Foreign
Affairs official told CNA Thursday.</P>
      <P>Otter will become the first U.S. state governor to visit Taiwan this year, the
official said.</P>
      <P>The 30-member delegation, including state government officials and
representatives of enterprises, will stay in Taiwan for four days before flying
to Japan Oct. 22, the official said.</P>
      <P>They will meet with President Ma Ying-jeou and Foreign Minister Francisco H.L.
Ou, as well as visiting the Department of Health and local enterprises that have
business relations with Idaho, including those in the meat and glass industries.</P>
      <P>The improved cross-Taiwan Strait relations might allow Otter's visit to proceed
more smoothly compared with previous planned visits by other U.S. state
governors, the official said.</P>
      <P>During the past eight years when the pro-independence Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) was in power,  China invested massive resources in winning over
Taiwan's supporters in the United States and blocking relations between U.S.
local governments and Taiwan, the official said.</P>
      <P>Maryland State Governor Martin O'Malley's and Iowa State Governor Chet Culver's
canceled plans to visit Taiwan last September and early May this year,
respectively, served as good examples of China's obstruction, the official said.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, only a few U.S. state head visited Taiwan in some
years from 2001 to 2007, the official said.</P>
      <P>Six came in 1999 when the Kuomintang was still in power and soared to 12 in the
following year, in which Taiwan underwent a political power transfer from the
KMT to DPP before tailing off when former President Chen Shui-bian's policies
became more apparent, the official added.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu attended the launch Friday of the first "made in
Taiwan" section at a hypermarket in the southern port city amid the ongoing
Chinese tainted milk product scandal.</P>
      <P>The President Group's hypermarket store Dollars established the section in
response to the municipal government's call for businesses in the sector to do
so as part of the government's efforts to restore consumers' peace of mind
regarding the safety of food products.</P>
      <P>At the launch,  Chen said  the government  has "a solemn responsibility to
ensure the safety of food" on the market.</P>
      <P>Recently, consumers in the city "don't know where to turn, " especially families
with small children, Chen said, stressing that the government is doing all that
it can to ensure food safety and reassure citizens.</P>
      <P>The measure of promoting the establishment of "made in Taiwan" sections at
hypermarkets is part of those efforts to restore people's peace of mind that
they are purchasing safe products, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The mayor also expressed the hope that the central government's Council of
Agriculture, Department of Health and relevant agencies will establish a food
traceability system to further protect citizens and put their minds at ease.</P>
      <P>Under the "made in Taiwan" program, all products must first undergo safety
testing by the municipal government's Department of Health and Economic Affairs
Bureau before being allowed to be displayed in these sections at hypermarkets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Labor groups call for paid typhoon day leave for laborers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Labor activist groups urged the government Friday to grant the same opportunity
to blue-collar or lower-ranking workers as civil servants to be entitled to paid
leave on severe typhoon days that are declared days off by the government.</P>
      <P>Members of the Youth Labor Union 95 (YLU 95) and other labor activists groups
went to the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) to demand that blue-
collar and lower-ranking workers be given days off during typhoon days when
offices and schools are closed.</P>
      <P>"If those workers still have to work during typhoon days, they must be
compensated by their employers," the activists said.</P>
      <P>It marked the second time that the YLU 95 and other labor activists have
petitioned the CLA since Sept. 23, when they made a similar appeal.</P>
      <P>The activists renewed their appeal after the CLA told them that the council will
leave disputes over working on typhoon days to private negotiations between
management and labor.</P>
      <P>They blasted the CLA, accusing it of passing a hot potato to the private sector.</P>
      <P>Citing as an example a part-time student worker in Taichung who died on his way
home after finishing work at a convenience store during a typhoon, the activists
said the government should not pass the buck any longer, particularly in the
face of Taiwan's unfair work environment,  where  the rate of labor union
organization  is pathetically low and laborers have always been at a
disadvantage in terms of management-labor relations.</P>
      <P>The activists argued that the CLA should make it a rule that blue collar or
lower-ranking workers should enjoy same rights as public functionaries and
should get paid leave when a typhoon day is announced as a day off.</P>
      <P>The government has been procrastinating in making such a rule to avoid causing
trouble with business and industrial leaders, who have said that the business
and industrial sectors will suffer heavy losses if workers stop working during
typhoon days.</P>

      <P>Control Yuan members Huang Huang-hsiung and Liu Hsing-shan visited Kinmen Friday
to inspect mine-clearing work on the outlying island, and lauded an Army
Engineers Corps demining team's progress.</P>
      <P>The team was established in April last year with the task of clearing the more
than 70,000 mines on over 150 minefields left on the island. It has vowed to
complete its mission before 2013.</P>
      <P>Huang and Liu were accompanied by Lt. Gen. Chang Jung-chung of the Kinmen
Defense Command and Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng on their visit to a minefield
in Chinning township that was affected by a major fire last October.</P>
      <P>During the visit, the Control Yuan members listened to a briefing by Col. Ku
Chien-chien, captain of the demining team.</P>
      <P>Ku said that since April 2007, the team has cleared 20 minefields covering about
865,000 square meters. A total of 13,200 mines, or 25.4 percent of the total,
were cleared during that period, he added.</P>
      <P>Ku said that the team is already 1.75 percent ahead of schedule in achieving its
goal of clearing Kinmen of all remaining mines by 2012.</P>
      <P>Noting that the remainder of the task, if contracted out to foreign deminning
experts, will cost about NT$5.8 billion (US$180.4 million) to complete, Ku said
the demining efforts will be beneficial in terms of the outlying islands'
development, as well as improving the country's international image.</P>
      <P>After listening to the briefing, Huang and Liu both praised the demining team's
substantial progress toward achieving its goal.</P>
      <P>Chinning township chief Lee Wen-chun and members of the township council were
also present to express their hope that the minefields will be handed over to
the township's residents for farming after they are cleared.</P>
      <P>In response, Huang said he agrees with the idea and that research will be
undertaken over the practicability of the military giving up the land.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ruled out Friday the
possibility that its chairwoman, Tsai Ing-wen, would run for Taipei County
magistrate, despite calls within the party for her to join the race.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-tsang, who as head of the DPP's Department of Culture and
Communications acts as the party's spokesman, said he has never heard of any
such idea or plans by Tsai.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the DPP realizes that Taipei County -- the country's largest
administrative region -- will be a benchmark in next year's elections for city
mayors and county magistrates, and the party will muster its wisdom to field the
best candidate.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a survey released the same day by a group of DPP
Taipei County councilwomen, if Tsai were to represent the DPP in the next Taipei
County magistrate election, 51.4 percent of voters would vote for her, while
only 27.5 percent of voters would support the possible re-election bid of
incumbent magistrate Chou Hsi-wei of the Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>The results showed that Taipei County residents were split over Chou's
performance,  with 44.8 percent of residents expressing satisfaction and 41.3
percent voicing dissatisfaction.</P>
      <P>Asked to compare Chou with his predecessor Su Tseng-chang from the DPP, 50.5
percent of respondents thought Su performed better than Chou, while 18.7 percent
said Chou is better.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted Sept. 27 and Sept. 29 among 1,072 Taipei County
residents aged 20 and older via telephone. It had a margin of error of 3
percent.</P>
      <P>Councilwomen Liao Hsiao-ching, Chou Ya-lin, Lin Hsiu-huei, Ho Shu-feng and Li
Chien-ping said the survey results indicate that Tsai is the DPP's best choice
for the the Taipei County race and that they will jointly persuade her to run
for the post.</P>
      <P>According to the councilwomen, the survey was carried out without Tsai's
knowledge. They claimed the results are "highly accurate and objective."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors have asked to detain a close aide of former president Chen Shui-bian
after interrogating him over his role in helping Chen and his family in the
alleged embezzlement of public funds and overseas money laundering.</P>
      <P>After interrogating Lin Teh-hsun, who was Chen's chief secretary from 2005-2008,
the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office filed a
request with a court for permission to hold Lin incommunicado over fears that he
would tamper with evidence related to the case if set free.</P>
      <P>Summoned as a potential defendant in the case, Lin was mainly questioned on the
nature and destination of expenditures  for so-called "top secret missions" that
came from the president's discretionary "state affairs fund."</P>
      <P>Prosecutors believe Lin is familiar with the former first family's alleged money
laundering operations and might be able to provide ironclad evidence against ex-
President Chen and his wife Wu Shu-jen.</P>
      <P>The former president has claimed his innocence, insisting that funds from "state
affairs fund" were targeted  at six secret diplomatic missions, and that none of
the money lined his own pocket.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors are investigating whether any portion of the "state affairs fund"
had been wired to the overseas bank accounts of his family members during his
eight-year presidency.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and Singapore established a parliamentary friendship association Friday,
in an attempt to further promote bilateral relations and exchanges between the
people of both countries.</P>
      <P>With the establishment of the Taiwan-Singapore Parliamentary Friendship
Association to serve as a focal point with Singapore, I believe the group will
further promote substantial relations between the two countries to bring even
closer relations, said Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng at a ceremony to
establish the group.</P>
      <P>Wang also serves as the honorary chairperson of the group.</P>
      <P>Wang saidthe meaning of the friendship association is different from other such
relationships Taiwan has, " suggesting it was a further deepening of already
strong ties. He noted that interactions between high-level officials of Taiwan
and Singapore have long been frequent and close and the two countries  share a
very good relationship in the absence of formal diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>Stanley Loh, the trade representative of the Singapore Trade Office in Taipei,
said Taiwan and Singapore have long been working together in many areas, such as
business, economic and cultural exchanges, and he knows that many Singaporean
companies are very interested in doing business in Taiwan, especially the
i-Taiwan 12 projects.</P>
      <P>The i-Taiwan national construction projects, one of President Ma's major
economic platforms, proposes spending US$120 billion over the next eight years
to stimulate the domestic economy and lower the unemployment rate by creating
120,000 job opportunities each year.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony, Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia described
Taiwan's relationship  with Singapore  as aspecial friendship, saying that he
believes bilateral relations will scale new heights under the efforts of the
parliamentary friendship association.</P>
      <P>Justin Chou, a ruling Kuomintang legislator and the chairman of the Taiwan-
Singapore Parliamentary Friendship Association, said that the group will strive
to promote bilateral relations and exchanges between Taiwan and Singapore, and
he hopes to lead a delegation to visit Singapore's parliament after the
Legislative Yuan goes into recess.</P>

      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) announced Friday that the United States
Diversity Immigrant Visa (DV) lottery will run from Oct. 3 to Dec. 2, Taiwan

      <P>Persons born on the islands of Taiwan and Penghu are eligible to participate in
the DV program," the AIT stated in a press release.</P>
      <P>The only source for complete and authoritative information on eligibility
requirements  and  application  procedures  is www.dvlottery.state.gov. All
applications must be submitted online according to the instructions on this Web
site," it added.</P>
      <P>The AIT stressed that there is no fee to participate in the DV lottery and that
the U.S. government employs no outside consultants or private services to
operate the DV program.</P>
      <P>"Any intermediaries or others who offer assistance to prepare DV entries do so
without the authority  or consent of the U.S. government, " the AIT said. "Use
of any outside intermediary or assistance to prepare a DV entry is entirely at
the entrant's discretion."</P>
      <P>Due to anticipated high demand for the online application system, the AIT is
encouraging participants to submit applications well before the lottery ends
because in the past, system delays caused by extremely heavy demand in the final
days of the registration period have resulted in the failure of some applicants
to be able to register for the program.</P>
      <P>According to the AIT, no entries will be accepted after 1: 00 a.m., Dec. 2
Taiwan time, regardless of whether there are system delays during the
registration period.</P>
      <P>The AIT functions as a de facto embassy in the absence of formal diplomatic
relations between Taiwan and the U.S. and its head is also treated as the de
facto top U.S. representative to Taiwan. The two countries have maintained
substantive ties since the U.S. switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to

      <P>The Taipei City government will launch a series of hiking events for vocational
high school students this weekend to help them learn more about the city after a
survey found that they mostly read entertainment and fashion news outside of
class.</P>
      <P>Wu Ching-shan, director of the city's Department of Education, told a news
conference Thursday that the city has mapped out 18 hiking trails featuring
natural ecology and cultural and heritage sites that will provide diversified
learning environments  for vocational high school students.</P>
      <P>The hiking program, called "Reading Taipei," was based on the "No Child Left
Inside" program launched in the United States,  a back-to-nature movement to
reconnect children with the outdoors, Wu added.</P>
      <P>He said that the goal of the "Reading Taipei" program is to encourage the
students to exercise more and experience Taipei's natural beauty and culture
rather than play video games.</P>
      <P>The program  was conceived  after a recent survey on the extracurricular reading
behavior of vocational high school students in Taipei City revealed that most of
them spend a lot of their leisure time reading entertainment news and articles
about fashion, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the King Car Education Foundation in June among
1,200 students at various vocational high schools around the city, with 1,170
valid questionnaires being collected.</P>
      <P>The poll had a confidence level of 95 percent and a margin of error of
plus/minus 3 percent.</P>
      <P>It showed that over the previous three months before the students were polled,
newspapers were their most popular reading material, read by 62.78 of the
respondents, followed by novels (58.97 percent) and Internet articles (38.99
percent).</P>
      <P>Their preferred extracurricular reading-material topics were movie- and TV-
related activities (38.36 percent) , fashion trends (35.4 percent) , travel and
leisure (23.9 percent) and sports (22.2 percent), according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Their extracurricular reading habits changed only slightly on weekends and
holidays. Their preferred topics on those days were movie- and television-
related stories (44.3 percent), fashion trends (33.6 percent) sports (26.26
percent) and articles offering tips on improving video game skills (21.4
percent).</P>
      <P>As to what type of extracurricular activities they would enjoy, 85 percent of
the respondents cited watching audio-visual programs while 58 percent of them
said they would enjoy an outdoor guided tour.</P>
      <P>The "Reading Taipei" hiking events will be held every weekend from Saturday to
Dec. 21 for vocational high school students and their parents. The campaign is
expected to attract some 900 people to participate, according to Wu.</P>

      <P>Tainan County in southern Taiwan is focusing on the state of its public toilets,
as part of efforts to maintain a clean and comfortable environment, an official
of the county's Bureau of Environmental Protection said Friday.</P>
      <P>Since 2006, the bureau has been carrying out monthly inspections of the 1,054
public toilets that fall under the county government's jurisdiction,  including
those in parks and at gas stations, sightseeing spots, and bus and train
stations, the official said.</P>
      <P>Schools toilets under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education and toilets
in private stores are not included, the official added.</P>
      <P>The county government offers cash prizes ranging from NT$5,000 to NT$20,000 to
units that best manage their restroom facilities, as assessed by the bureau, in
a bid to improve public washroom facilities, the official said.</P>
      <P>These cleaners who keep these public washrooms clean are also given presents as
rewards, the official added.</P>
      <P>With the cooperation of all concerned, the program has been showing results, as
only two restrooms failed to meet the inspection standards in September, the
official said, adding that since then they have made improvements.</P>
      <P>In step with its efforts to clean up public toilets, the Tainan County
government has been holding an environmental competition among its 31 townships
since 2006, and has designated the second Saturday of every month as Cleaning
Day in the county, according to the official.</P>
      <P>Every Cleaning Day, Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih and government staff
visit different townships to help with the clean-up work in the hope of drawing
wider participation by county residents, the official said.</P>
      <P>The county also imposes strict penalties for violations of its environmental
rules, such as illegal dumping and pasting of flyers on public property, the
official said.</P>

      <P>Taipei has the potential to become a regional financial center, the lord mayor
of the City of London -- the financial and commercial heart of Britain -- said
Thursday, and he offered Taiwan's capital a hand in achieving the goal.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference ahead of his planned visit to Asia, City of
London Lord Mayor David Lewis said London was a global financial center because
of its hundreds of thousands of talented foreign workers and argued that Taipei
could become a regional financial stronghold only if it relaxes restrictions on
foreign immigration.</P>
      <P>Excellent workers are also the reason that Hong Kong and Singapore are globally
influential financial cities as they, like Taiwan, lack natural resources, said
Lewis, who is scheduled to be in Taiwan Oct. 5-8.</P>
      <P>The City of London, known as the world's leading international financial and
business center, is willing to share its abundant business opportunities and
experience with Taipei, said Lewis.</P>
      <P>Located in the eastern part of downtown London, the City of London is also
called the "Square Mile" due to its 2.6-square kilometer area.</P>
      <P>The lord mayor is elected every year and is commissioned to act during the one-
year term as an ambassador for the UK-financial services industry.</P>
      <P>According to the City government's statistics, the financial sector generated an

    <TEXT>
      <P>oral vaccines for fish developed at National Cheng Kung University have won the
top prize in the "2008 Crazy Idea" -- a biotech competition organized by the
Industrial Development Bureau under Ministry of Economic Affairs, government
officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>At the award ceremony in Taipei Oct. 15, the research team, led by professor
Yang Huey-lang, will receive medals and a cash prize of NT$400,000 (about
US$12,000).</P>
      <P>The vaccines, which have already gained patents both in Taiwan and the United
States, had been under development for years before a breakthrough  was achieved
early last year,  according to the Tainan-based university.</P>
      <P>During the three-year experiments on nearly 60,000 cobias, the new vaccines
helped raise the survival rate from around 40 percent to more than 80 percent,
university officials reported. In optimal circumstances, the vaccines can
further boost the survival rate to 86 percent, which is better than the 64
percent achieved by the fish vaccines developed in some European laboratories,
they added.</P>
      <P>Conventional fish vaccines are delivered by injection, Yang explained, adding
that although these vaccines are quite effective, the cost and time increase
tremendously when applied to commercial aquaculture because the fish populations
are usually very large.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, while oral vaccines that are delivered by mixing them into
fish food can lower costs and reduce time, they are limited in terms of
efficacy, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Yang's team employed gene engineering techniques to implant the vaccines into
carrier bacteria, then fed planktons with the bacteria. The vaccine-carrying
planktons were later fed to fry and adult fish to induce their immunity against
certain pathogens.</P>
      <P>Compared to other oral vaccines, Yang said, his team's vaccines have greater
efficacy because each dose contains much more antigen, and it is much easier to
modify the vaccine to induce immunity against new pathogens.</P>

    <HEADLINE>158 kg of semi-finished amphetamine seized in southern Taiwan</HEADLINE>

      <P>Coast Guard Administration (CGA) officials have busted an illicit drug plant in
Kaohsiung County and seized 158.5 kilograms of semi-finished amphetamine, the
CGA's Kaohsiung office announced Friday.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the office said that officers from a CGA mobile unit in
Kaohsiung County on Thursday raided the plant, housed in a private home in
Fengshan city, and arrested three suspects. The officers also seized the
amphetamine -- a grade two drug -- in liquid form, along with the equipment for
producing the drug and NT$600,000 in cash.</P>
      <P>One of the persons arrested -- the owner of the plant -- was identified by the
surname Tsai. His girlfriend surnamed Lien and another accomplice surnamed Chang
were also arrested.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the mobile unit received a tip-off three months ago that
Tsai was in the process of producing amphetamine to take advantage of the drug
shortage in the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>The CGA mobile unit and criminal investigation  police in Kaohsiung  County
formed  a task force  to place Tsai under surveillance. Armed with a search
warrant issued by the local court, the task force raided the plant Thursday and
caught the three suspects red-handed.</P>
      <P>In an initial investigation, the task force found that the ephedrine, a
precursor chemical used in the production of the illicit drug, came from China.
The CGA officials found two large plastic bags labeled in simplified Chinese
characters showing that the chemical compound was produced in China's Sichuan
province.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the task force determined that the manufacturing
operation had been going on for about six months, and there are indications that
the plant has already delivered finished amphetamine products to its buyers.</P>
      <P>The three suspects will be referred to the local prosecutors office to face
criminal charges, while the task force will work to catch other suspects
involved in the drug network, he said.</P>

      <P>Health Minister Yeh Ching-chuan checked into National Taiwan University Hospital
(NTUH) Friday after he was allegedly attacked by opposition legislators in a
scuffle at the Legislative Yuan amid an ongoing public health scare over food
contaminated with melamine.</P>
      <P>Yeh, who took the post only eight days ago, was suffering from dizziness, flush,
cardiopalmus and high blood pressure upon arrival at the hospital, said NTUH
spokesman Tan Ching-Ting.</P>
      <P>Doctors suggested that Yeh stay in the hospital for further observation, Tan
said.</P>
      <P>Yeh was sworn in as health minister on Sept. 26 after Lin Fang-yue resigned one
day earlier to take responsibility for the government's delayed and inconsistent
response to the spiraling crisis on the melamine-spiked dairy foods and drinks
containing ingredients imported from China.</P>
      <P>According to ruling Kuomintang Legislator Chang Shuo-wen, who was with Yeh when
the scuffle erupted, opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators
tried to prevent Yeh from leaving the Legislative Yuan floor after a meeting
with bakery owners and lawmakers over disputes pertaining to the government's
response to the widening health scare.</P>
      <P>"Someone grabbed the minister's neck and he could hardly breathe," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan reiterated on Sept. 26 that no melamine as an additive
should be allowed in any foodstuffs. Under mounting pressure in recent days, he
also agreed to demand an apology and seek compensation from China for the
economic losses businesses here suffered.</P>
      <P>Government spokeswoman Vanessa Yea-ping Shih on Friday reiterated remarks made
by Liu of a zero tolerance for melamine.</P>
      <P>The government had surprised and frustrated the public when the Department of
Health set on Sept. 24 a new melamine standard which stipulated that products
containing 2.5 parts per million (ppm) of melamine would be allowed in
foodstuffs sold in Taiwan, a higher amount than the previous standard.</P>
      <P>Government officials, however, have said they reached the standard after taking
into consideration standards in developed countries.</P>
      <P>It was unclear if by referring to zero tolerance of melamine as an additive, Liu
and Shih were making a distinction between the deliberate adulteration of milk
powder and vegetable-based proteins, as has occurred in China, versus melamine
residue that has been known to migrate to foods and beverages from their
packaging.</P>
      <P>Yeh had overturned the controversial  safety standard for melamine set by the
health department one hour after taking over the health minister post, saying
that all products testing positive for the toxic chemical would be considered
"not up to standard."</P>
      <P>"We will not stipulate a maximum permissible quantity for melamine. There is
only positive and negative, " said Yeh, referring to the principle behind the
new test standard.</P>
      <P>The DPP blasted Yeh and the administration under President Ma Ying-jeou for its
handling of the food crisis.</P>
      <P>As of Friday, Taiwan has banned all Chinese dairy imports and ordered those
products already imported to be tested for traces of the industrial chemical
melamine, a nitrogen-rich industrial chemical used in the production of plastics
and glues.</P>
      <P>At least four infants have died in China and more than 25,000 others have been
sickened by milk powder and other dairy products contaminated by melamine --
which was added by unscrupulous milk middlemen traders and food manufacturers to
give the appearance in food tests that the milk has a higher protein content
than it actually does.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the melamine scare has been looming large as the chemical has also
been found in non-dairy creamer used in instant coffee, milk tea, puddings,
chicken-and-corn soup, ready-to-serve packs of healthy grain drinks, and even in
cheese powder packs offered by a local pizza franchise.</P>

      <P>The Catholic Good Shepherd Social Welfare Services urged the government Friday
to provide greater legal protection  for  divorced  or  abandoned  foreign
spouses  in Taiwanese-Vietnamese marriages and help protect the education rights
of their children.</P>
      <P>According to the social welfare organization, some Vietnamese women married to
Taiwanese men and their children suffer serious consequences when they are
divorced or intentionally abandoned.</P>
      <P>If they stay in Taiwan, most of the women cannot earn a living as they have to
take care of their children at the same time.</P>
      <P>If they return to Vietnam, their children, having only Taiwanese nationality,
cannot attend public schools there because of local regulations, said the
group's head Sister Therese Thong, in the first of a series of hearings on
problems faced by new immigrants.</P>
      <P>The hearing Friday on cross-border marriages was held by Yang Li-huan, a ruling
Kuomintang legislator, at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>"These children are deprived of their right to receive an education, and they
might have hatred for Taiwan when growing up, " said Sister Thong, who added
that private schools are not affordable for most of the Vietnamese spouses.</P>
      <P>She noted that a non-governmental organization tried to open a Chinese-language
school for these children two years ago, but the project failed as they were
scattered all over the country.</P>
      <P>"What we are more worried about is whether the women with trauma can still give
decent care to their children, " added Thong.</P>
      <P>She argued that the children's education was the responsibility of both
countries and demanded that the government find a solution to help people facing
such a predicament.</P>
      <P>In response, Hsieh Li-kung, deputy director-general of the National Immigration
Agency under the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) who also attended the hearing,
said the government has a 10-year budget of NT$3 billion to help foreign
spouses, and nongovernmental organizations can apply for funding in case of
need.</P>
      <P>But Hsieh said it was up to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with
Vietnamese authorities on the education question.</P>
      <P>He said there are currently 578 Taiwanese children from failed Taiwanese-
Vietnamese marriages in Vietnam, with 260 of them having remained there for more
than one year.</P>
      <P>He also noted that foreign spouses are already protected by the existing
Immigration Law in particular situations, but acknowledged that enforcement
rules need to be studied and amended to adapt to the real needs of society.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yang also demanded the agency and related departments to better
inform foreign spouses of ways in which they can apply for government
assistance.</P>
      <P>According to the MOI, a total of 408,547 foreign spouses were living in Taiwan
as of the end of August, accounting for 1.7 percent of the population. Of the
total, 269,871 were from China.</P>

      <P>Contrary to the public perception that high-tech personnel are apathetic toward
the world around them, more than 73 percent of them said they care about social
welfare, according to the results of an online survey released Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey on high-tech  personnel and social welfare was conducted by the
nonprofit World Peace Association and online company Youthwant  recently.  A
total of 1,076 effective samples were collected.</P>
      <P>Among them, 25 percent were in the high-tech sector, while others came from
different walks of life.</P>
      <P>Of those polled, 54 percent said high-tech personnel face tremendous pressure on
the job, 46 percent said high-tech personnel attach importance to efficiency and
execution, and 42.5 percent said high-tech personnel are less active socially
than others.</P>
      <P>When asked about participating in social welfare activities, 73.8 percent  of
the high-tech  respondents  said they cared about contributing to society, and
57.7 percent said they were willing to partake in charitable services if time
permitted.</P>
      <P>But since high-tech workers are often confined to their own world, they are
unable to participate in public service activities as often as they would like.
Some 23.6 percent said activities designed by social welfare groups don't fit
into their work schedules.</P>
      <P>The World Peace Association called on social welfare groups to design ways for
high-tech workers to have the opportunity to do good deeds.</P>
      <P>The association,  working with Youthwant and a second-hand bookstore, has
sponsored a book donation activity, calling for high-tech firms in science parks
to donate books to help children from underprivileged families.</P>

      <P>Although there has been speculation that Chen Yunlin, China's top negotiator
with Taiwan, would visit Taiwan by the end of this year, Premier Liu Chiao-
shiuan said Friday that the plans have not yet been finalized.</P>
      <P>"The matter has not yet been settled, as the relevant protocol arrangements have
to be discussed and finalized," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Liu insisted that Chen must address him as premier, if a meeting between the two
of them is to take place. "I will not meet Chen if he refuses to call me
'Premier Liu,'" he said.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks while answering questions from opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker Kuo Wen-cheng in a question-and-answer session
at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chen's planned visit to Taiwan, in late October or early November, comes at a
delicate time when Taiwan is battling a food scare over toxic milk powder and
vegetable-based proteins imported from China.</P>
      <P>There have been protests in some quarters against Chen's visit, accompanied by
demands that China apologize and that the responsible Chinese companies offer
compensation to Taiwan consumers or companies over the sale of the melamine-
tainted milk products.</P>
      <P>Liu's remarks were at odds with a statement the day before by the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) , whose vice chairman, Liu Te-shun, said that "there are
absolutely no plans to delay the date or shorten the process of the slated
meeting between Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's semi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), and Chen Yunlin, president of China's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)."</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are very likely to hold a new round of negotiations in late
October or early November as originally planned, the MAC vice chairman said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Officials from the two quasi-official intermediary bodies are still working to
set a date for a second meeting in Taiwan between the top negotiators of the two
sides," he said, adding, however, that "the date will be not be fixed until
around the middle of this month."</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference earlier Friday, Cheng Wen-tsang, head of the DPP's
public relations department, said the party will not pass up any opportunity to
protest against China while Chen is in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The DPP will definitely protest to Chen if he sets foot on Taiwan soil," Cheng
said, adding that a DPP panel has been assessing several options on how to stage
demonstrations while Chen is in the country.</P>
      <P>"Even if Chen does not come, the DPP would consider taking to the streets to
protest the importation of Chinese toxic milk and China's continued suppression
of Taiwan's independent sovereignty, " Cheng said.</P>
      <P>As several pro-independence groups plan to stage a street demonstration on Oct.
25, the DPP will encourage its supporters to join the rally in a concerted move
to convey the people's anger to the Kuomintang government, he added.</P>
      <P>In an ice-breaking meeting in June in Beijing, Chiang and Chen clinched two
milestone accords to step up two-way tourism and transportation services.</P>
      <P>In their next round of talks, Taiwan and China are expected to discuss the
opening of direct cross-strait cargo charter flights and shipping links, the
establishment of new passenger charter flight routes,  joint  oil  exploration
in the  Taiwan  Strait  and crime-fighting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New charge added to ex-MJIB head's indictment</HEADLINE>

10/03/08  21:15:10

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei's prosecutors added Friday yet another charge to the indictment of former
Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) Director Yeh Sheng-mao over his
handling of intelligence regarding suspected money-laundering involving former
President Chen Shui-bian and his family.</P>
      <P>The latest charge by the Taipei District Prosecutors Office accuses Yeh of
leaking the information to Chen. Yeh was charged Aug. 28 with a count of
concealing the information from the Supreme Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>According to the indictment, in a report delivered to the MJIB in January
through the international anti-money laundering organization Egmont Group, the
Cayman Islands' financial intelligence unit raised the suspicion that the former
first family was laundering money through an account created under the name of
Chen's daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching at the Merrill Lynch Bank in Geneva,
Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Based on the report, the bureau's Anti-Money Laundering Center on Jan. 29
compiled a file intended for delivery to the Supreme Prosecutors Office. Yeh
later requested that the file be handed over to him and said he would pass it to
State Public Prosecutor General Chen Tsung-ming in person, the indictment
stated.</P>
      <P>However, instead of giving the file to Chen Tsung-ming, Yeh leaked the content
of the file to Chen Shui-bian during a visit to the former president's official
residence between Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, the indictment said.</P>
      <P>The prosecution said although Yeh repeatedly claimed that he had made an oral
report to Chen Tsung-ming about the information, Yeh was inconsistent in his
story, which shows that Yeh was likely to have made up the story to try to shun
his legal liability.</P>
      <P>Besides the money laundering case, Yeh is also accused of leaking a plan by
prosecutors and investigators to raid the offices of Democratic Progressive
Party Legislator Ker Chien-ming in April over Ker's involvement in an illegal
mining operation in the eastern county of Hualien.</P>
      <P>The alleged money laundering involving the former first family only came to
light in July, when Taiwan received a request by Swiss authorities for
assistance in probing the case.</P>
      <P>Suspecting that the money wired overseas could be connected to the "state
affairs fund" embezzlement case implicating the former president and his wife Wu
Shu-jen, prosecutors in August listed the couple, their son Chen Chih-chung,
daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching and Wu's brother Wu Ching-mao as suspects in the
case of alleged money laundering.</P>
      <P>It was found that Huang Jui-ching and Wu Ching-mao are two of the nominal
holders of the former first family's overseas bank accounts, and Chen Chih-chung
is an authorized proxy on the accounts.</P>
      <P>However, Wu Shu-jen, said to be the manager of the family's finances, claimed
that the US$21 million deposited overseas had been obtained  legally  from four
sources --  surplus of political contributions for the campaigns of her husband,
her husband's practice as a lawyer before he went into politics, her own dowry
and her investments.</P>
      <P>Wu's statement was consistent with that of Chen Shui-bian, who openly confessed
on Aug. 14 that he did not honestly account for his election campaign expenses
and that his wife had wired surplus funds from the election campaign
contributions into overseas bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that all the surplus funds were handled by his wife and that he had
no idea until early this year that his wife had wired the funds abroad.</P>
      <P>The former president denied the money had any connection with the "state affairs
fund" case, in which the former first lady was charged with corruption and
forgery in November 2006 for using receipts provided by others to claim
reimbursements totaling NT$14.8 million from the president's "state affairs
fund" between July 2002 and March 2006.</P>
      <P>Chen, who had immunity from prosecution while in office, was named as a co-
defender in the case and was probed as soon as he stepped down from the
presidency on May 20.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SME competitiveness seen growing with high management efficiency</HEADLINE>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The global competitiveness of Taiwan's small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs)
is growing thanks to their increased spending in research and development over
the last several years, officials of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) said Friday.</P>
      <P>In the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2008 released in May by the Switzerland-
based International Institute for Management and Development (IMD), Taiwan
ranked fourth among 55 countries in the evaluation of SME management efficiency.</P>
      <P>The ranking marked a 10-notch jump from last year, according to the annual
report on the global competitiveness of nations. The CEPD said it regards SMEs
as a pillar of Taiwan's economy, based on a Ministry of Economic Affairs White
Paper on SMEs in 2008, which showed that there were some 1.23 million such
enterprises in Taiwan in 2007, accounting for 97.63 percent of all businesses in
the country.</P>
      <P>In 2007, over 7.9 million people worked at SMEs throughout Taiwan,  accounting
for 77.12 percent of the country's entire workforce, the paper stated.</P>
      <P>Accumulated SME exports reached NT$160 million (US$4.97 million) in 2007,
according to the white paper.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials attributed SMEs' growing competitiveness to their high capital
efficiency, the formation of industrial clusters, and steep increase in their
spending on research and development.</P>
      <P>Citing a government survey on the industrial, commercial and services sectors,
the officials said that in 2006, Taiwan SMEs offered 62.8 percent of all job
vacancies in those sectors and generated an output value of NT$10 trillion.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that SME capital productivity posted a rise of 20 percent
in 2006 from 2001, while labor productivity grew by 29.5 percent over that five-
year period.</P>
      <P>In the area of research and development spending, SMEs recorded an increase of
13.78 percent in 2006 from the previous year, higher than the 9.31 percent by
large enterprises, the survey showed.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves fell in September for the third consecutive
month, but the country still retained its status as the world's fifth largest
foreign exchange holder, according to statistics released Friday by Taiwan's
central bank -- the Taipei-based Central Bank of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The figures showed that as of the end of September, Taiwan's foreign exchange
reserves stood at US$281.13 billion, down US$957 million from the August figure.</P>
      <P>Lin Sun-yuan, deputy director-general of the central bank's department of
foreign exchange, explained that the decrease was mainly due to September's
outflow of foreign funds, which totaled US$4.8 billion in the first 19 days of
the month, compared with US$5 billion in August.</P>
      <P>Despite a decrease of US$10.27 billion in foreign currency reserves in the past
three months, Taiwan still ranked fifth among the world's largest foreign
exchange holders, behind China with US$1.8 trillion at the end of June, Japan
with US$971.3 billion at the end of August, Russia with US$446.1 billion at the

      <P>A Taiwanese drug convict who was originally sentenced to life imprisonment but
was later granted a series of commutations by the Thai king was finally released
recently and is ready to depart for home, Taiwan's representative office in
Bangkok said Friday.</P>
      <P>The convict, identified only by his family name Yang, was arrested in December
1992 on charges of narcotics trafficking, the representative office said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>Yang was first given a life sentence. Thanks to his good behavior behind bars,
Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej commuted his sentence to 40 years in prison.</P>
      <P>With assistance from the representative office, which issued a letter of
guarantee on his behalf, Yang's prison sentence was again reduced by one-third,
the statement said, adding that in the following years, Yang received three more
rounds of commutations and thus had his prison sentence cut to 15 years and nine
months.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, Yang, 52, served out his greatly reduced prison term
recently. He was jubilant at regaining his freedom, the statement said, adding
that the representative office had been busy helping with his paperwork for his
return to Taiwan since his release. Yang departed for home Friday evening.</P>
      <P>The representative office said another 118 Taiwanese citizens are still serving
time in Thai prisons, most of them were convicted of involvement in the
narcotics trafficking or drug trade.</P>
      <P>Noting that Thailand imposes a stringent ban on narcotics-related crimes, the
statement said that any person who is found to be involved in the drug trade or
trafficking tends to receive a severe penalty.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court granted a request by prosecutors to detain a close
aide of former President Chen Shui-bian Friday evening over his suspected role
in Chen's alleged embezzlement of public funds and overseas money laundering.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors sought to detain Lin Teh-hsun, who was director of Chen's office
from 2005-2008, after interrogating him earlier the same day. They suspect Lin
was involved in embezzlement, committing fraud through the abuse of his
position, and destroying evidence.</P>
      <P>Lin became the third person to be detained in the probe of the former first
family's alleged misconduct.</P>
      <P>Chen Chen-hui, the former cashier of the Presidential Office under Chen Shui-
bian, was the first to be detained.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ming-che, the brother of Tsai Mei-li, a college classmate of former first
lady Wu Shu-jen, was also detained for allegedly taking a bribe along with
former President Chen from a land developer and providing bank accounts for the
former first family to use in laundering money overseas.</P>
      <P>The three have been listed as potential defendants in the case, along with
former President Chen, former first lady Wu, their son and daughter-in-law, Wu's
brother Wu Ching-mao, and Tsai Ming-chieh, another brother of Tsai Mei-li.</P>
      <P>Those not in custody have been barred from leaving the country.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office said
that according to the 2003 rules on operating procedures for use of secret funds
from state affairs fund, the fund must be sent to a special account before they
can be used and then justified by a formal document reporting on the purpose of
the expenditure.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors found, however, that while Lin and Chen Chen-hui had claimed
secret expenses -- half of the "state affairs fund" available to the
Presidential Office each month -- they did not provide documents to explain
their purpose.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors  raided Chen Shui-bian and Chen Chen-hui's residences Aug. 16
and Sept. 25, seizing several disks from Chen Chen-hui's residence in which
computer files of the use of each secret fund use was recorded.</P>
      <P>Chen Chen-hui reportedly admitted that some secret funds were used by the former
first lady for personal use and some of the funds were wired to Wu Ching-mao's
overseas bank accounts on Wu Shu-jen's instructions.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said that Lin, while serving as Chen Shui-bian's chief secretary,
handled all the claims and expenditures of the secret portion of the "state
affairs fund, " and should have first-hand knowledge of Wu Shu-jen's use of the
fund.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>She tangoed energetically, waltzed gracefully and quickstepped livelily with her
partner on the dance floor, enjoying herself and entertaining the spectators.</P>
      <P>Her fluid movements were constantly dynamic, and at times she seemed to be
floating, twirling to quick and complex cadences.</P>
      <P>At 83, Sung Yu-heng is more than alive and well. She is truly kicking. With the
figure of a teenaged girl, she dances like a pro.</P>
      <P>The retired Chiayi school teacher, who is a widow, began to dance only seven
years ago, but has since wowed audiences all over Taiwan, shattering stereotypes
and traditional beliefs about the kind of life elderly people should lead.</P>
      <P>While many of her counterparts in Taiwan spend their days chatting in parks,
taking care of grandkids or shopping and cooking for their families, Sung
practices complicated dance steps for two hours during most days of the week.
Through her lifestyle, she has encouraged her peers to get out there, if not to
hit the dance floor, then to live their golden years to the fullest.</P>
      <P>"I never thought my life would turn out this way...so energetic and happy," Sung
said.</P>
      <P>Sung came in contact with dancing accidentally, at age 76. After her retirement,
she said she worked in the morning as a quality control worker at one of the
electronic factories owned by her daughter and son "to keep an eye on the
children." She also spent a lot of time trading stocks by phone "to make some
petty money, " and played mahjong with friends into the evening "to prevent from
developing senile dementia."</P>
      <P>When her health began to decline and her wallet began to thin from all the
stocks trading and mahjong playing, Sung told one of her mahjong partners that
she probably needed to "overhaul" her lifestyle once and for all, such as by
doing some physical exercises which were also fun.</P>
      <P>Several days later, her friends took her to a dance club, where people danced
social dance and made friends. In the beginning, she was not fascinated by
social dancing at all.</P>
      <P>"It was nothing but two people pushing and pulling," Sung said.</P>
      <P>After about a year of on-and-off social dancing, a teacher of international
standard dances, Shih Ta-chien, who later became her coach, realized Sung was
potentially talented and "can be carved into a piece of jewel."</P>
      <P>Shih, a professional ballroom dancer, persuaded Sung to be his student,
recognizing that Sung had the conditions to be a good dancer, despite her age.</P>
      <P>Partly because she was attracted by the 41-year-old Shih's charms, Sung became a
good pupil, taking two-hour courses, four times a week.</P>
      <P>She later proved Shih right.</P>
      <P>After studying with Shih for several years, Sung said she progressed from
"having two left feet" to a respectable level, albeit with a lot of hard work
and money too.</P>
      <P>"Sung has a good physique with muscles and bones that were much younger than her
age and first and foremost, dancing is so natural for her like it was all in her
blood," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Shih's encouragement and spectators' applause at small dance events gave Sung a
huge source of confidence, spurring her to want to learn more to master the
steps and push herself.</P>
      <P>Amazingly, Sung said, after putting in the effort and enjoying the process, she
has become healthier than she was six years ago. And most importantly, she feels
carefree and lighthearted every time she walks away from the dance studio after
two hours of sweating.</P>
      <P>"You expect more and more of yourself; it's something like an addictive
feeling," she said.</P>
      <P>Fame came naturally as Sung gained increased attention.</P>
      <P>She and Shih have been invited to show off their dance moves in Southeast Asia
and Sung even danced recently in Shanghai with Zhou JitianVone of the top dance
sport athletes in China. Zhou and his partner won the championship in the tango
competition in the 2005 East Asian Games and the title for New Stars in the
tango category in the World International Standard Dance Championship held in
Germany in 2006.</P>
      <P>Sung and Shih have appeared and danced in many of the major television variety
shows in Taiwan and have been invited to appear on other educational TV
programs.</P>
      <P>She was cited by local TV hosts as a role model for retirees seeking to stay
healthy and spend their later years happily.</P>
      <P>The rejuvenated Sung's greatest dream now is to take part in international
standard dance competitions abroad -- including, if possible,  competitions  in
Blackpool,  England,  the mecca of professional ballroom dancers from around the
world.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sung's children have turned a blind eye to her expenditures  on
private lessons,  dinners for the instructor, transportation and an enlarging
wardrobe of sequins and slick dresses -- while they steadily increased the money
they regularly give her.</P>
      <P>"So long as mother stays happy and healthy, the money we pay for her dancing is
much more worthwhile than paying for caretakers or medical bills, " said Sung's
daughter, who manages manufacturing operations from Taipei County to Shenzhen,
Shanghai and Kunshan city in China's eastern province of Jiangsu.</P>
      <P>A born athletic type, Sung said that of the five varieties of the modern
category of ballroom dancing, she likes skate, or Vienna waltz the most,
enjoying its crisp yet smooth tempo, and slower pace compared to the quickstep.</P>
      <P>In February Sung and her instructor were special guests at the closing gala of
the 2008 Professional Dance Championships Asian Tour Taipei Open. After
demonstrating their perfect footwork, the pair was given a standing ovation by
the packed audience, many of whom leading professional dancers from around the
world.</P>
      <P>The audience went wild with amazement when Sung spun clockwise in her record
high of 33 times at one stroke.</P>
      <P>Audience members were particularly ecstatic upon hearing from the emcee that the
dancing lady was 83 years old.</P>
      <P>Dancing by the elderly has become more popular in Taiwan in recent years, partly
because of a declining birth rate which leaves many retirees free from the
responsibility of caring for their grandchildren. Awareness of the benefits of
exercising and of living a full life after retirement has also grown.</P>
      <P>Many retirees in Taiwan often join dance activities at parks or community
centers in the early morning, after dinner or on weekends.</P>
      <P>Swimming and dancing are the best forms of exercise, said Shih, adding that
dancing, however, is more sociable. "You get a mouthful of water if you try to
talk while swimming," he said.</P>
      <P>Few sports that human beings do are as healing as dancing, Shih said, explaining
that when you dance, you constantly do backward strokes or reverse movement
which help the body of the dancer to rejuvenate.</P>
      <P>But most elderly people dance for exercise or just for fun. Sung is unique, as
she has advanced to professional level.</P>
      <P>"If possible, I will dance till I'm 120...I'm still so young, " Sung said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Third person detained in probe of former first family</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court granted a request by prosecutors to detain a close
aide of former President Chen Shui-bian Friday evening over his suspected role
in Chen's alleged embezzlement of public funds and overseas money laundering.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors sought to detain Lin Teh-hsun, who was director of Chen's office
from 2005-2008, after interrogating him earlier the same day. They suspect Lin
was involved in embezzlement, committing fraud through the abuse of his
position, and destroying evidence.</P>
      <P>Lin became the third person to be detained in the probe of the former first
family's alleged misconduct.</P>
      <P>Chen Chen-hui, the former cashier of the Presidential Office under Chen Shui-
bian, was the first to be detained.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ming-che, the brother of Tsai Mei-li, a college classmate of former first
lady Wu Shu-jen, was also detained for allegedly taking a bribe along with
former President Chen from a land developer and providing bank accounts for the
former first family to use in laundering money overseas.</P>
      <P>The three have been listed as potential defendants in the case, along with
former President Chen, former first lady Wu, their son and daughter-in-law, Wu's
brother Wu Ching-mao, and Tsai Ming-chieh, another brother of Tsai Mei-li.</P>
      <P>Those not in custody have been barred from leaving the country.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office said
that according to the 2003 rules on operating procedures for use of secret
expenses from state affairs fund, the expenses must be sent to a special account
before they can be used and then justified by a formal document reporting on the
purpose of the expenditure.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors found, however, that while Lin and Chen Chen-hui had claimed
secret expenses -- half of the "state affairs fund" available to the
Presidential Office each month -- they did not provide documents to explain
their purpose.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors  raided Chen Shui-bian and Chen Chen-hui's residences Aug. 16
and Sept. 25, seizing several disks from Chen Chen-hui's residence in which
computer files of the use of each secret fund use was recorded.</P>
      <P>Chen Chen-hui reportedly admitted that some secret funds were used by the former
first lady for personal use and some of the funds were wired to Wu Ching-mao's
overseas bank accounts on Wu Shu-jen's instructions.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said that Lin, while serving as Chen Shui-bian's chief secretary,
handled all the claims and expenditures of the secret portion of the "state
affairs fund, " and should have first-hand knowledge of Wu Shu-jen's use of the
fund.</P>

      <P>Police busted a human-smuggling ring in the mountains of Hsinchu, northern
Taiwan Friday, rescuing 10 illegal workers -- nine men and one woman -- from
Thailand.</P>
      <P>Police also arrested a suspect, surnamed Huang, who was turned over to the
Hsinchu Prosecutors Office on charges of obstruction of freedom and violation of
the Employment Services Act.</P>
      <P>Police said that they received a recent tip that Huang and an accomplice
surnamed Hsieh had been acting as brokers for illegal foreign laborers, finding
them odd jobs.</P>
      <P>The foreign laborers, whose number rose to more than 50 at one time, were housed
in tents erected in the mountainous region of Hsinpu, Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>The workers' passports and residence permits were seized by Huang so that he
could more easily control them, police said.</P>
      <P>Huang demanded NT$800 (US$25) per day from each laborer, which netted him NT$1
million, according to police. He and his accomplice threatened to report the
foreign laborers, who were on the run from their legitimate employers, to the
authorities if the workers did not comply with their demands, police said.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese drug convict who was originally sentenced to life imprisonment but
was later granted a series of commutations by the Thai king was finally released
recently and is ready to depart for home, Taiwan's representative office in
Bangkok said Friday.</P>
      <P>The convict, identified only by his family name Yang, was arrested in December
1992 on charges of narcotics trafficking, the representative office said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>Yang was first given a life sentence. Thanks to his good behavior behind bars,
Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej commuted his sentence to 40 years in prison.</P>
      <P>With assistance from the representative office, which issued a letter of
guarantee on his behalf, Yang's prison sentence was again reduced by one-third,
the statement said, adding that in the following years, Yang received three more
rounds of commutations and thus had his prison sentence cut to 15 years and nine
months.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, Yang, 52, served out his greatly reduced prison term
recently. He was jubilant at regaining his freedom, the statement said, adding
that the representative office had been busy helping with his paperwork for his
return to Taiwan since his release. Yang departed for home Friday evening.</P>
      <P>The representative office said another 118 Taiwanese citizens are still serving
time in Thai prisons, most of them were convicted of involvement in the
narcotics trafficking or drug trade.</P>
      <P>Noting that Thailand imposes a stringent ban on narcotics-related crimes, the
statement said that any person who is found to be involved in the drug trade or
trafficking tends to receive a severe penalty.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves fell in September for the third consecutive
month, but the country still retained its status as the world's fifth largest
foreign exchange holder, according to statistics released Friday by Taiwan's
central bank -- the Taipei-based Central Bank of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The figures showed that as of the end of September, Taiwan's foreign exchange
reserves stood at US$281.13 billion, down US$957 million from the August figure.</P>
      <P>Lin Sun-yuan, deputy director-general of the central bank's department of
foreign exchange, explained that the decrease was mainly due to September's
outflow of foreign funds, which totaled US$4.8 billion in the first 19 days of
the month, compared with US$5 billion in August.</P>
      <P>Despite a decrease of US$10.27 billion in foreign currency reserves in the past
three months, Taiwan still ranked fifth among the world's largest foreign
exchange holders, behind China with US$1.8 trillion at the end of June, Japan
with US$971.3 billion at the end of August, Russia with US$446.1 billion at the
end of August, and India with US$282.8 billion at the end of July.</P>
      <P>Other statistics show that South Korea ranked sixth, with its foreign currency
reserves totaling US$239.2 billion as of the end of September.</P>
      <P>Singapore and Hong Kong -- two of the four Asian "mini dragons" -- recorded
foreign exchange reserves of US$172.6 billion and US$153.2 billion,

      <P>The U.S. Department of Defense officially notified Congress Friday of six
possible weapons sales to Taiwan worth a total of US$6.46 billion.</P>
      <P>The deals announced by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency cover 330 Patriot
Advanced Capability (PAC-3) missiles, as well as associated equipment and
services, valued at US$3.1 billion, and 30 AH-64D Block III Apache Longbow
Attack Helicopters, as well as associated weapons, equipment and services,
valued at US$2.532 billion.</P>
      <P>Also included are 32 UGM-84L Submarine-Launched Harpoon Block II missiles and 2
UTM-84L Harpoon Block II Exercise missiles, as well as associated equipment and
services, valued at US$200 million, and 182 Javelin guided missile rounds and 20
Javelin command launch units, as well as associated equipment and services,
valued at US$47 million.</P>
      <P>The deal includes the upgrade of four E-2T Aircraft to the Hawkeye 2000
configuration, as well as associated equipment and services, valued at US$250
million, and the establishment of a blank order requisition case for follow-on
spare parts in support of F-5E/F, C-130H, F-16A/B, and Indigenous Defense
Fighter IDF aircraft, communication  equipment,  radar and other related
elements of logistics support, valued at US$334 million.</P>
      <P>The U.S. State Department told CNA that the sales are in line with the terms of

to help it maintain a strong defense capability.</P>

      <P>Taiwan appreciates the U.S. administration's approval of weapons sales to Taiwan
and the decision signals a new era of mutual trust between Taiwan and the United
States, Presidential Office Spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wang said in a news conference that President Ma Ying-jeou had expressed
appreciation, that he welcomes the decision and that he is glad to see President
Bush stand by Washington's commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA).</P>
      <P>The U.S. Congress passed the TRA in 1979 after the establishment of U.S.
relations with the People's Republic of China and the severing of relations
between the U.S. and the Republic of China to guarantee defensive arms sales to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The U.S. administration announced the US$6.46 billion arms package to Taiwan at
3 a.m. Taipei time, a decision made after what analysts and media had
interpreted as a "freeze" designed to ease tension between Beijing and Taipei.</P>
      <P>"The announcement made by the U.S. administration signals an end to the turmoil
of the past eight years and the beginning of a new era of safety and peace, as
well as of mutual trust between Taiwan and the U.S.," Wang said.</P>
      <P>He said that despite various media reports on the arms sales over the past few
months, the Presidential Office had remained optimistic because all the messages
received were positive. However, no details could be revealed due to a
confidentiality understanding between the Taiwanese and U.S. governments, he
added.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also lauded the arms deal in a press release,
saying that it serves as evidence of the staunch relations between Taipei and
Washington.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon announced its approval of the sales just hours after the House of
Representatives passed a US$700 billion financial bailout plan.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon's Security Cooperation Agency told lawmakers that the sales will
support Taiwan's continuing efforts to modernize its military.</P>
      <P>The arms package includes Apache attack helicopters, Patriot PAC-3 missile
batteries, and sea-launched Harpoon missiles.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday at a human rights forum that comprehensive
efforts are needed to achieve transitional justice instead of looking at
individual cases, and that the government has to do more to indemnify the losses
of 228 Incident victims.</P>
      <P>Speaking  at  the  opening  ceremony  of the  2008  First Taiwanese-Korean Human
Rights Forum, Ma said that "only by creating a domestic and international
harmonious environment can we eradicate human rights violations such as the 228
Incident."</P>
      <P>The forum was held by the Taipei-based Memorial Foundation of 228, the Korean
May 18 Memorial Foundation and the Jeju 4.3 Research Institute. Representatives
of human rights organizations, government officials and academics from Taiwan
and South Korea were invited to share their experiences and exchange views on
human rights and transitional justice.</P>
      <P>Ma added that a single standard should be applied to all human rights
violations, no matter where and when they take place.</P>
      <P>"Historical mistakes might be forgiven but they cannot be forgotten," the
president said. "The truth of the 228 Incident should be learned generation
after generation so that no such incident will ever happen again."</P>
      <P>Noting that human rights are universal values that should not be colored by
borders, race, political parties or time, Ma said the government should not only
acknowledge  the mistakes but also compensate the victims and restore their
reputations.</P>
      <P>Ma's speech was disrupted at one point by a family member of a 228 Incident
victim who protested against him and also urged the government to convict the
late President Chiang Kai-shek for the 228 Incident.</P>
      <P>Lin Li-tsai, the daughter of Lin Chieh who died in the 228 Incident, held up a
banner while Ma was making his speech and shouted out: "Chiang is the prime
culprit of the 228 Incident, convict him of the crime."</P>
      <P>She had earlier refused to shake hands with Ma when he approached her before the
human rights forum commenced.</P>
      <P>Lin accused Ma of turning a blind eye to a report conducted by the Memorial
Foundation of 228 in 2006 that named Chiang as the prime culprit for the
incident.</P>
      <P>She told reporters outside the forum that she had planned to protest against Ma
at the forum after finding out he would attend the event, because, she claimed
"everything Ma has done" since he took office May 20 is harming the interests of
Taiwan, such as referring to himself as "mister" instead of "president" when
dealing with China and allowing imports of milk products from China "as long as
they are sanctioned by the Chinese government."</P>
      <P>"Ma is using poison, tangible or intangible, to kill Taiwanese people, " Lin
claimed. "If he sells Taiwan to China, be done with it, but what he is doing is
handing over Taiwan to China, " she further claimed.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident was an anti-Kuomintang government uprising that began Feb. 28,
1947 in Taiwan. It was violently suppressed by the government under Chiang,
resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians.</P>
      <P>The incident marked the beginning of the White Terror period in Taiwan in which
thousands more Taiwanese disappeared, were killed, or imprisoned.</P>
      <P>To commemorate the event, Feb. 28 is celebrated in Taiwan as Peace Memorial Day
and monuments and memorial parks to the victims of the incident have been
erected in various cities around the country.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Saturday that the U.S.
administration's approval of the sale of six major weapons packages to Taiwan is
a "sign of a rebuilding of relations" between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Wang's remarks came one day after the U.S. State Department notified Congress of
its approval of a US$6.46 billion arms sales package that includes Apache attack
helicopters, Patriot PAC-3 missile batteries,  Javelin anti-tank missiles and
sea-launched Harpoon missiles, as well as an upgrade of the E-2T aircraft to the

aircraft, along with related support equipment.</P>
      <P>Speaking with a CNA reporter in Taipei, Wang said failure to approve the arms
package sale would have posed "a large problem."</P>
      <P>According to Wang, not approving the package would lead others to interpret that
"Taiwan-U.S. ties had regressed and that Washington no longer cared about
Taiwan's security."</P>
      <P>He added that as U.S. President George W. Bush had already given the green light
and as Taiwan's legislature had approved the budget, failure to approve the sale
would not have made sense.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Wang noted that under the Taiwan Relations Act, the United States
has an obligation to provide Taiwan with the weapons it needs to defend itself.</P>
      <P>The legislative  speaker  said  that  following  the State Department's approval
of the sales, Taiwan-U.S. relations will only continue to improve, adding that a
central focus of Taiwan's present government is to restore mutual trust between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>Wang further said that regardless of which U.S. presidential candidate wins the
election next month, he is confident the new U.S. head of state will demonstrate

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative caucus expressed
concern Saturday about the scale of the smaller-than-expected arms sales package
approved by the U.S. administration.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, the U.S. State Department notified Congress of its decision to
approve a US$6.46 billion arms package that includes Apache attack helicopters,

Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF) aircraft and related support equipment.</P>
      <P>In response to the news, DPP caucus whip Lai Ching-te noted that the approved
arms procurement package only includes five of the weapons items requested by
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The approved  package does not include the diesel-electric submarines and Black
Hawk helicopters that Taiwan is seeking.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, rather than hailing the approval of the package as a sign of
improved U.S.-Taiwan ties, the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou should
be wary of the fact that the package is smaller than expected and be vigilant
against the possibility that it is a sign of change in relations between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>He also said that the U.S. administration's delaying of approval of the arms
sale package for so long and only notifying Congress of its decision to give the
green light after the regular legislative session had already ended should be
viewed as warning signs.</P>
      <P>The opposition lawmaker called on Ma's administration not to interpret the
approved arms sales package as "a new beginning, but instead as a new variable"
in U.S.-Taiwan ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to sign LOA on U.S. arms sales soon: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 4 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) will sign a letter of offer and
acceptance (LOA) on arms sales by the United States as soon as possible, the
ministry said Saturday after the deal was approved by the U.S. administration
the previous day.</P>
      <P>MND Spokeswoman Lisa Chi made the remarks at a ministry press conference after
the U.S. administration notified Congress that it had approved sales to Taiwan
of upgrade systems for four E-2T aircraft, Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3)
missiles, sea-launched Harpoon Block II missiles, AH-64D Block III Apache
Longbow attack helicopters, and Javelin medium-range anti-tank missiles.</P>
      <P>The MND will sign the LOA as soon as the U.S. side completes the procedure for
the arms sales, Chi noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had proposed to buy seven weapons systems from the U.S., but two of them
-- diesel-electric submarines and Black Hawk helicopters -- were not approved.</P>
      <P>Chi said the MND hopes the U.S. government will deliver the remaining two items
to Congress for approval by the end of this year, because soon after then, the
budget appropriated by the Legislative Yuan for the arms procurement will
expire.</P>
      <P>If the budget expires, the MND will have to reintroduce its budget proposal.</P>
      <P>The MND will continue to communicate with the U.S. on the unapproved items, Chi
went on.</P>
      <P>Addressing the total budget of around US$6.5 billion for the five accepted
items, Chi said the MND began this year budgeting for the systems except for the
anti-tank missiles, which will be part of the 2009 budget.</P>
      <P>While the MND has to wait for about 50 working days to sign the LOA, it is
possible for the total cost for the arms procurement to be changed because of
possible fluctuations in currency values and commodity prices, Chi said.</P>
      <P>Chi said the MND believes the U.S. government will fulfill its commitments under
the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), continuing to offer Taiwan defensive weapons.</P>
      <P>The U.S. arms sales will not only help strengthen Taiwan's self-defense
capability but will also play a possible role in the stability of the Taiwan
Strait region and the development of cross-strait relations. They also meet the
U.S. policy regarding the status quo in the strait, Chi went on.</P>
      <P>Congress passed the TRA -- which commits the U.S. to providing Taiwan with
defensive weapons -- in 1979 after the establishment of U.S. relations with the
People's Republic of China and the severing of relations between the U.S. and
the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, Chi also stated that the MND will carefully re-evaluate
whether there are still holes in the country's military preparations and will
fix them based on national defense principles as part of efforts to build a
"small but strong" army.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) registered accumulated deficits of NT$83.2 billion
(US$2.59 billion) in the first eight months of this year, while the petroleum
refinery CPC Corp., Taiwan (CPC) incurred deficits of NT$59.1 billion in the
same period, according to statistics released Saturday by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>Ministry officials estimated that the deficits of the two state-run companies
will expand further by the end of the year due to increases in raw materials
costs, including coal and crude oil, on the international market.</P>
      <P>The companies have not increased their prices to levels that truly reflect the
surging costs, constrained by the government's policies of maintaining stability
in consumer prices and taking care of the well-being of the public, the MOEA
said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Taipower has assessed that the company will be faced with a deficit of up to
NT$100 billion this year.</P>
      <P>Although electricity prices were raised July 1 and again Oct. 1 under the
Executive Yuan's two-phase adjustment policy, the scale of the adjustments have
been enough to cover only half the company's cost increases, according to
Taipower officials.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that all MOEA-owned enterprises, except Taipower and CPC,
had generated profits this year as of Aug. 31, which include profits of NT$14.79
billion for the Taiwan Sugar Corp., NT$422 million for the Taiwan Water Corp.,
NT$2.02 billion for the shipbuilder CSBC Corp., Taiwan and NT$54 million for the
Aerospace Industrial Development Corp.</P>

      <P>A series of activities aimed at promoting family values kicked off Saturday,
with Minister of Education Cheng Jei-cheng attending the opening ceremony held
in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The event, formally known as Grandparents-Grandchildren Week, is being sponsored
by the Ministry of Education to mark the upcoming Chongyang Festival, or Double
Ninth Day, which falls on Oct. 7 this year. The day is also known as Senior
Citizens' Day because it is set aside to honor senior citizens.</P>
      <P>Besides the ceremony at the National Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Taiwan's
capital,  ceremonies  to launch  the  start  of the Grandparents-Grandchildren
Week program were also held in Miaoli County's Sihu township in northern Taiwan,
Tainan City in the southern part of the country, and Taitung City in the east.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening ceremony in Taipei, Cheng said Double Ninth Day is a
traditional festival held to show care and respect for the   elderly,   and  he
expressed   hope   that   the Grandparents-Grandchildren Week activities will
help re-establish the value of family and make society more harmonious.</P>
      <P>The opening ceremony included dance and music performances by various troupes,
including several from elementary schools in the city.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Energy-saving electrical appliances welcomed as power costs rise</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>As the price of electricity has risen since Oct. 1, many people have begun to
show preference for energy-saving items when purchasing household electrical
appliances, stores said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"Recently, almost all the customers visiting our stores have chosen energy-
saving electrical appliances, " said a saleswoman at U-Lite 3C, a major
appliance chain store.</P>
      <P>"If you can save money on your power bill and receive a government subsidy at
the same time, why not (buy energy-saving electrical appliances) ? " she asked,
adding that an energy-saving refrigerator can save up to 40 percent on
electricity costs compared with a traditional one.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)  began subsidizing purchases of energy-
saving equipment from Oct. 1 this year -- a program that will run through March
31 2009 -- in order to boost the energy-saving industry and encourage people to
buy eco-friendly appliances.</P>
      <P>Only purchases of Taiwan-made refrigerators, air conditioners and washing
machines bearing energy-saving labels are entitled to receive the subsidy of
NT$2,000 (US$62) per item.</P>
      <P>The energy-saving label is granted by the MOEA's Bureau of Energy for products
with energy efficiency that is 10 percent to 50 percent higher than normal
standards.</P>
      <P>According to Shih Yen-shiang, the MOEA administrative deputy minister, the
program will cost the government an estimated NT$530 million.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the project will help save about 41.6 million kilowatt-hours
of electricity and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 26,000 tons over a year --
69 times the quantity that would be absorbed by Daan Forest Park.</P>
      <P>Even if the public's preference for energy-saving products is obvious, not
everyone is prepared to buy locally made products, said a salesman of Tsannkuen
3C, another chain store.</P>
      <P>"Many of our clients prefer imported refrigerators, especially those from Japan,
which are, they believe, more energy-saving, thus more worth buying," he told
CNA.</P>
      <P>The state-run Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) raised the cost of electricity Oct. 1.
However, with the end of the peak summer season -- when electricity prices are
higher than at other times of the year -- people will not necessarily be paying
more for their power bills, said Yeh Huey-ching, director-general of the Bureau
of Energy, although compared to the same period of last year, the cost will be
slightly higher.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, Taipower is expected to suffer a deficit of NT$105.1 billion
in 2008 due to soaring crude oil and coal prices.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou visited a centenarian in southern Taiwan Saturday while
cities and counties around the nation sponsored a variety of activities to mark
the approach of Senior Citizen's Day, which falls on the ninth day of the ninth
lunar month -- Oct. 7 this year.</P>
      <P>Ma visited Chen Hsieh Lien, a 102-year-old woman, at her home in Kaohsiung and
wished her happiness.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior organized a variety show and other
activities at Banciao Train Station in Taipei County to celebrate the festival.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi wished all the elderly health and happiness, and
pledged to take better care of them, saying that is "the biggest responsibility
of the government."</P>
      <P>He noted that the number of the centenarians in Taiwan totaled 997 last year and
that as of the end of September this year, the number had reached 1,075, the
oldest of whom is a 122-year-old who lives in Taitung, eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also that same day, Minister of Education Cheng Jei-Cheng opened a grandparent-
grandchildren week activity in Taipei as part of the Senior Citizen's Day
celebrations.</P>
      <P>The first event of its kind, which aims to convey the sense that the old and the
young are treasures, was also held simultaneously in three other places --
Miaoli, Tainan and Taitung.</P>
      <P>Cheng expressed hope that the event, which features exchanges between the
generations, will help rebuild family values and develop a more harmonious
society.</P>
      <P>Elementary school students danced,  while grandparents  and grandchildren played
with tops, did shadow boxing, Chinese martial arts and played Chinese music
together.</P>
      <P>Old-time toys played during the childhoods of the grandparents were offered to
the grandchildren to let them get a glimpse of life in the old days, Cheng noted
.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, the city government treated 100 families to beef noodles as the 2008
Beef Noodle Festival kicked off that same day, as a way of paying respects to
senior citizens.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin also prepared a bowl of "nostalgia flavored" beef
noodle for auction that was sold to the Beef Noodle Exchange and Development
Association of Taipei -- which sponsors the annual festival -- for NT$99,999
(US$3,125). Nine is an auspicious figure that stands for longevity in Chinese.</P>
      <P>The association also auctioned three bowls of beef noodles to raise a total of
NT$153,667 (US$4,808) to be donated to charity organizations for the care of the
elderly.</P>
      <P>In Taichung, central Taiwan, two charity organizations solicited Uniform Invoice
receipts from the public.</P>
      <P>The Genesis Social Welfare Foundation and the Huashan Social Welfare Foundation,
which are dedicated to care for the elderly, mobilized volunteers to gather the
invoices, for which the government offers up to NT$2 million in a bimonthly draw
to encourage shoppers to get invoices for their purchases.</P>
      <P>The two foundations noted that the cooler winter weather can make elderly people
living alone feel especially isolated, so that caring for them requires more

    <HEADLINE>Zero-melamine content requirement difficult to follow: scholars</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>It is difficult for certain foods to be totally free of traces of melamine
because some plastic containers for foods,  agricultural pesticide derivatives
and construction materials release the industrial chemical, Taiwanese experts in
public health said Saturday.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks at the opening of the 2008 annual joint meeting  of the
Taiwan Public Health Association,  the Taiwan Epidemiology Association and the
Taiwanese Injury Prevention and Safety Promotion Association at the Taipei
Medical University.</P>
      <P>Melamine is the one of topics for discussion at the two-day meeting.</P>
      <P>Melamine adulteration in China-made milk powder or non-dairy creamer and
vegetable-based  proteins imported from China have recently triggered public
panic in Taiwan following news that toxic dairy products have killed at least
four infants and sickened tens of thousands of others in China.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) at one point revised the standard
for acceptable levels of melamine content in food from zero to 2.5 parts per
million (ppm).</P>
      <P>However, the revision caused panic among consumers, who clamored for a zero
content standard, leading to the resignation of former DOH Minister Lin Fang-yue
last week.</P>
      <P>As a result, the safety standard for melamine content was reset at
"undetectable, " meaning products that contain from 0.05 ppm to 2.4 ppm of the
industrial chemical are not allowed on store shelves.</P>
      <P>Wu Kueh-yuh, an assistant professor at the National Taiwan University Institute
of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene, said Japan discovered as
earlier as in 1987 that food containers release the toxic chemical, which is
used to make plastics and fertilizers.</P>
      <P>In addition to Japan, research by the World Health Organization (WHO) has also
detected melamine release from melamine tableware, cyromazin derivatives and
chemical construction materials.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Wu said, it is difficult to demand zero melamine content in food
products.</P>
      <P>Wu further explained that the WHO sets 0.007 ppm as a reference for acceptable
melamine concentrations.</P>
      <P>Citing animal research by the European Union, Wu said in the situation of
consuming melamine-containing foods for consecutive 13 weeks, the daily
tolerable amount of the chemical in humans is 0.5 ppm per kilogram of body
weight.</P>
      <P>Professor Chan Chang-chun at the institute suggested that the authorities should
set a clear line on standards for natural trace amounts of melamine and for
melamine adulteration to food, based on advice from experts from other
industrial countries to prevent unnecessary disputes.</P>
      <P>Melamine can cause kidney stones and kidney failure if consumed in sufficient
quantities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chiayi magistrate released on NT$3 million bail</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Chiayi District Court ruled Saturday to release Chiayi Magistrate Chen Ming-
wen on bail of NT$3 million (US$93,750) for his suspected role in a bidding
scandal for a waste water disposal project in the southern county.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said Chen might have revealed the floor price of the project to
benefit contractor Lai Wen-cheng, and requested earlier in the day that the
court grant the detention of both men.</P>
      <P>Lai was released on NT$1.5 million bail.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, prosecutors raided the Chiayi county government, Chen's residence
and several other places. They also questioned Chen, Lai and county official Lee
Hsiang-ku, who served as the acting head of the county's water resources
department last year.</P>
      <P>Former head of the water resources department Chen Tien-pao, who is now being
detained on suspicion of having received NT$5 million in kickbacks from the
contractor in the case, was also questioned Friday.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors alleged Chiayi Magistrate Chen of calling Lai on the eve of the
opening bidding date of the project in May 2007, and of meeting Lai in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lai then called his company to adjust the bidding price lower. The conversation
between Chen and Lai was recorded, the prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors also found that three assessment members of the waste water project
were all scholars with whom Chen Tien-pao, former director of the water
resources department, was on familiar terms.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-wen faces the biggest storm of his political life in three decades,
analysts said, and his involvement in the scandal could cast doubt on the Chiayi
magistrate election next year.</P>
      <P>Chen, originally a member of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , was elected county
councilor at the age of 24 and as Chiayi County Council speaker at 28, becoming
the youngest speaker in the nation. He was later elected as a legislator.</P>
      <P>After Chen Shui-bian's election in 2000 as president, the KMT wanted to recall
him, but then-Legislator Chen Ming-wen, urged by local people who wanted to
focus on the economy, defected to Chen Shui-bian's Democratic Progressive Party
camp in an attempt to help the agricultural county get more resources from the
central government. The recall motion eventually failed.</P>
      <P>To reciprocate, Chen's administration was said to have supported all Chen Ming-
wen's development plans, including giving consent to build a branch of the
National Palace Museum and an expressway in the county.</P>

      <P>Eight members of the U.S. House of Representatives have written to Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice calling for the removal of language unfriendly toward
Taiwan in the State Department's directives for its overseas agencies.</P>
      <P>The congressional members were referring to messages delivered on an annual
basis to U.S. embassies abroad in which the department repeats its long-standing
guidelines on U.S. relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Distributed as a routine message delivered every September -- one month before
Taiwan's Double Ten National Day -- the guidelines dictate various principles
for dealing with Taiwan,  including forbidding U.S. officials from attending
National Day receptions and from referring to Taiwan as the Republic of China,
its official name.</P>
      <P>While the messages are very similar every year, the congressmen said in the
letter dated Sept. 28 that they have noted that the State Department  added some
political  rhetoric harmful to Taiwan's democracy in its messages for 2007 and
2008.</P>
      <P>This rhetoric includes a reiteration of the United States' "one China policy, "
a statement that Taiwan is not a "sovereign independent country, " a section
detailing that "the United States does not support Taiwan's membership in
international organizations that "require statehood" and a part about the United
States not allowing the flag of Taiwan to fly on U.S. government premises,
according to the congressmen.</P>
      <P>The congressional members said they find it unacceptable that the State
Department is turning what should be a technical note into a specific policy and
demanded a clear explanation from Rice on the decision.</P>
      <P>They urged the State Department to remove the new language and restore the
original version used prior to 2007.</P>
      <P>The letter was signed by Shelley Berkley (D-Nev.), Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), Dan
Burton (R-Ind.), Scott Garrett (R-N.J.), Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), Thaddeus McCotter
(R-Mich.), Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.) and Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.).</P>
      <P>The State Department has outlined various restrictions for dealing with Taiwan
since Washington switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.</P>
      <P>The restrictions include that meetings between U.S. and Taiwanese officials must
not take place in State Department buildings, the White House or the Old
Executive Office Building; and that executive branch personnel are not permitted
to attend functions held at the Washington residence of Taiwan's representative
to the United States.</P>
      <P>Regarding official references to Taiwan, U.S. executive branch officials are not
permitted to refer to Taiwan's government as a "government." Instead, the term
"Taiwan authorities" must be used. The guidelines  also restrict executive
branch personnel  from referring to the people of Taiwan as "Taiwanese" but
require them instead to refer to the population as the "people on Taiwan."</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) will coordinate with the Department of Health
(DOH) even more closely to prevent imports of any melamine-contaminated
vegetable imports from China, the council said in a statement Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level council issued the statement amid Chinese media reports saying
that some China-grown vegetables, such as lettuce, tomato, mushroom, potato and
Java waterdropwort, have been found to contain excessive residues of melamine.</P>
      <P>Melamine, a nitrogen-rich chemical used to make plastics and fertilizers, is
abused in China as a food additive as it masks low protein levels in milk
diluted with water to lower costs.</P>
      <P>Melamine contamination of baby formula has been blamed for the deaths of at
least four infants and kidney illnesses in more than 53,000 children in China.</P>
      <P>A shipment of 25 tons of milk powder imported into Taiwan from China earlier
this year has also caused chaos in the local food market and led to the resign
of Lin Fang-yue as DOH minister late last month.</P>
      <P>The COA statement stressed that none of the vegetables on the reported melamine-
contaminated list have been imported into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, Taiwan imports about 50,000 tons of refrigerated
vegetables from China annually, with radish, chili pepper and sweet pepper
forming the bulk. In the first eight months of this year, vegetable imports from
China slightly exceeded 29,000 tons.</P>
      <P>COA officials stressed that all foreign vegetables, including those from China,
have to pass stringent pesticide residue tests before they enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Amid mounting  concerns  about safety  of China-originating foodstuffs, the
officials said the COA will coordinate with the Department of Health to
intensify testing and inspection of vegetable imports from China.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the officials said the COA has formed a special task force to step up
monitoring of animal feed imports from China in hopes of preventing any
melamine-tainted products from entering Taiwan.</P>

said the DPP will field the most competent candidates with clean images to run

rational, mature, pragmatic and vibrant modern party, Tsai said the DPP will
take the lead in nurturing a brand new political culture that treasures
accountability and credibility. "By so doing, we hope to inspire Taiwan's
sweeping political reform, " she added.</P>
      <P>Tsai further reiterated the party's platforms of pushing the Kuomintang
government to offer tax refunds to help improve people's livelihoods and uplift
the poverty line to allow more households to be eligible to receive social
welfare benefits amid the current worldwide economic volatility.</P>
      <P>Before concluding  her speech,  Tsai reaffirmed  the DPP's commitment to
safeguarding Taiwan's sovereignty,  enriching the Taiwan-centric consciousness
and helping build Taiwan into a strong, beautiful and creative fortress of
freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>In her speech delivered at the party's birthday celebration rally at Yuanshan
Park in Taipei City, Tsai also clarified the party's stance on the ongoing
judicial probe into alleged misconduct committed by former President Chen during
his eight years in power.</P>
      <P>Chen, a DPP founding member, quit the party in August amid reports  that his
family was involved  in cross-border  money laundering.</P>
      <P>"The DPP fully supports the ongoing judicial probe and will not shield or cover
up Chen's any misdeeds, "Tsai said, adding she believes that if local society
can face Chen's criminal allegations in a rational manner, Taiwan's democracy
will become more mature and even healthier.</P>
      <P>But if the former president's basic human rights could not be respected and
protected in the investigative process, Tsai said, Taiwan society would only
become more antagonistic and chaotic.</P>
      <P>"The judiciary's credibility could also be at stake if the media is allowed to
make a trial before the court hands down a ruling, " Tsai added.</P>
      <P>In addition to being implicated in a money laundering case, Chen is also under
investigation for alleged embezzlement of public funds by using other people's
spending receipts to gain reimbursements from a special "state affairs fund" set
aside for his discretionary use for official purposes. His wife has been
indicted in this case.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors are now investigating whether any portion of the "state affairs
fund" had been wired to the overseas bank accounts of Chen's family members
during his eight-year presidency.</P>
      <P>Two of Chen's trusted aides and a college classmate of the former first lady
have been held incommunicado for their alleged roles in the two cases involving
Chen and his family.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Shui-bian, the money in the overseas bank accounts was the
balance of political contributions for his two mayoral and two presidential bids
between 1993 and 2004. Chen claimed his innocence, insisting that he didn't use
any penny of the "state affairs fund" to line his own pocket.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA vows to tighten vegetable inspection over safety concerns</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) will coordinate with the Department of Health
(DOH) even more closely to prevent imports of any melamine-contaminated
vegetable imports from China, the council said in a statement Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level council issued the statement amid Chinese media reports saying
that some China-grown vegetables, such as lettuce, tomato, mushroom, potato and
Java waterdropwort, have been found to contain excessive residues of melamine.</P>
      <P>Melamine, a nitrogen-rich chemical used to make plastics and fertilizers, is
abused in China as a food additive as it masks low protein levels in milk
diluted with water to lower costs.</P>
      <P>Melamine contamination of baby formula has been blamed for the deaths of at
least four infants and kidney illnesses in more than 53,000 children in China.</P>
      <P>A shipment of 25 tons of milk powder imported into Taiwan from China earlier
this year has also caused chaos in the local food market and led to the resign
of Lin Fang-yue as DOH minister late last month.</P>
      <P>The COA statement stressed that none of the vegetables on the reported melamine-
contaminated list have been imported into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, Taiwan imports about 50,000 tons of refrigerated
vegetables from China annually, with radish, chili pepper and sweet pepper
forming the bulk. In the first eight months of this year, vegetable imports from
China slightly exceeded 29,000 tons.</P>
      <P>COA officials stressed that all foreign vegetables, including those from China,
have to pass stringent pesticide residue tests before they enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Amid mounting  concerns  about safety  of China-originating foodstuffs, the
officials said the COA will coordinate with the Department of Health to
intensify testing and inspection of vegetable imports from China.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the officials said the COA has formed a special task force to step up
monitoring of animal feed imports from China in hopes of preventing any
melamine-tainted products from entering Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>State Department urged to stop using 'unfriendly' language</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Eight members of the U.S. House of Representatives have written to Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice calling for the removal of language unfriendly toward
Taiwan in the State Department's directives for its overseas agencies.</P>
      <P>The congressional members were referring to messages delivered on an annual
basis to U.S. embassies abroad in which the department repeats its long-standing
guidelines on U.S. relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Distributed as a routine message delivered every September -- one month before
Taiwan's Double Ten National Day -- the guidelines dictate various principles
for dealing with Taiwan,  including forbidding U.S. officials from attending
National Day receptions and from referring to Taiwan as the Republic of China,
its official name.</P>
      <P>While the messages are very similar every year, the congressmen said in the
letter dated Sept. 28 that they have noted that the State Department  added some
political  rhetoric harmful to Taiwan's democracy in its messages for 2007 and
2008.</P>
      <P>This rhetoric includes a reiteration of the United States' "one China policy, "
a statement that Taiwan is not a "sovereign independent country, " a section
detailing that "the United States does not support Taiwan's membership in
international organizations that "require statehood" and a part about the United
States not allowing the flag of Taiwan to fly on U.S. government premises,
according to the congressmen.</P>
      <P>The congressional members said they find it unacceptable that the State
Department is turning what should be a technical note into a specific policy and
demanded a clear explanation from Rice on the decision.</P>
      <P>They urged the State Department to remove the new language and restore the
original version used prior to 2007.</P>
      <P>The letter was signed by Shelley Berkley (D-Nev.), Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), Dan
Burton (R-Ind.), Scott Garrett (R-N.J.), Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), Thaddeus McCotter
(R-Mich.), Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.) and Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.).</P>
      <P>The State Department has outlined various restrictions for dealing with Taiwan
since Washington switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.</P>
      <P>The restrictions include that meetings between U.S. and Taiwanese officials must
not take place in State Department buildings, the White House or the Old
Executive Office Building; and that executive branch personnel are not permitted
to attend functions held at the Washington residence of Taiwan's representative
to the United States.</P>
      <P>Regarding official references to Taiwan, U.S. executive branch officials are not
permitted to refer to Taiwan's government as a "government." Instead, the term
"Taiwan authorities" must be used. The guidelines  also restrict executive
branch personnel  from referring to the people of Taiwan as "Taiwanese" but
require them instead to refer to the population as the "people on Taiwan."</P>

      <P>The Taipei Confucian Temple held a rite Sunday to mark the 2,558th anniversary
of the birth of Confucius (551-479 BC) -- the most revered philosopher and
educator in Chinese history.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou burned incense, delivered a eulogy and presented an
inscribed board in praise of Confucius during the rite, marking the first time
since Taiwan's retrocession from Japanese rule in 1945 that a head of state has
attended a ceremonial ritual at the Confucian Temple to mark the anniversary of
the ancient Chinese sage's birth.</P>
      <P>The rite, which began at 5 a.m., was presided over by Taipei Mayor Hau lung-bin,
with Kung Chuei-chang, the 79th lineal descendant of Confucius, serving as the
"sacrificial official" of the rite.</P>
      <P>An adapted version of the classic eight-row ceremonial dance, known as the Bayi
Dance, was performed by 64 schoolchildren in tribute to the sage. In the past, a
smaller-scale six-row ceremonial dance has been held to mark the occasion.</P>
      <P>A grandiose feast of 193 courses, including dried peach and prune, bamboo shoots
and goose, was offered as a sacrifice at the ritual.</P>
      <P>The Taipei city government had postponed the Confucius birthday ritual by one
week from Sept. 29 -- which is also Teacher's Day -- to Oct. 5 because of
Typhoon Jangmi, which deluged the country on that day.</P>
      <P>In 1952, the Republic of China government designated Confucius' birthday as
Teachers' Day in recognition of his great achievements as a teacher, and
Confucian temples around Taiwan hold sacrificial rituals on this day every year
in his honor.</P>
      <P>Confucius was born Sept. 28, 551 BC in China's state of Lu -- now Shandong
Province. His teachings have become the cornerstone of traditional  Chinese
philosophy  and culture and have greatly influenced some other Asian countries
in which the Chinese have had influence.</P>

      <P>Copyright police in the city of Chiayi, southern Taiwan, announced Sunday that
they had busted an illegal DVD copying factory in the northern county of Taoyuan
and had seized 100,000 pirated discs with an estimated value that represents
losses to the legal copyright holders of NT$10 billion (US$310.95 million).</P>
      <P>Wu Chuan-hao, leader of the Chiayi unit of the Intellectual Property Protection
Brigade under the Taiwan Provincial Police Administration, told a press
conference that about six months ago, officers of his unit discovered a Web site
offering the pirated products.</P>
      <P>The goods offered for sale on the Web site included a wide variety of software
systems usually bundled on a single disc under the name "instant noodles," as
well as pirated movies and pornographic films.</P>
      <P>According to Wu,  the unit's investigation  identified the mastermind behind the
piracy operation as a man surnamed Chen, who had the Web site hosted by a server
in China.</P>
      <P>Chen would take orders in China through the Internet and then refer the orders,
along with the illegally copied software, to his two accomplices in Taiwan --
Tsai Chih-dong and Lin Dong-hua, both aged 27 -- who would copy the ordered DVDs
and then use delivery services to send them to customers at prices ranging from
NT$100 to NT$300 per disc.</P>
      <P>Wu said his unit placed  the DVD copying  factory  under surveillance for nearly
six months before deciding it was time to take action.</P>
      <P>"With a warrant issued by the Taoyuan Public Prosecutors Office, we searched the
factory at Hsinwu township in Taoyuan County and seized 50 DVD burner machines
along with the discs," he said.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the Web site has been in operation for three years, with
turnover exceeding NT$1 million each month.</P>
      <P>The two suspects being questioned will face charges for violation of the
Copyright Law.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's two main international airports experienced drops in world rankings in
both passenger and cargo volume in 2007, according to a report released Saturday
by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport ranked 15th among 877 airports in the world
in terms of cargo transport volume in 2007, down two notches from the previous
year, the report shows.</P>
      <P>In the Asia-Pacific region, the airport ranked 6th among 136 in cargo volume in
2007, the same as 2006, while Kaohsiung International Airport was placed 40th,
down one notch from 2006.</P>
      <P>In terms of passenger volume in the region, Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
ranked 14th in 2007, slipping one place from 2006, while the Kaohsiung airport
ranked 45th in 2007, down eight places from 2006, the report reveals.</P>
      <P>The ministry's Institute of Transportation warned in the report that while
airports in neighboring countries registered growth in cargo volume in 2007,
Taiwan's two main airports suffered a decline.</P>
      <P>The institute  noted that in 2007,  both Beijing  Capital International Airport
and Shanghai Pudong International Airport saw growth of more than 15 percent in
cargo volume, while cargo volume at Seoul's Incheon International Airport
increased 9.4 percent.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport experienced a 5.5 percent dip
and Kaohsiung International Airport saw an 8.8 percent drop in cargo volume.</P>
      <P>The total volume of cargo handled at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
totalled 1.61 million tons for the year.</P>
      <P>The institute suggested that Taiwan's airports should enhance their
competitiveness in cargo handling by improving logistics, lowering operating
costs, increasing flight destinations and adopting effective logistics
strategies.</P>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) attributed the drop in cargo volume
to the overall economic situation and the drop in export cargo due to local
high-tech companies moving to foreign countries.</P>
      <P>It said more cargo shippers also opted to deliver cargo by most cost-efficient
sea shipping instead of air transport to cope with surging oil prices.</P>
      <P>China's rapidly growing air cargo sector has also had a heavy impact on Taiwan's
air cargo industry. Since China signed an agreement on air cargo delivery with
the United States in 2004, the number of cargo flights between the two countries
has doubled over the past three years, according to the CAA.</P>
      <P>To boost the development of Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, the government
is pushing forward a draft "special statute for Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport" that calls for the setting up of an extensive "aviation city"
comprising not only the airport but also various economic zones, the CAA noted.</P>
      <P>Another report shows that for the first eight months of this year, passenger
volume at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport dropped 3.4 percent compared with
the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>In response, the CAA said it will make it clear whether the decline in passenger
traffic is the result of the construction and expansion of airports in the Asia-
Pacific region or the expansion of the Chinese air transport market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that Taiwan will open its doors to Chinese
students seeking to pursue advanced studies but will not allow them to sit tests
in Taiwan and obtain Taiwanese professional licenses.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a national convention on youth policy sponsored by the Cabinet-level
National Youth Commission, Ma said the government's policy of recruiting Chinese
students is aimed at making Taiwan's educational environment more liberalized
and globalized.</P>
      <P>"The policy was espoused 10 years ago by then-Education Minister Wu Jin," Ma
noted.</P>
      <P>He added that the so-called "opening policy" means that domestic colleges and
universities will be allowed to recruit Chinese students but the administration
will not push or encourage them to do so.</P>
      <P>Noting that China now has over 2,500 colleges and universities, some of which
rank among the list of leading universities in the world, Ma said Taiwan will
leave itself a "laughing stock" if it continues to close its doors and turn its
back on world opinion.</P>
      <P>On the viewpoint that such opening will "bring about unlimited business
opportunities to the country, " Ma denied that this is the purpose of the
government policy.</P>
      <P>"The first and foremost purpose of allowing Chinese students to study in Taiwan
is to help young men and women from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to better
know each other, eventually helping normalize cross-strait relations," Ma said.</P>
      <P>"Secondly, it will help Taiwan recruit top-notch Chinese students to spur Taiwan
students' competitiveness," he added.</P>
      <P>"The other purpose of the opening policy is that it will probably help solve the
problems  facing  privately  run colleges  and universities because of
increasingly declining enrollment rates, " he predicted.</P>
      <P>Ma added, however, that the country will not allow Chinese citizens to sit tests
in Taiwan for professional licenses on the grounds that only people who are
Republic of China nationals are allowed to sit such tests.</P>

      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said Sunday that she
has no plans to run for the post of Taipei County magistrate in late 2009.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks while responding  to questions from reporters during a
beach cleanup along the banks of the Danshui River in Bali township, Taipei
County.</P>
      <P>The cleanup took place as part of a series of programs to celebrate the DPP's
22nd founding anniversary, which had been postponed for one week because of
Typhoon Jangmi.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who took over the helm of the DPP in May after the party lost the
presidential election and became an opposition party, is considered a rising
star and the DPP's best hope. Several DPP councilors on the Taipei County
Council have urged Tsai to run for county magistrate next year.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Su Tseng-chang, who served as Taipei magistrate for two terms
from 1996 to 2004, said he would respect Tsai's wishes but reminded her that, as
party chairwoman, she has a responsibility to field heavy hitters from the party
for the 2009 mayoral and county magistrate elections.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on former President Chen Shui-bian's speaking tour of Taiwan in
which he is claiming innocence over alleged corruption and money laundering
charges against himself and his family, Tsai said she can "understand Chen's
feelings as a person facing imminent judicial proceedings."</P>
      <P>But she added that "although DPP members are still emotionally attached to him,
they do know clearly what is right and what is wrong."</P>
      <P>On her plans for the party, Tsai said the biggest challenge is finding ways to

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top China policy planner said Sunday in response to an outcry over the
rights of Chinese spouses of Taiwanese people to work and stay in Taiwan that
the issue will be tackled step-by-step.</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) attaches great importance to the rights and
interests of the Chinese spouses of local citizens, whose numbers are close to
300,000, MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said during  a symposium  sponsored  by
the  Cross-Strait  Marriage Consultation and Enhancement Association, a private
organization.</P>
      <P>Lai said the council is taking a three-pronged approach to safeguard the rights
and interests of Chinese spouses -- they will be welcome to enter Taiwan if they
are genuine and legal; cases involving Chinese women entering Taiwan under the
guise of a bogus marriage will be cracked down; and the council will spare no
efforts to protect the rights and interests of genuine Taiwanese-Chinese
couples.</P>
      <P>As for the Chinese spouses' rights to work and the period they are allowed to
remain in Taiwan, Lai said any change to the regulations will be up to
amendments to the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the
Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>"It will be tackled step-by-step, as other coping measures will also be needed,"
she added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she went on, the number of new cross-strait marriages registered in
Taiwan has declined over the past two years -- down from 39,000 in 2003 to
slightly over 10,000 in 2007 and 2006 -- mainly as a result of a crackdown on
marriages of convenience and marriage brokers.</P>
      <P>Lai forecast that marriages between people who actually know and love each other
will be the mainstay of cross-strait marriages in the future.</P>
      <P>Chinese spouses are also expected to have different requirements from now, she
continued, predicting that the wives of Taiwanese citizens working in China will
likely demand long-term multiple entry and exit permits instead of seeking
longer periods of leave to remain.</P>
      <P>At a meeting with representatives of the Cross-Strait Marriage Consultation and
Enhancement Association July 16, Lai said the MAC intended to repeal what it
sees as unjust regulations governing Chinese spouses that were put in place over
the past four years by the previous Democratic Progressive Party administration,
including a requirement that they provide documented proof of financial solvency
when applying for a Taiwan identity card.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President expects direct links to make Kaohsiung Harbor boom</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday during a tour of Kaohsiung Harbor that the
harbor's competitiveness is expected to be boosted after it is opened for direct
sea transport across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He said that once the direct shipping links are established, international
merchant ships will not need to sail via third places, which will help
enterprises cut transport costs.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while meeting with businessmen to listen to their opinions
on enhancing Kaohsiung Harbor's competitiveness in light of the dwindling cargo
throughput of the port over the past few years.</P>
      <P>Lu Feng-hai, chairman of Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp., suggested that the
government should build another cross-harbor tunnel to Cijin, a cross-harbor
bridge and access roads to the harbor, to relieve traffic between the area and
Cijin and enhance the efficiency of cargo delivery at the harbor.</P>
      <P>Ma ordered the harbor administration to take Lu's advice into account in its
plans.</P>
      <P>The president also cited a recent report that Kaohsiung Harbor has slipped to
only the world's sixth-busiest container port after Singapore, Hong Kong,
Shanghai, Busan and Shenzhen.</P>
      <P>He added that the harbor's ranking is expected to slide further as it is likely
to be overtaken by Dubai and Rotterdam.</P>
      <P>Expressing concern over the drop in ranking from third to sixth, Ma expressed
hope that the volume of shipping cargo handled at the harbor will substantially
increase after direct cross-strait shipping comes into practice.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Change stated house sizes to reflect reality: consumers' group</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The registered size of houses should be limited to private enclosed areas, a
consumers group said Sunday, urging the government to change the registration
system to "give consumers better protection."</P>
      <P>Lin  Wang-gen,  an official  of the non-profit  Consumers' Foundation, told a
news conference that nearly 20 percent of the advertised area of apartments sold
in 38 building surveyed in Taipei by his foundation was common space, balcony
space or covered rooftop space.</P>
      <P>This space, which Lin described as "fictitious space, " also includes elevator
wells, machinery rooms, public corridors, public recreation halls, water tanks
and air conditioner rooms.</P>
      <P>"These areas are not living spaces used exclusively by the owners, but are
registered on official documents as part of the houses and are sold as such to
the buyers." Lin said.</P>
      <P>In some of the surveyed buildings, the "fictitious space" accounts for up to
66.01 percent of the advertised space of the houses for sale, meaning that
buyers have to pay for more than they can actually use, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Almost all of the 38 buildings inspected have balconies and canopies which
cannot be used as living space but those two parts made up an average of 19.84
percent of the houses' nominal size, Lin went on.</P>
      <P>In addition to warning potential house buyers to watch out for this unusable
space, Lin urged the government to crack down on what he described as a
"dishonest practice" employed by most house builders by excluding at least
balcony and canopies from the registered size of houses.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou told a youth meeting Sunday that the government is
working toward the establishment of a culture and tourism ministry to better
promote cultural innovation and tourism.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that the government raised the education, science and culture budget to
NT$343 billion in its 2009 general budget proposal, representing 18.7 percent of
the total budget, which he said is proof that the administration  considers  the
issue to be of great importance.</P>
      <P>Saying that the budget allocated to the ministry will also be greater than that
allocated to the existing Council for Cultural Affairs, Ma added that promoting
domestic tourism is part of the government's flagship plans to spur the
development of the country's service industry.</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that 3.71 million visitors came to Taiwan last year,
while Taiwan tourists made more than 8.67 million overseas visits during the
same period. The figures mean that "we still have ample room to improve in this
area, " he said.</P>
      <P>Adding that granting free-visa privileges is a measure that can be taken into
consideration, Ma also said the central government will provide funding for
local governments to boost the development of the tourism industry on a step-by-
step and longstanding basis.</P>
      <P>The government policy "calls for creativity and promotional efforts to increase
Taiwan's visibility and attract more tourists, " he went on, adding that
cultural and artistic activities are also a principal aspect of Taiwan's tourism
industry.</P>
      <P>The president also said traditional Taiwanese opera will not fade away as it has
taken root in Taiwan, given that many elementary schools provide courses in
local theatrical opera.</P>

      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen will not
attend Oct. 10 National Day celebrations to be staged in front of the
Presidential Office, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who is the leading
organizer of the celebrations, said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wang said he had been told by Tsai that she will not attend the celebrations,
the first one under the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou of the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Much as he was disappointment at Tsai's decision, the speaker said, he can

the KMT.</P>
      <P>Wang was referring to a scuffle between the lawmakers of DPP and KMT at the

about 10,500 square meters on five floors and featuring  over 400 marine
artifacts,  paintings  and nautical instruments.</P>
      <P>One of the main attractions of the new museum is sure to be the 360-degree

      <P>The display screen system was donated by Weathernews Inc., the world's leading

celebration of his 80th birthday. The establishment of the museum has long been
one of Chang's dreams.</P>
      <P>Visitors to the museum will be able to view maps of pressure systems, ocean
currents, water temperatures, storm positions and much more on the display
system's 1.5-meter diameter screen.</P>
      <P>Besides meteorological data, the display system, with its use of a position
polling system and global position system, will allow visitors see the location
of Evergreen Marine Corp.'s 88 ships anywhere in the world.</P>
      <P>The new museum features five permanent exhibition galleries, including the
History of Ships gallery on the fifth floor, the Modern Ships gallery on the
fourth floor, the Maritime Taiwan and Marine Paintings  galleries on the third

    <HEADLINE>Rules on Chinese spouses' working rights should be relaxed: CLA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
10/06/08  13:55:08
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top labor affairs official said Monday that the regulations governing
the working rights of Chinese spouses of Taiwan nationals should be relaxed if
the country is determined to treat this group of people fairly.</P>
      <P>Wang Ju-hsuan, minister of the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA),
said that since Chinese spouses of local citizens are daughters-in-law  of
Taiwanese elders and mothers of Taiwanese children, they should be granted the
same rights as people from other countries who are married to Taiwan nationals.
This means that Chinese spouses should be able to obtain work permits
immediately after they are granted resident status, she said.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the media at the Legislative Yuan, Wang said a relaxation of the
work restrictions has long been sought by social activits and Chinese spouses.</P>
      <P>Under the current regulations, Chinese spouses have to wait at least six years
after marriage before they can obtain permission to work in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that any change to the regulations will require amending the Statute
Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland
Area, Wang said she believes the legislative caucus of the ruling Kuomintang
will support the amendments. She further noted that the main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party has not opposed the proposal too strongly.</P>
      <P>Wang promised that once the Mainland Affairs Council -- the country's top China
policy coordinating body -- approves the amended policy, the CLA will follow.</P>
      <P>Addressing concerns that the proposed amendement may have an adverse impact on
job opportunities for Taiwan nationals, Wang said she is not particularly
worried about that, given that currently only about 20,000-odd Chinese spouses,
of the total 300,000, will be qualified to work in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Besides, she added, most of the Chinese spouses currently working in Taiwan are
employed as caregivers or in the service sector at businesses such as
restaurants -- jobs that most Taiwanese people would not take.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Middle-age workers hit by employment crisis: survey</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 6 (CNA)
10/06/08  14:22:46
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eighty-two percent of middle-age workers are concerned about a possible
employment crisis as an economic slowdown has led to sluggish business,
according to the results of a survey released Monday by an online employment
broker.</P>
      <P>The survey conducted by 1111 Job Bank found that many workers have started to
feel the impact, with 46.21 percent of respondents saying their employers have
announced a workforce reduction, 30.68 percent  having seen a change in their
job content or labor conditions, and 26.45 percent having experienced a
cancellation or change in their benefits.</P>
      <P>While only 12.15 percent of respondents expressed confidence that it was
"absolutely impossible" for them to become a victim of involuntary unemployment,
17.41 percent said it was "very possible, " and 9.47 percent said such a
scenario was "imminent."</P>
      <P>The problems that middle-age workers worry about most, in the event that they
lose their jobs, are their financial status, difficulty finding a new job, and
the small number of middle- and high-level positions available.</P>
      <P>Conscious of the difficulty middle-age workers find in changing jobs, 36.36
percent of respondents wanted to retain their current positions until
retirement. The other two major reasons mentioned by the respondents were
satisfaction with their current pay and benefits and fear of change.</P>
      <P>The workers who most wish to stay in their currents jobs until retirement age
are from the government, education, medical and health care, agricultural,
industrial and commercial service sectors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 42.11 percent of the businesses surveyed said their inclination to
hire workers aged 35-45 has grown following a 2007 amendment to the Employment
Services Act that banned employment discrimination based on age.</P>
      <P>However, on average, businesses still set an age limit of 38 for candidates
applying for non-supervisory positions, with 45.9 percent of businesses setting
the ceiling at 35.</P>
      <P>On average, workers aged 35-45 accounted for 31.38 percent of the staff of the
surveyed businesses, with 55.85 percent of businesses having no more than 30
percent of workers in that age group.</P>
      <P>While 48.17 percent of businesses are accepting middle-age workers, 7.31 percent
are shutting out this age group completely, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The reasons behind the reluctance to hire middle-age workers include less
flexibility among people in this group, the high personnel costs involved, the
disinclination among these workers to accept changes, their difficulty fitting

    <HEADLINE>EU urged to enhance trade with Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
10/06/08  15:34:37
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) called on the European Union
Monday to enhance trade with Taiwan, saying that this would boost not only the
EU's export and production, but also its competitiveness in Asia.</P>
      <P>The call came after Copenhagen Economics, a highly reputable international
consultancy hired in January by the ECCT, released at an EU-Taiwan economic
forum in Taipei a report that examines the economic merits of EU-Taiwan trade
enhancement measures (TEMs) in the context of the EU Trade Commissioner's
strategic objectives in the Asian region.</P>
      <P>The EU Trade Commissioner launched a "Global Europe" strategy in 2006 to
underline the importance of gaining market access to the growing Asian markets.
So far, agreements with the Republic of Korea, India and the Association for
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are on the agenda.</P>
      <P>In his opening address at the forum, ECCT Chairman Philippe Pellegrin said the
chamber has called on the governments of both Taiwan and the EU to begin talks
on TEMs -- similar to free trade agreements (FTAs) -- as they will serve to
increase bilateral trade between Taiwan and the EU annually by billions of
euros.</P>
      <P>Concurring with Pellegrin,  Chen Tain-jy,  chairman of the Executive YuanCouncil
of Economic Planning and Development, said that while the ultimate goal in
strengthening  EU-TW economic relations is the signing of an FTA, "the bilateral
trade of the two economies can be enhanced, in the short term, by alternatives
such as a mutual recognition arrangement (MRA) or trade and investment framework
agreement (TIFA)."</P>
      <P>Martin Thelle, a partner at Copenhagen Economics and the author of the report,
said in his presentation at the forum that TEMs can greatly benefit the EU and
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The EU should consider saying 'yes' if Taiwan expressed interest in initiating
discussions on ambitious TEMs, as the economic impacts of trade enhancement are
considerable," Thelle said.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that enhancing trade with Taiwan can boost European GDP by up to
2 billion euros per year, expanding the output of European producers and
creating more jobs in Europe, according to Thelle. Taiwan's GDP in turn will be
increased by an estimated 3.8 billion euros, he added.</P>
      <P>"In the longer term, openness to trade with economies like Taiwan and South
Korea will give an additional boost to the European economy," Thelle said,
adding that Copenhagen Economics assessed that the strategic opportunities for
European firms are larger in Taiwan than in Korea.</P>
      <P>"The main reason is Taiwan's close economic integration with mainland China," he
said. "Taiwan is a bridgehead to China."</P>
      <P>Although some may fear that China may react negatively to potential trade
enhancement measures between Taiwan and the EU, Thelle said, his analysis shows
that China's economy would be, in fact, slightly positively affected by any
trade enhancement between the EU and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Certainly China's exports to Europe will face more direct competition from
Taiwan's exporters, but the growth of the Taiwanese economy as a result of trade
enhancement measures with the EU will benefit China, and this latter effect will
dominate," he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, China will benefit significantly from the removal of the Taiwan-
imposed restrictions on trade and investment across the Taiwan Strait, according
to Thelle.</P>
      <P>The forum, held by the ECCT and sponsored by the HSBC, attracted government
officials, foreign diplomats and representatives in Taiwan as well as
businessmen and academic experts.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>If Taiwan opts for the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) , this
should be done independent of the Central Bank of the Republic  of China (CBC)
and under new legislation, CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan said Monday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Perng said the existing Four Major
Funds and the National Development Fund run by the administration are all SWFs
in nature since they are all state-owned investment funds.</P>
      <P>"The best policy here and now is to integrate the Four Major Funds and the
National Development Fund into a bigger one, instead of establishing a new SWF,"
Perng said.</P>
      <P>In response to ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lai Shyh-bao's question on whether
the CBC favors the way that Singapore established its SWF, Perng said, "the
Singaporean model is a good one to emulate."</P>
      <P>He added that before establishing its SWF, Singapore first enacted a relevant
statute.  The Singaporean  government  then established a SWF with funds raised
via the issuance of state bonds and in turn used the SWF to invest overseas, he
said.</P>
      <P>The CBC governor added that both the establishment of SWFs and overseas
investment of the funds should be in line with International Monetary Fund (IMF)
regulations.</P>
      <P>Perng dismissed as groundless a recent report by the Taipei-based China Times,
which alleged that, when asked his opinion on the subject, he categorically
ruled out using the country's foreign exchange reserves to establish a new SWF.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan completed Monday a preliminary review of a proposed
amendment to the Gender Equality in Employment Act that would raise the
punishment for employers who fail to take action to prevent or correct sexual
harassment in the workplace.</P>
      <P>The law requires employers hiring over 30 employees to establish measures for
sexual harassment prevention and rules on the handling of complaints about and
punishment for sexual harassment. Employers are required to openly display such
measures and rules in offices and take immediate and effective correctional and
remedial measures when they know of an incidence of sexual harassment.</P>
      <P>While the maximum fine for employers who fail to comply is currently set at
NT$100,000 (US$3,096) , the bill clearing the Legislative Yuan's Health,
Environment and Labor Committee would raise the ceiling to NT$500,000.</P>
      <P>According to ruling Kuomintang Legislator Pan Wei-kang, a lead sponsor of the
bill, sexual harassment in the workplace is a form of gender discrimination that
undermines the physical safety of women and "other sexual minorities."</P>
      <P>However, compared with the punishments for other forms of gender discrimination,
the penalties for sexual harassment are much lower, Pan said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA contracts with private enterprises aim to achieve 'zero waste'</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) has contracted private
businesses to recycle all kinds of kitchen waste, including some types not on
the current list of recyclables, the agency said in a statement Monday.</P>
      <P>The contracts are part of the EPA's efforts to achieve the long-existing goal of
"zero kitchen waste, " the statement said. To meet this goal, in 2001, a set of
step-by-step measures were formulated, beginning with the collection of kitchen
leftovers that can be recycled to feed pigs.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the first stage of the recycling program was adopted by all 319
townships around the country. Today, environmental protection units around
Taiwan collect approximately 2,000 tons of kitchen waste daily, according to the
EPA statement.</P>
      <P>That volume is equivalent to the treatment capacity of two 900-ton garbage
incinerators, the EPA department of environmental supervision affairs said.</P>
      <P>Currently, moist kitchen waste is recycled by being cooked or steamed at high
temperatures before being made into fertilizer or animal feed.</P>
      <P>According to the EPA department, around 75 percent of recycled waste goes into
making hog feed, 24 percent into fertilizers and one percent into dried feed for
chickens.</P>
      <P>However, there are still many types of organic kitchen leftovers not listed as
recyclable, the department said, These include the skins of pomelos, bananas,
pineapples and sugar canes, as well as mango seeds, coconut husks, clam shells,
lobster shells, meat bones, all kinds of nut shells, weeds, wilted flowers and
tree branches, it added.</P>
      <P>Currently  those types of waste are still being taken to incinerators, along
with other garbage.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level EPA said it has contracted a private company to recycle
organic materials. The company is capable of handling around 2,000 tons of
organic leftovers from around Taiwan, the press release said.</P>
      <P>This contract model will be further expanded to allow the EPA to reach its goal
of zero kitchen waste, while recycling the waste into useful resources, the EPA
stated.</P>
      <P>According to EPA research, household garbage in Taiwan includes between 20
percent and 30 percent of kitchen waste.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister  of  Transportation  and Communications Mao Chi-kuo said Monday that
Taiwan and China share a common view on adopting direct routes for the existing
nonstop cross-strait weekend charter flights.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Legislative Yuan, Mao said proposals on the adoption of the
shortest possible routes for direct cross-strait weekend  charter flights have
almost been drafted by the two intermediary bodies -- Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS).</P>
      <P>"Once the new rounds of SEF-ARATS talks take place and details on the matter are
worked out, agreements on the opening of direct weekend charter flights via
direct routes could be signed by the two sides," a confident Mao said.</P>
      <P>"Direct flights via direct routes would help reduce the flying time between
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Beijing to two hours and 30 minutes and
between Taoyuan and Shanghai to just 67 minutes," Mao said.</P>
      <P>In response to a question raised by ruling Kuomintang Legislator Chen Ken-teh,
Mao agreed that direct flights via direct routes would help save energy and
reduce carbon dioxide emissions from a global point of view, but added that the
issue involves crucial negotiations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Mao said he could not disclose the content of the new SEF proposal and that
there is no timetable for the signing of agreements by the SEF and ARATS on the
opening of such flights.</P>
      <P>He pointed out, however, that relevant agencies, including the Ministry of
National Defense, have already given the nod to the content of the proposal.</P>
      <P>Historic  direct cross-strait  weekend charter flights were launched in early
July after SEF and ARATS negotiators reached unprecedented agreements in talks
in Beijing in June.</P>
      <P>All the direct cross-strait weekend charter flights, however, have been flown so
far with a detour via the Hong Kong Flight Information Region to symbolize the
flights' passage via a "third location."</P>
      <P>In their planned new round of talks to be held in Taipei at the end of this
month, SEF and ARATS negotiators are expected to focus their discussions on the
opening of direct cross-strait cargo charter flights and shipping links, the
establishment of new passenger charter flight routes, joint oil exploration in
the Taiwan Strait and cross-strait crime-fighting.</P>
      <P>Of these topics, the establishment of new passenger charter flight  routes  will
in fact  address  the  opening  of the shortest-possible  cross-strait  routes,
said  Lee  Long-wen, director-general of the Civil Aeronautics Administration.</P>
      <P>Lee added  that in this  regard,  both sides  have tacit understanding that
direct flights via direct routes "could be done, but not to be spelled out"
prematurely.</P>

police, military police and police officers from Kaohsiung  city and county
monitored  the activities  of the counterfeiting  ring for four months before
raiding  its four operational bases in Kaohsiung and the adjacent counties of
Kaohsiung and Pingtung simultaneously.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, police officers seized fake Chinese currency
totaling 100 million yuan (US$14.61 million) and sheets of uncut paper currency
worth 45 million yuan, along with a wide range of equipment.</P>
      <P>The criminal ring used a house in a remote mountainous area of Kaohsiung
County's Daliao township as its printing factory. In addition to churning out
fake Chinese currency, it also counterfeited prepaid toll coupons for Taiwan's
freeways, as well as driving licenses.</P>
      <P>The task force also seized 3,500 books of fake prepaid freeway toll tickets,
each consisting of 100 coupons.</P>
      <P>The ringleader and his girlfriend were arrested on the spot. Also arrested were
four accomplices, identified as Tsai Chien-shun, Huang Guan-chieh, Hung Ying-
tzer and Wang Cheng-hua, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The six suspects will be charged with offenses relating to currency
counterfeiting,  as well as offenses relating to the counterfeiting of valuable
securities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOE: recognition of Chinese diplomas still under review</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Education Cheng Jei-cheng revealed guidelines Monday concerning
Chinese students studying for diplomas in Taiwan that say a national quota will
be imposed, as well as enrollment ceilings in universities and departments.</P>
      <P>As for the recognition of Chinese diplomas, Cheng said the ministry is still
making plans on the issue but noted that it might move up its timeframe.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that Taiwan will open its doors to Chinese
students pursuing advanced studies but will not allow them to take professional
license tests. Ma also said earlier this year that Taiwan will recognize Chinese
diplomas in the near future.</P>
      <P>The new policies raised concerns from some legislators, who argued at a
committee session that the moves are a precursor to allowing Chinese students to
take tests for local professional licenses, which may have a negative impact on
Taiwan's labor market.</P>
      <P>Kuan Bi-ling, a legislator of the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) , questioned how Cheng can forbid Chinese people from taking tests for
professional licenses, since the government is planning to recognize Chinese
diplomas and accept Chinese students.</P>
      <P>She noted that according to the Professional and Technical Examinations Act and
Taiwan's commitment made in 2001 when it joined the World Trade Organization,
foreigners are permitted to take tests for 64 professional licenses in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response, Cheng said that Chinese people should not be considered "simple
foreigners, " as Taiwan has a very special relationship with China and there are
specific regulations in the framework of the Act Governing Relations Between
People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>Another DPP legislator, Lin Shu-fen, accused the government of planning to
recognize Chinese diplomas, receive Chinese students and then allowing them to
take tests for professional licenses.</P>
      <P>@"Opening the door to Chinese students to an appropriate degree can promote
exchanges between young people of both sides and will be beneficial to Taiwan in
the long run," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>At present, the MOE is planning to prolong the maximum study period for Chinese
students in Taiwan from four months to one year.</P>

      <P>A former chief of the Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Justice, Yeh
Sheng-mao, was taken into custody Monday by the Taipei District Court.</P>
      <P>At the the third hearing in his trial for withholding information on alleged
money-laundering by ex-President Chen Shui-bian's family, Yeh was questioned by
a panel of three judges and was ordered detained after the day's court
proceedings.</P>
      <P>Chief judge Lee Ying-hao told Yeh that by passing the information to Chen Shui-
bian, he may have "unduly profited others, " a felony which gives the court the
power to detain potential offenders at its discretion.</P>
      <P>Citing concerns that Yeh could collude with others to offer false testimony, the
judge ordered Yeh's detention, to the surprise of the former Investigation
Bureau chief.</P>
      <P>Yeh was indicted on Aug. 28 for concealing and not investigated information on
overseas bank accounts held by Chen Shui-bian's family members in the Cayman
Islands in the Caribbean.</P>
      <P>The information was provided to the Investigation Bureau by international anti-
money laundering association Egmont Group on Jan. 28. but went missing after
being submitted to Yeh.</P>
      <P>Yeh admitted on Sept. 2 that he handed the information to Chen in February while
Chen was still serving as president.</P>
      <P>His confession led prosecutors to bring an extra charge of leaking classified
information against him last Friday, paving the way for his detention.</P>
      <P>At Monday's trial hearing, the court also heard testimony from two Investigation
Bureau officials that the Egmont Group had previously sent a report in Dec. 2006
to the bureau concerning an account held by Chen's daughter-in-law in Jersey in
the Channel Islands.</P>
      <P>Yeh acknowledged receiving the report and said he provided an outline of its
contents to the president, but decided not to investigate further because the
intelligence was not concrete enough and the account had been closed in Oct.
2005.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors hope to have The investigation into the alleged money laundering of
Chen and his family wrapped up by the end of this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Arms sales demonstration of U.S. commitment to Taiwan: AIT</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Following the Bush administration's green light to a US$6.4 billion arms sale to
Taiwan, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) expressed Monday Washington's
support of President Ma Ying-jeou's handling of relations across the Taiwan
Strait, as well as bilateral ties between the U.S. and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"This is a significant and tangible demonstration  of the commitment of the
United States, under the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), to provide to Taiwan the
defensive weapons that it needs," AIT spokesman Thomas Hodges said in response
to reporters' inquires on the Pentagon's recent notification to Congress that it
had approved the sales of various defensive weapons systems to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We appreciate the Ma administration's efforts to reduce tension in the Taiwan
Strait and to build on the already excellent ties between the people of Taiwan
and the U.S.," he added.</P>
      <P>Passed by the U.S. Congress in 1979 after the U.S. switched diplomatic
recognition from the Republic of China to the People's Republic of China, the
TRA guarantees U.S. defensive arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Defense Department notified Congress Oct. 3 of its approval of a
US$6.46 billion arms package, a decision quickly lauded by Ma, who said the
announcement "signals an end to the turmoil of the past eight years and the
beginning of a new era of safety and peace, as well as of mutual trust between
Taiwan and the U.S."</P>
      <P>The arms deal includes Apache attack helicopters, Patriot PAC-3 missile
batteries,  Javelin anti-tank missiles and sea-launched Harpoon missiles, as
well as an upgrade of the E-2T aircraft to the Hawkeye 2000 configuration and
blank order requisitions for spare parts in support of F-5E/F, C-130H, F-16A/B
and Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF) aircraft, along with related support
equipment.</P>
      <P>However,  the  approved  package  does  not  include  the diesel-electric
submarines and Black Hawk helicopters that Taiwan is seeking.</P>
      <P>In response  to the decision,  the  opposition  Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said that rather than hailing the approval of the package as a sign of
improved U.S.-Taiwan ties,  the Ma administration should be wary of the fact
that the package is smaller than expected and be vigilant against the
possibility that it is a sign of change in relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>DPP caucus whip Lai Ching-te said the U.S. administration's delay of approval of
the arms sale package for so long and only notifying Congress of its decision to
give the green light after the regular legislative session had already ended
should be viewed as warning signs.</P>
      <P>The opposition lawmaker called on Ma's administration not to interpret the
approved arms sales package as "a new beginning" but instead as "a new variable"
in U.S.-Taiwan ties.</P>
      <P>The fact  that Hodges'  comments  --  besides  reiterating Washington's
commitment under the TRA -- explicitly recognize Ma's efforts in boosting
relations with Beijing and Washington, makes it evident that the DPP accusations
are unfounded, according to a senior official of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No vegetables marketed in Taiwan detected with melamine traces</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>No vegetables marketed in Taiwan have been detected to bear traces of melamine
contamination, according to the results of recent tests on 112 vegetable
samples, Agriculture and Food Agency officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The tests were launched after news reports from China last week said that
melamine residue had allegedly been found on some lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms
and potatoes grown in China.</P>
      <P>The reports  said the residue  might  have come from the agricultural pesticide
cyromazine, which releases melamine as the pesticide naturally dissolves in the
soil.</P>
      <P>The agency under the Council of Agriculture said in a statement that the test
samples ranged from leafy vegetables and cabbages to root vegetables.</P>
      <P>In some of the samples, a safe level of cyromazine traces were detected but no
traces of melamine, an industrial chemical used to make plastics and
fertilizers, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The toxic chemical, used by unscrupulous Chinese milk producers to adulterate
their baby formula in order to give falsely high protein levels, was blamed last
month for the deaths of four infants and the sickening of another 530,000
children in China who were fed with melamine-adulterated infant formula.</P>
      <P>The crisis spread to Taiwan and many other countries around the world that
import raw materials from China.</P>
      <P>It is legal to use cyromazine as a pesticide on vegetables in Taiwan, a local
media report said Sunday, citing Fei Wen-chi, deputy director of the Taiwan
Agricultural Chemicals and Toxic Substances Research Institute under the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Fei said the institute has been taking strict measures to monitor and control
the use of the pesticide on local farmland and that based on the institute's
regular tests, the level of cyromazine residue has been controlled below between
0.01 ppm (parts per million) and 0.3 ppm -- much lower than the international
allowable standard.</P>
      <P>The expert urged the public not to worry about the possible natural release of
melamine from the pesticide on vegetables, saying such a release is mostly in
tiny amounts that can simply washed off by rinsing the vegetables with water.</P>
      <P>If consumed, the human body also discharges the chemical through metabolism, she
added.</P>
      <P>However, she warned that farmers in China might have abused the use of the
substance, resulting in unsafe levels of toxic residue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Yunlin County Bureau of Health said Monday that coffee products
from the county's Gukeng township -- Taiwan's main coffee-producing area -- were
found after testing to be free from melamine.</P>
      <P>A total of 45 samples were examined, none of which were found to be
contaminated, according to the bureau's report.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2008 Taiwan Business Alliance Conference opened at the Taipei International
Convention Center Monday with more than 1,400 industry leaders and business
executives from 33 countries participating.</P>
      <P>Addressing the conference, President Ma Ying-jeou said now was the best time for
local and foreign businesses to invest in Taiwan, as the government is committed
to fostering a harmonious domestic society and peaceful exchanges across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He noted that the theme of this year's conference is "new Taiwan, new
opportunities" and explained that although Taiwan remains Taiwan, it has a new
government.</P>
      <P>Since its inauguration May 20, the government has been striving to "steer a new
course" for Taiwan's future, the president said.</P>
      <P>He said his government has restarted stalled consultations with China and has
also eased restrictions on businesses investing in China, raising the investment
cap from 40 percent of a company's net worth to 60 percent.</P>
      <P>Also, companies that set up their headquarters in Taiwan or subsidiaries of
multinational enterprises will not be subject to such restrictions.</P>
      <P>The measurers are aimed at creating a better overall investment environment as
Taiwan opens up to the rest of the world, he said.</P>
      <P>He touted Taiwan's advantage of having a high quality work force, with one
quarter of its population receiving college or university educations or above.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also enjoys a superb geographic location, as well as close ties with
major economies such as the United States, Japan and China.</P>
      <P>He said the government has launched a "12 i-Taiwan major infrastructure project"
program, with the "i" standing for the Chinese word for "love, " as well as
connoting investment in Taiwan, its renowned IT industry, intelligent and
international. He added that investors are welcome to invest in these projects.</P>
      <P>The president said the government is capable of making Taiwan a global
innovation center and of developing a sound, high quality economy.</P>
      <P>He later presented the Best Investment Partner Awards to nine foreign companies
for their contributions to the local economy.</P>
      <P>The nine recipients were Asahi Glass Co., American International Group, Citi
Taiwan, Corning Display Technologies Taiwan, Dai Nippon Printing Co., Elpida
Memory, Kingston Technology Company, Nissan Motor Co. and Texas Instruments.</P>
      <P>In the first forum on Global Investment Perspectives &amp; Taiwan's Emerging
Opportunities, Vice President Vincent Siew said Taiwan has weathered many
economic difficulties and Asian financial crises and is determined to turn
challenges into opportunities and turn the island an "unsinkable ship."</P>
      <P>He also highlighted the warmer cross-strait  relations and measures to upgrade
the nation's competitive edge, including a series of deregulation steps, tax
reforms, the 12 major infrastructure projects and the recruitment of talent from
abroad to revitalize the economy.</P>
      <P>Richard McCormack, vice chairman of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., gave his views on
the global financial crisis, noting that after the 1997 Asian financial crisis,
interest rates were kept too low for too long, turning "a good idea into a bad
one."</P>
      <P>The same thing happened with the current U.S. housing crisis, and the bubble
burst again because of extremely low interest rates, he said.</P>
      <P>McCormack said there should be enhanced supervision of banks, as well as
measures to keep the financial market stable by making it more transparent.</P>
      <P>He also urged the public to remain optimistic, quoting Warren Buffet's words,
"Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful."</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Yiin Chii-ming noted that since 2003 when the first Taiwan
Business Alliance Conference was held, it has become an excellent  platform for
decision makers,  industry leaders and venture capital/fund managers to explore
Taiwan's investment potential and opportunities.</P>
      <P>Now in its sixth year, Yiin said, the conference has more to offer the
participants than ever as Taiwan opens its doors to new links and new
connections across the Taiwan Strait, adding that the number of this year's
participants is greater than in previous years.</P>
      <P>This year's conference also has Chinese business leaders taking part for the
first time. With the government easing restrictions on trade relations with
China, the integration of cross-strait resources and resulting potential trade
opportunities have been included in the panel discussions.</P>

      <P>China will provide opportunities for many countries around the world as it
continues to grow, but Taiwan, which stands to gain substantially from the
mainland's economic expansion, must determine how to leverage its advantages, a
panel of experts said Monday.</P>
      <P>Eizo Kobayshi,  president and CEO of Japanese firm ITOCHU Corporation, said
speculation of a slowdown in China's economy following the end of the 2008
Beijing Olympics will be proven wrong, as the Beijing economy comprises only
around 4 percent of China's total GDP.</P>
      <P>He and others were speaking at a panel discussion titled "Leveraging Cross-
Strait Resources for Global Marketsat the 2008 Taiwan Business Alliance
Conference, which runs from Oct. 6-8.</P>
      <P>In the current global financial and credit crisis, China has offered a
sanctuary, as the mainland has emerged to become a large market that's
comparable to the European Union and United States markets, with a substantial
contribution to global GDP, said Jeffrey Wong, managing partner at McKinsey
&amp; Company.</P>
      <P>If the Chinese economy continues to grow, it will become a counteracting force
in the global economy, said Wong, a Singapore native.We believe as long as the
Chinese economy continues to grow, then this will be good news to support the
growth of the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Taiwan stands to gain significantly from Chinas growth, with its proximity to
mainland China and its similar language as well as long history, deep
involvement and wealth of experience investing in the mainland.</P>
      <P>In the next 20 years, there will be 20 megacities developing in China, with
annual per capital income in each mega city to eventually reach an estimated
US$25,000, Wong said.</P>
      <P>In developing itself, however, China will face a shortage of talent, an
inadequate health care system and challenges on its environment.</P>
      <P>These and more are areas where Taiwan can use its expertise to reap rewards from
China's growthVnamely by providing value-added services, Wong and others said.</P>
      <P>For example, with more direct flights, Taiwan can serve as a niche market in
providing medical services to people in China, experts said.</P>
      <P>With all this information, wisdom, expertise and insight, I think Taiwan should
continue to contribute to the mainland Chinese economy and it will also help our
economy, said Theodore Huang, chairman of the Taiwan-based TECO Group.</P>
      <P>But the challenge  for Taiwan  is deciding  what kind of relationship it wants
with China, experts said.</P>
      <P>Theoretically, it should be easier for us than other countries, but we need to
have goals, strategies to come up with (relevant) government measures, said the
panel's moderator P.K. Chiang, chairman  of Taiwan's  Straits Exchange
Foundation,  which is responsible for negotiations with China in the absence of
government to government relations.</P>
      <P>As China becomes more integrated with the global economy and as its system
becomes more transparent, however, problems in China will become much more
obvious, such as the recent food crisis over poisoned milk powder, according to
experts.</P>
      <P>This has done a big blow to China's manufacturing interests, said Kobayashi,
citing global consumerswariness about Chinese products as a result of the
scandal.</P>
      <P>Huang said:Looking forward, we believe China, in the process of opening up, will
see more and more such issues.</P>
      <P>Again, Taiwan can benefit by being of service to China in these areas, as it has
also learned from similar problems in the past, according to experts.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China can complement each other very well, Chiang said.</P>

      <P>Two Kaohsiung City councilors expressed concern Monday over the worsening crime
situation in the southern port city and urged police to step up their efforts to
curb the trend.</P>
      <P>At an interpellation session of the city council, Lien Li-chien, a councilor of
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , quoted statistics compiled
by the city government's Department of Budget, Accounting and Statistics as
showing that Kaohsiung recorded a crime rate of 239 cases per 100,000 people in
August -- the highest since March 2006.</P>
      <P>The crime rate for August exceeded July's 207 cases per 100,000 people, as well
as the 211 cases for August last year.</P>
      <P>In terms of the city's offender rate, 143 out of every 100,000 people committed
criminal offenses during August, up 22 percent from July and 16 percent from
August last year.</P>
      <P>Citing examples to describe the city's worsening public order, Lien said the
neighborhood around the rapid transit system's Aozihdi Station in Gushan
District alone saw seven criminal cases in the past month, including gold
necklaces being snatched from around women's necks and car break-ins.</P>
      <P>Another DPP city councilor, Lin Ying-jung, said she had been robbed in the city.</P>
      <P>"My car was broken into and my belongings were stolen, but to date the case
still remains unresolved," Lin said. "I believe the city's real crime rate could
be even higher, because some of the criminal cases were not officially
recorded."</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Police Bureau Director-General Tsai Chun-chang said his men had worked
hard during the summer to fight all sorts of crimes, including drunken driving,
drug pushing and substance abuse.</P>
      <P>Tsai admitted that some police officers might have tried to keep the crime
statistics down by not recording reported cases properly. He assured the city
councilors that any police officers caught doing this will be severely punished.</P>

      <P>Chiefs of seven local governments in southern Taiwan said Monday they oppose the
central government's decision to use Hanyu Pinyin, the world's most common
Mandarin romanization system, on all public signs around the country.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu, Tainan City Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair, Kaohsiung

system used should not be chosen for political purposes or have political
overtones, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The statement also said that the new measure will not only cause confusion over
English on signs around the country, but also come at a high price tag.</P>
      <P>A preliminary assessment of the total cost for the seven cities and counties to
convert their public signs to Hanyu Pinyin found the bill would total NT$500
million (US$15.44 million) , the statement said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government adopted the Tongyong Pinyin system under the previous
Democratic Progressive Party government. It was developed by a Taiwanese and is
only employed in the country.</P>
      <P>The DPP administration was criticized for selecting the Tongyong Pinyin
romanization system for political and ideological reasons and of ignoring the
commonly used Hanyu Pinyin system mainly because it originated and his used in
China.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan under the new Ma Ying-Jeou administration recently decided,
however, to change the standard to Hanyu Pinyin to bring Taiwan in line with
international standards.</P>
      <P>The system was developed in China in the late 1950s and was later adopted as the
international romanization standard in the late 1970s and early 1980s, leading
to its widespread use around the world.</P>
      <P>The government's new policy was quickly challenged by the DPP-run Kaohsiung City
government, which said it had only recently changed most of town's signage to
Tongyong Pinyin and did not want to spend the estimated NT$213 million to
convert city signs again, this time to Hanyu Pinyin.</P>
      <P>The city administration said it had spent a lot of money over the past two years
in making romanization on signs more consistent as part of its efforts to build
an international English language environment.</P>
      <P>It further argued that the central government's policy will cause confusion
among romanization systems around the country at a time when the 2009 World
Games, to take place in Kaohsiung next July, are quickly approaching.</P>
      <P>Around 5,000 foreign athletes and relevant personnel will come to Taiwan for the
games and could face possible chaos caused by the co-existence  of the two
different romanization systems,  city officials said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, they said, representatives from the seven cities and counties will
attend a planned meeting hosted by the Ministry of Education to voice their
opposition to the new policy.</P>

      <P>The consumer price index (CPI) rose 3.09 percent year-on-year in September, the
lowest annualized rise in the the past eight months, the Directorate-General of
Budget, Accounting, and Statistics (DGBAS) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>September's CPI also fell 0.6 percent from the level in August, thanks to lower
prices for fuel cost and food, which decreased by 8.16 percent and 0.57 percent
compared to a month earlier, according to DGBAS section chief Wu Chao-ming.</P>
      <P>The core CPI, which excludes the prices of energy, fresh vegetables, fruit, and
seafood, also fell by 0.13 percent compared to August, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The wholesale price index (WPI) for September rose 6.64 percent year-on-year,
the lowest annualized growth rate since June, Wu said, adding that the index
actually fell 1.42 percent compared to August, another indication that price
inflation was easing, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's monthly CPI, which registered 106.39 in September, hit its peak in July
at 106.88, the highest since in October 1994, Wu said. Global inflation also hit
its peak in July according to economic forecaster Global Insight.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait have formally established a direct
communications mechanism for food safety-related issues, the quasi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Monday in a statement.</P>
      <P>Under the mechanism, two major commodity inspection and food safety control
agencies on each side have been designated as channels for direct communication
and real-time reporting whenever any major food poisoning case is reported, the
SEF statement said.</P>
      <P>From now on, the statement said, the Bureau of Food Safety under Taiwan's
Department of Health will contact the Health Supervision Bureau under China's
Ministry of Health in the event of food safety issues of public concern, and
vice versa.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the statement went on, commodity inspection agencies on the two sides
-- the Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection under Taiwan's Ministry of
Economic Affairs and the Import and Export Food Safety Bureau under China's
General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine -- will
also forge a similar direct dialogue and communications channel for food safety-
related information exchanges, mutual assistance and emergency response.</P>
      <P>The  two sides  reached  a preliminary  consensus  on the establishment of a
direct cross-strait communications mechanism to deal with emergency food
poisoning cases during a working-level meeting in Beijing in late September.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the SEF informed its Chinese counterpart -- the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) -- of the Taiwan government's
decision to pick its food safety and commodity inspection agencies as its
designated liaisons with relevant Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>The SEF said it received a response from the ARATS shortly afterward, saying
that the Chinese government also chose its health supervision and commodity
inspection agencies to serve as liaison agencies with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>By now, the SEF statement said, all the formalities have been completed for the
installation of a direct communications mechanism for food safety concerns.</P>
      <P>The need to craft direct cross-strait dialogue channels to deal with food safety
issues arose after the recent melamine scare.</P>
      <P>Melamine, a nitrogen-rich chemical used to make plastics and fertilizers, has
been widely used in China to spike watered-down milk to mask the resulting
protein deficiency and fool quality tests.</P>
      <P>Melamine contamination of baby formula has been blamed for the deaths of at
least four infants and kidney illnesses in more than 53,000 children in China.</P>
      <P>A shipment of 25 tons of milk powder imported into Taiwan from China earlier
this year has also caused a stir in the local food market and led to the
resignation of Lin Fang-yue as DOH minister late last month.</P>
      <P>Through the arrangements of the SEF and the ARATS -- the two quasi-official
intermediary bodies authorized to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence
of official ties -- a Taiwan delegation of health officials and experts visited
Beijing Sept.27-29 to discuss the establishment of a direct communciations

      <P>More than 20 percent of local college students responding to a recent opinion
survey said they experienced various levels of depression, but most of them
tended to deal with the phenomena on their own, pollsters said Monday.</P>
      <P>The John Tung Foundation, a private organnization dedicated to public health
promotion, conducted a survey between May and June to explore the mental and
emotional health of students at local universities and colleges.</P>
      <P>The foundation distributed 6,840 questionnaires and collected 5,655 valid
samples.</P>
      <P>Survey results showed that 22 percent  of the respondents described  themselves
as suffering from different  degrees of depression, but more than 80 percent of
this group of students tended to resolve their emotional problems on their own,
declining to seek counseling to help relieve their emotional pressure.</P>
      <P>The foundation  created a measurement  scale to gauge the respondents' emotional
health, assessing the students' sources of pressure and how they coped with it.</P>
      <P>According to the survey's findings, the top five sources of pressure for local
college students were outlook on life, personal economic   well-being,
academic   workload/exam   scores, appearance/fitness, and family economic
situation or debt problems, in that order.</P>
      <P>The five most common ways cited by respondents to relieve their emotional
pressure were taking a rest or sleep, seeking advice online, talking with other
people, going to movie or watching TV.</P>
      <P>For those who confessed to suffering from depression, few cited "talking with

    <TEXT>Today is Tuesday, Oct. 7, or the ninth day of the ninth month of the Year of the
Rat according to the lunar calendar. Following is a list of important events
that have occurred on this date in the past:

1900: Heinrich Himmler, head of the Gestapo, and from 1929, Adolf Hitler's
second-in-command, is born.

1913: Henry Ford, the leading manufacturer of U.S. automobiles in early 1900's,
creates the world's first assembly line to build the model T cars.

1919: KLM, the national airline of the Netherlands and the world's first
airline, is established, and flights are scheduled to begin in 1920.

1949: East Germany, or the German Democratic Republic, is proclaimed, with
Wilhelm Pieck as president and Otto Grotewohl as prime minister.

1950: Communist Chinese troops enter Tibet.

1958: Communist Chinese begin to launch a mass movement in Tientsin to make iron
and steel, in which about 100 million people would eventually participate. The
movement, which proved to be a waste of both human and material resources,
resulted in the loss of 100 billion yuan in industrial production.

1959: Mario Lanza, U.S. tenor and film actor, dies at the age of 38. His films
included "The Great Caruso."

1961: Two Communist Chinese pilots, Shao Hsi-yen and Kao Yu-tsung, arrive in
Taipei from Seoul.

1974: A 90-member Japanese calligraphic mission led by Akira Koyama arrive in
Taipei for a six-day visit.

1976: U.S. President Gerald Ford, already under fire for pardoning the disgraced
Richard Nixon, tells the public on prime-time television that "there is no
Soviet domination of eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford
administration."

1982: Jimmy Wei, the national policy advisor to President Chiang Ching-kuo and
former president of the Central News Agency, dies of a heart attack at the age
of 77.

1986: President Chiang Ching-kuo tells Katherine Graham, head of the board of
the Washington Post and Newsweek, in an interview that the Republic of China
government will soon propose lifting martial law to actively promote democracy,
but adds that new political parties should abide by the ROC Constitution and
anti-Communist policy. He also emphasizes the ROC will never negotiate with the
Communist Chinese.

1990: The National Unification Council is established under the Office of the
President to help plan the policy framework for national unification and to
integrate various opinions on the issue at all levels of the society.

1998: Thousands of Russians take to the streets to protest against unpaid wages
and to call on President Boris Yeltsin to resign.

2000: Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan confirms that the Ministry of Justice's
Investigation Bureau will formally phase out its controversial "political
surveillance" work soon.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "It is only the man with the most perfect divine
moral nature who is able to combine in himself quickness of magnanimity,
generosity, benignity, and gentleness: qualities necessary for the exercise of
patience."</TEXT>

electric  submarines and Black Hawk helicopters from the United States.</P>
      <P>"Our internal foreign military sales process is continuing. We have turned down
nothing," the official told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>The Bush administration notified Congress Oct. 3 that it had approved sales to
Taiwan of 330 Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) missiles, 32 sub-launched
Harpoon Block II missiles, 30 AH-64D Block III Apache Longbow attack
helicopters, 182 Javelin guided anti-tank missile rounds and 20 Javelin command
launch units, and system upgrades for four E-2T aircraft.</P>
      <P>However,  two other items under review --  diesel-electric submarines and Black
Hawk helicopters -- were not included on the list.</P>
      <P>Asked why the notifications were only sent to Congress on the final  day of the
congressional  session  before  a scheduled adjournment, the official said
Washington's decisions on foreign military sales to Taiwan "are not controlled
by a timetable."</P>
      <P>"We only recently finished our internal consultations and arrived at this
decision on those items," he said.</P>
      <P>Washington makes decision regarding weapons sales to Taiwan based on the defense
needs of Taiwan and the TRA under which the United States makes available items
for Taiwan's self-defense, the official added.</P>
      <P>On the Bush administration's position toward Taiwan's request for F-16C/D
fighters, the official said "we do not comment on potential weapons systems in
the foreign military sales program."</P>

      <P>As many as 81 percent of Taiwanese support Democratic Party candidate Barack
Obama as the next U.S. president, according to results of an international
survey released Tuesday by Reader's Digest.</P>
      <P>Republican Party candidate John McCain, on the other hand, obtained only 6
percent of support among Taiwanese, the results showed.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between June and July among 17,000 people from 17
countries, including the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany,
Finland, Australia, South Africa, Brazil, Poland, Russia, India and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The results revealed that Obama won overwhelming support in all countries except
for the United States, where Obama and McCain are in a neck-and-neck race, with
36 percent and 38 percent support levels, respectively.</P>
      <P>The support ratings of the two candidates saw the largest margin in the
Netherlands, where Obama is 84 percentage points ahead of McCain.</P>
      <P>The narrowest differences outside the United States were recorded in India and
Russia, where Obama leads McCain by 35 percentage points.</P>
      <P>The support rating of 81 percent for Obama in Taiwan is the third highest among
the 17 countries surveyed.</P>
      <P>Joanne Chang, a research fellow at Academia Sinica's Institute of European  and
American  Studies  and Taiwan's  former  deputy representative to the United
States, said the widespread support for Obama overseas is likely related to his
personal charisma and the attention that he pays to human rights and
environmental issues.</P>
      <P>Whoever is elected the next U.S. president, the government of Taiwan is expected
to maintain friendly relations with both parties, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Tuan Y. Cheng,  director of National Chengchi University's Institute of
International Relations, said U.S. interests will be the top concern of whoever
becomes U.S. president, noting that both candidates are paying little attention

      <P>Only one head of state from among Taiwan's 23 allies and half as many foreign
guests as last year will attend Double Ten National Day celebrations Oct. 10,
numbers the Ministry of Foreign Affairs attributed to the short time span
between President Ma Ying-jeou's May 20 inauguration and Taiwan's national day.</P>
      <P>Matthew Lee, chief of MOFAs Department of Protocol, said at a regular press
briefing that a total number of 171 foreign guests from diplomatic allies and
other countries will attend Taiwans Oct. 10 Double Ten National Day
celebrations, compared to 368 people last year.</P>
      <P>Guatemala President Alvaro Colom, who is slated to arrive later today, will be
the only head of state from Taiwans allies to attend the countrys birthday
celebrations, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>Colom will receive a military salute Oct. 8 at National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial
Hall's Liberty Square.</P>
      <P>Explaining the reduced number of foreign dignitaries attending National Day
activities, Lee noted that 584 foreign guests attended Ma's May 20 inauguration.</P>
      <P>"If we combine the number of foreign guests attending National Day celebrations
and the inauguration, it is much more than the total number last year,Lee said.</P>
      <P>The MOFA official said five of Taiwan's diplomatic allies will send a total of
31 delegates to Taiwans National Day celebrations, including Colom and
parliamentary speakers from Kiribati, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Gambia, as well
as Honduras Vice Foreign Minister Eduardo Federico Rosales Ramirez.</P>
      <P>Also, 140 guests from the U.S., Japan, Canada, South Africa, Kuwait and
Palestine will attend Double Ten celebrations, according to Lee, of which, a
116-people Japanese group will make up the biggest delegation, led by Takao
Fujii, executive director of the pro-Taiwan Japan-ROC Dietmen's Council.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the briefing, Harry Tseng, director-general of MOFA's Department of
North American Affairs, said that 11 people from the U.S. National Association

      <P>Given that the U.S. presidential election is approaching, there are no

    <HEADLINE>Government urged to act to dissuade teenagers from using cell phones</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A civic group urged the government Tuesday to take action to dissuade children
and teenagers from using mobile phones, out of concern over possible
electromagnetic radiation hazards.</P>
      <P>To back its appeal, the Taiwan Electromagnetic Radiation Hazard Protection and
Control Association (TEPCA) presented results of a survey on Taiwanese children
and teenagers' use of cellular phones and tests on the levels of electromagnetic
radiation among mobile phones marketed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted between August and October among children and teenagers
aged between 6 and 18 around Taiwan, showed that 34.4 percent of polled
elementary school students, 67 percent of surveyed junior high school students,
and 89.6 percent of surveyed senior high school students are cell phone users.</P>
      <P>Based on the survey, the association estimated that around 2.2 million Taiwanese
children and teenagers in the 6-18 age group possess mobile phones.</P>
      <P>It also concluded that the older the young people are, the longer they talk on
the phone, and that 390,000 of them speak on the phone for an average of at
least five minutes per call and 170,000 people talk for over 10 minutes per
call.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, tests on the electromagnetic radiation levels of 33 types of mobile
phones currently marketed in the country showed that more than 60 percent of the
handsets  release electromagnetic radiation 1 million times higher than the
background level.</P>
      <P>The association said that although cell phones have become a necessary device in
modern life, industrial countries, including Britain, Germany, France, Belgium,
Italy and Russia, have all advised children, teenagers and pregnant women, to
refrain from using cell phones out of health concerns.</P>
      <P>The TEPCA is a nonprofit organization committed to bringing together  the
victims  of electromagnetic  radiation  hazards, self-relief organizations,
nongovernmental organizations, individuals and groups aware of the risk to
promote electromagnetic radiation hazard protection and related legislation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) assured the public Tuesday that the
government's plan to open straighter air routes across the Taiwan Strait will
not undermine Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>According to military spokeswoman  Lisa Chi,  the MND has contributed its
professional assessment to the plan and suggested that the air routes should not
involve any direct flights across the imaginary median line in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Based on this principle, the MND has proposed several possible routes that would
not put national security at risk, Chi said.</P>
      <P>Also, the MND has worked out the necessary measures to deal with the possible
impact of the new air routes on the military's air training programs, she said.</P>
      <P>While there are no regular passenger flights between Taiwan and China, the
cross-strait weekend and holiday charter flights currently in service are
required to make a detour through Hong Kong's or Macau's air space, adding hours
to flights between Taiwan and central and northern China.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Minister of Transportation and Communications Mao Chi-kuo said that
Taiwan and China have reached a high level of consensus on adopting more direct
routes for the flights.</P>
      <P>An formal agreement on the issue is likely to be signed during the upcoming
talks between Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation and its Chinese
counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, slated for
later this month in Taipei, Mao said.</P>
      <P>The new routes, which will dispense with the detours through a third area, are
expected to shorten the flying time between Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
and Shanghai from 150 minutes to 67 minutes.</P>
      <P>A more direct Taoyuan-Beijing flight would take two and a half hours, 75 minutes
less than the current time, and a Taoyuan-Xiamen flight would take one hour, 30
minutes less than it does now.</P>

    <HEADLINE>International seminar on melamine to be postponed: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
10/07/08  17:04:44
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said Tuesday that an
international seminar on melamine's toxicity and Taiwan's safety standards
related to the chemical will be postponed to Oct. 17.</P>
      <P>In principle, the DOH has no plan to change the current safety standard, Yeh
said, when asked if the DOH would readjust its strict standard on the level of
melamine allowed in dairy products, after a press conference aiming at
encouraging people to eat breakfast and do exercise.</P>
      <P>He indicated, however, that the current standard may lead to technological and
commercial issues and suggested it might be necessary to move in step with
international guidelines if the problems became serious.</P>
      <P>At present, all food products in Taiwan must test negative for melamine   when
tested  with  highly  sensitive   liquid chromatography/tandem mass (LC/MS/MS)
spectrometers, which can detect the presence of as little as 0.05 ppm (parts per
million) of melamine.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the seminar, to be attended by experts from the World Health
Organization, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European
Union, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, is to verify if Taiwan's safety
standard, which might be the strictest in the world, is appropriate, he said.</P>
      <P>The European Union recently stipulated that food containing at least 15 percent
or an unknown percentage of dairy products must not contain more than 2.5 ppm of
melamine.</P>
      <P>In New Zealand, the safety standard for melamine for most food products is 5
ppm, and 1 ppm for baby formula.</P>
      <P>As to the United States, the Food and Drug Administration issued a guideline
noting that eating 2.5 ppm of melamine would not raise health concerns, even if
a person ate melamine-tainted food every day.</P>
      <P>But it refused to set any permissable level of melamine in infant formula,
saying "there is too much uncertainty to set a level in infant formula and rule
out any public health concern."</P>
      <P>In addition to discussing safety standards for melamine, Taiwan needs to collect
more information at the seminar about the toxicity of the chemical, including
the ways in which it pollutes food and harms human health, Yeh noted.</P>
      <P>He said currently Taiwan only has data on melamine exposure from animal
experiments.</P>
      <P>As for the preparation of the international seminar, which was originally
scheduled to be held on Oct. 12, DOH spokesman Wang Je-chau said the DOH is
still contacting experts.</P>
      <P>The safety standard for the toxic chemical melamine has caused confusion for
both consumers and the food industry in Taiwan over past few weeks.</P>
      <P>The then-DOH minister Lin Fang-yue announced in late September that food
products containing up to 2.5 ppm (parts per million) would be qualified for
sale and were safe to eat, taking into consideration different sensitivities of
test instruments and the possibility that melamine accidentally came into
contact with food.</P>
      <P>But Lin's decision, although later validated by European and U.S. guidelines on
melamine standards, ignited an uproar among consumers and opposition
politicians, who believed that the agency had loosenedthe safety standard,
putting their health at risk.</P>
      <P>Lin later resigned over the decision.</P>
      <P>After taking office, Yeh announced that all products testing positive for
melamine would not be permitted for sale in order to ease consumersworries.</P>
      <P>He also said that food products should be examined with the most sensitive
instrument in Taiwan, the LC/MS/MS spectrometer, which can detect as little as
0.05 ppm of melamine.</P>
      <P>Melamine, normally used in industrial applications, was added to diluted milk to
mask lower protein levels.</P>
      <P>Adulterated infant formula has led to widespread kidney disease among children
in China, with four dying and 53,000 others left ill.</P>
      <P>Many countries have recalled or banned imported Chinese food products containing
dairy ingredients and vegetable-based proteins.</P>

      <P>The government will guarantee larger bank deposits than previously to ease fears
that the financial crisis sweeping U.S. and European banks will not overwhelm
local financial institutions.</P>
      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) announced Monday night that the
government would guarantee bank deposits of up to NT$3 million per depositor per
bank, up from the existing NT$1.5 million cap.</P>
      <P>Local financial authorities took the move after observing a shift in recent
weeks of ten of billions of Taiwan dollars in deposited funds from smaller
private banks to accounts in government-controlled institutions, such as Bank of
Taiwan and the post office.</P>
      <P>The new policy will only cover savings accounts, time deposits, checking
accounts and personal retirement pension accounts, while foreign currency
accounts and structured notes will not be included, the FSC said.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, speaking at a legislative interpellation session
Tuesday morning, urged citizens not to be too pessimistic about the current
financial climate, noting that confidence is important and that the government
"will protect the people's assets by guaranteeing all deposits at domestic

      <P>Liu further said that the government will strictly supervise domestic  banks to
make sure that they meet capital adequacy requirements.</P>
      <P>The premier added that he has already instructed the FSC, the central bank, and

      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yeh-hsiang said Tuesday that the
production value of Taiwan's photovoltaic industry is expected to break the
NT$100 billion mark for this year and reach NT$400 billion by 2015.</P>
      <P>Speaking  at the opening of the 2008 Taiwan International Photovoltaic Forum and
Exhibition being held at the Taiwan World Trade Center Exhibition Hall 1,  Shih
said that the domestic photovoltaic industry has been growing at a rapid pace of
over 35 percent per year since 1998.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the domestic photovoltaic industry's production value could
quadruple by 2015, Shih said that Taiwan will likely become an important global
base for photovoltaic production by that time.</P>
      <P>Currently in the photovoltaic industry, Taiwan is most competitive in the area
of solar cell production, enjoying a 7 percent share of the global market in
2006 and a 12.7 percent share last year, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>Shih said the government has been actively assisting in the development of
Taiwan's photovoltaic industry through tax incentives, loans, assistance in the
establishment of facilities, and other measures. He added that a renewable
energy development bill, which has already been sent to the Legislative Yuan,
will also help in this respect.</P>
      <P>Shih said that based on Taiwan's successful experience in developing its
semiconductor and flat panel display industries, he is confident  that  the
country  will  also become  an important international player in the emerging
photovoltaic industry in the years to come.</P>

      <P>Television is the most popular source of news and the medium to which most
people in Taiwan are exposed, followed by newspapers and the Internet, according
to a survey released Monday by Shih Hsin University.</P>
      <P>TV ranked as the most heavily used type of media for the fifth consecutive year
in the university's fifth survey on media use patterns and media exposure, said
Hsiung Jie, director of the College of Journalism and Communications at the
university, which conducted the survey.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted in 22 cities and counties around the country to produce
indicative rankings of newspapers, magazines, radio broadcasting, TV stations
and Internet services, indicates people's heavily reliance on television, Hsiung
said.</P>
      <P>The survey found that Formosa TV, TVBS, HBO and SET-TV had the highest
viewership, while Da Ai (Great Love) TV had "the greatest influence on
individuals, " "the greatest influence in the society, " and "the best quality".</P>
      <P>TVBS and Unique Business News cable channels ranked as having the best news
coverage, while the Discovery and Travel &amp; Living channels were picked as
the top providers of educational, cultural, leisure and entertainment content,
the survey revealed.</P>
      <P>Although the impartiality of TV news reporting in Taiwan is often questioned,
the respondents in the survey gave TV news coverage the highest credibility
rating among all the media, Hsiung said.</P>
      <P>The survey found that the Apple Daily was the most frequently read newspaper,
favored by 44.2 of the respondents, followed by the Liberty Times (34.1
percent), the United Daily (25.1 percent) , and the China Times (20.5 percent).</P>
      <P>The Apple Daily was also cited as the paper that provides the "the most detailed
reports, " "the most diversified content" and "the best quality". It was also

      <P>Hualien County in eastern Taiwan held a drill Tuesday that simulated marine
pollution from a damaged ship off its coastline, according to Magistrate Hsieh
Shen-shan.</P>
      <P>The county government mobilized 34 units, including firefighters, and personnel
in environmental protection, public health, marine patrol and township offices,
with a total of 191 people participating in the drill, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The scenario envisaged an accident in which a cargo ship strikes a rock and is
crippled at the mouth of the Meilun River.</P>
      <P>Marine pollution prevention and control is an important task for Hualien County,
which has 175 km of coastline, the longest along any city or county in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tuesday's drill covered emergency reporting, inspection, oil spill cleanup, and
evidence collection, said Hsieh, who was the commander of the exercise.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the participants displayed skill in all aspects of the drill and
reacted swiftly, which he said boded well in the event of an emergency, as a
quick response can help to minimize damage.</P>
      <P>Hualien County has had several marine pollution incidents in the past,  and
quick responses  and mobilization  by the relevant authorities were crucial in
dealing with these crises, Hsieh said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier insists on parity in possible meeting with Beijing official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chiao-shuan said Tuesday that he will insist on parity and dignity
in a possible meeting with a key Beijing official who is slated to visit Taiwan
soon.</P>
      <P>"Chen Yunlin, president of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) , must address me as 'premier' if the meeting is to take place,"
Liu said.</P>
      <P>Liu made the comment in a question-and-answer session at the Legislative Yuan
while fielding questions from opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
lawmaker Huang Wei-cher.</P>
      <P>"Arrangements will have to be made in advance, and I will not meet Chen if the
two sides fail to reach an agreement on this matter, " he said. "Reciprocality
and dignity must be fully observed during the meeting with Chen."</P>
      <P>The premier also gave the assurance that in addition to Chen, he will demand an
apology from the Chinese government and companies over China's toxic milk powder
and other questionable dairy products sold to Taiwan, and promised to help
Taiwan's private sector seek compensation from the Chinese side.</P>
      <P>Chen serves as China's top negotiator in systematic two-way talks with Taiwan.
His planned visit to Taiwan, originally slated for late October or early
November, has drawn objection from the DPP and its supporters, particularly as
it was found last month that milk powder and other food products imported from
China were tainted with a toxic industrial chemical melamine.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  chairman of the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
Chiang Pin-kung, Chen's Taiwanese counterpart, said the SEF and ARATS are still
arranging the details of Chen's visit to Taiwan, projected for late October.</P>
      <P>"The date of Chen's Taiwan visit will not be changed once it has been fixed,
despite objections from some quarters, " Chiang said later Tuesday during a
speech at the opening of a cross-Taiwan Strait electronics show sponsored by the
Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association.</P>
      <P>"In their next round of negotiations, the two sides hope to wrap up talks on
establishing direct cross-strait air and sea links," he reiterated.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DPP and several pro-independence groups have vowed to take to the
streets in protest against China while Chen is in the country.</P>
      <P>In the next round of SEF-ARATS talks in Taipei, Taiwan and China are scheduled
to discuss the opening of straighter cross-strait cargo charter flights and
shipping links,  the establishment of new passenger charter flight routes, joint
oil exploration in the Taiwan Strait and crime-fighting.</P>
      <P>In an ice-breaking meeting in June in Beijing, Chiang and Chen clinched two
milestone accords to step up two-way tourism and passenger transportation
services on weekends.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a legislative interpellation session earlier Tuesday, Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said issues relating to Chen's
projected visit later this month are being discussed as slated. But, she added,
a pair of pandas offered by China to Taiwan as gifts are not expected to be
brought to Taiwan on Chen's flight.</P>
      <P>"China's gift of two giant pandas will not arrive in Taiwan at the same time as
Chen, as quarantine issues remain unsettled, " Lai said, asserting that the two
endangered animals will eventually be brought to Taiwan when the necessary
quarantine measures are put in place.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Given the fact that Taiwan's economic fundamentals are very healthy, the country
stands a better chance than some others of weathering the global financial
crisis, the lord mayor of the City of London -- the financial and commercial
heart of Britain -- said Tuesday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"Fundamentally, your economy is in very good shape, " Lord Mayor David Lewis
said at a news conference at the end of his four-day visit to Taiwan. He said
Taiwan has good GDP, good export volume, low inflation rates and healthy foreign
currency reserves.</P>
      <P>"I think you stand a better chance of weathering the storm than some other
countries, " Lewis said. "You should more optimistic about the situation."</P>
      <P>The lord mayor also applauded President Ma Ying-jeou's economic policy toward
China, which includes initiatives such as direct cross-strait flights and
relaxation of the investment ceiling. This "is a very good thing, both for
Taiwan and China and for the rest of the world," he said.</P>
      <P>"Dialogue is the only way you can solve economic and political problems, so I
endorse what he has done," he added.</P>
      <P>Regarding Taiwan's efforts to become a regional financial center, Lewis said
Taiwan has a lot to do, as there is a lot of "red tape" involved in starting a
business in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also, Taiwan has to encourage more foreign investors to list on the Taiwan stock
market and encourage more Taiwanese businesses to come back to invest at home,
he added.</P>
      <P>Turning his attention to the current global financial crisis, Lewis suggested
that global action is needed to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>"Fundamentally, it has to do with lack of confidence and lack of trust, " Lewis
said. "Because it is a global problem, only a global solution will deal with
it."</P>
      <P>He said it is essential that governments, regulators, and central banks across
the world get together and agree on a course of action to restore the confidence
and trust that everyone had in the system and also, just as importantly, to
prevent similar financial crises from happening again in the future.</P>
      <P>The lord mayor argued that it is quite understandable and sensible to see the
consolidation of financial institutions around the world, because while there is
nothing fundamentally wrong with the businesses, the problem lies in bank
liquidity.</P>
      <P>He said such consolidation should apply to Taiwan as well because the country
has too many banks for a population of only 23 million.</P>
      <P>"You need small banks to be merged or taken over by larger banks, which will
then become more stable and stronger, and that would result in more confidence
in the system," Lewis said.</P>
      <P>The 61-year-old Lewis will leave Taiwan Oct. 8 and travel to Japan, Brunei and
Singapore from Oct.9-16 to discuss investment opportunities that the City of
London has to offer.</P>
      <P>Located in the eastern part of downtown London, the City of London is also
called the "Square Mile" because it is 2.6 square kilometers in area.</P>
      <P>The lord mayor is elected every year and is commissioned to act during the one-
year term as an ambassador for the UK-financial sector industry.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Consumers in Taiwan now have the option of buying native Taiwanese chicken whose
prices have dropped from its peak a month ago amid the current economic
volatility.</P>
      <P>At the "2008 chicken broth of happiness" fair in Taipei Tuesday, the organizer,
the Poultry Association of the Republic of China, drew attention to the fact
that the market price of local chicken fell from over NT$80 (US$2.47) per
kilogram in September to around NT$53 per kg in early October.</P>
      <P>Ho Yu-chen, an association executive responsible for the sale of locally raised
chicken, said that between 1.8 million and 2 million chickens were sold per week
during the long summer break -- a volume that she said was about normal for that
time of year.</P>
      <P>However, in the cooler autumn season, sales were expected to rise to between 2
million and 2.2 million whole chickens per week, but they fell short of that
projection this year, Ho said.</P>
      <P>This is because local poultry farmers had overstocks of between 400,000 and
500,000 units during the Mid-Autumn  Festival,  a traditional high season for
chicken, one of the main ingredients of local cuisine and of a health broth that
includes Chinese herbal medicine, Ho added.</P>
      <P>The association has therefore organized a series of promotional activities
around the island in the hope of pumping up the sluggish sale of locally grown
chicken, she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's infrastructure plan offers ample investment opportunities</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 7 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2008 Taiwan Business Alliance Conference entered its second day Tuesday with
four panel discussions in the morning, including one presenting Taiwan's NT$3.99
trillion infrastructure development plan.</P>
      <P>Hwang Wang-hsiang, vice chairman of the nation's top economic planning agency,
the Council for Economic Planning and Development, introduced the i-Taiwan 12
projects as "the new economic development blueprint for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Investment in the projects is expected to hit NT$3.99 trillion (US$123.2
billion) over eight years, with NT$2.65 trillion coming from the government and
NT$1.34 trillion from the private sector.</P>
      <P>Among the 12 projects will be the extension  of Taiwan's transportation network,
encompassing three programs: a fast and convenient islandwide transportation
network, Kaohsiung port-city regeneration, and the development of a Taoyuan
international aviation city.</P>
      <P>Another project, to stimulate industrial development, will focus on building a
new central region high-tech industrial clusters program,  an industrial
innovation corridors programs,  and an intelligent Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Two major programs will be emphasized in the project related to urban and rural
development: urban and industrial park regeneration, and farm village
regeneration.</P>
      <P>The project related to environmental protection will feature four main
components: coastal regeneration, green forestation, flood prevention and water
management, and sewer construction.</P>
      <P>The government's preliminary budget for the 12 projects in 2009, pending
legislative approval, is NT$170.226 billion. Of that, 38.89 percent, or
NT$65.349 billion, will be earmarked for the building of a fast and convenient
islandwide transportation network.</P>
      <P>The programs developing an intelligent Taiwan and industrial innovation
corridors will account for 20.02 percent, or NT$34.07 billion, of the 2009
budget.</P>
      <P>Jennifer Yuh-jen Wu,  deputy director of the Institute of Transportation  under
the  Ministry  of  Transportation  and Communications, said that the fast
transportation network aims at allowing residents of villages and townships with
populations greater than 50,000 to reach a freeway or expressway within 30
minutes and reach regional centers in one hour.</P>
      <P>In another panel discussion on biotechnology, National Health Research
Institutes Secretary-General C.M.  Liang said Taiwan's diverse advantages
offered attractive opportunities  in biotech development.</P>
      <P>While worldwide revenues in the bio- pharmaceutical industry now total US$800
billion annually, Taiwan's annual revenues currently stand at only US$6 billion,
Liang said, indicating the sector's considerable potential for growth in the
country.</P>
      <P>Liang noted that Taiwan's biotechnology industry enjoys many advantages,
including a reservoir of high-quality talent to help discover and develop new
drugs and its powerful electronics industry, which can help design better
medical monitoring devices.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine will also help as more people
around the world stress  health  maintenance, a potentially crucial trend for
the bio-pharm sector, Liang suggested.</P>
      <P>He observed that as baby boomers age, biotechnology will be geared as much to
enhancing health care and quality of life as it is to preventing  disease,  a
trend that will cater to Taiwan's competitive advantages.</P>
      <P>He also said that nurturing and retaining biotech talent is an urgent priority
in the research and development of new drugs, and noted that the key areas in
the development of bio-pharm will be small molecule drugs, DNA &amp; RNA drugs
and protein drugs.</P>
      <P>In the panel discussion on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) ,  Shyu Jyuo-
min,  chairman of the Nanotechnology  and Micro Systems Association, noted that
Taiwan's semiconductor industry has good supply chain integration.</P>
      <P>That strong supply chain is seen as a major advantage, Shyu said, as it enables
many ODM factories, foundries, and fabless companies to advance their MEMS
component technologies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also has a sound high-tech infrastructure with northern, central and
southern Taiwan industrial parks, making it very suitable to develop MEMS
applications, he said.</P>
      <P>Yee Kuo-chung, vice president of the R&amp;D Center of the Advanced
Semiconductor Engineering Group (ASE) , said there were growing opportunities in
Taiwan's MEMS sector as 4C functions are being merged into handsets and demand
is growing for the technology in sensors and related equipment.</P>
      <P>Yee said the key factors in winning MEMS business included standardization &amp;
diversification, cost effectiveness, market size, supply chain integration and
chip-package-system know-how.</P>
      <P>In the panel discussion on Taiwan's LED Industry, Taiwan was introduced as the
world's second largest LED manufacturer in terms of output, after Japan, with
applications in cellular phones, small- and middle-size panel backlights and
digital photo frames being the backbone of the industry.</P>
      <P>Panel participants noted that considering the huge commercial opportunities  in
large backlights,  residential and commercial lighting and automobile LED
applications, upstream epitaxial wafer and chip production is seen as an ideal
niche for foreign investment.</P>
      <P>The output value of the LED industry in Taiwan was US$1.423 billion in 2007,
accounting for a 21.6 percent share of the world market.</P>
      <P>Following the panel discussions, Charles H.C. Kao, the chairman of the Institute
of Knowledge Economy and Management, discussed Taiwan's investment climate in
front of a luncheon audience.</P>
      <P>Kao said he was fundamentally optimistic about Taiwan's economic future, and
lauded the government's attempt to improve cross-Taiwan Strait relations to
solidify Taiwan as a key hub between the West and China.</P>
      <P>But he also urged the administration to address the country's tax structure,
streamline regulations and maintain policy consistency to strengthen the local
investment environment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan eyeing position as regional financial center</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan will capitalize on its strength in manufacturing  industries  to  turn
itself  into  a  regional niche-oriented financial center, a senior official
said Tuesday at an annual international business conference.</P>
      <P>Bill  Chang,  a  Financial  Supervisory  Commission  (FSC) commissioner, made
the remarks while moderating a panel discussion on finance and insurance
industry development held as part of the 2008 Taiwan Business Alliance
Conference.</P>
      <P>Chang said the FSC has singled out developing Taiwan into a regional financial
center as a long-term goal for the coming four to eight years.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is working hard to improve relations with China and ease restrictions
on trade and economic exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, Chang said, Taiwan
stands a good chance of realizing its ambitious goal of becoming a regional
financial center, given its cultural and language advantages and having the
greater China area as its market.</P>
      <P>In becoming a regional financial market, Chang went on, Taiwan must seek to
become a regional financial service center, fund raising center and wealth/asset
management center for Asia.</P>
      <P>While Hong Kong is outstanding in market opening and financial liberalization
and Singapore is good at integrating financial services under its efficient
government leadership, Chang said Taiwan has many advantages that cannot be
easily replaced, such as a rich talent pool, an enormous demand for capital and
financial services by a large array of overseas Taiwanese companies, and a well-
developed chain of high-tech manufacturing industries.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan can leverage its strengths in these fields, such as its upstream
companies' demand for financing, its midstream companies' demand for securities
management and its downstream companies' demand for commodity distribution,
Chang said, Taiwan can emerge as a regional financial center.</P>
      <P>At another panel discussion on investment opportunities based on cross-strait
deregulation, both local and foreign business executives said Taiwan's
government should come up with a comprehensive policy on trade and economic
relations with China in order to create more jobs and business opportunities
through further opening to Chinese capital.</P>
      <P>Randall Hall, CEO-China of Savills Property Services (Shanghai) Co., said Taiwan
should develop a well-rounded cross-strait economic policy and greatly ease
restrictions on two-way investment across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's real estate, tourism and hotel industries will all benefit from such
reforms, Hall said during the panel discussion on investment opportunities based
on cross-strait deregulation.</P>
      <P>Forecasting that both the commercial property and housing markets in Taiwan will
benefit from deregulation, Hall said he is very confident of Taiwan's property
market prospects once Taiwan opens its doors wider to Chinese investors.</P>
      <P>He further suggested that Taiwan accelerate its pace of opening up to China by
allowing direct shipping links and direct cross-strait flights on a daily basis
and permitting Chinese citizens to invest in Taiwanese industries and property.</P>
      <P>Fred P.C. Huang, chairman of the Taiwan Association of Machinery Industry,
concurred with Hall's views, saying that as China has gradually evolved from a
"global factory" to a "global market, " Taiwan's business community should step
up efforts to tap its neighbor's vast domestic market and consider how to
cooperate with its Chinese counterpart to cope with changing global economic
trends and financial volatility.</P>
      <P>In its formulation of cross-strait economic policy, Huang said, the government
should take into account Taiwan's leverage, the feasibility of cross-strait
cooperation in industrial development, and China's willingness to engage in such
cooperation.</P>
      <P>Yasushi Hata, general manager of Japan's Mitsui &amp; Co.'s overseas department
in charge of corporate planning and strategy, said Taiwanese and Japanese
companies would stand a better chance of gaining a solid foothold in the Chinese
domestic market if they pool their resources and cooperate closely, given the
fact that Taiwan has advantages in the areas of management, cost control and
market distribution in China, while Japan excels in the areas of branding and
technical know-how.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in a panel discussion on the tourism and hospitality industry,
Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai said now is the best time for
investment in Taiwan's tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Noting that many international news media outlets have run articles on Taiwan's
tourism resources, Lai said the government has also spared no efforts in an
international publicity campaign in order to attract more tourists.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years,  Lai said,  the government  has consistently set aside
a large portion of its annual budget for the renovation of tourist facilities
and infrastructure construction. Moreover, she added, the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait have come to terms on mutual tourist exchanges, ushering in a new
era for Taiwan's tourism development.</P>
      <P>Stanley C. Yen,  honorary chairman of the Taiwan Visitors Association and group
president of Landis Hotels and Resorts, said Taiwan has potential to become a
regional travel and recreational center if it can carve out unique tourist
attractions by leveraging on its generous hospitality and abundant religious and
cultural heritage.</P>
      <P>On the development of the logistics industry, Bobby Yu, chairman of Taiwan Air
Cargo Terminal, said that thanks to Taiwan's thriving information technology
industry and booming cross-strait transport services, the combined air cargo
volumes of Taiwan's two major carriers -- China Airlines and Eva Airways -- have
put Taiwan at the top of the world air cargo service map.</P>
      <P>Other domestic logistics industry operators have also used online services and
forged cooperative ties with foreign air carriers to expand their reach in the
global transport service market, Yu added.</P>
      <P>Henk Meijboom, executive board member for shipping and logistics divisions of
the Netherlands Broekman Group, shared Yu's views on Taiwan's advantages in the
logistics industry, saying that Taiwan occupies a favorable geographic location,
enjoys continued economic growth and boasts a strong IT industry.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless,  Meijboom  continued,  Taiwan also faces many challenges in
sustaining its niches in this field. To reap even more gains, he said, Taiwan's
logistics industry operators should step up their exploration of Chinese market-
related logistics services by using its geographic proximity to that country.</P>
      <P>With its robust manufacturing sector, Meijboom said, Taiwan should capitalize on
the daily demand of its world-renowned companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corp., Acer and Chimei, for delivery of their goods worldwide
every day to beef up its logistics service network.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,500 business people attended the 2008 Taiwan Business Alliance
Conference, in which two forums and eight panel sessions were held. The event

      <P>Fifteen companies with diverse businesses and headquartered in different parts
on the world on Tuesday pledged to invest an estimated US$150 million to US$200
million in Taiwan, citing the islands skilled workforce, strong government
support and honest business environment as reasons why they want to put their
money here.</P>
      <P>The companies signed letters of intent at a ceremony on the sidelines of the
2008 Taiwan Business Alliance Conference, an event that is held for the fifth
time in Taiwan this year, attracting 1,500 business people this time. The
conference concluded Tuesday.</P>
      <P>There are different reasons why these companies made their commitments, with
some planning to make Taiwan their regional headquarters. The reasons include
Taiwans strong talent, location and the improvement in cross-strait relations,
said Yiin Chii-ming, Taiwans Minister of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Of the companies that signed the letters of intent, 10 will expand or increase
their investments here. These include companies that have been investing in
Taiwan for nearly 20 years or more, including Bayer, 3M, Corning, and Siemens.</P>
      <P>For Bayer, the letter of intent is the first the company has signed with the
government in 10 years.</P>
      <P>We see Taiwan as a key market in our strategic positioning in Asia, especially
in research and development of functional films, said Tim Bielfeldt, head of
Bayer Material Science A.G.</P>
      <P>We are especially encouraged by recent commitments by Mr. Yiin and his team that
they are supporting private sector investment in environmental protection,
especially investments in green products, Bielfeldt said at the signing
ceremony.</P>
      <P>Another five companies will make their initial investments in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>One of them, Matla Solar Energy (Pty) Ltd., which is based in Africa, plans to
invest US$25.2 million in opening a photovoltaic cell manufacturing facility in
Taiwan and another US$8.1 million into a Taiwan-based research incubation
company.</P>
      <P>Thats very unusual for an African country, underdeveloped, to be investing
heavily in a developed country. We do that for strategic reasons and because we
embrace the people of Taiwan because of their warmth and expertise, said
Zwelakhe Sisulu, chairman of the company s parent company, The Matla Group.</P>
      <P>Six of the companies will set up R&amp;D centers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They said the business environment and attitude of the government and people
makes Taiwan anexcellent choiceas a regional base for their companies in the
Asia Pacific region.</P>
      <P>We speak about trust, loyalty and honesty and its not always easy to find these
words in China, but we have these in Taiwan,said Johan Stjernberg, president and
CEO of Swedish firm, the STEGIA Company, which makes electrical, mechanical,
telecom and automotive devices.</P>

environment to attract foreign direct investment more efficiently.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is strategically located in East Asia.KWe believe cross-strait
deregulation and cooperation as well as new domestic infrastructure development
will lead to more investments in Taiwan, Yiin said at the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Yiin said later that he did not know whether the amount pledged at the
conference was greater than investment commitments made in previous conferences,
but that regardless of the amount, with the financial challenges currently faced
around the world, the ministry willneed to work harder to attract foreign

    <TEXT>
      <P>The British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) announced Tuesday the two winners
of this year's Mansion House Scholarship, who will embark on financial training
and courses in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>The two winners -- Chang Hsiao-ping and Wang Wei-kai -- were awarded at a joint
chamber luncheon earlier in the day by Alderman David Lewis, the lord mayor of
the City of London -- the financial and commercial heart of Britain.</P>
      <P>"I wish both the winners of the scholarship a fruitful financial experience in
the City of London, " Lewis was quoted as saying by the BTCO in a press release.</P>
      <P>Thirty-four-year-old Chang, who has a master's degree in banking and finance
from the University of Stirling, has worked as a specialist at the Financial
Supervisory Commission's Division of International Banks since 2001, according
to the BTCO.</P>
      <P>She  intends  to  undertake  a  short-term  position  at Switzerland-based UBS
London headquarters to learn about the wealth management business, the BTCO
added.</P>
      <P>Wang, a 30-year-old economics graduate who has worked for the Export-Import Bank
of the Republic of China since 2006, is planning to take either a masters in
finance at the London Business School or an MSc in investment management at Cass
Business School.</P>
      <P>The Mansion House Scholarship Scheme targets overseas students wishing to take
masters-level degree courses at British universities and young business
executives or officials wishing to undertake training or work experience in the
financial services sector or in related business activities in the U.K.</P>
      <P>The scheme was established by the lord mayor of London in 1997 to help build
links between London's City -- one of the world's leading financial centers --
and other financial centers, including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The scheme provides an excellent opportunity to gain a better insight  into
British  business  life and underlying  cultural perceptions. Awards vary in
size but are usually in the region of 5,000-7,500 British pounds (NT$282,500 to
NT$423,500.)</P>
      <P>The process and selection of the successful applicants are made by the lord
mayor's office on the advice of the BTCO.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Security chief apologizes over `slip of tongue' on SARS remarks</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 7 (CNA)
10/07/08  20:26:21
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National Security Bureau (NSB) Director Tsai Chao-ming apologized Tuesday for
what he described as a "slip of the tongue" he made a day earlier at the
legislature when he called the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
outbreak a result of "China's biological warfare."</P>
      <P>The apology was made through a news release issued by the NSB. Unlike a previous
news release a day earlier that flatly denied that Tsai made any remarks to that
effect, the Tuesday news release said Tsai's "slip of the tongue" occurred
because of the limited time he had to answer questions from a legislative
committee.</P>
      <P>SARS originated in southern China and went on to kill about 745 people around
the world, including 350 in China, 299 in Hong Kong and 83 in Taiwan. It dealt a
heavy blow to Asia's tourism and air industries.</P>
      <P>Tsai's remarks about SARS being a biochemical agent of China were</P>
      <P>made in response to questions  from opposition  Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Legislator Twu Shiing-jer, who was the head of the Cabinet-level
Department of Health (DOH) during the SARS outbreak.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on whether the SARS virus could be used as a biological weapon,
Yeh Chin-chuan, who took over as minister of the DOH 10 days ago, said the
possibility is "very slim."</P>
      <P>"I am not a weapons expert, but the SARS virus is something that can be
controlled. If it occurs, we are capable of stopping it," said Yeh, who earned
the reputation as Taipei's "SARS-fighting hero" in 2003 when he led the
quarantined Taipei Municipal Hoping Hospital in the fight against the outbreak
as director of the city's health bureau.</P>
      <P>Although Tsai offered an apology for his remarks, the controversy appeared to be
still developing, with legislators of both the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the
DPP bent on pursuing the issue.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus urged Tsai to reveal all information his bureau has
about a SARS conspiracy theory that the virus was "probably produced in a
Chinese laboratory" in order that Taiwan can ask the international community to
join an investigation into the issue.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislative caucus also said that if Tsai cannot back his remarks with
concrete proof, he should step down from his post as the nation's top security
chief.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from opposition DPP legislators  at an interpellation
session, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan voiced his support for the KMT legislators,
saying that the NSB has an obligation to clarify the issue.</P>
      <P>On whether he agreed with the KMT legislative caucus' view that Tsai should
resign, the premier said he would relay the suggestion to President Ma Ying-jeou
and that it is up to the president to decide what, if any, further steps should
be taken.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called Tuesday for the signing of an extradition treaty
between Taiwan and the United States so that Taiwan criminals, especially
economic criminals who have fled to the United States, could be brought back to
face justice.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while receiving a delegation from the U.S. National
Association of Attorneys General.</P>
      <P>Ma expressed the hope that the delegation would help in this regard when they
return to the United States, so that the U.S. Congress could formulate the
relevant legislation to turn a new page in bilateral judicial cooperation.</P>
      <P>He said that although the two countries have not signed an extradition treaty,
Taiwan has worked with the U.S. to turn over U.S. suspects who had fled to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This relatively unbalanced situation has existed for a long time, the president
said, expressing the hope that the signing of a bilateral extradition treaty
will serve to repatriate Taiwan fugitives in the U.S.</P>
      <P>Ma said that Taiwan has cooperated well with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency in
a "controlled delivery" approach, noting that drug mules traveling from
Southeast Asia to the United States sometimes go via Taiwan or Japan.</P>
      <P>When such drug traffickers are spotted passing through Taiwan's ports, the
Taiwan police usually take no action, but instead allow the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Agency to make the arrests and seize the drugs when the suspects
arrive on the U.S. West coast, the president said.</P>
      <P>The process has to be kept top secret and requires full cooperation, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has worked with the United States in this way for a long time, Ma said,
adding that it would be even better if both sides signed an extradition treaty.</P>

    <HEADLINE>14th case of enterovirus fatality reported this year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) reported Tuesday the 14th fatality from
enterovirus this year, confirming the death of an eight-month-old boy affected
by enterovirus 71 (EV71), which can cause severe neurological damage.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control, said the
patient became ill on May 30, and was taken to a local clinic for medical
treatment the next day.</P>
      <P>Without showing signs of getting well, the boy was transferred to a medical
center on June 1, where he was admitted to an intensive-care ward. The following
day, he was put on the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo) life support
system.</P>
      <P>The system was removed on June 5, but the boy remained in critical condition,
Lin said.</P>
      <P>The patient, suffering from damage to the central nervous system of the brain,
was transferred to a health care center on July 4, where he succumbed to the
disease, passing away on Sept. 21, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>With rising public awareness about the outbreaks of the epidemic this year, only
13 suspected cases were reported as of Tuesday since Sept. 1, five of which were
confirmed, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>The accumulated volume of confirmed severe enterovirus infection cases reached
396 so far this year, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Lin reminded the public that asking their children to wash their hands
frequently and maintaining good hygiene are the best ways to protect children
from the disease.</P>
      <P>Parents and teachers are also advised to be on guard if children under 5 have
the typical symptoms of a serious case of enterovirus -- fever, foot-and-mouth
disease, twittering and drowsiness.</P>
      <P>Enterovirus is the most common cause of aseptic meningitis and can lead to
serious illness, especially in infants and the immunocompromised.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tourists favor quota control on visitors to Orchid Island: poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A vast majority of tourists who have visited Orchid Island support the idea of
imposing a quota system to control the number of visitors to the small island
off the coast of Taitung County in southeastern Taiwan, a tourism organization
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Taitung Sustainable  Development  Association  made the statement based on
the results of a public opinion survey that it conducted recently under
commission by the Taitung County government.</P>
      <P>Citing the poll results, association officials reported that as many as 62.5
percent of the respondents favored the idea of establishing a "quota control"
mechanism to limit the number of tourists to the Orchid Island, while 58.9
percent supported setting up a "conservation area" on the island -- both to help
preserve its natural resources.</P>
      <P>These are strong indications that visitors are increasingly aware of the
importance of environmental protection on the island, said association
officials.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the survey, most tourists to the Orchid Island are
young men and women with higher education who visit the island at least once.</P>
      <P>To this type of tourist,  Orchid Island's "landscape" and "diversified
ecological system" are the prime attractions, the survey found. About 92.1
percent said they would like to visit the island again with their families or
friends.</P>
      <P>But about 90 percent of the respondents said they are deeply concerned that the
many motorcycles on the island would destroy its tranquil environment, while
many tourists said they were most dissatisfied with what they described as the
island's unclear "road signs" and "explanation boards" at the tourist spots.</P>
      <P>The 45 square-kilometer Orchid Island is located some 80 km southeast of Taitung
County. It is home to some 5,000 indigenous people of the Tao tribe. Most of the
residents are farmers and fishermen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Legislature urged to provide live broadcasts of sessions</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Citizen Congress Watch (CCW) , a civic group that monitors the Legislative
Yuan, has urged the legislature to provide live broadcasts of its sessions via
the video-on-demand (VOD) system, CCW Chairman Ku Chung-hwa said at a news
conference Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ku said the legislature has spent six months working on providing the service,
efforts that have included sending a delegation to America in July to learn from
its experience. However, he went on, no progress has been made since then.</P>
      <P>Legislative  Speaker Wang Jin-pyng vowed in July that the legislature would put
the service into practice in September, but has failed to keep his promise, Ku
said.</P>
      <P>Wang said at the beginning of October that the legislature is working toward
allowing public access to live session broadcasts and will hold a cross-party
meeting Oct. 13 to reach consensus on the many problems involved.</P>
      <P>However, CCW Executive Director Ho Tsung-hsun said the issue of technical
problems should be excluded in that meeting, pointing out that eight local
government councils -- Taipei City, Kaohsiung City, Keelung City, Yilan County,
Hualien County, Chiayi County, Chiayi City and Taichung City -- have already put
broadcasts of their sessions on their Web sites.</P>
      <P>Among them, the Kaohsiung City Council started providing the service in 2001,
while Taipei City launched its one in September after just two months of
preparation, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Financial support will not be a problem, either, Ho said, pointing out that
Chiayi City's operating expenses in this regard amount to about NT$50,000
(US$1,543) per year, while those of Hualien County cost only NT$10,000 for one
year.</P>
      <P>Ho said he does not understand why the legislature has been so ineffective in
providing the service, given that it enjoys more resources than local councils.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that the Oct. 13 meeting will come up with resolutions that
meet the public's expectations.</P>

      <P>The 2008 Taichung Jazz Festival is scheduled to open in the central city next
Saturday, with 20 to 30 well-known saxophonists and saxophone ensembles from

      <P>The nine-day festival, which is held annually, is in its sixth year.</P>
      <P>At the opening of the festival sponsored by the city's Cultural Affairs Bureau,
1,000 musicians are expected to team up to perform popular songs on saxophone at
the bustling City Square in the city's West District, said Mark K. Huang, the
bureau's director-general.</P>
      <P>They will be attempting to break the British-based Guinness Book of World

900, a record set in Toronto, Canada March 30, 2004, Huang said.</P>
      <P>At present, more than 500 musicians have applied to take part in the Taichung
saxophone performance, Huang said.</P>
      <P>With less than two weeks left before the scheduled assault on the record, Huang
said the bureau will do more to publicize the record-breaking attempt and try to

lessons to participate in the performance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP proposes bill to compensate importers harmed by melamine scandal</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) @legislator proposed a draft
bill Tuesday to compensate Taiwanese import firms that have suffered financial
losses as a result of their importing of melamine-contaminated products from
China.</P>
      <P>Wang Sing-nan, a DPP caucus whip, submitted the bill to the legislative Yuan's
Procedure Committee, which agreed to report it to a meeting of the whole
legislature for discussion Oct. 14.</P>
      <P>The bill has won the endorsement from the legislative caucuses of both the DPP
and the ruling Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Legislator William Lai, another DPP legislative caucus whip, said the government
should first compensate the affected importers for their losses and then try to
get the money back from the Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>KMT caucus whip Lin Yi-shih said the KMT caucus supports the bill in principle
but will need to communicate with the Cabinet to thrash out some differences.</P>
      <P>In addition to granting such importers business tax exemption for September, the
bill would allow cash compensation to be paid for melamine-related losses to
import firms according to their annual business revenues.</P>
      <P>For example, a firm whose revenues totaled between NT$3 million and NT$4 million
last year could get NT$500,000@ (US$15,420) in compensation, while a smaller
firm with revenues of less than NT$1.2 million could receive just NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been engulfed in a food scare since the food and beverage products of
several noted companies were recently found to contain melamine. The
contamination occurred because milk power and non-dairy creamer imported from
China were used as ingredients in the Taiwanese companies' food and beverage
products.</P>
      <P>Twenty-two dairy companies in China were found to have added melamine -- a toxic
chemical used to make plastics and fertilizers -- to milk powder and non-dairy
products to give them artificially high protein levels.</P>
      <P>Taiwan discovered last month that 25 tons of Sanlu-brand milk powder imported
from China in June was contaminated with melamine. The milk powder was sold
mainly to bakeries and beverage companies as a baking ingredient and creamer.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the Chinese authorities, six babies have
died and some 53,000 children have fallen ill -- including 6,200 infants
diagnosed with kidney stones -- after consuming melamine-tainted infant formula.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former first lady Wu Shi-jen's older brother was detained  Tuesday on charges of
violating  the anti-money laundering act, making him the fifth person to be held
incommunicado in the ongoing probe into alleged money laundering involving the
former first family.</P>
      <P>Wu Ching-mao was taken into custody after being questioned for several hours
earlier in the day. Prosecutors sought Wu's detention as they believed he had
offended against the anti-money laundering act by helping his older sister wire
more than NT$60 million abroad using figurehead accounts.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors also feared that Wu might tamper with evidence or collude with other
suspects to commit perjury if allowed to remain at large.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court granted the request for detention after reviewing the
case and ordered that he be held incommunicado. The court said in its ruling
that the money wired abroad by Wu might be connected with public funds;
otherwise, he had not to have used many figurehead accounts to evade scrutiny.</P>
      <P>Wu's detention came a day after former Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau
Director-General Yeh Sheng-mao was detained by the Taipei District Court for his
role in the former first family's alleged money laundering case.</P>
      <P>Yeh was indicted Aug.  28 for concealing  and failing to investigate information
about overseas bank accounts held by members of former President Chen Shui-
bian's family in the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean. Yeh was the first to be
indicted in the case.</P>
      <P>The district court will hold a hearing on Yeh's case Wednesday, during which Yeh
is expected to hold cross-debate with Chen.</P>
      <P>Two of the former president's most trusted aides -- Chen Chen-hui, a former
cashier of the Presidential Office, and Lin Teh-hsun, director of Chen's office
from 2005-2008 -- have also been taken into custody for their suspected roles in
the case.</P>
      <P>Also detained was Tsai Ming-tse, a brother of Tsai Mei-li, a college classmate
of former first lady Wu Shu-jen.</P>
      <P>In addition to being implicated in the money laundering case, Chen is also under
investigation for alleged embezzlement of public funds by using other people's
spending receipts to gain reimbursements from a special "state affairs fund" set
aside for his discretionary use for official purposes. His wife has been
indicted in this case.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors are now investigating whether any portion of the "state affairs
fund" had been wired to the overseas bank accounts of Chen's family members
during his eight-year presidency.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Shui-bian, the money in the overseas bank accounts was the
balance of political contributions for his two mayoral and two presidential bids
between 1993 and 2004. Chen claimed his innocence, insisting that he didn't use
any penny of the "state affairs fund" to line his own pocket.</P>

      <P>The 2008 Taichung Jazz Festival is scheduled to open in the central city next
Saturday, with 20 to 30 well-known saxophonists and saxophone ensembles from
home and abroad performing, an official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The nine-day festival, which is held annually, is in its sixth year.</P>
      <P>At the opening of the festival sponsored by the city's Cultural Affairs Bureau,
1,000 musicians are expected to team up to perform popular songs on saxophone at
the bustling City Square in the city's West District, said Mark K. Huang, the
bureau's director-general.</P>
      <P>They will be attempting to break the British-based Guinness Book of World

900, a record set in Toronto, Canada March 30, 2004, Huang said.</P>
      <P>At present, more than 500 musicians have applied to take part in the Taichung
saxophone performance, Huang said.</P>
      <P>With less than two weeks left before the scheduled assault on the record, Huang
said the bureau will do more to publicize the record-breaking attempt and try to
encourage city government staffers and city residents who have taken saxophone
lessons to participate in the performance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP proposes bill to compensate importers harmed by melamine scandal</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) @legislator proposed a draft
bill Tuesday to compensate Taiwanese import firms that have suffered financial
losses as a result of their importing of melamine-contaminated products from
China.</P>
      <P>Wang Sing-nan, a DPP caucus whip, submitted the bill to the legislative Yuan's
Procedure Committee, which agreed to report it to a meeting of the whole
legislature for discussion Oct. 14.</P>
      <P>The bill has won the endorsement from the legislative caucuses of both the DPP
and the ruling Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Legislator William Lai, another DPP legislative caucus whip, said the government
should first compensate the affected importers for their losses and then try to
get the money back from the Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>KMT caucus whip Lin Yi-shih said the KMT caucus supports the bill in principle
but will need to communicate with the Cabinet to thrash out some differences.</P>
      <P>In addition to granting such importers business tax exemption for September, the
bill would allow cash compensation to be paid for melamine-related losses to
import firms according to their annual business revenues.</P>
      <P>For example, a firm whose revenues totaled between NT$3 million and NT$4 million
last year could get NT$500,000@ (US$15,420) in compensation, while a smaller
firm with revenues of less than NT$1.2 million could receive just NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been engulfed in a food scare since the food and beverage products of
several noted companies were recently found to contain melamine. The
contamination occurred because milk power and non-dairy creamer imported from
China were used as ingredients in the Taiwanese companies' food and beverage
products.</P>
      <P>Twenty-two dairy companies in China were found to have added melamine -- a toxic
chemical used to make plastics and fertilizers -- to milk powder and non-dairy
products to give them artificially high protein levels.</P>
      <P>Taiwan discovered last month that 25 tons of Sanlu-brand milk powder imported
from China in June was contaminated with melamine. The milk powder was sold
mainly to bakeries and beverage companies as a baking ingredient and creamer.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the Chinese authorities, six babies have
died and some 53,000 children have fallen ill -- including 6,200 infants
diagnosed with kidney stones -- after consuming melamine-tainted infant formula.</P>

      <P>The leader of the copyright police in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan, said Tuesday
that officers from his unit seized more than 1,000 pirated DVDs a day earlier at
a night market in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>Chen Fu-chien, leader of the Taoyuan unit of the Intellectual Property
Protection Brigade under the National Police Agency, said his men discovered a
junior high school student selling discs containing a wide rage of illegally
copied movies.</P>
      <P>"We were surprised to see such recent titles as `Cape No. 7' and `Paris' among
the titles," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Cape No. 7 is a Taiwanese film that is still being screened around the island,
with box office takings surpassing NT$300 million already, while Paris is a
French romance not scheduled to be shown in Taiwan until December.</P>
      <P>The student claimed that he was not the owner of the pirated films but was
merely paid NT$1,000 to look after the stand. Police officers were trying to
follow leads to track down the counterfeit ring that produced the discs, Chen

    <HEADLINE>Ex-first lady's brother detained in money laundering probe</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former first lady Wu Shi-jen's older brother was detained  Tuesday on charges of
violating  the anti-money laundering act, making him the fifth person to be held
incommunicado in the ongoing probe into alleged money laundering involving the
former first family.</P>
      <P>Wu Ching-mao was taken into custody after being questioned for several hours
earlier in the day. Prosecutors sought Wu's detention as they believed he had
offended against the anti-money laundering act by helping his older sister wire
more than NT$60 million abroad using figurehead accounts.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors also feared that Wu might tamper with evidence or collude with other
suspects to commit perjury if allowed to remain at large.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court granted the request for detention after reviewing the
case and ordered that he be held incommunicado. The court said in its ruling
that the money wired abroad by Wu might be connected with public funds;
otherwise, he had not to have used many figurehead accounts to evade scrutiny.</P>
      <P>Wu's detention came a day after former Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau
Director-General Yeh Sheng-mao was detained by the Taipei District Court for his
role in the former first family's alleged money laundering case.</P>
      <P>Yeh was indicted Aug.  28 for concealing  and failing to investigate information
about overseas bank accounts held by members of former President Chen Shui-
bian's family in the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean. Yeh was the first to be
indicted in the case.</P>
      <P>The district court will hold a hearing on Yeh's case Wednesday, during which Yeh
is expected to hold cross-debate with Chen.</P>
      <P>Two of the former president's most trusted aides -- Chen Chen-hui, a former
cashier of the Presidential Office, and Lin Teh-hsun, director of Chen's office
from 2005-2008 -- have also been taken into custody for their suspected roles in
the case.</P>
      <P>Also detained was Tsai Ming-tse, a brother of Tsai Mei-li, a college classmate
of former first lady Wu Shu-jen.</P>
      <P>In addition to being implicated in the money laundering case, Chen is also under
investigation for alleged embezzlement of public funds by using other people's
spending receipts to gain reimbursements from a special "state affairs fund" set
aside for his discretionary use for official purposes. His wife has been
indicted in this case.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors are now investigating whether any portion of the "state affairs
fund" had been wired to the overseas bank accounts of Chen's family members
during his eight-year presidency.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Shui-bian, the money in the overseas bank accounts was the
balance of political contributions for his two mayoral and two presidential bids
between 1993 and 2004. Chen claimed his innocence, insisting that he didn't use
any penny of the "state affairs fund" to line his own pocket.</P>

      <P>America should continue to sell defensive weapons to Taiwan in the future and
stand by Taiwan's people, U.S. Republican presidential candidate John McCain
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"I welcome reports indicating that the sale of defensive arms to Taiwan -- a
package that has been on hold for too long -- will now move forward, " McCain
said in a statement issued Tuesday by his campaign headquarters in Arlington,
Va.</P>
      <P>The administration is taking a step in the right direction by notifying Congress
of its intent to provide weapons aimed at bolstering Taiwan's self defense, he
said in the statement.</P>
      <P>"I have long supported such sales in order to strengthen deterrence in the
Taiwan Strait and to help preserve the peace. American interests in Asia are
well-served through faithful implementation of the Taiwan Relations Act, and if
I am fortunate enough to be elected President, I will continue the longstanding
and close ties between our peoples," McCain said.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon's Defense Cooperation Security Agency on Oct. 3 notified Congress
that it had approved the sale of a package of weapons to Taiwan, including 30
Apache attack helicopters, 330 advanced capability Patriot (PAC-3) missiles, 32
Harpoon sub-launched missiles, 182 guided Javelin missile rounds, and four E-2T
system upgrades.</P>
      <P>But the U.S. did not approve Taiwan's requests for 64 Black Hawk helicopters and
8 diesel-electric submarines, nor did it accept a letter asking the U.S. to sell
Taiwan advanced F-16C/D fighters, a decision McCain disagreed with.</P>
      <P>"I urge the administration to reconsider this decision, in light of its previous
commitment to provide submarines and America's previous sales of F-16s," the
statement said.</P>
      <P>"These sales -- which could translate into tens of thousands of jobs here at
home -- would help retain America's edge in the production of advanced weaponry
and represent a positive sign in these difficult economic times."</P>
      <P>While McCain did not discount  the importance  of seeking cooperative and
productive relations with China, he argued promoting the improvement of cross-
strait relations meant bolstering Taiwan's defense capabilities.</P>
      <P>"We should understand that the possibility of productive ties between Taiwan and
China are enhanced, not diminished, when Taipei speaks from a position of
strength," McCain said in the statement.</P>
      <P>"I believe that America should continue to sell defensive weapons to Taiwan  in
the future,  in accordance  with  its security requirements, and stand by this
remarkable free and democratic people," he said.</P>

      <P>In an attempt to defuse China's anger over its decision to sell advanced weapons
to Taiwan, the United States insisted Tuesday that the sale was approved in
accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act, which permits the selling of defensive
systems to the island.</P>
      <P>China has canceled a series of military-to-military contacts with the U.S. and
China's ambassador to the United States, Zhou Wenzhong, lodged  a protest  at
the State  Department  after  the Bush administration notified Congress Oct. 3
that it had approved sales of US$6.46 billion worth of weapons to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The package included 330 Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) missiles, 32 sub-
launched Harpoon Block II missiles, 30 AH-64D Block III Apache Longbow attack
helicopters, 182 Javelin guided anti-tank missile rounds and 20 Javelin command
launch units, and system upgrades for four E-2T aircraft.</P>
      <P>Department of State deputy spokesman Robert Wood said at a regular news briefing
Tuesday that China's reaction to the sale was unfortunate.</P>
      <P>"It's an unfortunate decision that the Chinese have taken. We've explained to
them that what we've done is very much in accordance with the Taiwan Relations
Act in terms of selling defensive systems to the Taiwanese and we'll continue to
work with the Chinese on a whole range of issues where we have mutual interests,
" Wood told reporters.</P>
      <P>Wood said China has basically informed the State Department that some
U.S.-Chinese bilateral exchanges may be affected, but would not elaborate on
which activities would suffer.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Department of Defense spokesman Stewart Upton said Tuesday in
response to Taiwanese reporters' questions that the People's Republic of China
canceled or postponed several upcoming military-to-military exchanges due to the
arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Bilateral events affected involve senior level visits and humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief exchanges that were scheduled to occur between
now and the end of November. We are not going to go into further detail on the
affected programs at this time, " Upton said.</P>
      <P>"There has been no change in U.S. government policy and we have faithfully
carried out the provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act under which the U.S.
makes available items necessary for Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self
defense," he said.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese reaction is unfortunate and results in missed opportunities," he
added.</P>

      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) announced Tuesday night that the
government will guarantee all deposits at private and public banks without
limit.</P>
      <P>The blanket guarantee will cover all types of deposits, including savings
accounts, time deposits, checking accounts, foreign currency accounts,
negotiable certificates of deposit, and interbank call loans, the FSC said.</P>
      <P>Deposits at credit cooperatives, fishermen's and farmer's credit associations,
and other financial institutions will also be covered by the guarantee.</P>
      <P>The FSC's announcement came just one day after it announced that the Central
Deposit Insurance Corp. would increase the maximum amount of deposits to be
guaranteed from NT$1.5 million to NT$3 million through Dec. 31, 2009.</P>
      <P>The period of the blanket guarantee will be decided over the next day or two,
with the decision then being sent to the Executive Yuan for approval, FSC Vice
Chairwoman Lee Jih-chu said at Tuesday's press conference.</P>
      <P>Lee said the blanket guarantee is a preventive measure to restore confidence and
alleviate depositors' concerns about current financial conditions.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the news conference, Chang Ming-daw, head of the FSC's banking
bureau, said that the government's revenue from business tax and the Central
Deposit Insurance Corp.'s premiums, totaled about NT$24.5 billion a year, will
be sufficient to bail out any banks that might default.</P>
      <P>Earlier on Tuesday at a legislative interpellation session, Premier Liu Chao-
shiuan announced the full guarantee for deposits in Taiwan's banking system and
urged citizens not to be too pessimistic about the current financial climate.</P>
      <P>He noted that confidence is important and that the government "will protect the
people's assets" by guaranteeing all deposits at domestic banks.</P>
      <P>Liu further said that the government will strictly supervise domestic  banks to
make sure that they meet capital adequacy requirements.</P>
      <P>He also called for depositors to "trust the government" and for "everyone to
work together to get through this difficult situation."</P>

      <P>Taichung City Council Speaker Chang Hung-nien, suspected of influence peddling
on behalf of pachinko parlor operators, was released Wednesday on bail of NT$5
million (US$153,000) instead of being detained as prosecutors had urged.</P>
      <P>The Taichung District Court rejected a request by prosecutors early Wednesday
morning to detain Chang, after he was questioned overnight on allegations that
he received NT$20 million to help pachinko parlor owners get business licenses.</P>
      <P>The court stipulated, however, that Chang is not allowed to change his residence
or leave the country.</P>
      <P>Chang claimed his innocence after being set free on bail, denying that he used
his influence to help pachinko operators acquire operating permits.</P>
      <P>Chang contended that he was only "concerned" about the matter because the
government had imposed "very strict" restrictions on issuing licenses for such
gaming businesses.</P>
      <P>The council speaker insisted that he had not accepted any "illegal money" from
pachinko operators to get business licenses from relevant authorities and
claimed that the pachinko business owner involved in the case was simply a
friend of nearly 20 years.</P>
      <P>The Taichung city councilor and several his aides were summoned by prosecutors
Tuesday for questioning over the allegations.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors then asked the local district court for approval to detain Chang
because of the seriousness of the case and to prevent him from tampering with
evidence, but their request was denied.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH defends rejection of heavy-ion cancer therapy project</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's level of cancer treatment has kept pace with other countries and will
remain among the leaders with proton radiation therapy, Taiwan's health chief
said Wednesday, after the Department of Health (DOH) nixed a private
foundation's plan to introduce heavy-ion therapy to Taiwan last month.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan can already be considered among the leading countries (in the area of
cancer treatment), " said DOH Minister Yeh Ching-chuan at a committee hearing in
the Legislative  Yuan,  when asked by legislators if Taiwan was in immediate
need of the heavy-ion therapy to cure cancer.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that at present, proton radiation therapy is more proven than heavy-ion
therapy, and noted that Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Gou donated NT$15 billion
last year to National Taiwan University Hospital to build Taiwan's first proton
therapy center.</P>
      <P>The questions were raised after Evergreen Group Chairman Chang Yung-fa angrily
denounced the DOH Monday for rejecting his private foundation's proposal to
build a cancer center equipped with a heavy-ion treatment facility.</P>
      <P>Dissatisfied with the government's response, Chang said his foundation had
abandoned the project and that he would dismiss the team responsible for making
related preparations.</P>
      <P>Advocates of the relatively untested heavy-ion radiotherapy believe it is more
effective at killing tumors than proton therapy while damaging less healthy
tissue in the process.</P>
      <P>The DOH refused to approve the NT$6-10 billion project, however, because it
considered the high radiation heavy-ion therapy dangerous and insisted that it
first pass human clinical tests.</P>
      <P>Shih Chung-liang, director of the DOH Bureau of Medical Affairs, also said that
clinical tests could only be conducted in conjunction with a teaching hospital,
and thus the foundation was not eligible to introduce the equipment on its own.</P>
      <P>Suggesting  that Chang's foundation could cooperate with a teaching hospital,
Yeh stressed that he was willing to communicate with the foundation and help
realize the project.</P>
      <P>He added that studies and proof of the safety and curative powers of the
technology should be presented before it is introduced to Taiwan. If there is
insufficient evidence or its efficacy varies with different ethnic groups, human
tests are needed to verify its safety.</P>
      <P>There are currently only three heavy-ion treatment facilities in the world --
two in Japan and one in Germany -- while 29 proton treatment facilities are
functioning in 13 countries in the world, according to the DOH.</P>
      <P>Cancer ranks first among causes of death in Taiwan for about two decades. It
claimed more than 40,000 lives last year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Election Commission (KEC) promised Wednesday to increase the
number of polling booths from the originally planned 145 to 203 for an upcoming
referendum on reducing class sizes at elementary and junior high schools in the
southern port city.</P>
      <P>The referendum, to be held Nov. 15 on cutting class sizes from 35 to 25
students, is the first city-wide referendum to be staged since the amendment of
the country's Referendum Act.</P>
      <P>Chen Bao-te, deputy secretary-general of the KEC, made the promise to increase
the number of polling booths in response to a petition filed that same day
during a rally by more than 100 teachers led by Kaohsiung Teachers' Association
(KTA) President Yu Chu-cheng.</P>
      <P>The teachers held the rally to express their concerns about the fact that the
low number of polling booths could affect voter turnout.</P>
      <P>Cheng Ming-shan,  a member of the association's  board of directors, said the
city government was "acting out of tune" with the wishes of the people, noting
that more than 57,470 residents of the city had signed the petition on applying
to hold the referendum.</P>
      <P>Several city councilors joined the teachers in the rally to give their moral
support and express the hope that the referendum will be passed for the sake of
improving the quality of the city's education system.</P>
      <P>Chen said the KEC will announce the locations of the additional polling stations
by Oct. 20 and that the total cost of the operation is estimated at about
NT$11.5 million.</P>
      <P>The KTA has been holding large-scale campaigns recently to drum up support for
the referendum, although many city officials have been arguing against it,
pointing out that the government will have to shell out an additional NT$32
million per year for extra teaching staff and classrooms if the referendum is
passed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has to build up a brand image for its fruit and establish connections
with big distributors in China to market its produce in an orderly and stable
way, Council of Agriculture (COA) Minister Chen Wu-hsiung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen was addressing concerns by legislators at a legislative committee meeting
about Taiwanese fruit and flower exports to the world.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers urged the government to formulate a quality agriculture
development statute to help fruit and flower exports and enhance
competitiveness. For instance, they said, Taiwan should upgrade competitive edge
in butterfly orchid trade as the Netherlands' output is twice that of Taiwan and
its production value is three times Taiwan's.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said exporting fruit to China has been listed as a goal of the
council for next year.</P>
      <P>"The COA will work toward anything that is beneficial to farmers or will help
tap the market," he added.</P>
      <P>He noted that the first thing needed is to establish an image for Taiwanese
fruit, which must be marked with quality assurance labels to differentiate them
from fruit from China or other countries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also needs to establish connections  with "big and credible"
distributors, he added.</P>
      <P>On Chinese visitors buying fruit in Taiwan, Chen said that the policy of "taking
orders in Taiwan and making deliveries in China" remains unchanged and that the
sites for taking orders will be increased in addition to one near the Sun Moon
Lake in central Taiwan, one of the biggest attractions for Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>The COA has also initially planned to set up delivery sites in Beijing and
Shanghai, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chiu Ching-chun of the ruling Kuomintang suggested that the COA set
up fruit parlors in rest areas along the freeways, and treat Chinese tourists to
Taiwanese fruit in hotel rooms.</P>
      <P>On the sidelines of the committee meeting, meanwhile, Chen said Taiwan and China
will donate animals to each other as a "reciprocal" gesture.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks came one day after Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Chiang Pin-kung said China and Taiwan will donate animals to each other,
suggesting that long-awaited Chinese pandas will come to Taiwan soon.</P>
      <P>Chen said the "mutual donation is a reciprocal gesture, " adding that Taiwan
will also present animals listed under the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES) to China. Taiwan has previously donated animals to
both China and Japan.</P>
      <P>As for the exporting and importing references on the documents, Chen said this
will be decided by the Mainland Affairs Council, the nation's highest China
policy coordinating agency.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is poised to stage a large
demonstration against China in late October or early November when a high-
ranking Beijing official is slated to come for a visit, a party spokesman said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The DPP will stage a large-scale protest against China to express the people's
strong desire to protect and underline Taiwan's independent sovereignty around
the time when Chen Yunlin, president of the semi-official Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), visits Taiwan," DPP spokesman Cheng
Wen-tsang told a news conference.</P>
      <P>Chen serves as China's top negotiator with Taiwan in the absence of government-
to-government contacts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The DPP has set October as "a month of civic activities" and will organize a
series of events to highlight its cause, he noted, adding that the party will
keep a close watch on the government to see how it responds while Chen is
visiting.</P>
      <P>Cheng accused President Ma Ying-jeou  of falling short of safeguarding  Taiwan's
independent sovereignty  in the face of continued suppression by China and said
DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen will not attend the Oct. 10 National Day
celebrations held by the Presidential Office if Ma fails to "correct" his
rhetoric concerning Taiwan-China relations.</P>
      <P>Ma recently described cross-Taiwan Strait ties as "not links between two
states."</P>
      <P>"It is pointless to celebrate the Oct. 10 National Day should Taiwan's popularly
elected president not dare to recognize that the country is an independent
sovereignty. In such a case, how the president could build up the people's
fidelity to the nation, " Cheng said.</P>
      <P>This is why Tsai has urged Ma to uphold a firm stance toward China regarding
Taiwan's sovereign status, he said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's exports dropped 1.6 percent year-on-year to US$21.85 billion in
September, the first negative growth since April 2002, due to falling demand
from major trade partners amid the global economic volatility, the Ministry of
Finance reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>While the value of exports declined, that of imports grew 10.4 percent to
US$21.04 billion during the same period, registering a trade surplus of US$810
million, according to customs statistics released by the ministry.</P>
      <P>Lin Lee-jen, director of the ministry's statistics department, attributed the
drop in exports to the impact of the U.S. financial crisis and weaker global
demand for electronic  and machinery products, as well as plastic raw materials.</P>
      <P>Shipments to China and Hong Kong, the main destinations of Taiwan's exports, in
September plunged 16.3 percent year-on-year, the first drop since January 2002,
Lin noted, adding that this is the main reason for Taiwan's lackluster
performance in exports in September.</P>
      <P>A 4.4 percent decline in exports in the same month to six Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member countries - Singapore, Malaysia,
Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam - also took a toll on Taiwan's
exports, Lin added.</P>
      <P>In response, the Bureau of Foreign Trade suggested that the government should
intensify marketing and promotional efforts to boost shipments.</P>
      <P>The value of exports for the first nine months of this year totaled US$204.48
billion, a 14.5 percent growth year-on-year, while that of imports was US$196.01
billion, an increase of 21.6 percent over the same period last year, the
statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The figures translated into a trade surplus of US$8.47 billion for the first
nine months, very close to the goal of US$10 billion originally set for the
whole year, said the bureau under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The bureau added that despite the global economic slowdown, the goal is expected
to be achieved thanks to a high amount of export orders received  by traditional
industries,  such as textile, petrochemcial and machinery industries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI)  show that the cross-
border  marriage rate has significantly declined in the past four years, a
result of a stricter immigration  interview  system  implemented  by  the
National Immigration Agency, a ministry official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the MOI, the cross-border marriage rate had climbed from 15.69
percent in 1998 to 31.86 percent by 2003, and thereafter declined to 18.29
percent last year, when 24,700 Taiwanese married foreign spouses, of which
14,721 were from China.</P>
      <P>"The considerable  reduction  results  from the immigration interview system
implemented in late 2003 in an effort to prevent fraudulent marriages, " said an
MOI official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>The Immigration Agency began to conduct immigration interviews for Chinese
spouses applying for entry permits in order to prevent them from using bogus
marriages as a ruse to gain entry to Taiwan to work or engage in other illegal
activities.</P>
      <P>For spouses from other countries, the system was implemented in 2005 and is
carried out by Taiwan's representative offices in the respective countries.</P>
      <P>"When  marriage  brokerage  companies  are prohibited  from introducing foreign
spouses to Taiwan, the number will probably decrease even further," he went on.</P>
      <P>The official was referring to an amendment of the Immigration Law approved by
the Legislative Yuan in late 2007 stipulating that only non-profit
organizations, rather than commercial businesses, can provide marriage broker
services.</P>
      <P>The regulation is expected to go into effect by the end of 2008.</P>
      <P>MOI data shows that 399,000 foreigners were married to Taiwanese people as of
the end of 2007, including 262,000 from China, accounting for 65.76 percent of

13rd, respectively.</P>
      <P>Of the three major sub-indexes - basic requirements, efficiency enhancers, and
innovation and sophistication factors - Taiwan scored 20th, 18th and 8th places,
respectively.</P>
      <P>In terms of education and innovation, Taiwan is doing relatively well, according
to the report.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has high enrollment rates at all levels, and the educational system gets
good marks for quality," said the WEF, adding that "companies provide a high
level of continuing on-the-job training, ensuring that the workforce can adapt
to the rapidly changing economy."</P>
      <P>In terms of innovations, the report said, Taiwan has a large pool of scientists
and engineers, and it benefits from high company spending on R&amp;D and strong
collaboration between research institutes and the business sector.</P>
      <P>The report indicated that Taiwan led the world on "utility patents" and "state
of cluster development" and ranked 4th on "tertiary enrollment."</P>
      <P>But the WEF said that Taiwan's financial markets "represent a comparative
weakness", and expressed concerns about the "soundness of banks (ranked 117th)
and the restriction of capital flows (78th)." It added that public institutions
could be further strengthened.</P>
      <P>Of the 12 "pillar indexes, " financial market sophistication, ranked  58th  and
is the  weakest  link  in Taiwan's  total competitiveness, while its 7th
position in innovation is the island's strongest performance.</P>
      <P>The United States tops the overall ranking and Switzerland is in second place
followed by Denmark, Sweden and Singapore.</P>
      <P>The global competitiveness rankings are calculated from both publicly available
data and the Executive Opinion Survey,  a comprehensive annual survey conducted
by the WEF together with its network of partner institutes. This year, over
12,000 business leaders were polled in a record 134 global economies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Health officials in Taipei have examined 39 Nestle and Klim milk powder products
and found that 16 of them contained tiny amounts of melamine -- a harmful
industrial chemical that has caused a global food safety scare -- the Taipei
city government's department of health announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Nestle, which also produces Klim milk power, is one of the leading brands of
infant and adult milk products in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiang Yu-mei, head of the department, said the 16 products were found to
contain 0.123 parts per million (ppm) to 2.02 ppm of melamine, and that these
products must be removed from the city's store shelves.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, the 16 products included the six certified by the Cabinet-
level Department of Health on Oct. 2 as containing small amounts of melamine.
Among the six products that had already been removed from Taiwan's store shelves
were Klim Instant Full Cream Milk Powder and the Neslac Growing Up series,
produced in China's Heilongjiang province.</P>
      <P>The other 10 products included two Klim Superkid milk powder brands --
respectively for children who are 3 to 5 years old and children who are 6 or
older -- two types of Klim milk powder for people aged 50 or over, Nestle Neslac
Gold 1+ Growing Up Milk Powder, Neslac Gold 3+ Growing Up Milk Powder, and two
products in the Nespray series.</P>
      <P>All these milk powder products were produced by Shuangcheng Nestle Co. in
Heilonjiang province.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has adopted a zero tolerance standard for melamine content in food
products, although its newly imported test equipment can only detect melamine
levels as low as 0.05 ppm.</P>
      <P>Nestle milk products were previously declared as safe because the equipment
employed to test them was less sensitive.</P>

      <P>Sophie Hong, a noted Taiwanese fashion designer, is exhibiting her latest
creations at the Atmosphere d'Ete fashion show in Paris.</P>
      <P>The Oct.5-8 Atmosphere d'Ete show mainly features women's ready-to-wear and
accessories collections.</P>
      <P>Jean-Pierre Mocho, president of the French Women's Ready-to-Wear Federation, and
Republic of China Representative to France Michel C. L. Lu visited Hong's booth
at the show Monday.</P>
      <P>Mocho, in conversation with Lu, said that more of Taiwan's skilled fashion
designers should participate in international fashion shows to promote their
work.</P>
      <P>Mocho said that he really likes Hong's creations because they exhibit the
designer's ability to make clothing so amazing that few Western designers can
match her creative use of fabric and design patterns.</P>
      <P>"That is why I have invited Hong every year for the past 12 years to take part
in the fashion show," Mocho said.</P>
      <P>Hong's creations for this year feature a modern collection in a range of colors
that include peacock green and they incorporate elements of art and lifestyle in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hong expressed hope that the ROC government can do more to recommend outstanding
fashion designers to participate in fashion shows in Europe so that Europeans
can learn more about Taiwan's culture and fashion industry.</P>
      <P>Born in Taiwan, Hong in 1997 entered the Taipei-based Shih Chien College -- a
higher education institution famous for its department of fashion design. She
later went on to study at the Fashion and Creation Department of Dunka Fashion
College in Tokyo, Japan.</P>
      <P>Hong, one of Taiwan's top fashion designers, has designed costumes for choirs,
theater groups and dance companies. Her designs have been displayed at the Musee
Galliera de la Mode et du Costume -- a well-known fashion museum in Paris.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Penghu faces challenge of preserving old temples</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 8 (CNA)
10/08/08  20:55:24
(By Kao Mao-hsiung &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The island county of Penghu boasts more than 200 temples that serve as a source
of comfort for the island residents who make their living on the seas.</P>
      <P>While the 127-sq-km  county,  consisted  of 90 islets off southwestern Taiwan,
has the highest concentration of temples in all of Taiwan, most of them are old
or have been destroyed because the residents pay scant attention to the
preservation of historic relics, conservationists said.</P>
      <P>Wang Kuo-yu, a county official responsible for museum affairs, said Wednesday
that Penghu residents believe that the bigger and more ostentatious  the
temple,  the greater  the honor  for their neighborhood.</P>
      <P>With this attitude, the residents have often moved to tear down an old temple in
order to build a new and bigger one, Wang said. Some construction  contractors,
in their own interests,  have also encouraged and persuaded temple owners to
embark on restoration or reconstruction work.</P>
      <P>As a result, many valuable historical temples have simply vanished, Wang
lamented.</P>
      <P>Over the years, many of Penghu's temples that were old but not old enough to be
categorized as national historic heritage sites, have undergone renovation --
with disastrous results, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Recalling the most notorious example -- the reconstruction of the "Chou Wang
Temple" in Makong City in 2001 -- Wang said it was heartbreaking to see an
excavator tearing down and destroying most of precious folk art by famous
Taiwanese ceramic figurine master Wang Pao-yuan and painter Pan Li-shuei.</P>
      <P>"I risked my life to save a few pieces of the masters' works," he said.</P>
      <P>Wang Wen-liang, a Penghu resident who specializes in history and culture,
recalled that in Penghu, only two temples -- the Chou Wang Temple and Yung An
Temple -- owned Wang Pao-yuan's works, most of which were destroyed during the
renovation of the temples.</P>
      <P>Wang Wen-liang said that temple architecture in Taiwan flourished in the 1960s
and 1970s. Many famous artists in different disciplines were invited at the time
to help build temples around the country.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, he went on, local governments cannot apply for nation heritage
protection for those temples because they are not old enough.</P>
      <P>A 2007 documentary film by director Tzeng Chi-hsien featured the life and art of
Wang Pao-yuan, 79, who has been involved in the construction of many temples in
southern Taiwan over the past six decades.</P>
      <P>In the Shichuan district in suburban Makong, Chen Fu-chi, a native folk artist
devoted to the preservation of old temples, has drawn criticism because of the
means he chose to rescue some works of art and artistic aspects of dismantled
temples.</P>
      <P>Chen used the pillars and doors of old temples to built a tea house named "Chun
Chiao" and decorated the wooden building with ceramic figurines and other small
objects from dismantled temples.</P>
      <P>Critics accused Chen of having destroyed the antiques rather than attempting to
preserve them.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen explained that he had stored the collections in a warehouse,
but given his limited financial resources, he was unable to properly protect
them and some of them rotted or were damaged by insects.</P>
      <P>He has no choice but use the antiques "in a pragmatic manner, " Chen said in an
interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>"If I did not use them to build the Chun Chiao Tea House, there would be nothing
to see now," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gov't to imprint agricultural, fishery equipment to prevent theft</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In view of the high rate of theft of agricultural and fishery equipment in the
first eight months of this year, the government is considering adopting an
imprint method to help prevent stealing, an official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yung-fong, chief secretary of the Government Information Office, said that
to reduce the theft rate, Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi has come up with a
method patterned on the hot stamping of motorcycles.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Interior Ministry has reached an agreement with the Council of
Agriculture (COA) on the matter, and the imprinting of equipment will be
launched in major agricultural counties on a trial basis and later expanded to
other areas.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after Premier Liu Chao-shiuan presided over a meeting at
which National Police Agency (NPA) Director-General Wang Cho-chun reported on
social law and order.</P>
      <P>According to Wang's report, in the first eight months of this year, the number
of criminal cases, violent crimes and burglaries dropped from the same period
last year, while the rate of solving such crimes increased, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Overall, social law and order was improving, but the theft of agricultural and
fishery equipment was markedly increasing, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>NPA statistics showed that in the first eight months of the year, the number of
reported thefts of agricultural and fishery equipment was 1,096 -- an increase
of 428 cases, or 64 percent, from the same period last year.</P>
      <P>This practice is most prevalent in the counties of Changhua, Pingtung,
Kaohsiung, Taichung and Yunlin, according to the NPA.</P>
      <P>Wang explained that due to the soaring price of metal worldwide, small electric
devices and machinery have become attractive to thieves.</P>
      <P>Moreover, most of the equipment is usually located in isolated areas such as
fields, mountainous regions and along the seashore, which makes it easy for them
to be stolen, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Immigration Agency (NIA) recently cracked down on a Taiwanese human
trafficking ring that was smuggling children from China into the United States
on Taiwan passports purchased from Taiwanese parents.</P>
      <P>The NIA's Border Affairs Corps said in a statement Wednesday that information
provided by the U.S. showed that the illegal Chinese immigrants who were
arrested in the case had U.S. visas in passports supplied by a Taiwanese human
trafficking ring, which was headed by a man surnamed Lin.</P>
      <P>In its investigation, the agency discovered that the crime ring had bought the
identity of Taiwanese children from parents who were in financial straits.</P>
      <P>Using the Taiwan IDs, the human traffickers acquired Republic of China passports
by means of a legal loophole that allows a representative to apply for a Taiwan
passport and a U.S. visa for Taiwan citizens under the age of 14.</P>
      <P>The statement said that 20 Taiwan citizens, including 10 parents from the
greater Kaohsiung area in southern Taiwan, were found to have provided IDs to
the human trafficking ring.</P>
      <P>The parents sold their children's IDs at a price of NT$90,000 (US$2,780) each,
the agency said.</P>
      <P>The investigators further found that the crime ring employed the strategy seven
times in the first half of this year to smuggle 18 children into the U.S.</P>
      <P>The agency said it was the largest human trafficking ring it had ever busted.</P>
      <P>It said it has taken action to fix the loophole, and it urged local parents not
to risk their children's future for small sums of money.</P>

      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen and high-
ranking party officials hailed coffee produced in Yunlin County Wednesday and
urged the public to buy local products  amid a public scare over tainted Chinese
foodstuff.</P>
      <P>Tsai and members of the DPP's decision-making Central Standing Committee (CSC)
each drank a cup of coffee produced in the county's Gukeng township at a news
conference ahead of a weekly CSC meeting, in a gesture to help promote local
foodstuffs after China-made milk powder and non-dairy creamers sold in Taiwan
were found to contain melamine -- a toxic chemical used by Chinese milk
producers to give falsely high protein levels in tests.</P>
      <P>The DPP chairwoman urged the public to buy locally made products "for the sake
of Taiwan's economic development, " as consumer spending has rapidly stagnated
over the melamine scandal.</P>
      <P>Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair, one of the party's CSC members, also gave a
"thumbs-up" to Gukeng coffee.</P>
      <P>Gukeng township in Yunlin County in central-southern Taiwan is one of the very
few places in the country where coffee is grown commercially.</P>
      <P>Yunlin County Magistrate Su Chih-fen praised the Gukeng coffee as the world's
safest because samples of 45 local coffee brands sent by Yunlin makers for lab
examinations all tested melamine-free.</P>
      <P>"The 45 companies voluntarily removed their coffee from store shelves and sent
their products to be examined after questionable milk powder from China was
first detected in Taiwan Sept. 25, " said Su.</P>
      <P>According to a spokesman for a Yunlin resort tourism association, local
companies had always used coffee creamer imported from Holland and New Zealand
until last year, when they began importing cheaper products from China to cut
production costs.</P>
      <P>"Yunlin coffee companies have sustained combined losses of more than NT$10
million  (about US$300,000)  in recent weeks after widespread fear over melamine

      <P>The Taipei Prosecutors Office indicted an Indonesian domestic worker Wednesday
on charges of causing injury, after she allegedly poisoned the family of her
employer with mercury.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Chang An-chen said the worker, known by the name Sukini, is currently
being held at a detention center in Hsinchu, northern Taiwan, pending a trial.</P>
      <P>The alleged victims -- Chang, his wife, and their two children -- are recovering
after being treated in hospital and having the heavy metal residues removed from
their bodies, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors said Sukini was employed with the Chang family in the Sungshan
district, Taipei City, between June 2006 and March 2007.</P>
      <P>Possibly due to discontent, Sukini allegedly broke several thermometers and put
the mercury into the family's food.</P>
      <P>Chang and his wife later developed symptoms that included hair loss,  mouth
ulcers and impairment of vision, which are all indicative of mercury poisoning,
the prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>The two children in the family, aged 3 and 5, were constantly falling because
they lacked physical coordination, the prosecutors added. It was found that the
mercury concentration in their bodies was respectively 10.42 times and 23.33
times the normal level.</P>
      <P>After Sukini ran away from the family, Chang's wife found several broken mercury
thermometers in the house, which led her to suspect that the family had been
poisoned, and she sought medical treatment, the prosecutors disclosed.</P>
      <P>Although Sukini denied any wrongdoing, the prosecutors, based on the fact that
she was employed in the Chang home and on the evidence of the broken
thermometers, indicted her on charges of causing injury.</P>

      <P>A hypermart chain store in the southern port city of Kaohsiung has seen its
sales triple since it established an exclusive "made-in-Taiwan foodstuff"
retailing zone earlier this month amid a melamine scare, market sources said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Dollar hypermart's Mintsu store cooperated with the Kaohsiung city
government to create the special zone for the exclusive sale of Taiwan-made
foodstuffs after reports of imports of a shipment of melamine-adulterated milk
powder from China caused panic among local consumers.</P>
      <P>With consumers' confidence undermined by Chinese food suppliers' unscrupulous
business practices, foodstuff sales at local stores were being seriously
affected, according to market sources.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government then offered to help food retailers set up special
zones for melamine-free made-in-Taiwan foodstuffs. Store operators are required
to produce documents showing that none of their food ingredients came from China
and to send samples of their products for food safety testing.</P>
      <P>The Dollar hypernmart's Mintsu store was the first to respond to the city
government's call for cooperation in setting up an exclusive Taiwan foodstuff
zone to more easily attract health-conscious consumers.</P>
      <P>The store sent 60-plus items for testing and more than 30 proved to be melamine-
free. Since the melamine-free products were put on sale in the special "made-in-
Taiwan foodstuff" zone, sales of those products have increased threefold on
average, a store spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Many other supermarket and hypermarket chains and bakeries in the city are
expected to follow suit in the near future, a city official said.</P>
      <P>Melamine, a nitrogen-rich chemical used to make plastics and fertilizers, has
been widely used in China to spike watered-down milk to mask the resulting
protein deficiency and fool quality tests.</P>
      <P>Melamine contamination of baby formula has been blamed for the deaths of at
least four infants and kidney illnesses in more than 53,000 children in China.</P>
      <P>A shipment of 25 tons of milk powder imported into Taiwan from China earlier
this year has also caused a stir in the local food market and led to the
resignation of Lin Fang-yue as DOH minister late last month.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen and high-
ranking party officials hailed coffee produced in Yunlin County Wednesday and
urged the public to buy local products  amid a public scare over tainted Chinese
foodstuff.</P>
      <P>Tsai and members of the DPP's decision-making Central Standing Committee (CSC)
each drank a cup of coffee produced in the county's Gukeng township at a news
conference ahead of a weekly CSC meeting, in a gesture to help promote local
foodstuffs after China-made milk powder and non-dairy creamers sold in Taiwan
were found to contain melamine -- a toxic chemical used by Chinese milk
producers to give falsely high protein levels in tests.</P>
      <P>The DPP chairwoman urged the public to buy locally made products "for the sake
of Taiwan's economic development, " as consumer spending has rapidly stagnated
over the melamine scandal.</P>
      <P>Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair, one of the party's CSC members, also gave a
"thumbs-up" to Gukeng coffee.</P>
      <P>Gukeng township in Yunlin County in central-southern Taiwan is one of the very
few places in the country where coffee is grown commercially.</P>
      <P>Yunlin County Magistrate Su Chih-fen praised the Gukeng coffee as the world's
safest because samples of 45 local coffee brands sent by Yunlin makers for lab
examinations all tested melamine-free.</P>
      <P>"The 45 companies voluntarily removed their coffee from store shelves and sent
their products to be examined after questionable milk powder from China was
first detected in Taiwan Sept. 25, " said Su.</P>
      <P>According to a spokesman for a Yunlin resort tourism association, local
companies had always used coffee creamer imported from Holland and New Zealand
until last year, when they began importing cheaper products from China to cut
production costs.</P>
      <P>"Yunlin coffee companies have sustained combined losses of more than NT$10
million  (about US$300,000)  in recent weeks after widespread fear over melamine
broke out among Taiwanese consumers, " the spokesman pointed out.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutors Office indicted an Indonesian domestic worker Wednesday
on charges of causing injury, after she allegedly poisoned the family of her
employer with mercury.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Chang An-chen said the worker, known by the name Sukini, is currently
being held at a detention center in Hsinchu, northern Taiwan, pending a trial.</P>
      <P>The alleged victims -- Chang, his wife, and their two children -- are recovering
after being treated in hospital and having the heavy metal residues removed from
their bodies, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors said Sukini was employed with the Chang family in the Sungshan
district, Taipei City, between June 2006 and March 2007.</P>
      <P>Possibly due to discontent, Sukini allegedly broke several thermometers and put
the mercury into the family's food.</P>
      <P>Chang and his wife later developed symptoms that included hair loss,  mouth
ulcers and impairment of vision, which are all indicative of mercury poisoning,
the prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>The two children in the family, aged 3 and 5, were constantly falling because
they lacked physical coordination, the prosecutors added. It was found that the
mercury concentration in their bodies was respectively 10.42 times and 23.33
times the normal level.</P>
      <P>After Sukini ran away from the family, Chang's wife found several broken mercury
thermometers in the house, which led her to suspect that the family had been
poisoned, and she sought medical treatment, the prosecutors disclosed.</P>
      <P>Although Sukini denied any wrongdoing, the prosecutors, based on the fact that
she was employed in the Chang home and on the evidence of the broken
thermometers, indicted her on charges of causing injury.</P>

      <P>Hotel rooms in the Hualien area are fully booked for the period Oct. 10 through
12 -- the three-day weekend that begins with the Double Ten National Day on
Friday -- hotel owners said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>They noted that even private tourist accommodations in the city and county of
Hualien are fully booked for the weekend, mainly because many people from around
Taiwan want to attend the Double Ten gala night, to be held Friday at Hualien
Stadium, and go sightseeing during the two following days.</P>
      <P>The hotel owners said that the influx of visitors has caused one inconvenience
-- all train tickets to and from Hualien between Oct. 10 and 12 have been sold
out, leaving many of their guests without transportation means to go to Hualien
or return home on Oct. 12.</P>
      <P>Entry to the Double Ten festivities is free, with the public allowed to enter
the stadium from 4: 30 p.m. The lineup of performers includes television
entertainment program hosts, well-known singers and dancers.</P>
      <P>The aboriginal  tribes in Hualien will also present their traditional dancing
and singing at the event. The gala night will culminate with a fireworks display

      <P>Kaohsiung, Oct. 8 (CNA) A hypermart chain store in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung has seen its sales triple since it established an exclusive "made-in-
Taiwan foodstuff" retailing zone earlier this month amid a melamine scare,
market sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Dollar hypermart's Mintsu store cooperated with the Kaohsiung city
government to create the special zone for the exclusive sale of Taiwan-made
foodstuffs after reports of imports of a shipment of melamine-adulterated milk
powder from China caused panic among local consumers.</P>
      <P>With consumers' confidence undermined by Chinese food suppliers' unscrupulous
business practices, foodstuff sales at local stores were being seriously
affected, according to market sources.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government then offered to help food retailers set up special
zones for melamine-free made-in-Taiwan foodstuffs. Store operators are required
to produce documents showing that none of their food ingredients came from China
and to send samples of their products for food safety testing.</P>
      <P>The Dollar hypernmart's Mintsu store was the first to respond to the city
government's call for cooperation in setting up an exclusive Taiwan foodstuff
zone to more easily attract health-conscious consumers.</P>
      <P>The store sent 60-plus items for testing and more than 30 proved to be melamine-
free. Since the melamine-free products were put on sale in the special "made-in-
Taiwan foodstuff" zone, sales of those products have increased threefold on
average, a store spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Many other supermarket and hypermarket chains and bakeries in the city are
expected to follow suit in the near future, a city official said.</P>
      <P>Melamine, a nitrogen-rich chemical used to make plastics and fertilizers, has
been widely used in China to spike watered-down milk to mask the resulting
protein deficiency and fool quality tests.</P>
      <P>Melamine contamination of baby formula has been blamed for the deaths of at
least four infants and kidney illnesses in more than 53,000 children in China.</P>
      <P>A shipment of 25 tons of milk powder imported into Taiwan from China earlier
this year has also caused a stir in the local food market and led to the
resignation of Lin Fang-yue as DOH minister late last month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's central bank cuts key interest rates</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9 (CNA)
10/09/08  12:18:27

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of the Republic of China (CBC) announced Thursday an emergency
measure to cut the country's key interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, in
reaction to the International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) call for coordinated
policies by economies worldwide to help reverse the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>The step is the second of its kind in two weeks, after the rates were reduced by
0.125 percentage points on Sept. 25.</P>
      <P>The latest reduction marked the discount rate further down to 3.25 percent, the
rate on accommodations with collateral to 3.625 percent and the rate on
accommodations without collateral to 5.50 percent.</P>
      <P>CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan said while weakening overseas demand led to negative
growth in Taiwan's exports in September, the ongoing global financial crisis is
undermining consumption and investment among Taiwanese, raising the risk of
slower economic growth in the country.</P>
      <P>Following the relief of inflationary pressure thanks to the fall in oil and
commodities prices in recent months, the cut in key interest rates is expected
to help stimulate domestic demand to push the country's economic growth, Perng
said.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday,  the IMF warned that the world economy  is experiencing a major
downturn in the face of "the most dangerous financial shock in mature markets
since the 1930s."</P>
      <P>The IMF's latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) projects global growth to slow
substantially in the latter part of 2008, revising the projected growth rate
downward to 3.9 percent for the year.</P>
      <P>The WEO has forecast that growth in advanced countries will be close to zero
until at least mid-2009, while growth in emerging and developing countries will
slow to substantially lower rates than in the recent past.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, growth is likely to reach 3.8 percent in 2008 and drop to 2.5 percent
in 2009, according to the WEO.</P>
      <P>In an effort to boost confidence in the world financial system, major central
banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of England, European Central
Bank, Bank of Canada, Bank of Sweden, and Swiss  National  Bank,  cut their  key
interest  rates  by a half-percentage point Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the People's Bank of China dropped its key interest rates by 0.27
percentage points.</P>

      <P>U.S. Senator and Democratic presidential candidate  Barack Obama said Wednesday
he welcomes  the Bush administration's decision to notify Congress of a package
of weapon systems for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued by his national security spokesperson Wendy Morigi,  Obama
said he looks forward to fully reviewing  the notifications and the accompanying
justification of the Department of Defense.</P>
      <P>"This package represents an important response to Taiwan's defense needs. This
action is fully consistent with U.S. obligations under the Taiwan Relations
Act," Obama said.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon's Defense Cooperation Security Agency on Oct. 3 notified Congress
that it had approved the sale of a package of weapons to Taiwan, including 30
Apache attack helicopters, 330 advanced capability Patriot (PAC-3) missiles, 32
Harpoon sub-launched missiles, 182 guided Javelin missile rounds, and four E-2T
system upgrades.</P>
      <P>The move drew strong protest from China, which has suspended military-to-
military exchanges and nonproliferation talks with the United States.</P>
      <P>Expressing  regret over China's  decision,  Obama said the discussions should be
resumed because they are in the interest of both sides.</P>
      <P>Obama said he strongly supports the reduction of tensions between China and
Taiwan and he commended Chinese President Hu Jintao and Taiwan's President Ma
Ying-jeou for their efforts in that regard.</P>
      <P>"A strengthening of Taiwan's defenses will not undermine the process of
reduction of tensions and can actually promote it, " the statement read.</P>
      <P>Obama's statement came one day after his Republican opponent, Senator John
McCain, said that U.S. White House did not go far enough when it agreed to the
items in the arms package.</P>
      <P>"The package will not include submarines or new F-16 aircraft, McCain said. "I
urge the administration to reconsider this decision, in light of its previous
commitment to provide submarines and America's previous sales of F-16s."</P>
      <P>Also in his statement, McCain said the U.S. government should continue to sell
defensive weapons to Taiwan in the future and stand by the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>"American interests in Asia are well-served through faithful implementation of
the Taiwan Relations Act, and if I am fortunate enough to be elected president,
I will continue the longstanding and close ties between our peoples," McCain
said.</P>

Thursday which would allow children who have been sexually or physically abused

disapproval rating of 37.9 percent in the same poll.</P>
      <P>Legislator Liao Cheng-ching of the ruling Kuomintang asked Jiang to analyze the
reasons for the decline in Ma's approval ratings in recent media polls.</P>
      <P>Jiang said the polls are based on political assessment rather than scientific
analysis, but he admitted that the president's sliding approval rating is
closely linked to media criticism of gaffes and policy flip-flops by ranking
government officials, as well as to lack of clear explanations or strong defense
of government policies, and poor communication with the legislature and the
media.</P>
      <P>Jiang also said that President Ma's campaign promises "will not vanish into thin
air, " and that the commission will keep track of their progress. If the
government "cannot deliver on Ma's campaign platform, we will have to explain
why to the voters," he added.</P>
      <P>"In mid-October, the respective government agencies will submit progress reports
on their implementation of the president's campaign promises in his first three
months in office," Jiang said.</P>

      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Cabinet-level Department of
Health announced Thursday an imported case of dengue fever that was reported to
the CDC by the patient himself.</P>
      <P>The man came down with fever and joint and muscle pain soon after his return
from a trip to Vietnam on Oct. 3, according to CDC Deputy Director-General Lin
Ting.</P>
      <P>Suspecting that he may have contracted dengue fever, the man informed the CDC of
his symptoms through the CDC's online self-notification system on Oct. 7 and
tests confirmed his suspicions were true, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The man will be awarded NT$2,500 as part of the center's measures to encourage
individuals to report their disease cases to the center, which helps prevent the
spread of diseases, the CDC said.</P>
      <P>CDC statistics show that 375 cases of dengue fever have been recorded in Taiwan
so far this year, 209 of which are indigenous cases and 166 are imported cases.</P>
      <P>Of the total 375 cases, 185 have occurred since the start of summer, according
to the CDC.</P>
      <P>Dengue is transmitted by the bites of mosquitoes infected with the dengue
viruses, according to the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>Symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and bleeding. The disease is
potentially deadly, affecting mainly children, who have weaker immune systems.
Early diagnosis increases the survival of patients, the WHO said.</P>
      <P>To prevent transmission of the disease, people are urged to clear sources that
help breed mosquitoes, such as standing water, including uncovered buckets or
drains.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA sees no easing of diplomats visa restrictions in Venezuela</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 9 (CNA)
10/09/08  18:21:55
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that it sees no signs of
Venezuela easing its restrictions on Taiwanese diplomats' visas, but will
continue to communicate with the Venezuelan government to find a solution.</P>
      <P>Diego Chou, sub-director-general of MOFAs Department of South American Affairs,
made the remarks at a regular press briefing in response to reporters'
inquiries.</P>
      <P>Chou indicated that the visa restrictions announced last year might have been a
gesture by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who is known for his anti-U.S.
attitude, to show solidarity with China.</P>
      <P>Venezuela not only canceled the 90-day visa-on-arrival for Republic of China
passport holders last March as part of Chavez's scheme to strengthenone China
policy, " the South American country also keeps shortening  the courtesy visa
status for Taiwans officials stationed there, Chou said.</P>
      <P>According to the Foreign Ministry, officials of the ministry, the Government
Information Office and the Ministry of Economic Affairs posted in Caracas have
to renew their visa every two to three months, whereas their visas used to be
valid for the duration of their stay.</P>
      <P>The Venezuelan government has also imposed a lot of restrictions on the
activities of the Taiwan representative office in Caracas, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>Of course this serves as an indicator -- an indication of their unfriendly
gesture toward us,Chou said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the Foreign Ministry is still trying to communicate with the
Venezuelan government on the basis of Taiwan's intention to strengthen economic,
trade and cultural relations with the country, despite the absence of diplomatic
ties, Chou added.</P>
      <P>Asked if there is a possibility  that Taiwans officials stationed in Venezuela
might be expelled, Chou said:I believe they will not go that far.</P>
      <P>It is not that they cannot do so, but I guess he (Chavez) does not think it is
necessary, given the fact that Taiwan and Venezuela have many substantial
relations, he said, citing as an example cooperation in oil fields.</P>
      <P>According to a senior official of the MOFA who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, the ministry is trying to communicate with the Venezuelan government
on the visa issue since relations between Taiwan and China have been improving
after President Ma Ying-jeou took office.</P>
      <P>The official stressed that the Venezuelan government should take notice of
Masmodus vivendidiplomatic strategy and realize that cross-Taiwan Strait
relations are now much more reconciliatory.</P>
      <P>Ma has been touting amodus vivendidiplomatic strategy to seek more international
space for Taiwan and to end the longstanding diplomatic tug-of-war with China
for allies. Under this approach, Taiwan will focus on consolidating diplomatic
relations with its few existing allies while continuing to build relations with
other countries with which it does not have formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>In March 2007, Venezuela repealed a 90-day visa exemption for Taiwanese tourists
and in June 2007, the Venezuelan government decided not to renew visas for five
members of Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Caracas. The MOFA reached an
agreement with the Venezuelan government in July this year in order to avoid the
closure of the Taiwanese representative office there.</P>
      <P>However, travel to Venezuela remains difficult since a visa is required to go to
the South American country, especially as Venezuela has no representative office
in Taiwan. All applications have to be translated into Spanish and be notarized
by both Taiwans and Venezuelas representative offices in Hong Kong before being
handled by the Venezuelan government.</P>

      <P>Articles highlighting the beauty of Taiwan by a Japanese graduate student
studying at I-Shou University in the southern county of Kaohsiung have drawn
great attention among a number of Japanese readers after they were posted on the
Website of an overseas Japanese reporters club.</P>
      <P>Since moving to Taiwan with her husband 10 years ago, Meiko Fukuoka,  a
freelance  writer and a graduate  student of the university's Institute of
Applied Japanese, has written numerous articles online describing what she saw
and heard in the country.</P>
      <P>Her online stories have made a splash in the Japanese community and have also
become the main source of topics for Japanese journalists reporting on Taiwan.
Due to her writings' popularity, Fukuoka has been hired by several Japanese
magazines to write stories introducing Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Japanese writer said she has fallen in love with Taiwan since she and her
family moved here 10 years ago when her husband, a construction engineer was
dispatched to the island for work.</P>
      <P>Fukuoka said that unlike people in other countries, Taiwanese people are very
friendly to foreigners and quite conversable. They are not xenophobic, she
added, but happy to help people from other countries.</P>
      <P>In her view,  Fukuoka said,  Taiwan's people attach great importance to
communication among family members and value the virtue of filial piety and the
concept of respect for the elders.</P>
      <P>Citing the homegrown blockbuster "Cape No. 7", Fukuoka said it was a rare
experience for her to see Taiwan's youngsters and senior citizens jointly stage
a performance and share music together as shown in the film, a scene she said is
not common at all in Japan's society.</P>
      <P>As she has been working to cover news events and write stories based on various
topics as requested by various Japanese journals, Fukuoka said she has had
tremendous opportunities to get a better understanding of various aspects of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"From the perspective of a Japanese, it is interesting to see many things in
Taiwan, " Fukuoka added, citing as an example an interview with indigenous
people in Shandimen in Pingtung County, southern Taiwan during which she was
impressed by their passion and easy-going attitude, and fascinated by their
daily appliances which are splendid, rich in color, and full of aboriginal folk
style.</P>
      <P>Other things worthy of mention  in Taiwan are delicacies, aboriginal dance and
festivals, Fukuoka added.</P>
      <P>Fukuoka currently lives in Taipei City and commutes between the city and
Kaohsiung County to study every week.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is committed to attracting more tourists from neighboring countries,
apart from China, and in particular Japan and South Korea, Minister of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) Mao Chi-kuo said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The number of tourist arrivals from Japan, South Korea and other Asian
countries has grown this year by more than 20 percent, " Mao said, in response
to questions by lawmakers of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on the government's tourism expansion efforts
during a legislative committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan in July established direct cross-strait weekend passenger
charter flights and opened its doors wider to more Chinese tourists, the
economic effect of the two measures has been limited, as the number of Chinese
traveling to Taiwan remains low, the lawmakers said.</P>
      <P>"The government is aiming not just at the Chinese market, but is also eyeing
other markets like Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and other Southeast Asian
countries, " Mao said. The government has spent over NT$100 million (US$3
million) in tourism promotion campaigns to court visitors from Japan and South
Korea, he disclosed.</P>
      <P>He expressed confidence that the number of Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan
would also increase rapidly in the future.</P>
      <P>Touching on the issue of Taiwan and China considering straighter routes for
nonstop charter flights between the two sides, he asserted that the Ministry of
National Defense strongly supports the relevant plans put forward by the MOTC.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Mao stressed that safeguarding Taiwan's national security and
dignity is the highest priority in the negotiations with China on bilateral
transportation links.</P>
      <P>The transportation minister told a legislative session Monday that Taiwan and
China have reached a high degree of consensus on the projection of new flight
routes and that relevant details would be finalized in the two-way talks slated
for late October or early November in Taipei.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan urged to watch out for pink eye disease</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>People in Taiwan were urged Thursday to be on the alert for a possible  outbreak
of acute  hemorrhagic conjunctivitis -- commonly known as pink eye disease --
which in recent months has hit nearby Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Given that the number of reported cases of pink eye disease in Hong Kong has
risen this year by five folds of that recorded in the area last year, Taiwan's
doctors have expressed concern that people in Taiwan, particularly school
children, could also be affected this season.</P>
      <P>Wei Li-chen, an ophthalmologist with central Taiwan's Taichung Veterans General
Hospital, said the island witnessed an outbreak of pink eye disease last
October, with school children and junior high school students from Taipei,
Yunlin and Chiayi areas being affected the most.</P>
      <P>As her clinic has received increased cases of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis
in recent days, Wei advised those who have not been infected with the disease to
avoid sharing towels, hand-to-eye contact, and eye medicine, and to wash their
hands thoroughly before and after contact with their eyes.</P>
      <P>For those who have already been infected, Wei suggested that they avoid shaking
hands with other people and students should temporarily stop going to school to
avoid spreading the disease to their classmates.</P>
      <P>Conjunctivitis is caused by an infection or inflammation of the mucous membrane
that lines the inner surface of the eyelid and exposed surface of the eyeball.
Pink eye usually is brought about by either bacterial, viral, or numerous
allergic factors.</P>
      <P>Although pink eye is not a serious eye disease, the bacterial causes need to be
treated because the symptoms do not go away without proper treatment and this
variant of conjunctivitis can be passed on to other people just by coming into
contact with the contaminated items.</P>
      <P>Conjunctivitis usually looks bad on first diagnosis as the eye can turn bright
red, but the worst part is usually the irritation and itchiness.</P>
      <P>Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is characterized by a sudden onset of painful,
swollen, red eyes, with hemorrhaging of the conjunctiva, and excessive tearing.
Cases of the disease have been detected throughout tropical regions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet on Thursday approved a draft law on indoor air quality management
and will submit to the legislature the bill, which if passed into law could
require businesses and public facilities to improve the air people breathe.</P>
      <P>Chiau Wen-yan, deputy minister of the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) , told a press conference that most people in Taiwan spend
about 90 percent of their time indoors every day, and that the air quality in an
indoor environment has a direct effect on people's health.</P>
      <P>After the bill becomes law, titled the Indoor Air Quality Management Act,
several central government departments will be authorized to publicize indoor
air quality standards based on consideration of the volume of people in a given
environment and the health risks involved, Chiau said.</P>
      <P>Indoor environments include office buildings, schools, hospitals, factories,
banks, movie theaters, department stores, hypermarkets, restaurants, railway
stations and transportation vehicles, including aircraft, boats and buses, Chiau
said.</P>
      <P>After the draft bill becomes law, it will not be enforced until one year later.
First offenders will not be penalized, but will be given a warning and a time
period to correct the problems. Those who fail to do so could be fined between
NT$50,000 and NT$250,000 (US$7,727).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the EPA's Environmental Analysis Laboratory and National Cheng Kung
University's Department of Medical Technology have developed a new biochip that
can simultaneously detect up to 10 kinds of airborne disease-causing
microorganisms, including four kinds of dangerous fungi:  Aspergillus
versicolor,  Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, and Stachybotrys
chartarum.</P>
      <P>This technological innovation can shorten the time required to test air quality
from one month to just a few days.</P>
      <P>According to EPA officials, once the legislature passes the legislation, this
technology will be ready for use immediately.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Germany-based Bayer Group has decided to invest more than US$5 million over
the next three years to establish two new research and development centers in
Taiwan, its Taiwan operations announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>One of the centers will focus on the R&amp;D and industrial application of
functional films, which are widely used in the areas of flexible electronics and
printed electronics, said Bayer Taiwan's President Steffan Huber.</P>
      <P>Huber said that the center will be fully operational by the end of 2009 and that
Bayer is expected  to funnel 900,000 euros (UD$123,800) annually into the
operation during its first three years.</P>
      <P>According to Bayer Taiwan, the center will also seek to expand cooperation with
local universities in an effort to upgrade its R&amp;D capabilities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huber said, the other center will concentrate on the application of
thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)  in sports and recreational products.</P>
      <P>In 2007, Bayer relocated its TPU headquarters from Germany to Hong Kong and
merged with Taiwan Ure-tech Co. -- the largest TPU supplier in Asia-Pacific
region -- to become the largest TPU supplier in the world.</P>
      <P>With another TPU R&amp;D center in Taiwan, company officials said, the group
will have a better chance of maintaining its edge in the region.</P>
      <P>Huber told the CNA that he is optimistic about Taiwan's business environment. If
direct sea and air links across the Taiwan Strait can be realized, the
industrial players surely will be able to further reduce time and costs in
maintaining their operations, he said.</P>
      <P>Based on its experience of operating in Taiwan for 50 years, Bayer Taiwan urged
the government to set up a "single window" -- a one-stop service -- for
multinational companies, so that potential foreign investors can more easily
enter the Taiwan market.</P>

estimated economic growth of 5.08 percent for next year will be revised amid the
global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Yiin made the remarks when questioned by legislators of a legislative committee
about the impact of the world financial crisis on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Legislator  Chang  Hwa-kuan  of the  opposition  Democratic Progressive Party
accused Premier Liu Chao-shiuan's Cabinet of "making up the figures to cheat the

      <P>"The Cabinet needs to know where the problems are before it can solve them, "
Chang said, urging the government "to come up with the right economic measures
to tackle the problems."</P>
      <P>Rebutting  Chang's  accusation,  Yiin pointed out that the government set the
figure before the financial crisis exploded and said the figure will be adjusted
downward.</P>
      <P>He also said that while the global economy is not in good shape and some
developed countries might not see economic growth, the emerging economies could
still see growth, citing China as an example in that it might still be able to
maintain growth of about 8 percent.</P>
      <P>He admitted, however, that Taiwan still has to work hard to overcome the
challenges.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ching-hua of the ruling Kuomintang asked Yiin how long the hard

      <P>The Executive Yuan will give priority to the establishment of a Ministry of
Culture and Tourism, or will at least complete its organic legislation by May 20
next year, along with that of another five government units in the coming four
years, as the first phase of a plan to streamline the government administration,
an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The reform plan, proposed by the former administration, was also part of
President Ma Ying-jeou's campaign platform when he was running for president in
the March election, according to Jiang Yi-huah,  chairman of the Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission.</P>
      <P>To better cope with contemporary social changes, the government plans to
restructure its executive branch by cutting the number of agencies under the
Executive Yuan from 39 to 26, which would include 14 ministries,  seven
councils,  and another  five independent organizations.</P>
      <P>Besides the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, five other units to be established
in the first phase of the plan are: the agriculture ministry, marine affairs
ministry, environmental resources ministry, social welfare ministry, and gender
equality commission.</P>
      <P>Jiang said the plan's preparation committee, consisting of government officials
and experts in management, decided at a meeting Wednesday that the plan will be
carried out in different phases.</P>
      <P>The meeting was convened by Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung, Jiang added.</P>
      <P>More measures will be discussed in future meetings of the joint committee,
including the number of government personnel which each of the new government
units will have, Jiang said.</P>
      <P>He added that the joint committee will hold a meeting every month as the initial
reform requires  intensive  coordination  among government organizations.</P>
      <P>To strive for faster legislation, Jiang's commission will propose a draft
amendment to allow the administrative overhaul to happen, Jiang said.</P>
      <P>He said the new amendment will not be very different from the previous one, and

      <P>Five cities and counties in northern Taiwan launched a carpooling system
Thursday in an effort to reduce pollution and improve traffic congestion.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei, Taoyuan Magistrate
Eric Liluan Chu, Yilan Magistrate Lu Kuo-hua and Keelung Mayor Chang Tung-jung
presided over the formal launch ceremony for the network -- the first of its
kind in Taiwan -- at the Taipei county government headquarters.</P>
      <P>The five local government chiefs urged the public to take part in the carpooling
system through http://intranet.tpepb.gov.tw/carpool.</P>
      <P>The idea of setting up the carpool was initiated by the Taipei county magistrate
and received the support of the other four local government chiefs.</P>
      <P>Although the system is mainly aimed at commuters in the greater Taipei area,
residents from the rest of the country are welcome to use the network, with 671
routes and 19 stops for pick-ups and drop-offs.</P>
      <P>Nearly 70 routes have been established since the network began operating in late
August, and the organizers have estimated that some 26,400 liters of gasoline
could be saved and 57,200 kg of carbon dioxide emissions could be cut each year
thanks to the practice.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, 2,863 people have become members of the carpool network.</P>
      <P>Hau said Taipei City will benefit the most from the carpool system because it
has 1.8 million registered vehicles, including around 650,000 private cars and a
large number of motorcycles -- causing serious pollution.</P>
      <P>Chu for his part noted that more than 10,000 school children in the Taoyuan area

the Tourism Bureau will stick to its plan to help attract some 4 million
tourists this year.</P>
      <P>"We will strive to achieve that goal whatever it takes," Lai said during a
ceremony held at the ministry, where the winners of a "most tourist-friendly
cities and counties in Taiwan" competition were cited and awarded.</P>
      <P>Lai said the 3 millionth tourist this year is likely to arrive Oct. 14.</P>
      <P>The eastern county of Hualien won the championship in the category of natural
environment as it is home to the Taroko Gorge National Park, an impressive 19-km
canyon of marble and granite, and is situated on the east coast facing the
Pacific Ocean nestled among mountains as high as 3,800 meters.</P>
      <P>The capital city of Taipei was the champion in the category of humanities and
history as it is home to National Palace Museum -- which is considered the
world's leading museum of ancient Chinese artifacts.</P>
      <P>Both Hualien County and Taipei City were awarded cash prizes of NT$600,000
(US$18,519).</P>
      <P>The southern county of Chiayi, home to the famous Alishan, and the central
landlocked county of Nantou, which is the location of the beautiful Sun Moon
Lake, were placed second and third, respectively, in the natural environment
category.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Island and the central county of Changhua won the second and third places
in the category of humanities and history -- with the historic Chukuang Building
and the Lukang historic site, respectively.</P>
      <P>Some cities and counties were rated as "unfriendly to tourists" because of
factors ranging from jumbled, disordered, unprofessional shop layouts and
unclear road signs to unhandled garbage, disordered parking lots and sloppily
dressed shopkeepers and store clerks, according to the judges of the
competition, which was sponsored by the Tourism Bureau and Global View Magazine.</P>

      <P>The National Palace Museum (NPM) is working to obtain a piece of land in the
suburbs of Taipei City to build an incubation center for the cultural and
creative industry in Taiwan, according to museum curator Chou Kung-shin.</P>
      <P>Chou made the announcement during a tea party to mark the 83rd founding
anniversary of the museum -- a classical Chinese imperial court-like complex
established in the city's Shihlin district in 1964.</P>
      <P>The NPM now boasts more than 654,500 works of art, featuring the world's best
collection  of Chinese historical  artifacts  and antiquities, including books,
documents, paintings, ceramics and calligraphy. The museum, with a main
exhibition gallery that covers 15,118.2 square meters, is one of the country's
chief attractions for tourists.</P>
      <P>The museum management intends to acquire a 5.4 hectare plot of idle land,
formerly occupied by a sanitary service school affiliated to the Ministry of
National Defense, for the purpose of establishing an innovation and incubation
center for the cultural and creative industry in Taiwan, Chou said.</P>
      <P>The land, which is now jointly owned by the National Security Bureau and the
Taipei city government, is located near the NPM.</P>
      <P>The museum's aspiration  to build the center is aimed at developing cultural and
creative design talent, Chou said.</P>
      <P>Exchange exhibitions on innovative works by local and foreign gurus from
cultural and creative industries around the world will be held at the center
when it is completed, Chou said. It will also host a series of lectures by
masters on their unique creative design experiences.</P>
      <P>The NPM, which plans to make the center a flagship dedicated to boosting the
visibility  of Taiwan's creative products in the international community, will
also do its utmost to develop the center as a hub for creative industries
worldwide, according to Chou.</P>
      <P>The center will be a modern garden complex with a multifunctional architectural
structure that features aspects of classical Chinese style, Chou said, adding
that it will include underground parking lots, restaurants, coffee shops, tea

    <HEADLINE>Special forces retirees in battle of a different sort</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/09/08  21:45:42</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of retired Army Air Special Services Commando members will climb a
mountain in eastern Taiwan Friday to use their highly trained military skills in
a different kind of battle - ridding the island's precious mountains of garbage.</P>
      <P>As part of a project that began in 2005, the former soldiers -with an average
age of around 50, will carry not guns, but digging tools and garbage bags, with
their enemy being waste littered by mountain climbers and tourists in the
precipitous mountain.</P>
      <P>About 20 members of the Special Air Services Commandos Retiree Association and
several other soldiers serving in the same special services, will climb Cilai
Mountain in Taiwan's scenic Taroko National Park in Hualien County for a three-
day clean up mission.</P>
      <P>The mountain, also called "Black Cilai, " is located within the northern section
of the Central Mountain Range's main ridge and is the source of the Jhuoshuei
River that flows over central and southern Taiwan and the Liwu River that passes
through eastern Taiwan to the sea.</P>
      <P>A big name among Taiwan's mountain climbers, Cilai is well known for beautiful
mountain  views that come from its magnificent topography constituted by the
undulating contours of the Central Mountain Range and the two rivers.</P>
      <P>Statistics by the Taroko National Park Administration Center showed 3,971
climbers visited the mountain last year and since January, more than 2,000
people have stepped foot on the mountain.</P>
      <P>The retired special forces members will go up by the mountain's main ridge at
the north, starting from Cilai's entrance at the Songhseu Lodge, which is 3,200
meters above sea level. They will march toward the direction of the Cilai North
Peak at 3,560 meters above sea level.</P>
      <P>All participants, including the oldest who is 64 years old, have to meet certain
requirements for this mission, such as experience in climbing Cilai and spending
nights in high mountains, according to mission coordinator Huang Hsi-jung.</P>
      <P>To prepare for the journey, the retirees, who are volunteers, practiced jogging
at 5,000-meter stretches, mountain hiking carrying gears weighing 20 kg for 8
kilometers, and bike riding for 30 kilometers every week.</P>
      <P>They also meet regularly at Yushan Forward Peak for group training, taking
advantage of that mountain's similar geology with Cilai Mountain's, according to
Huang.</P>
      <P>Many people have joined mountain clean-up activities and have contributed a lot
to improving the mountain's environment, but only the special forces retirees
can reach the most difficult and least visited areas, according to the national
park administration center.</P>
      <P>The group will be divided into three teams, with one team consisting of seven
members with the best skills trying to climb as far as they can to remove
garbage in the most dangerous areas.</P>
      <P>A 10-member team will collect garbage along the crest line.</P>
      <P>Another 11 members will travel among different sites to carry the garbage out of
the mountain, Huang said, emphasizing that the waste has to be carried by labor,
instead of by machines, due to the mountain's special topography.</P>
      <P>The most difficult part of the climb is an up-slope which has a 400-meter gap of
height on the return trip near the mountain's entrance, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Most climbers find it difficult to finish that section after two days' difficult
climb, thus some of them would dump their stuff there, turning a valley down the
slope into what looks almost like a garbage landfill, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang believes the park administration center's efforts to raise public
awareness about the need to keep the mountain clean, has reduced the amount of
garbage dumped by climbers.</P>
      <P>"I have to say that we have seen less and less newly added garbage each time we
visit the mountain, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>The association launches a garbage pick-up mission to the mountain twice a year.
The last clean-up drive was carried out in the same place in April.</P>
      <P>They also helped clean up other mountains like Hehuan Mountain and Jade
Mountain, the highest mountain in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In previous campaigns, they found all kinds of garbage on mountains, such as PE
bottles, plastic bags, food leftovers, and climbing tools like steel bars and
batteries that can cause heavy metal contamination, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The team spent five months preparing for this mission. But even with good
preparation and confidence gained from continuos training, whether  they will
succeed  remains unknown,  because  of the hard-to-predict weather.</P>
      <P>Changeable weather, as well as unexpected river runoffs and steep drops in the
mountain areas pose threat to the participants, despite good preparations and
optimistic views about garbage volume.</P>
      <P>Directions of dried stream paths on sunny days in the mountain areas could be
altered as water runoffs come out after heavy rains, which could force climbers
to find alternative paths in unfamiliar territory, according to the Taroko
National Park Administration Center.</P>
      <P>"Loss of body temperature often happens after rains in the mountain, " said
coordinator Huang, who has many years of experience climbing the mountain.</P>
      <P>In order to have better control and more correct forecast of the weather, a
section chief of the Central Weather Bureau involved in weather radar monitoring
will join the team to ensure their safety.</P>
      <P>"Tornado, " the section chief's nickname on the campaign's online forum, is also
a retiree from the Special Forces. He said the weather for the next three days
in the Cilai mountain area will be fine.</P>
      <P>But he added that the possibility for rain still exist.</P>
      <P>Even Tornado is not sure how the mission will turn out.</P>
      <P>"We don't know how far we can reach and how much we can do this time. We'll just
try to do our best," he said.</P>

      <P>She said that since early September, civil rights groups have received more than

      <P>The Banciao District Court in Taipei County granted a request by public

game rigging.</P>
      <P>The six detainees are Wu Chao-hui, coach of the T-Rex baseball team owned by the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) called on air carriers to think of
the feelings of their passengers lest they "lose big by focusing on trivial
things."</P>
      <P>CAA Director-General Lee Lung-wen made the remarks amid reports that China
Airlines (CAL), the nation's biggest airliner, is planning to charge an extra
NT$500 from Oct. 16 for passengers who choose front row or aisle seats.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that only CAL is planning to charge the extra fees while other
carriers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude.</P>
      <P>He reminded those who plan to charge extra fees that while they might be able to
rake in between NT$3 million and NT$5 million a month, they must not overlook
the fury of passengers, which could cause them to actually lose more than they
make.</P>
      <P>Lee said that civil aviation law and related regulations do not ban airlines
from charging extra money and that the CAA will "respect the approach of each
air carrier and will only ask them to report to the CAA on the method and
content of the extra charges to the passengers."</P>
      <P>Lee said that with the era of high fuel prices and the increasingly unfavorable
environment faced by the aviation industry, domestic and foreign carriers have
adopted various ways to cope with the difficulties.</P>
      <P>He noted that these contingency measures include charging extra money for more
than one luggage, or even charging passengers who ask for a blanket on long-haul
fights.</P>
      <P>Carriers might someday even stop supplying food during long-haul flights, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>If the plight of carriers worsens further, the "user pays" method might become
more of a trend, he added.</P>

dmedia Corp.; Kuo Teh-chih, spokesman for the team; and four members of a
gambling ring headed by Lin Bin-wen, who is also the head of the group that owns
the team.</P>
      <P>The Banciao Public Prosecutors Office pointed out that their offenses are
related to fraud, breach of trust and organized crime and that it was necessary
to detain them to prevent them from colluding among themselves.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecutors, Lin and Wu would give instructions to the pitcher
and the other players on how to play in order to produce game results according
to their plans, so that the ring could net huge winnings from their bets.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, prosecutors raided 22 locations linked to the suspects and took
them in for questioning.</P>
      <P>The dmedia T-Rex team was formerly called the Macoto Cobras, but was renamed in
February this year after being bought by dmedia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAL urged to `consider feelings' of air passengers</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 9 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) called on air carriers to think of
the feelings of their passengers lest they "lose big by focusing on trivial
things."</P>
      <P>CAA Director-General Lee Lung-wen made the remarks amid reports that China
Airlines (CAL), the nation's biggest airliner, is planning to charge an extra
NT$500 from Oct. 16 for passengers who choose front row or aisle seats.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that only CAL is planning to charge the extra fees while other
carriers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude.</P>
      <P>He reminded those who plan to charge extra fees that while they might be able to
rake in between NT$3 million and NT$5 million a month, they must not overlook
the fury of passengers, which could cause them to actually lose more than they
make.</P>
      <P>Lee said that civil aviation law and related regulations do not ban airlines
from charging extra money and that the CAA will "respect the approach of each
air carrier and will only ask them to report to the CAA on the method and
content of the extra charges to the passengers."</P>
      <P>Lee said that with the era of high fuel prices and the increasingly unfavorable
environment faced by the aviation industry, domestic and foreign carriers have
adopted various ways to cope with the difficulties.</P>
      <P>He noted that these contingency measures include charging extra money for more
than one luggage, or even charging passengers who ask for a blanket on long-haul
fights.</P>
      <P>Carriers might someday even stop supplying food during long-haul flights, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>If the plight of carriers worsens further, the "user pays" method might become
more of a trend, he added.</P>

      <P>A 17-member Chinese tour group from Shanghai experienced high-quality health
checkups in Taipei Thursday and many of its members praised local medical
personnel service attitudes and professionalism.</P>
      <P>The tour group was organized by Cathay Financial Group's Shanghai operations and
the quasi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council as part of the
government's efforts to promote medical tourism.</P>
      <P>Members are mostly Cathay Group's life insurance policy buyers, with ages
ranging between 30 and 60. Two of them are operators of medical institutions in
China and many of them are senior executives of private corporations in the
Shanghai area.</P>
      <P>Tseng Hsiao-chi, a section chief in charge of health management at Cathay
General Hospital, a Cathay Group affiliate, said the Cathay Life Insurance's
Shanghai operation hopes the success of the group's trip will serve as a
catalyst to attract more Chinese citizens to come to Taiwan for sightseeing and
health checkups.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, many of the tour group members told hospital staff that they
had undergone similar checkups, including heart and cancer examinations, in
Shanghai and found that Shanghai's facilities are generally on a par with those
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"However, they said Taipei excels in terms of heath check procedural
arrangements, service attitudes and overall levels of medical attention," Tseng
said.</P>
      <P>Each of the tour group members paid NT$20,000 for their checkup, according to

    <HEADLINE>President Ma Ying-jeou's National Day address</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 10 (CNA)
10/10/08  12:48:49</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is the full text of President Ma Ying-jeou's National Day address.</P>
      <P>Vice President Siew, Presidents of the Five Yuans, Ministers, Distinguished
Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen: Good morning!</P>
      <P>Today, the 97th National Day of the Republic of China, we celebrate the founding
of our nation with joyful hearts. At the same time, we must also be prepared to
resolutely face the formidable challenges posed by global economic events and
set long-term goals for our nation's development. Only then can we fashion a
vision for our future.</P>
      <P>Over the past 97 years, our nation has undergone many severe trials. We have
traversed an era of national partition, have been buffeted by the whirlwinds of
two world wars, and have suffered pain and hardship during the Chinese Civil
War. On Taiwan, however, we have steadfastly upheld the ideals of our nation's
founding father, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, engaging in democratic reform at every
governmental level nationwide. In March of this year, Taiwan accomplished its
second change of government, enabling our democracy to evolve in the direction
of greater maturity and stability.  Intolerance  for corruption and insistence
on clean government have become our common values. The country has become not
only a model for democracy in Asia, but also a beacon of democracy for Chinese
people everywhere. This is the historic achievement of all of the 23 million
people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since taking office in May, this administration has been keenly aware of the
desire of our citizenry for good governance. Four months on, gaps yet remain
between measures adopted and the expectations of our people. To fulfill their
hopes, we must remain humble and engage in self-reflection, while continuing to
expedite reform, enhance competitiveness, revitalize the economy, and rebuild
confidence.</P>
      <P>First of all, we need to come to grips with the fact that Taiwan is now facing
unprecedented  economic challenges.  The current financial crisis is one of
those that, in the words of former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
comes once in a century. In this age of globalization, it is impossible for
Taiwan to avoid coming under its influence. To help the private sector get
through these difficult times, this government is exploring all possible
avenues.</P>
      <P>After taking office, this administration immediately launched programs to
stimulate the economy through boosting domestic demand, assisting low-income
groups, and other approaches. We have also taken forceful measures to conserve
energy and reduce carbon-dioxide emissions. In the span of just these few
months, our fuel consumption has fallen by one-fifth. More crucial, however, is
the imperative to carry out forward-looking, long-term reform.</P>
      <P>Just as past oil crises presented Taiwan with opportunities for transformation
and development, so too must we meet today's global challenges by initiating
large-scale infrastructure projects and revamping our industries to buttress our
national strength and reinvent our economy. In response to global changes, we
have adopted apolicy of liberalization and deregulation, whereby people and
capital can flow into and out of the country more freely, and enterprises can
deploy around the globe more boldly.</P>
      <P>Concerning basic infrastructure, this government aims to invest vigorously in
construction projects that will improve Taiwan's living environment. These
include working on river engineering projects, rebuilding roads and bridges,
integrating public transportation networks, and rejuvenating local industries.
These and other projects are clearly outlined in the "i-Taiwan 12 Projects." We
will invest an increasing amount of resources to complete these projects in
stages so as to lay a solid foundation for the next cycle of robust economic
development.</P>
      <P>With regard to reinventing our economy, this government will create a sound
investment environment for the private sector. Besides the construction of
essential infrastructure, this entails the creation of mechanisms for
cultivating talents and the introduction of government policies to encourage
private-sector development. We will support the transformation of certain key
types of enterprises such as those concerned  with conserving  energy and
reducing carbon-dioxide  emissions,  those in the cultural and creative
industries, high-tech businesses, the biotechnology industry, and the tourism
sector. The government will also strive to revitalize traditional industries by
providing them with resources and services in a timely manner.</P>
      <P>These efforts to spur transformation and long-term development cannot produce
results overnight. Yet, just like the Ten Major Construction Projects of three
decades ago that laid the groundwork for Taiwan's "economic miracle, " this
administration's policy direction and vision are crystal clear: building a
future for generations to come and laying a solid foundation for Taiwan's
prosperity in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>The new administration has taken heed of the public's grievance over corruption
in the past. We not only will be law-abiding, but also will hold ourselves to a
higher standard, in order to restore the core values of incorruptibility,
integrity,  honesty, and trustworthiness. Already, we have begun to implement a
set of Code of Ethics for Civil Servants to strictly regulate public servants'
conduct with respect to social gatherings and the giving and receiving of gifts.
To ensure the proper functioning of the five branches of the central government
in accordance with the ROC Constitution, after this administration took office,
it quickly reactivated the operations of the Control Yuan, thus enabling this
independent organ to once again exercise its oversight mandate.</P>
      <P>To safeguard social justice and take care of disadvantaged families, this
government has implemented the annuitized labor pension system, which covers 8.8
million workers. Further, a number of other programs have either been launched
or are in the works, such as the national pension system; a program to benefit
low-income people; a plan to work with community and charity groups to help the
disadvantaged; benefits for first-time home buyers; support for people who
cannot afford National Health Insurance premiums; and the expanded subsidization
of lunches for schoolchildren. In short, this government is determined to take
care of all socially disadvantaged groups and make Taiwan a beautiful home in
which everybody can enjoy security, stability, and peace of mind.</P>
      <P>Concerning relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the Straits
Exchange Foundation and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
have resumed consultations on the basis of the "1992 Consensus" after a hiatus
of ten years. Our efforts to alleviate cross-strait confrontation, create a new
dynamic for peace, and enhance stability in East Asia have won the international
community' s affirmation. Holding fast to the principle of "putting Taiwan first
for the benefit of the people, " and guided by a policy of liberalization and
deregulation, we have pushed forward with direct cross-strait charter flights,
visits by tour groups from mainland  China,  expansion  of  the  "mini-three-
links, " and encouragement of Taiwan's businesspeople overseas to list their
companies on Taiwan's stock markets. The aim of these initiatives is to create
a more open,  stable environment  for cross-strait interaction.</P>
      <P>In the realm of foreign relations, we have replaced the previous confrontational
foreign policy style with a diplomacy of the possible as the core of our foreign
policy. Our aim has been to defend the sovereignty of the Republic of China,
strengthen ties with our diplomatic allies, and improve our substantive
relationships with friendly nations-in particular, to re-establish mutual trust
and promote bilateral security cooperation between Taiwan and the United States.
Further, we handled the recent Diaoyutai Archipelago incident in an appropriate
manner, ensuring justice and dignity for the people of Taiwan, while laying a
foundation for nurturing a " special partnership" between Taiwan and Japan. At
the same time, we have gradually developed our foreign relations and
participated with flexibility in more international organizations and
activities, thereby expanding our international  space.  Regarding national
defense, we adhere to the principle of "resolute defense and effective
deterrence." We are working to strengthen our modern defense  capabilities,
move forward with the creation  of an all-volunteer force, reinforce a sense of
honor among our soldiers, and instill in the men and women of our armed forces a
firm faith in the meaningfulness of their service in protection of the nation.</P>
      <P>We have unshakeable confidence in Taiwan. Taiwan's Olympic taekwondo competitor
Su Li-wen is one reason among many. Her persistence enabled her to pick herself
up even after her 11th fall. Courage is what inspired Cape No. 7 movie director
Wei Te-shen to realize his cinematic dream. It is passion that has driven Ming
Hwa Yuan to bring Taiwanese Opera to stages around the world. And then there are
the idealism and creativity of countless other talented people that push them to
strive for a better future for Taiwan. All are manifestations of the
determination and bravery that constitute the " Taiwan Spirit." This spirit is
our most precious asset and the wellspring of our collective strength. We are
blessed with a very industrious, pragmatic people and with dynamic entrepreneurs
eager to do business all over the globe. Our economic fundamentals are strong,
our industrial base solid, our fighting spirit unbreakable. We have confidence
to revitalize our economy and bring prosperity back to Taiwan again.</P>
      <P>The courageous see crises as challenges and opportunities for transformation.
Over its 97-year history, the Republic of China has prevailed against
difficulties much more formidable than the ones we face today, yet here we stand
tall, having created an economic miracle in Asia and established a model
democracy. Today, we find ourselves at a turning point in history. Let us, then,
strive as one, with unbounded courage and wisdom, to meet challenges, ride out
storms, and together ensure better lives for our descendents and peace for all.</P>
      <P>In closing, let me wish our nation great success and prosperity!</P>
      <P>And may all of us be blessed with health, peace, and happiness!</P>
      <P>Thank you!</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou pledged Friday to speed up economic reforms to enhance
Taiwan's competitiveness and rebuild the public's confidence in the country's
economy.</P>
      <P>Raising the issue while presiding over a National Day ceremony at the
Presidential Office, Ma admitted that the policies implemented by his
administration over the past four months since his inauguration have failed to
meet the public's expectations.</P>
      <P>While Ma said his administration will humbly reflect on its failure, he called
the people's attention to the fact that the country is undergoing "unprecedented
economic challenges" as a result of the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>"In this age of globalization, it is impossible for Taiwan to avoid coming under
its influence. To help the private sector get through these difficult times,
this government is exploring all possible avenues," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Despite the difficult situation, the president said, he has "unshakeable
confidence" in Taiwan because the country has a wealth of talent such as Olympic
taekwondo competitor Su Li-wen, Cape No. 7 movie director Wei Te-shen, and
Taiwanese opera impressario Ming Hua Yuan who is passionately bringing Taiwanese
opera to stages around the world.</P>
      <P>"All are manifestations of the determination and bravery that constitute the
`Taiwan Spirit.' This spirit is our most precious asset and the wellspring of
our collective strength, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma said he believes the industrious people of Taiwan, combined with its globally
minded businesses, strong economic fundamentals and solid industrial base, will
together revitalize the country's economy and bring prosperity back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that the world
economy is experiencing a major downturn in the face of "the most dangerous
financial shock in mature markets since the 1930s."</P>
      <P>The IMF's latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) has projected global growth to
slow substantially in the latter part of 2008, revising the projected growth
rate downward to 3.9 percent for the year.</P>
      <P>The WEO has forecast that growth in advanced countries will be close to zero
until at least mid-2009, while growth in emerging and developing countries will
slow to substantially lower rates than in the recent past.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, growth is likely to reach 3.8 percent in 2008 and drop to 2.5 percent
in 2009, according to the WEO.</P>
      <P>Due to a drop in the public's confidence in the economic situation, Taiwan's
stock index has decreased almost by half from 9,068.89 at Ma's inauguration May
20 to 5,130.71 Oct. 9.</P>
      <P>Likewise, Ma's approval rating has also been falling.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the latest survey released Aug. 19 by the Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission, Ma received an approval rating of just 47
percent, with 36.3 percent of the respondents expressing dissatisfaction with
his performance.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that in response to global changes, the
administration has adopted a policy of liberalization and deregulation, while
the government will be given stronger teeth to bolster safety control and crisis
management.</P>
      <P>"While our policies of deregulation and liberalization will remain unchanged,
this government will make every effort to minimize social risks by strengthening
safety controls and crisis-management mechanisms, " Ma said in his speech
delivered to the Double Tenth Day rally in front of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Ma said that in this age of globalization, it is impossible for Taiwan to avoid
coming under its influence.</P>
      <P>"Given the growing interdependence among nations in this era of globalization,
however, crises related to epidemics, pollution, or finance can spread around
the world overnight. The recent global financial troubles and the danger posed
by tainted milk from mainland China are two striking examples of such crises,
which have heightened our vigilance against potential hazards of integrating
ourselves with the rest of the world, including mainland China.</P>
      <P>"This is not to say that we must give up eating simply for fear of choking.
Rather, we should turn crises into opportunities, " he said.</P>
      <P>Invigorating the domestic economy is the administration's top priority, Ma went
on, adding that challenges to the country's economy present golden opportunities
for reform.</P>
      <P>"Currently, we are pressing forward with deregulation in order to expedite
economic growth and we are renovating infrastructure to fortify the constitution
of our economy," he continued.</P>
      <P>"With deregulation, our businesses can bring their competitive advantages into
full play, enabling them to become more firmly rooted in Taiwan, while
integrating with the Asia-Pacific region and deploying worldwide.</P>
      <P>"With comprehensive retooling of infrastructure hardware and software,  our
businesses will have enhanced power to attract investment and talent from all
over the world. Moreover, with our implementation of diverse programs to promote
social security and ensure the welfare of disadvantaged groups, Taiwan's society
will become fairer, more compassionate and more harmonious," he said.</P>
      <P>"To safeguard social justice and take care of disadvantaged families, the
government has implemented the labor pension system and a number of other
programs to take care of all socially disadvantaged groups and make Taiwan a

      <P>During the visit, the two sides will sign deals on regular cross-strait flights
and direct cargo shipments, according to Chiang.</P>
      <P>In response to the news, Chang Sho-wen, secretary-general of the ruling
Kuomintang's (KMT's) legislative caucus, said the planned meeting is part of the
protocol of foreign relations and is "not inappropriate."</P>
      <P>On opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)  plans to mobilize supporters
to stage a protest during Chen's visit, Chang said that "if the DPP wants Taiwan
to be a country, it should not try to obstruct visits by Chinese
representatives."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan should treat Chen with a magnificent welcome based on the principles of
etiquette and should not welcome him with protests and resistance," he added.</P>
      <P>According to KMT Legislator Lin Yu-fang, the planned meeting represents  "a
breakthrough  in  cross-strait  relations"  and demonstrates Ma's self-
confidence in negotiating with China.</P>
      <P>Lin further said he expects cross-strait relations to normalize, adding that
Taiwan "will still have a voice on the international stage in the future."</P>
      <P>Noting that China is Taiwan's largest export market but also its main military
threat, Lin said Taiwan needs to keep lines of communication open with China,
which includes visits to Taiwan by Chinese representatives.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whip William Lai said that the main issue is not Ma's
meeting with Chen during his visit.</P>
      <P>"What the public objects to is that President Ma doesn't dare to insist on his
status as president and doesn't dare to insist that Taiwan is a country," Lai
said.</P>
      <P>He added that the people are opposed to Ma "sacrificing Taiwan's sovereignty and
disregarding the Taiwanese people's rights and interests" in his dealings with
China.</P>
      <P>As for lawmakers of the ruling party, Lai claimed, they have been embellishing
the benefits to Taiwan of cross-strait negotiations and "pretending that all is
going well."</P>
      <P>"They should remember their responsibility to speak on behalf of the Taiwanese
people," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen's visit will be the highest level visit by a Chinese official to Taiwan. It
will also mark the first face-to-face meeting between the heads of the SEF and
ARATS since they signed deals on direct cross-strait weekend charter flights and
a further opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists in a landmark meeting in Beijing
in June this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Improved cross-strait ties cannot be based on wishful thinking: Ma</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that improving cross-Taiwan Strait relations
is the shared aspiration of the people of Taiwan, but he added that the
administration cannot do so based on wishful thinking.</P>
      <P>"In the course of exchanges between Taiwan and China, this administration will
surely uphold the principle of `putting Taiwan first for the benefit of the
people, '" Ma said in a speech delivered in front of the Presidential Office to
mark Double Ten National Day.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's interests cannot be compromised and the dignity of its people must be
staunchly defended," Ma went on.</P>
      <P>He said that under the guidance  of public opinion,  the administration has
sought since it took office May 20 to resume cross-Taiwan Strait dialogue after
a hiatus of 10 years.</P>
      <P>"The resumption has substantially alleviated cross-strait tension and enhanced
stability in East Asia -- efforts that have won the international community' s
affirmation," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma said that while differences still exist between Taiwan and China over
sovereignty issues, "we hope that the two sides can apply wisdom to shelve
disputes and chart courses to steadily extend the political reconciliation
achieved in cross-strait relations to the international arena."</P>
      <P>"We hope to thereby  eliminate  unnecessary  conflict  and confrontation between
the two sides in the international community, and create a mutually beneficial
situation for Taiwan, China and the world community."</P>
      <P>"At the same time, we must maintain a solid national defense so that we can
promote peace across the strait without having our security compromised. Let us
join together to safeguard our country's sovereignty and our precious island
home," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Improving cross-strait relations within the framework of the Constitution and
through a policy of no unification talks with China, no creation of an
independent Taiwan republic and no use of force to settle sovereignty issues is
the shared hope of the people of Taiwan. Doing so, however, cannot be based on
wishful thinking, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, although his administration has been hard at work, the
country's citizenry expects more from the government. "We feel deeply the pain
of our people caused by the economic downturn."</P>
      <P>"This administration will shoulder the responsibility to end suffering for as
long as it exists. We must therefore accelerate the pace of reform and, with
firm commitment, unite our forces as a nation to break through economic
roadblocks," Ma said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NTU, UN-affiliated organization to cooperate on rice research</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) on Thursday became Taiwan's first academic
institution to sign a research cooperation agreement with the International Rice
Research Institute (IRRI) , a partnership aimed at conducting rice-related
research to boost global rice production.</P>
      <P>The agreement, signed by NTU President Lee Si-chen and Robert S. Zeigler, a
representative of the IRRI, comes at a time when global rice stocks are at their
lowest levels in a quarter of a century.</P>
      <P>Many countries in the world have been faced with severe food shortages because
rice production has fallen as a result of global climate change and the
extensive use of land for biofuel production, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The problem is particularly serious, he noted, because rice is the main staple
of more than half the world's population.</P>
      <P>The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization warned in a 2007 report
that with global rice stocks falling to a 25-year low because of global warming,
world rice prices are expected to be high over the next few years.</P>
      <P>The IRRI has also asserted that only if world rice production grows 1.2 percent
annually by 2015 can global rice supply keep up with demand.</P>
      <P>Lee said that NTU, as a leading institute in rice research, is keen to
contribute its knowledge and expertise in developing new rice varieties and
improving rice cultivation skills to help boost world rice yields and address
food shortages.</P>
      <P>Bao-ji Chen, the dean of NTU's College of Bioresources and Agriculture,
indicated that the IRRI began to conduct exchanges with NTU on rice research a
little over a year ago when an exhibition of a new rice species was staged on
the university campus.</P>
      <P>Chen said the IRRI selected NTU as a partner because Taiwan is situated in a
sub-tropical  region that is suitable for rice cultivation, and the grain is the
main staple of the country.</P>
      <P>Under the accord, NTU will serve as an intermediary platform between the IRRI
and Taiwan's Academia Sinica, the Agricultural Research Institute under the
Council of Agriculture, and other academic institutions specializing in rice
research, to help promote bilateral cooperation and exchanges, Chen added.</P>
      <P>The IRRI,  a UN-affiliated  organization dedicated to rice research, has
maintained cooperative relations with many institutions worldwide.</P>
      <P>NTU became the first university in Taiwan to sign a collaborative pact with the
international organization, according to Chen, who expressed hopes that through
the cooperation, Taiwan's achievements in rice research will be presented in the
global arena.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) chairwoman described President
Ma Ying-jeou's National Day speech as a "compilation of previous empty rhetoric,
" saying that what the people wanted were "actions and execution" that could
turn governmental policies into reality.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen made the comment at a summit meeting in Kaohsiung of DPP
administrators of seven cities and counties in southern Taiwan. She did not
participate in the National Day celebration that took place earlier in the day
in front of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>At the Kaohsiung event, Tsai said that although many people focused on whether
she and DPP legislators would attend National Day festivities, she believed the
issue was relatively unimportant.</P>
      <P>The most important issue is "whether President Ma has the ability to rule the
country, whether he is determined to safeguard his own country, and whether he
recognizes Taiwan as an independent sovereign country," she said.</P>
      <P>She argued that people believe the Ma administration, in its pursuit of closer
and more frequent exchanges between Taiwan and China, had gone against the
rising Taiwan-centric consciousness developed throught the considerable efforts
of the previous DPP government, which ran Taiwan from 2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>She also denounced the current government for failing to advocate Taiwan's
sovereignty and accused it of being incompetent and unaware of the people's
suffering.</P>
      <P>Judging from Ma's 2008 National Day speech, Tsai said she thinks the president
is too distant from the people's feeling and reminded Ma that the current "one
China" policy was doing serious harm to Taiwan rather than serving as a magic
cure for its problems.</P>
      <P>Ma admitted in his speech that the policies implemented by his administration
over the past four months since his inauguration May 20 have failed to meet the
public's expectations.</P>
      <P>While saying his administration will humbly reflect on its failure, the
president called the people's attention to the fact that the country is
undergoing "unprecedented economic challenges" as a result of the global
financial crisis.</P>

      <P>Ten Taiwanese senior high school students have recently gained admission to the
preparatory school of France's prestigious "Grandes Ecoles, " the Ministry of
Education (MOE) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The 10 students, including Lo Lun-si from Taipei Municipal Chien Kuo High
School, Lai Yen-ling from National Chiayi High School in southern Taiwan and
Huang Chih-kang from Taichung First High School in central Taiwan, will be able
to attend the two-year "Classes Preparatoires aux Grandes Ecoles" beginning in
early 2009, according to an MOE official.</P>
      <P>The 10 students gained admission after passing an examination sponsored by the
French Ministry of Education to select outstanding senior high school students
from Taiwan for studies  at the preparatory school.</P>
      <P>The French government will fund the two-year tuition for the 10 students while
the MOE will provide them with round-trip plane tickets, the official said.</P>
      <P>If the students gain admission to one of the Grandes Ecoles after they finish
the preparatory courses, 90 percent of their tuition for the three years of
advanced studies will be financed by the French government, the official said.</P>
      <P>They will be awarded with master's degrees if they make it through one of the
Grandes Ecoles, which produce many of France's top civil servants, politicians
and businesspeople.</P>
      <P>Four Taiwanese senior high school students gained admission to the Grandes
Ecoles preparatory school in 2006 when the French government began to offer free
tuition for Taiwan students to study at the school under an academic exchange
program.</P>

      <P>The Taipei City Department of Labor will organize a free one-day clinic to
provide health checks and medical consultancy services to foreign workers in
Taiwan, the department said in a statement Friday.</P>
      <P>The clinic will be held from 1: 30 p.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday at the Taipei Railway
Station, in a joint effort between the city government and the Tzu Chi
International Medical Association (TIMA).</P>
      <P>The city department and the non-profit organization, founded by a group of
healthcare professionals under the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi
Foundation, will recruit local physicians who speak the languages of Indonesia,
the Philippines and Vietnam to volunteer at the clinic, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The services provided will include normal health checks and basic medical
treatment for those suffering from depression, eye, skin and teeth problems, and
gynecological and internal diseases.</P>
      <P>City officials responsible for organizing the service said that as most foreign
workers in Taiwan do not speak Mandarin or any of the local dialects, they are
usually reluctant to go to a local clinic or hospital when they are ill.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Business operators hustle to revive MRT underground shopping area</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/10/08  18:59:25</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The people who crowded into the Zhongshan underground shopping mall on National
Day may have been surprised to learn that much of the commercial strip had been
little more than a ghost town for most of the year.</P>
      <P>Now, after a renovation that lasted from the end of 2007 to its grand re-opening
Oct. 4, at least one section of the 2-kilometer mall that connects Taipei Main
Station to Shuanglian Station to the north is hoping to thrive in today's
difficult retail environment.</P>
      <P>A total of 81 shops occupy the mall, which first opened in 2000. Since then, it
has faced its ups and downs, and with business weak through much of 2007, the
city had trouble finding new private contractors this year to operate the
shopping area's different sections after contracts with previous management
companies ran out.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai Jing-cheng, the vice president of the private contractor that
re-opened one of the mall's three sections Oct. 4, the underground street was
mostly populated in recent months by homeless people who would lie on benches
until midnight.</P>
      <P>That same stretch now is home to shiny new storefronts, with all 35 booths in
the section managed by Tsai's company rented out, although some booths in other
areas are still vacant.</P>
      <P>To make the contract signed with the city government to operate the mall section
pay, Tsai needs to help his tenants generate revenue by capitalizing on the
heavy MRT and railway passenger traffic that passes through the Taipei station.</P>
      <P>That means focusing on inexpensive goods and fast services that are more likely
to compel metro passengers to stop and spend, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The need for speed and convenience is reflected in the choices shoppers have,
from clothes, cafes, and home furnishings to video game booths, massage services
and barber shops.</P>
      <P>To celebrate the Oct. 10 National Day, for example, a barber shop was running a
two-day promotion, offering already relatively cheap NT$100 haircuts for NT$10
(US$0.31) , to publicize its fast haircut service.</P>
      <P>But consumers should not expect anything more than a simple cut, because the
shop does not wash or style hair or offer more time-consuming services.</P>
      <P>Next to the barber shop is a massage parlor offering quick relaxation breaks
from blind masseurs. Passengers in a hurry who need a bit of pampering can enjoy
a 10-minute massage for NT$100.</P>
      <P>In addition, several book stores in the area provide 15 to 25 percent discounts
on many kinds of publications.</P>
      <P>Chris, an American tourist from Los Angeles who strolled through the underground
street, told the Central News Agency that the underground shopping area was a
good idea, and was just beginning to be adopted in his hometown.</P>
      <P>Having bought several T-shirts in the shopping street, he was also happy with
the prices, which are considerably lower than those in department stores.</P>
      <P>Joe Teltser, who arrived in Taiwan from New York two weeks ago, said he liked
the idea even if he initially found it odd after coming from a city where subway
stations are not connected as they are in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"(The idea of the shopping area) is fine; (the space) is not narrow, and it's
shielded from the weather," Teltser said.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, however, generating sales is not always easy, not only
because of the tough economic environment but also because of the many
restrictions on advertising and promotional events imposed by the city.</P>
      <P>"We can't do all the promotional activities we want because of the metro
company's regulations, " Tsai said, complaining that stores are not allowed to
use loud-speakers or hold events that are "too exciting."</P>
      <P>At best, they can only distribute leaflets in front of their stores, which Tsai
described as "meaningless."</P>
      <P>To attract more shoppers, Tsai plans to enhance the diversity of the stores in
addition to insisting on low prices as his main business strategies. His newest
idea?</P>
      <P>"I'm thinking about introduce a pet shop here in the near future, if the metro
company allows it."</P>

      <P>Eleven out of 54 herbal medicine samples that the Consumers' Foundation had
tested recently were found to have been adulterated with Western medicines,  a
spokesman for the nonprofit organization said Thursday.</P>
      <P>At the request of local consumers, the foundation sent the samples for testing
to determine whether any of them contained Western medicines, said Hsieh Tien-
jen, the foundation's acting chairman.</P>
      <P>Laboratory tests showed that 11 of the samples, or 20 percent of the total, were
adulterated with Western medicines, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Four of the samples testing positive for Western medicines originated in China,
and one of those even contained excessive amounts of lead. In Taiwan, the
permissible lead content is set at 100 ppm (parts per million).</P>
      <P>Noting that excessive lead intake can cause renal failure or brain damage, Hsieh
called on the public to take medicine prescribed only by licensed doctors
instead of purchasing drugs of unknown origin.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, the remaining seven of the 11 samples that tested positive
were all purchased domestically, including three bought from traditional martial
art studios, two bought from friends, one bought from a herbal shop and the
other bought from a Western medicine store.</P>
      <P>All of them contained either painkillers or diuretics that could also damage the
kidneys.</P>
      <P>Founded in Taipei in 1980, the foundation is an independent, nonprofit

      <P>A species of rare land crab has been spotted in southern Taiwan's Kenting
National Park, marking only the third time in history that this type of species
has been observed by scientists, sources at the park administration said Friday.</P>
      <P>The park's biologists said that the sesarmid crab,  named labuanium
trapezoideum,  was first spotted in Andaman Island, Indonesia in 1837 and
biologists did not find another such crab until 166 years later.</P>
      <P>In 2003,  a group of biologists  found several  labuanium trapezoideum crabs in
Taiwan's eastern county of Taitung and made detailed records of their biological
and behavioral characteristics, which was later published in the science journal
Crustaceana.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the crabs live in a hilly area five kilometers from the
sea, and only come close to the seashore during breeding season. The young crabs
return to land habitat when they are two to three months old.</P>
      <P>The park biologists said that since 2003, however, no other habitats of
labuanium trapezoideum crabs had been found in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In mid-September this year, however, an amateur ecologist at the park reported
seeing and photographed a "strange" crab, which was later identified as a
labuanium trapezoideum crab.</P>
      <P>Park biologists noted that the finding indicates not only that the species still
exists, but that there may be a new habitat inside the national park.</P>

      <P>China has insisted at a World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting that the
widespread melamine contamination of infant formula in the country was
"accidental, " an apparent attempt to play down the latest Chinese food safety
furor that has raised health concerns around the world.</P>
      <P>At the WTO Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures Committee meeting held from Oct.
8 to 9, a Chinese official acknowledged widespread concern about recent
discoveries of melamine in milk powder and other products, according to a WTO
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>The WTO official quoted a Chinese official as saying that the contamination was
"accidental" and that the Chinese government was also concerned about the issue
and making enormous efforts to deal with problem.</P>
      <P>Information has been provided directly to consumers, through the World Health
Organization's (WHO) Web site and diplomatic channels, the Chinese official was
quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Since Sept. 10, tighter controls have been introduced for milk and no
contamination has been discovered, with a similar result for milk products after
controls tightened on Sept. 20, China claimed, according to the WTO official.</P>
      <P>Noting that several countries have introduced import bans, China urged them to
base their measures on science, risk assessment and information from the WHO, to
avoid escalating the restrictions, and to notify the WTO and its members of the
measures, the WTO official said.</P>
      <P>Melamine, normally used in industrial applications, was added to diluted milk to
mask lower protein levels. Adulterated infant formula led to the deaths of four
children from renal failure and sickened more than 54,000 others in China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and many other countries have recalled or banned imported Chinese  food
products  containing  dairy  ingredients  and vegetable-based proteins.</P>

      <P>Tsai made the announcement following a meeting with the heads of the seven local
governments in Kaohsiung City, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu, Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing,
Tainan  City Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair,  Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih,
Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen, Yunlin County Magistrate Su Chih-fen and
Pingtung County Deputy Magistrate Chung Jia-pin attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the seven local government heads hope that the central
government would set up a food safety certification system to help the public
select safe agricultural and farm products at a time when the Taiwan people are
deeply concerned about substandard products imported from China.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers have submitted to the Legislative Yuan a law amendment proposal
aimed at mandating tighter inspection of Chinese foodstuff and ingredients, Tsai
said.</P>
      <P>The local government chiefs are pushing the DPP lawmakers to make the bill a
priority on the legislative agenda, she added.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan people have strong doubts about the resolve of President Ma Ying-
jeou's administration to uphold the country's sovereignty during the upcoming
visit by a key Beijing official, she said.</P>
      <P>They are also skeptical of the government's capability to handle cross-Taiwan
Strait dealings, including the consequences of importing from China melamine-
tainted milk powder and other products containing the toxic chemical, according
to Tsai.</P>
      <P>Melamine is a toxic industrial chemical that produces falsely high results in
tests for protein levels in food.</P>
      <P>Instead of attending National Day celebrations, Tsai visited a Kaohsiung City
hypermart earlier the same day to help promote a special zone, the second of its
kind in the city, that has been set up in the mart to sell high quality and safe
local agricultural goods.</P>
      <P>"It is pointless to celebrate National Day at a time when the country's
sovereignty, the economy and the people's livelihood are being hit hard, " Tsai
said. "It is much more meaningful to take the opportunity to encourage the
public to use locally produced goods."</P>
      <P>Tsai was accompanied on the tour of the center by Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu,
Chiayi Magistrate Chen Ming-wen, Tainan Deputy Mayor Hung Cheng-chung and
several DPP lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Chen said the central government has a responsibility to rebuild consumer
confidence in the wake of the melamine scare, and called for a speedy
legislation to institute a standard mechanism to strengthen food safety control
for the sake of the public's health.</P>
      <P>In view of the enthusiastic public response to the Taiwanese product center,
Chen Ming-wen said he would consider a similar plan in Chiayi County.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EU calls for universal abolition of death penalty</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>On the occasion of the World and European Day against the Death Penalty, which
falls on Taiwans Double Ten National Day, the European Union Friday called on
Taiwan, along with the rest of the world, to take measures to abolish the death
penalty.</P>
      <P>Benita Ferrero-Waldner, commissioner for External Relations and European
Neighborhood Policy, said in a press release promulgated by the Taipei-based
European Economic and Trade Office (EETO) that although over half of the
countries in the world have abolished the death penalty in law or practice, the
global figures for its use remain much too high.</P>
      <P>I fully recognize the plight of victims of violent crime, but the death penalty
is not the solution,Ferrero-Waldner said, adding thaton the Contrary, it only
serves to aggravate a culture of violence and retribution.</P>
      <P>The Commission is determined to work towards the universal abolition of the
death penalty through all available diplomatic channels and as a leading donor
in this field,she added.</P>
      <P>The EU encourages public debate, strengthening public opposition and putting
pressure on retentionist countries to eliminate the death penalty, or at least
introduce a moratorium as a first step, the press release said.</P>
      <P>It added that the EU also acts against the death penalty in multilateral fora,
such as the United Nations; a culmination of this effort was the resolution on
the moratorium on the use of the death penalty, adopted by the United Nations
General Assembly on Dec. 18, 2007.</P>
      <P>EETO Director Guy Ledoux, told CNA that he hopes Taiwan would continue its "de
facto moratorium" on the death penalty since the last execution three year ago.</P>
      <P>Some very good progress has been seen in Taiwan and we hope that it will
continue the moratorium on the death penalty, if abolishment cannot be achieved
in the short term,Ledoux said.</P>
      <P>Launched by the World coalition Against the Death Penalty on Oct. 10, 2003, the
first World Day Against the Death Penalty gathers annually  international  non-
governmental  organizations,  bar associations, unions and local governments
from all over the world to lobby for the abolition of the death penalty.</P>
      <P>While a total of 137 countries have abolished the death penalty in law or
practice since 2005, the number of government-condoned death penalty sentences
and executions around the world sill remain high.</P>
      <P>During 2007, at least 1,252 people were executed in 24 countries and at least
3,347 people were sentenced to death in 51 countries, the EU said, adding that
88 percent of all known executions took place in five countries: China, Iran,
Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United States.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A salvage team of the Republic of China Navy on Friday successfully towed a
150-ton fast-attack missile boat that had been grounded off the coast of Chiayi
County, southern Taiwan, into the county's Budai harbor.</P>
      <P>Navy Fleet Command spokesman Liu Chih-chien told reporters that the team used
two giant cranes to pull the Kuang Hua No. 6 Missile Speedboat out of shallow
waters, and that the boat is now berthed at one of the wharves in Budai harbor.</P>
      <P>Liu said the hull of the boat is generally in a satisfactory condition, although
Navy frogmen who inspected the damage below water discovered five holes in the
bottom of the boat.</P>
      <P>"The Navy is confident in its ability to repair the boat," Liu said, adding that
after a preliminary welding job in Budai harbor, the boat will be towed back to
Kaohsiung Port for an overhaul.</P>
      <P>The missile boat is a prototype designed by the Navy under its Kuang Hua No. 6
Missile Speedboat Plan to phase out the 50-ton Seagull-Class missile boats. It
is 34 meters long and 7.6 meters wide, with a top speed of 34 knots.</P>
      <P>The boat ran aground Sept. 25 in bad weather while taking part in the Han Kuang
24 Military Exercise. The 14 crewmen on board were rescued shortly after the
mishap.</P>
      <P>In the following days, rescue workers from the Navy removed the four Hsiung Feng
anti-ship missiles, the navigation system and other important equipment from the
vessel.</P>
      <P>Under the Kuang Hua No. 6 plan, 30 boats will be built at a cost of about NT$400
million (US$12.29 million) each. The state-run Kaohsiung-based CSBC Corp. Taiwan
-- the nation's largest shipbuilder -- began building the boats in November
2007.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's domestic fuel prices were lowered by approximately 7 percent Friday,
with the prices for gasoline falling NT$2.3 per liter and diesel prices dropping
NT$2.5 per liter.</P>
      <P>The price cuts came amid falling international crude oil costs that are now
approaching US$80 per barrel, down from a record-high of US$147 per barrel in
July.</P>
      <P>State-run oil refiner CPC Corp., Taiwan (CPC), and the private Formosa
Petrochemical Corp. both announced the adjustment earlier in the day, with CPC's
price cuts to take effect Friday at midnight and Formosa's to go into effect an
hour later, at 1 a.m. Saturday.</P>
      <P>Following the latest adjustment, the price of 92-octane unleaded gasoline will
fall to NT$27.2 per liter, that of 95-octane unleaded will be NT$27.9 per liter
and that of 98-octane unleaded will fall to NT$29.4 per liter.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that prices for 95-octane and 98-octane gasoline fell
below the NT$30 barrier since CPC Corp. adopted a floating pricing mechanism
Aug. 7 that reviews prices on a weekly basis.</P>
      <P>Price adjustments are made based on fluctuations in the prices of Dubai and
Brent crude oil as quoted on Platts, a leading global provider of energy
information.</P>

      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party officials and President Ma Ying-jeou to
respect national dignity and the feelings of Taiwan's people when they meet
Beijing's top negotiator with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The form of the meeting and other arrangements must pay attention to the issue
of the dignity of Taiwan's 23 million people. President Ma was elected by
Taiwan's people, and their feelings should be respected, " Tsai said in
Kaohsiung City after meeting with the heads of DPP-held cities and counties in
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's  independent  sovereignty   and  Taiwan-centric consciousness are very
important and cannot be shunned," she added.</P>
      <P>A foreign wire service report said a day earlier that Ma will meet Chen Yunlin,
the president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS), during Chen's expected visit to Taiwan at the end of October or early
November.</P>
      <P>The report cited as its source Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the quasi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , who is Chen's Taiwanese counterpart.</P>
      <P>Commenting  on the Reuters report,  SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Kao
Koong-lian acknowledged Thursday that the SEF and the ARATS were arranging a Ma-
Chen meeting.</P>
      <P>"As Chiang also met Chinese President and Communist Party General Secretary Hu
Jintao in Beijing in June, a meeting between President Ma and Chen is certainly
under consideration and being arranged, " Kao explained.</P>
      <P>But he added that the matter will not be finalized before the two intermediary
bodies have concluded ongoing talks on the issue.</P>
      <P>Chen would be the highest-ranking official from the People's Republic of China
ever to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The planned Chiang-Chen meeting in Taipei would be a follow-up to a landmark
meeting between the two men in June in Beijing, in which two accords on weekend
charter flights and Taiwan's wider opening to Chinese tourists were clinched.</P>
      <P>Should they meet, Chiang and Chen are expected to hold talks on cross-Taiwan
Strait  transportation  services,  including  the establishment of regular cargo
charter flights and regular passenger flights, financial supervisory cooperation
and crime-fighting, among other things.</P>
      <P>The DPP and several pro-independence groups have decided to hold large-scale

      <P>Taiwan is unlikely to achieve an economic growth  rate of 5.08 percent  for 2009
as projected  by the Cabinet-level  Directorate-General  of  Budget,  Accounting
and Statistics, an academic said Friday.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's economy is heavily dependent on export trade, Wu Chung-shu,
dean of the College of Management at National Dong Hwa University in Hualien
County, eastern Taiwan, said the pace of world economic recovery will determine
whether Taiwan's gross domestic product could realize a growth rate of 4 percent
for 2009.</P>
      <P>"The global financial market seriously underestimated the impact of the American
sub-loan crisis," Wu said, adding that the current global financial crisis will
further delay world economic recovery and that the public should exercise
discretion and remain conservative in making personal financial plans.</P>
      <P>"It is too early to predict when the current global financial crisis will be
over. Most governments are trying to cope with the problems, although there is
not much they can do. People need to be more careful and conservative," he said.</P>
      <P>Quoting statistics from the International Monetary Fund's world economic outlook
report released earlier this week, Wu said the global growth rate for 2008 was
revised downward from the July projection of 4.1 percent to 3.9 percent, and
that the previous forecast of 3.9 percent growth for 2009 was also slashed to 3
percent -- the lowest since 2002.</P>
      <P>The IMF defined growth of 3 percent as implying a "global recession" and warned
that the world economy is entering a major downturn in the face of the most
dangerous financial shock in mature financial markets since the 1930s.</P>
      <P>Like other major stock markets in North America, Asia and Europe, Taiwan's stock
market has also suffered continuous setbacks. Despite a series of government
measures to attempt to prop up investor confidence, the Taiwan stock index fell
nearly 2,000 points, from 7,046 in early September to 5,130 on Oct. 9.</P>

      <P>Amid what diplomats described as the most exciting atmosphere in recent years,
around 5,000 local and foreign dignitaries and guests joined the Republic of
China in celebrating its 97th National Day at a reception Friday.</P>
      <P>Hosted by Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou and his wife, the reception was
graced by the presence of President Ma Ying-jeou and first lady Chow Mei-ching,
who arrived at around 5: 05 p.m. at the Taipei Guest House where the function
was held.</P>
      <P>Chow wore a purple V-neck evening dress that flattered her slender figure, but
sticking to her usual austere style, she did not wear any accessories.</P>
      <P>Other guests included  Premier  Liu Chao-shiuan,  Guatemala President Alvaro
Colom, Gambian Parliamentary Speaker Fatoumata Jahumpa-Ceesay, Saint Kitts and
Nevis Parliamentary Speaker Curtis Martin and Honduras Deputy Foreign Minister
Eduardo Federico Rosales Ramirez, as well as other foreign guest and members of
the diplomatic corps.</P>
      <P>"I am so impressed by the grandeur of this years National Day Reception,"
Nicaraguan Ambassador to Taipei William Tapia told CNA, adding that it was much
bigger than the previous year when he attended the function as a member of a
special mission to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hans-Peter Fitze, deputy director of the Taipei-based Trade Office of Swiss
Industries, said that this year's reception was the best compared to the
previous two he attended, and he made special mention of the traditional
Taiwanese and aboriginal cuisine.</P>
      <P>With the Baroque-style Taipei Guest House as the backdrop, the world-renowned
Ming Hwa Yuan Taiwanese Opera Company entertained the guests, performing on a
lotus-shaped stage erected above the pond in the center of the garden.</P>
      <P>As nostalgia was the theme of this year's reception, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs invited folk art performers to showcase their talent, which featured
flour miniature, paper cutting, calligraphy and art works from Taiwan's
aboriginal tribes.</P>
      <P>The cuisine at the reception included Taiwanese, Hakkanese and aboriginal
dishes, which symbolized the richness and harmony of Taiwan's culture and

      <P>A shipment of dragon fruit imported from Vietnam earlier this month had been
found to contain pesticide residues, but about 18,000 kilograms of the affected
fruit have already been sold, food safety inspection officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Ting-hung, deputy director of the Bureau of Food Safety under the Cabinet-
level Department of Health, said samples of the fruit, imported by Kieunga
Import-Export Trading Co., were found to contain 0.27 ppm (parts per million) of
prochloraz, a pesticide used in the cultivation of a variety of crops such as
small berries, mushrooms and rice.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, prochloraz is not highly toxic and the testing standard for
small berries is set at below 1 ppm, but no prochloraz residue is permitted in
dragon fruit.</P>
      <P>The Pingtung-based trading company in southern Taiwan had sold a large portion
of the affected shipment before the test results were confirmed, but officials
from the DOH and the local health bureau confiscated the remaining 34 cases of
the fruit, each of 9.5 kg.</P>
      <P>The company has been required to produce a detailed customer list to facilitate
tracking and recall of the tainted dragon fruit, also known as pitaya, Hsieh
said.</P>
      <P>The company will be slapped with fines ranging between NT$40,000 (about
US$1,238) and NT$200,000. In addition, Hsieh said, it may be deprived of the
right for six months to take delivery of imported goods before  residue  testing
results  are available  as an administrative penalty.</P>

      <P>A 50-minute fireworks show, during which 7,813 fireworks were set off,
brightened the night sky of southern Taiwan's Chiayi City Friday as part of
Double Ten National Day celebrations.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time in history that the annual National Day fireworks show
was held in the southern city, attracting a huge crowd of spectators, many of
whom came from neighboring cities and counties.</P>
      <P>The dazzling fireworks presented images of "Double Ten" and plum blossoms -- the
Republic of China's national flower -- to celebrate the country's birthday. Also
featured in the show were images of the Chiayi City flower known as the Hong
Kong orchid.</P>
      <P>The fireworks,  mainly gold and silver,  also formed many distinguishable
shapes, such as numbers, geometrical patterns like trapezoids and pyramids, and
glittering paths, during the display, enthralling spectators and winning
acclaim.</P>
      <P>People began to gather at the event's venue -- the city's main stadium -- at
noon, even though the show was not to begin until 7 p.m.</P>
      <P>Chiayi-born Vice President Vincent Siew presided over the opening of the event.
In his brief speech, he urged the public to remain confident in the country's
bright future despite the current global financial  crisis,  given  Taiwan's
relatively  sound economic fundamentals.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, Chiayi City Mayor Huang Min-hui and many
other local politicians also attended the ceremony to admire the eye-catching
display.</P>
      <P>The colorful show was followed by a pop concert, which brought the National Day
celebrations in the city to another climax.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, President Ma Ying-jeou attended an evening party in the eastern
county of Hualien to celebrate National Day. Ma praised Hualien as a mecca for
Taiwan's democratic development because its first-ever direct local elections
took place in the county which boasts beautiful natural scenery.</P>
      <P>In 1950, Ma recalled that Hualien residents first elected county councilors  and
then elected their magistrate.  Both elections proceeded smoothly and
successfully, according to Ma.</P>
      <P>After more than five decades of development, Ma went on, Taiwan's democracy has
matured and evolved into a steady growth period as evidenced in the second
transition of power in the wake of the March 22 presidential election. Ma won a
landslide in the poll, paving the way for his party, the Kuomintang, to regain
power after an eight-year hiatus.</P>
      <P>"While celebrating our country's birthday,  we should feel grateful for Hualien
's contribution to Taiwan's democratic transformation, "he added.</P>

(DPP)  Chairwoman  Tsai Ing-wen urged senior ruling Kuomintang  (KMT)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party officials and President Ma Ying-jeou to
respect national dignity and the feelings of Taiwan's people when they meet
Beijing's top negotiator with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The form of the meeting and other arrangements must pay attention to the issue
of the dignity of Taiwan's 23 million people. President Ma was elected by
Taiwan's people, and their feelings should be respected, " Tsai said in
Kaohsiung City after meeting with the heads of DPP-held cities and counties in
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's  independent  sovereignty   and  Taiwan-centric consciousness are very
important and cannot be shunned," she added.</P>
      <P>A foreign wire service report said a day earlier that Ma will meet Chen Yunlin,
the president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS), during Chen's expected visit to Taiwan at the end of October or early
November.</P>
      <P>The report cited as its source Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the quasi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , who is Chen's Taiwanese counterpart.</P>
      <P>Commenting  on the Reuters report,  SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Kao
Koong-lian acknowledged Thursday that the SEF and the ARATS were arranging a Ma-
Chen meeting.</P>
      <P>"As Chiang also met Chinese President and Communist Party General Secretary Hu
Jintao in Beijing in June, a meeting between President Ma and Chen is certainly
under consideration and being arranged, " Kao explained.</P>
      <P>But he added that the matter will not be finalized before the two intermediary
bodies have concluded ongoing talks on the issue.</P>
      <P>Chen would be the highest-ranking official from the People's Republic of China
ever to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The planned Chiang-Chen meeting in Taipei would be a follow-up to a landmark
meeting between the two men in June in Beijing, in which two accords on weekend
charter flights and Taiwan's wider opening to Chinese tourists were clinched.</P>
      <P>Should they meet, Chiang and Chen are expected to hold talks on cross-Taiwan
Strait  transportation  services,  including  the establishment of regular cargo
charter flights and regular passenger flights, financial supervisory cooperation
and crime-fighting, among other things.</P>
      <P>The DPP and several pro-independence groups have decided to hold large-scale
protests against China if Chen goes through with the visit.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is unlikely to achieve an economic growth  rate of 5.08 percent  for 2009
as projected  by the Cabinet-level  Directorate-General  of  Budget,  Accounting
and Statistics, an academic said Friday.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's economy is heavily dependent on export trade, Wu Chung-shu,
dean of the College of Management at National Dong Hwa University in Hualien
County, eastern Taiwan, said the pace of world economic recovery will determine
whether Taiwan's gross domestic product could realize a growth rate of 4 percent
for 2009.</P>
      <P>"The global financial market seriously underestimated the impact of the American
sub-loan crisis," Wu said, adding that the current global financial crisis will
further delay world economic recovery and that the public should exercise
discretion and remain conservative in making personal financial plans.</P>
      <P>"It is too early to predict when the current global financial crisis will be
over. Most governments are trying to cope with the problems, although there is
not much they can do. People need to be more careful and conservative," he said.</P>
      <P>Quoting statistics from the International Monetary Fund's world economic outlook
report released earlier this week, Wu said the global growth rate for 2008 was
revised downward from the July projection of 4.1 percent to 3.9 percent, and
that the previous forecast of 3.9 percent growth for 2009 was also slashed to 3
percent -- the lowest since 2002.</P>
      <P>The IMF defined growth of 3 percent as implying a "global recession" and warned
that the world economy is entering a major downturn in the face of the most
dangerous financial shock in mature financial markets since the 1930s.</P>
      <P>Like other major stock markets in North America, Asia and Europe, Taiwan's stock
market has also suffered continuous setbacks. Despite a series of government
measures to attempt to prop up investor confidence, the Taiwan stock index fell
nearly 2,000 points, from 7,046 in early September to 5,130 on Oct. 9.</P>

      <P>Amid what diplomats described as the most exciting atmosphere in recent years,
around 5,000 local and foreign dignitaries and guests joined the Republic of
China in celebrating its 97th National Day at a reception Friday.</P>
      <P>Hosted by Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou and his wife, the reception was
graced by the presence of President Ma Ying-jeou and first lady Chow Mei-ching,
who arrived at around 5: 05 p.m. at the Taipei Guest House where the function
was held.</P>
      <P>Chow wore a purple V-neck evening dress that flattered her slender figure, but
sticking to her usual austere style, she did not wear any accessories.</P>
      <P>Other guests included  Premier  Liu Chao-shiuan,  Guatemala President Alvaro
Colom, Gambian Parliamentary Speaker Fatoumata Jahumpa-Ceesay, Saint Kitts and
Nevis Parliamentary Speaker Curtis Martin and Honduras Deputy Foreign Minister
Eduardo Federico Rosales Ramirez, as well as other foreign guest and members of
the diplomatic corps.</P>
      <P>"I am so impressed by the grandeur of this year's National Day Reception,"
Nicaraguan Ambassador to Taipei William Tapia told CNA, adding that it was much
bigger than the previous year when he attended the function as a member of a
special mission to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hans-Peter Fitze, deputy director of the Taipei-based Trade Office of Swiss
Industries, said that this year's reception was the best compared to the
previous two he attended, and he made special mention of the traditional
Taiwanese and aboriginal cuisine.</P>
      <P>With the Baroque-style Taipei Guest House as the backdrop, the world-renowned
Ming Hwa Yuan Taiwanese Opera Company entertained the guests, performing on a
lotus-shaped stage erected above the pond in the center of the garden.</P>
      <P>As nostalgia was the theme of this year's reception, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs invited folk art performers to showcase their talent, which featured
flour miniature, paper cutting, calligraphy and art works from Taiwan's
aboriginal tribes.</P>
      <P>The cuisine at the reception included Taiwanese, Hakkanese and aboriginal
dishes, which symbolized the richness and harmony of Taiwan's culture and

      <P>A shipment of dragon fruit imported from Vietnam earlier this month had been
found to contain pesticide residues, but about 18,000 kilograms of the affected
fruit have already been sold, food safety inspection officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Ting-hung, deputy director of the Bureau of Food Safety under the Cabinet-
level Department of Health, said samples of the fruit, imported by Kieunga
Import-Export Trading Co., were found to contain 0.27 ppm (parts per million) of
prochloraz, a pesticide used in the cultivation of a variety of crops such as
small berries, mushrooms and rice.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, prochloraz is not highly toxic and the testing standard for
small berries is set at below 1 ppm, but no prochloraz residue is permitted in
dragon fruit.</P>
      <P>The Pingtung-based trading company in southern Taiwan had sold a large portion
of the affected shipment before the test results were confirmed, but officials
from the DOH and the local health bureau confiscated the remaining 34 cases of
the fruit, each of 9.5 kg.</P>
      <P>The company has been required to produce a detailed customer list to facilitate
tracking and recall of the tainted dragon fruit, also known as pitaya, Hsieh
said.</P>
      <P>The company will be slapped with fines ranging between NT$40,000 (about
US$1,238) and NT$200,000. In addition, Hsieh said, it may be deprived of the
right for six months to take delivery of imported goods before  residue  testing
results  are available  as an administrative penalty.</P>

      <P>A 50-minute fireworks show, during which 7,813 fireworks were set off,
brightened the night sky of southern Taiwan's Chiayi City Friday as part of
Double Ten National Day celebrations.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time in history that the annual National Day fireworks show
was held in the southern city, attracting a huge crowd of spectators, many of
whom came from neighboring cities and counties.</P>
      <P>The dazzling fireworks presented images of "Double Ten" and plum blossoms -- the
Republic of China's national flower -- to celebrate the country's birthday. Also
featured in the show were images of the Chiayi City flower known as the Hong
Kong orchid.</P>
      <P>The fireworks,  mainly gold and silver,  also formed many distinguishable
shapes, such as numbers, geometrical patterns like trapezoids and pyramids, and
glittering paths, during the display, enthralling spectators and winning
acclaim.</P>
      <P>People began to gather at the event's venue -- the city's main stadium -- at
noon, even though the show was not to begin until 7 p.m.</P>
      <P>Chiayi-born Vice President Vincent Siew presided over the opening of the event.
In his brief speech, he urged the public to remain confident in the country's
bright future despite the current global financial  crisis,  given  Taiwan's
relatively  sound economic fundamentals.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, Chiayi City Mayor Huang Min-hui and many
other local politicians also attended the ceremony to admire the eye-catching
display.</P>
      <P>The colorful show was followed by a pop concert, which brought the National Day
celebrations in the city to another climax.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, President Ma Ying-jeou attended an evening party in the eastern
county of Hualien to celebrate National Day. Ma praised Hualien as a mecca for
Taiwan's democratic development because its first-ever direct local elections
took place in the county which boasts beautiful natural scenery.</P>
      <P>In 1950, Ma recalled that Hualien residents first elected county councilors  and
then elected their magistrate.  Both elections proceeded smoothly and
successfully, according to Ma.</P>
      <P>After more than five decades of development, Ma went on, Taiwan's democracy has
matured and evolved into a steady growth period as evidenced in the second
transition of power in the wake of the March 22 presidential election. Ma won a
landslide in the poll, paving the way for his party, the Kuomintang, to regain
power after an eight-year hiatus.</P>
      <P>"While celebrating our country's birthday,  we should feel grateful for Hualien
's contribution to Taiwan's democratic transformation, "he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's banking sector has second-lowest risk: report</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's banking sector presents the second-lowest risk after Saudi Arabia among
key emerging markets around the world, according to a report released recently
by Global Insight.</P>
      <P>Also ranked among the list of lowest risk countries are United Arab Emirates,
Malaysia and Slovakia, according to the Banking Sector Risk Rankings for 33
emerging markets conducted by the U.S.-based economic forecasting and financial
analysis company.</P>
      <P>The report said the banking sectors of Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Arab Emirates and
Malaysia have the greatest prospects for stability thanks to their high capital
levels, sufficient liquidity, adequate bank management and prudent regulatory
environment.</P>
      <P>"Our strong rating for these countries carries a stable outlook with no
significant deterioration of their present status expected in the near-term,"
the report stated.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the report warned of the highest risk of banking sector
instability in Ukraine, Hungary, Nigeria, Iran and Venezuela.</P>
      <P>While the banking sectors in Venezuela, Iran and Nigeria suffer from strong
political influence and unfavorable economic policies, Hungary and Ukraine see
very high foreign currency borrowing by banks and on-lending to unhedged
domestic customers, the report said.</P>
      <P>The report concluded that the global financial crisis has had relatively limited
direct effect on banking stability in most emerging markets thus far, but
pressures are starting to mount and the outlook has turned negative for the
banking sectors of a number of major emerging economies.</P>
      <P>According to Toby Wight, manager of Global Insight's Banking Risk Service,
strong economic growth has contributed to rapid credit expansion in many
emerging markets over the past several years, causing questionable credit risk
assessment practices and asset price inflation.</P>
      <P>"These risks are compounded, in many instances, by high levels of non-performing
loans, poor financial sector regulation, and the limited extent of economic
reforms, all of which have further negative implications of bank stability,"
Wight said.</P>
      <P>For emerging markets in Asia, the report gave a negative outlook for China,
Vietnam, India and Pakistan.</P>
      <P>It said Chinese and Vietnamese banking sectors present high potential for
instability due to excessive political influence and poor risk assessment and
banking practices, while India and Pakistan have moderate levels of instability
as a result of inadequate credit risk assessment capabilities and banking
practices.</P>

      <P>After 16 months on the job, she has proven to be one of Taiwan's most effective
civil servants as she blocks travelers from smuggling meat, fresh fruit and
living plants into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>One of the 27 sniffer dogs working at Taiwan's international airports, Doggy has
earned her keep with an 80 percent detection rate of items that should be
quarantined, her trainer Lu Chi-yan proudly boasted Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lu said the four-year-old Doggy, the only mixed-breed in the program, was first
trained to attend to elderly people because of her mild character.</P>
      <P>But because of her display of high energy and insatiable desire for food -- key
traits needed to become sniffer dogs -- Doggy was sent to the sniffer dog
training center at National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, and
her career change has been a boon to the country.</P>
      <P>Since starting on the job in June 2007, she has had a number of traveler-
frustrating exploits, Lu said, including once when she caught a Vietnamese woman
married to a local citizen trying to smuggle meats from her homeland into
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The passenger disguised the food as vegetarian ham, but was still sniffed out by
Doggy, said Lu, who works with his four-legged friend as quarantine detectors at
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport.</P>
      <P>Most of the 27 sniffer dogs serving for the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine are beagles, a small hound known for its hunting
instincts.</P>
      <P>They discover about 30 tons of banned meat, fresh agricultural products and
animals every year at the customs and cargo centers at Taiwan's international
airport gateways.</P>
      <P>Beginning Oct. 1, travelers who are found attempting to bring animals and
plants, as well as processed meat products and fresh fruit into Taiwan without
applying for clearance, will be subjected to a fine of at least NT$3,000
(US$92), according to the bureau.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two-way trade between Taiwan and Malaysia reached US$8.8 billion for the first
eight months of the year, marking an increase of 18 percent over the same period
a year earlier, the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in Malaysia said
in a statement released Saturday.</P>
      <P>The statement quoted remarks made by Victor Tseng, Taiwan's representative to
Malaysia, in a speech at a party hosted by the office Thursday evening to
celebrate the Republic of China's Double Ten National Day.</P>
      <P>According to the TECO, Tseng said that Malaysia, with its stable political
situation and ideal climate, is also a main destination for Taiwanese investment
capital.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese  businesses  began investing  heavily in Malaysia beginning in 1987 in
response to the government's "Go South" policy of diversifying overseas
investments, according to Tseng.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was the top source of foreign investment in Malaysia in 1990 and again in
1994 and had invested more than US$10 billion in the Southeast Asian country as
of the end of last year, ranking Taiwan as Malaysia's third largest source of
foreign investment.</P>
      <P>The two-way trade of US$8.8 billion between the two countries in the first eight
months of 2008 also made Taiwan Malaysia's seventh largest trading partner,
Tseng said.</P>
      <P>At the same time,  tourism between the two countries has increased, with more
than 200,000 Taiwan nationals visiting Malaysia last year, according to Tseng.</P>
      <P>In the area of culture and education, exchanges have also been on the rise,
Tseng said, noting that more than 30,000 Malaysian students were studying in
Taiwan as of the end of 2007.</P>
      <P>He added that 19 Malaysian students have received scholarships this year to
pursue undergraduate, master's or doctoral degrees in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tseng expressed the hope that under the new administration of President Ma Ying-

    <HEADLINE>Vice president touts benefits of Taiwan-ASEAN free trade pact</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 11 (CNA)
10/11/08  17:22:26
(By Steve Bercic)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Saturday that a free trade agreement between
Taiwan and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) would be mutually
beneficial in terms of economic development as well as regional peace and
stability.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the 1st Taiwan-East Asia Conference on Free Trade Agreement held in
Taipei City, Siew said that Taiwan will assume an "attitude of practical
participation" in striving for its goal of being included in regional economic
integration.</P>
      <P>Siew said regional economic integration is a global trend and that major
economies, including China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and India, want to
enter into FTAs with ASEAN to create a stronger and larger economic entity and
boost their mutual economic and trade relations.</P>
      <P>The vice president said Taiwan expects that under the ASEAN charter and by means
of a practical model, it can begin dialogue and cooperation  with the
organization  and proceed  to meaningful participation in "ASEAN + N" regional
dialogue and negotiations.</P>
      <P>Though Taiwan has actively sought to advance the process of working toward a
free trade agreement with ASEAN, it has encountered political obstacles on the
international stage toward this end and been marginalized to an extent, Siew
said.</P>
      <P>He urged China to change its "rigid policies" in this regard, pointing out that
Taiwan would also like to open communication channels with Beijing to reduce
unnecessary misunderstandings and discuss a possible FTA between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Siew said that it is worth noting that ASEAN foreign ministers in a meeting in
July all welcomed statements on an improvement in cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>On pushing for Taiwan's inclusion in talks on regional economic integration,
Siew cited various statistics to illustrate  the importance of bilateral trade
between Taiwan and countries in East and Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>He noted that seven of Taiwan's top 10 trading partners are located in these
regions. According to Siew, Taiwan's trade with major ASEAN countries reached
US$60 billion for 2007, marking an increase of 17 percent over the previous
year's level.</P>
      <P>The figure represented 12.8 percent of Taiwan's total trade, surpassing the
United States for third spot on the list, according to Siew.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that as of the end of 2007, total Taiwan investment in
Southeast Asia had surpassed US$51.1 billion.</P>
      <P>Arguing that a Taiwan-ASEAN free trade pact would be beneficial to both sides,
Siew noted that Taiwan ranks as the third largest source of foreign investment
in Thailand and Cambodia and the largest source in Vietnam, with investment
amounting to US$1.8 billion in 2007 alone, up 630 percent over the previous
year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan investment in Singapore in 2007 reached US$1.2 billion, up 46 percent,
with the figure  for the Philippines  rising an astronomical 878 percent to
US$200 million, he added.</P>
      <P>All these statistics clearly illustrate that Taiwan has brought much
technological development and job opportunities to the region and that the
importance of this bilateral cooperation has been increasing significantly, Siew
said.</P>
      <P>He further said that the improvement in cross-strait relations since the
administration of President Ma Ying-jeou came to power in May of this year will
help reduce the obstacles to Taiwan and ASEAN negotiating a free trade pact.</P>
      <P>At the same time, he noted, Taiwan has been making preparations at home for the
start of FTA talks with ASEAN by continuing to strengthen economic and trade
contacts, establishing a special task force to lay the groundwork, planning more
overseas offices in member states, and increasing the number of staff working on
the "ASEAN + N" goal.</P>
      <P>Siew stressed  that Taiwan will use its geographical  and transportation
advantages to promote the development of peace and stability in the region and
at the same time maintain its practical approach to achieving greater economic
integration with the region to the benefit of all parties involved.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-East Asia FTA conference, held at the International Conference Hall
of National Chenghi University's Institute of International Relations, was
organized by the institute as well as the Bureau of Foreign Trade under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Arms sales symbolize improved Taiwan-U.S. mutual trust: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
10/11/08  19:11:09
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday the recent move by the United States to
sell weapons to Taiwan symbolizes an initial improvement in trust between the
two countries after it was seriously undermined during the tenure of the
previous Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration.</P>
      <P>The sale was "very important" to both Taiwan and the United States because the
weapons systems will meet Taiwan's defense needs and demonstrate Taiwan's
determination to defend itself, Ma asserted as he met with a U.S. scholarly
delegation led by John Hamre, president and CEO of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.</P>
      <P>Despite concerns the Bush administration would pass off a decision on selling
advanced weapons to Taiwan to its successor, it notified Congress on Oct. 3 that
it had approved a package of possible arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The package includes 30 Apache attack helicopters, 330 advanced capability
Patriot (PAC-3)  missiles,  32 Harpoon sub-launched missiles, 182 guided Javelin
missile rounds, and four E-2T system upgrades.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that in his May 20 inaugural address, he pledged that Taiwan
would procure the necessary defensive weapons systems from foreign countries
while working to improve the country's relations with China.</P>
      <P>The arms package provided by the U.S. government represents not only U.S.
recognition of Taiwan's efforts in improving cross-Taiwan Strait ties but also a
continuation  of U.S.-Taiwan  security cooperation, he said.</P>
      <P>Also helpful to the restoration of mutual trust between Taipei and Washington
was his decision to keep his August U.S. stopovers low-profile, Ma continued.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the purpose of the decision was to make the United States and
the world realize that he had no intention of engaging in any unnecessary
activities that might raise the concern of the host country.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's quest for broader international space, Ma said the government has
adopted a pragmatic approach and promoted a bid for Taiwan's "meaningful
participation" in U.N. specialized agencies, in substitution for the high-
profile drive pushed by the former DPP administration for U.N. membership under
the name "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The latest bid "unexpectedly" received positive responses in the international
community, with the United States openly expressing its support through its
mission to the United Nations, Ma noted.</P>
      <P>"This has increased our confidence in the strategy that we are following," he
said.</P>
      <P>In terms of cross-strait relations, Ma said ties have been progressing steadily
since the two sides resumed dialogue in June after a hiatus of almost 10 years.</P>
      <P>Following the launch of nonstop cross-strait charter flights on weekends, the
arrival of Chinese tourists to Taiwan and cross-strait currency trading over the
past months, the two sides will soon begin negotiations on the opening of more
direct cross-strait air routes, cargo charter flights and direct shipping links,
he said.</P>
      <P>According to the president, Taiwan will also seek to discuss with China issues
concerning Taiwan's international  space,  on the condition that the country's
sovereignty and interests are protected.</P>
      <P>Although the opposition is strongly critical of the "modus vivendi" approach
adopted by Ma's administration, the president argued that the government "has so
far not damaged Taiwan's dignity a bit, " but has instead won more friends than
before and restored the trust of many friends in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan advised to gain access to ASEAN as 'economic entity'</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A former secretary-general of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
suggested Saturday that Taiwan be "practical" and bid for access to the regional
political and economic bloc as an economic entity rather than a sovereign
nation.</P>
      <P>Rodolfo C. Severino from the Philippines made the suggestion at the first
Taiwan-East Asia Conference on Free Trade Agreement, which opened earlier in the
day in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Severino said he understands how much Taiwan wants to join ASEAN, and that he
knows Taiwan is an important trade partner to Southeast Asian countries, but
felt Taiwan should still be practical in seeking participation in the 10-country
organization.</P>
      <P>Severino noted that in addition to Taiwan, many East Asian countries, New
Zealand and Australia have also expressed their desire to become ASEAN members,
and that Singapore -- one of 10 members of the regional organization -- will
sign a free trade agreement with China next month.</P>
      <P>Severino was invited to deliver a keynote speech at the two-day conference
organized by the Institute of International Relations of National Chengchi
University and the Bureau of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs.</P>
      <P>In the speech,  Severino said ASEAN was delighted to see cross-Taiwan Strait
relations becoming increasingly stable.  He stressed peace and stability, and
economic and trade development are the highest guiding principles in the ASEAN
charter.</P>
      <P>Based on his experience with ASEAN from 1998 to 2002, Severino said the
association was concerned whether China and Taiwan would maintain a stable
relationship because conflicts and threats were the last thing the regional
group wanted to see in Asia.</P>
      <P>ASEAN has been hoping that Taiwan and China reach agreements in many different
fields, he noted.</P>
      <P>ASEAN,  formed in 1967, comprises Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Brunei, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.</P>

      <P>Violations of intellectual property rights (IPR) were the most common economic
crimes in the first eight months of the year, Ministry of the Interior
statistics showed Saturday.</P>
      <P>Ministry officials said police reported 7,155 economic crimes during the eight-
month period, and IPR violations accounted for 56 percent of them.</P>
      <P>Following IPR violations were financial violations at 25 percent and smuggling
cases at 6.2 percent, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The economic crimes involved a total of NT$18.9 billion over the eight months,
they said.</P>
      <P>To curb economic  crimes and protect legal operators  and consumers, police have
actively clamped down on illegal economic activities in recent years, the MOI
said, leading to an increase in economic crimes in terms of numbers and
violators reported.</P>
      <P>Those numbers have finally begun to decrease this year, the MOI noted.</P>
      <P>In the first eight months, 9,361 people committed 7,155 economic crimes, down
from the same period last year, mainly because of a dramatic decrease in
smuggling, producing and selling bootleg liquor, they said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>World-class physicists Yang Chen-ning and Paul Chu reflected on their own
scientific careers Saturday and encouraged young people to maintain their
passion for whatever they do and not to fear failure.</P>
      <P>At a workshop titled "The Allure of Physics" held by the Lung Yingtai Cultural
Foundation, Chu and Yang shared their successful experience with the audience,
saying that passion and curiousity are the most important forces that compel
students to persist with their studies.</P>
      <P>"If you fall down, you will at least have a handful of sand, " said Chu at the
workshop, stressing that opportunities can be created out of failure and young
people should know their qualities and limits.</P>
      <P>Yang also reminded the audience that if they take failure as a hardship, they
may have little chance of success, as hope and the desire to persevere as well
as having passion for one's vocation are the real driving forces.</P>
      <P>He further said that if one can find a flaw in something that everyone believe's
to be true, that person's contribution to the world is even more important.</P>
      <P>Yang also noted that people will have to face more complicated and serious
problems in the coming decades, and encouraged the students to develop a broader
perspective and vision to serve society.</P>
      <P>Those interest in scientific careers will also need a healthy dose of patience,
Yang said.</P>
      <P>Though China and Taiwan have invested a huge amount of money in scientific
research, the 86-year-old Yang indicated that neither country should be anxious
to have a Nobel Prize laureate, as "scientific research needs long-term
development."</P>
      <P>Born in 1922, Yang received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 for his
contribution to the theory of the nonconservation of parity in weak
interactions.</P>
      <P>The 67-year-old Chu, who is currently the president of the Hong Kong University
of Science and Technology and the executive director of Texas Center for
Superconductivity, has pioneered developments in the field of superconductivity.</P>
      <P>He was selected "Best Researcher" in the United States by U.S. News and World
Report in 1990.</P>
      <P>Asked about his plans after leaving his post, Chu said that he will try to hook
up with international scientists to discover a room temperature superconductor.</P>
      <P>Superconductivity is a phenomenon occurring in certain materials at very low
temperatures, featuring zero electrical resistance and the exclusion of the
interior magnetic field.</P>
      <P>The workshop was hosted by the renowned writer Lung Ying-tai and Li Chia-wei, a
professor in the Department of Life Sciences at National Tsing Hua University
and also editor in chief of the Chinese version of Scientific American.</P>
      <P>The foundation, established in 2005, organizes regular workshops featuring
international intellectuals in different fields in an effort to broaden the
vision of young citizens.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's top negotiator with China said Saturday that closer cross-Taiwan
Strait exchanges will not lead to a tilt toward China, but will help Taiwan's
economy.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, also said that
without a stable cross-strait relationship, Taiwan would have trouble building a
prosperous economy.</P>
      <P>Chiang dismissed worries that Taiwan could tilt toward China with closer
exchanges, saying that with more interaction between the two sides, China will
increasingly value Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>As long as Taiwan moves toward a quality democracy, encompassing the rule of
law, human rights, prosperity and civility, "Chinese people will envy Taiwan,"
Chiang argued.</P>
      <P>He noted that the concept of "Taiwan-centric consciousness" is based on
"economic prosperity and quality democracy, " and the key to achieving  economic
prosperity  lies with improved cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Through his frequent visits to China, especially in the past three years, Chiang
said he came to realize that the development of cross-strait relations will
affect Taiwan's economy the most.</P>
      <P>"Without stable and peaceful cross-strait relations, Taiwan's economy will not
get better," he said.</P>
      <P>He said that the dignity of the nation hinges on the economy, saying that "when
the economy is strong, others will respect you, but when the economy is in poor
shape, they will look down on you."</P>
      <P>He said that when cross-strait relations are peaceful and trade is normalized,
Taiwan's economy will fare better than that of other countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei Zoo panned for failing to phase out smoking areas</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The John Tung Foundation (JTF) slammed the Taipei Zoo Saturday for continuing to
maintain outdoor smoking areas inside its complex, saying the city zoo has set a
bad example for the campaign against smoking.</P>
      <P>Lin Ching-li, a JTF section chief in charge of tobacco hazards control and
prevention, said the foundation has received complaints from a number of
citizens in recent weeks about the presence of outdoor smoking areas inside the
city zoo.</P>
      <P>One of those sounding off said he didn't know how to explain the concept of a
smoking ban to his young children when people were lighting up in the zoo's
"smoking areas" despite a sign at the zoo's main entrance clearly stating that
smoking is not allowed inside its compound, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>A survey by JTF staff showed that there are three smoking areas inside the zoo,
with one close to its main gate and another close to vending machines in its
temperate zone animals area, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Although the new version of the Tobacco Hazards Prevention and Control Act that
completely bars smoking in 13 types of venues will soon take effect on Jan. 11,
2009, the city zoo has yet to install posters or signboards inside its complex.</P>
      <P>"It seems to me that zoo administrators do not think that any improvement is
needed with regard to its duty to discourage smoking and create a smoking-free
environment inside its compound," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Yao Su-yuan, dean of Chinese Culture University's College of Law, said the
revised anti-smoking act clearly defines which places will be subject to a
complete smoking ban and which will be allowed to set up an outdoor smoking
area.</P>
      <P>The city zoo, which accommodates 4 million visitors annually, should fall within
the category subject to a complete smoking ban because its main visitors are
children and their parents, and its main function is for public education, Yao
said.</P>
      <P>Even if zoo officials don't think the zoo is an educational place, Yao said,
they should not have installed smoking areas in locations that most zoo visitors
pass by.</P>
      <P>Lin insists that education should be the zoo's primary mission since it is
placed under the city's Education Department.</P>
      <P>Responding to the foundation's criticism, Taipei Zoo Director Jason Yeh said zoo
officials will step up anti-smoking publicity in the future as smoking is
detrimental to health.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he said, visitors to the zoo include parents and smoking addicts.
In consideration of their needs, he said, the zoo must still maintain smoking
areas.</P>
      <P>But he promised that the smoking area near the zoo's entrance will be closed and
designate new areas in more "remote places" that fewer people frequent.</P>
      <P>"We'll also add a no-smoking mark on the zoo's admission ticket," Yeh said.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou and visiting Guatemalan  President  Alvaro Colom
Caballeros  signed a joint communique Saturday, pledging to strengthen
cooperation in key areas and boost bilateral ties of more than seven decades.</P>
      <P>Colom, who arrived at Taipei Wednesday to attend the ROC Double Ten National Day
celebrations, called on Ma at the Presidential Office to sign the joint
communique before his departure.</P>
      <P>In the communique, the two presidents expressed gratification at the completion
of the first stage in the expansion of the CA-09 highway in the Central American
country and expressed hope that second-stage work will begin as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>In addition to the three-phase expansion of the highway, the two also planned to

route leading to Port Barrios.</P>
      <P>The two reaffirmed continuing cooperation in developing automated fingerprint
identification systems for Guatemalan police to help authorities improve social
order.</P>
      <P>President Ma also said Taiwan will help Guatemala improve its penitentiary
system, including constructing a prison.</P>
      <P>On bilateral  ties,  the two presidents  reviewed Taiwan's cooperation programs
in Guatemala.</P>
      <P>President  Colom  expressed  his  appreciation  to Taiwan's agricultural
missions stationed in his country, and specifically highlighted the benefits
brought about by papaya exports, vegetable cultivation and exports, and tilapia
cultivation.</P>
      <P>The two presidents also stressed cooperation in various fields, including
improving life in rural areas of Guatemala by promoting food safety, the
elimination of poverty, housing construction, vocational training for women and
health care.</P>
      <P>On bilateral trade,  the two presidents agreed to promote Taiwanese investment
in Guatemala and seek new policies to boost trade relations so that the benefits
from a bilateral free trade agreement, which came into effect in July 2006, can
be optimized.</P>
      <P>The two presidents also stressed the importance of Taiwan's investment and trade
office stationed in the country in terms of providing guidance to small-  and
medium-sized enterprises and narrowing Guatemala's digital divide.</P>
      <P>President Colom also expressed his intention to invite Taiwan's Formosa Plastics
Group to invest in an integrated energy project in his country.</P>
      <P>Guatemala is one of Taiwan's 23 diplomatic allies, half of which are in Latin

    <HEADLINE>Ex-adviser authorizes account checks in money laundering probe</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A former presidential adviser has authorized prosecutors to check his overseas
bank accounts in the probe into an alleged money laundering  case involving
former President Chen Shui-bian and his family, prosecutorial sources said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-nan, director of the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office, told a news conference that Wu Li-pei, a Presidential Office
senior adviser during Chen Shui-bian's presidency, has signed an authorization
letter for prosecutors to review transaction records of his four bank accounts
in two foreign countries to verify his testimony.</P>
      <P>Wu signed the authorization letter after being interrogated by prosecutors as a
witness for more than four hours earlier in the day about Chen Shui-bian's
recent revelation that his wife had wired nearly US$2 million from her overseas
bank account to an elder pro-independence activist in February to promote
Taiwan's cause in the international community.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors investigating Chen Shui-bian and his family's alleged money
laundering case found that former first lady Wu Shu-jen remitted a total of
US$1.918 million from her account at ABN AMRO Bank's Singapore branch on Feb.21
and Feb.22 this year, shortly after Swiss prosecution authorities froze
deposits, totaling US$21 million, at Swiss bank accounts of members of Chen's
family.</P>
      <P>According  to prosecutors,  the money  was wired  in four installments into four
accounts under two different designations.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian confirmed the remittances during a Taipei District Court hearing
Oct.8 on former Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau chief Yeh Sheng-mao's
concealment of information provided early  this  year by the international
anti-money  laundering organization Egmont Group about suspected money
laundering by members of Chen's family. He argued at the court that the money
remitted to a pro-independence elder would be used for Taiwan's diplomatic
causes.</P>
      <P>Wu Li-pei came forward the following day to admit that he was the recipient of
the money wired by the former first lady in February.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors summoned Wu for questioning about the flow and functions of the
money. Wu was quoted as having told prosecutors that the money remains in his
four bank accounts in two countries and will be used specifically for Taiwan's
diplomatic operations in the future.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he himself is the beneficiary of the money, Wu told prosecutors
that he was not helping Chen launder money.</P>
      <P>After securing Wu's authorization letter, prosecutors said they will review Wu's
overseas bank accounts to get to bottom of the case.</P>
      <P>Two of the former president's aides as well as the ex-first lady's older brother
and the younger brother of one of her college classmates have been held
incommunicado in the probe into the alleged money laundering case.</P>

      <P>Responding to the foundation's criticism, Taipei Zoo Director Jason Yeh said zoo
officials will step up anti-smoking publicity in the future as smoking is
detrimental to health.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he said, visitors to the zoo include parents and smoking addicts.
In consideration of their needs, he said, the zoo must still maintain smoking
areas.</P>
      <P>But he promised that the smoking area near the zoo's entrance will be closed and
designate new areas in more "remote places" that fewer people frequent.</P>
      <P>"We'll also add a no-smoking mark on the zoo's admission ticket," Yeh said.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou and visiting Guatemalan  President  Alvaro Colom
Caballeros  signed a joint communique Saturday, pledging to strengthen
cooperation in key areas and boost bilateral ties of more than seven decades.</P>
      <P>Colom, who arrived at Taipei Wednesday to attend the ROC Double Ten National Day
celebrations, called on Ma at the Presidential Office to sign the joint
communique before his departure.</P>
      <P>In the communique, the two presidents expressed gratification at the completion
of the first stage in the expansion of the CA-09 highway in the Central American
country and expressed hope that second-stage work will begin as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>In addition to the three-phase expansion of the highway, the two also planned to

    <TEXT>
      <P>A former presidential adviser has authorized prosecutors to check his overseas
bank accounts in the probe into an alleged money laundering  case involving
former President Chen Shui-bian and his family, prosecutorial sources said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-nan, director of the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office, told a news conference that Wu Li-pei, a Presidential Office
senior adviser during Chen Shui-bian's presidency, has signed an authorization
letter for prosecutors to review transaction records of his four bank accounts
in two foreign countries to verify his testimony.</P>
      <P>Wu signed the authorization letter after being interrogated by prosecutors as a
witness for more than four hours earlier in the day about Chen Shui-bian's
recent revelation that his wife had wired nearly US$2 million from her overseas
bank account to an elder pro-independence activist in February to promote
Taiwan's cause in the international community.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors investigating Chen Shui-bian and his family's alleged money
laundering found that former first lady Wu Shu-jen remitted a total of US$1.918
million from her account at ABN AMRO Bank's Singapore branch on Feb.21 and
Feb.22 this year, shortly after Swiss prosecution authorities froze deposits,
totaling US$21 million, at Swiss bank accounts of members of Chen's family.</P>
      <P>According  to prosecutors,  the money  was wired  in four installments into four
accounts under two different designations.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian confirmed the remittances during a Taipei District Court hearing
Oct.8 on former Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau chief Yeh Sheng-mao's
concealment of information provided early  this  year by the international
anti-money  laundering organization Egmont Group about suspected money
laundering by members of Chen's family. He argued at the court that the money
remitted to a pro-independence elder would be used for Taiwan's diplomatic
cause.</P>
      <P>Wu Li-pei came forward the following day to admit that he was the recipient of
the money wired by the former first lady in February.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors summoned Wu for questioning about the flow and use of the money. Wu
was quoted as having told prosecutors that the money remains in the four bank
accounts in two countries and will be used specifically for Taiwan's diplomatic
operations in the future.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he himself is the beneficiary of the money, Wu told prosecutors
that he was not helping Chen launder money. None of the accounts were in Wu's
name, but he had access to all the accounts.</P>
      <P>After securing Wu's authorization letter, prosecutors said they will review Wu's
overseas bank accounts to get to bottom of the case.</P>
      <P>Two of the former president's aides as well as the ex-first lady's older brother
and the younger brother of one of her college classmates have been held
incommunicado in the probe into the alleged money laundering case.</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) rejected charges Sunday that a restricted
area set up in Yilan County for Chinese fishermen will enable them to work in
Taiwan and insisted that Chinese nationals are still barred from taking up jobs
in the country.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan was responding to a local media report that the
Council of Agriculture (COA) had opened a small section of Nanfangao port where
Chinese workers could perform odd jobs and stay overnight and that it was
planning to extend the measure to other locations.</P>
      <P>Opposition legislators and labor groups criticized the move and accused
President Ma Ying-jeou of reneging on a campaign promise not to allow Chinese
workers on Taiwanese soil.</P>
      <P>Lai denied, however, that the government has altered its stance on the issue,
and explained that allowing the Chinese fishermen to stay ashore was merely an
extension of their offshore activities aboard Taiwanese fishing boats, and that
they were not earning extra pay for their works on land.</P>
      <P>She asserted that the measure will not negatively  impact employment
opportunities for Taiwanese workers, because Chinese fishermen employed by local
fishing vessels will do the same jobs as before even though they can now be
housed on shore.</P>
      <P>"The government has no plans to open its door to Chinese laborers at the
present," she said.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued later Sunday, the COA's Fisheries Agency confirmed that
Chinese fishermen would be limited in the restricted area to jobs that would
also be done on board the fishing vessels, such as repairing nets.</P>
      <P>It also stressed that the principle of allowing local fishing boats to hire
Chinese fishermen offshore to help with tasks offshore had not changed, and that
the Chinese fishermen would not be allowed to take on jobs outside the
restricted area.</P>
      <P>Labor rights groups have argued that some of the jobs the Chinese fishermen
would be allowed to do in the areas should be performed by domestic workers,
especially at a time of rising unemployment, and accused the government of
"permitting Chinese laborers to work in Taiwan in a disguised form."</P>
      <P>The COA is expected to set up similar port centers for Chinese fishermen in Wuci
in central Taiwan's Taichung County by the end of this year, while similar areas
would be established in other regions next year, such as in the Keelung and
Hsinchu areas in northern Taiwan and Pingtung County in southern Taiwan, news
reports said.</P>
      <P>In the past, Chinese fishermen have not been permitted to set foot on Taiwan's
shores except to take refuge when strong typhoons affect waters around the
island.</P>

      <P>The government will conduct a survey to explore public opinion on a planned
visit to Taiwan by a key Beijing official in the near term, Research,
Development, and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) Chairman Jiang Yi-hua said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The possible visit of Chen Yunlin, who serves as China's top liaison with Taiwan
as president of the quasi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS) , has drawn a mixed response in Taiwan, and the RDEC will conduct
a poll to gauge public opinion on Chen's visit and its impact on two-way
exchanges, Jiang said.</P>
      <P>Results of the survey will be turned over to related agencies as references to
assist in policy-making, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen's planned visit to Taiwan at the end of October and the beginning of
November has met with resistance from the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and pro-independence groups.</P>
      <P>The DPP has set October as a "month of civic activities, " and it will hold a
vigil on the night of Nov. 1 on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential
Office and launch a demonstration the next day to protest what they believe to
be President Ma Ying-jeou's tilt toward China and the government's poor
performance.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said Oct. 9 that the
government would form a cross-agency task force to take charge of Chen's visit.</P>
      <P>Chen is slated to hold talks with his Taiwan counterpart -- Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung -- while here.</P>
      <P>Chen would be the highest-ranking People's Republic of China official ever to
visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In their scheduled talks in Taipei, Chiang and Chen are expected to discuss the
establishment of direct cargo charter flights and shipping links, the opening of
new passenger charter flight routes, crime-fighting, financial supervisory
cooperation and joint oil exploration in the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>51% of senior citizens have at least 3 chronic diseases: survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 50 percent of Taiwan's senior citizens   said  they  suffer   from  at
least   three professionally-diagnosed chronic diseases, with hypertension
topping the list, a Department of Health poll has revealed.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Mei-ling, director of the Bureau of Health Promotion under the Cabinet-
level DOH, said the bureau conducted a survey on senior citizens' overall
condition in 2007 as part of a long-term study on the mental  and physical
health  of middle-aged  and elderly individuals.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,700 valid samples were collected.</P>
      <P>Survey results showed that the five most common chronic diseases troubling
senior citizens were hypertension,  cataracts,  heart disease, ulcers or gastric
diseases, and arthritis or rheumatism, in that order, according to Hsiao.</P>
      <P>In the survey, nearly 90 percent of the respondents said they were suffering
from at least one chronic disease, 70 percent said they were suffering from two
or more chronic diseases, and 51 percent said they had three or more chronic
diseases.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that women were more vulnerable to chronic diseases than
males.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, hypertension and cataracts were the two most common
chronic diseases for both elderly men and women.</P>
      <P>The third through fifth most common chronic illnesses among women were
osteoporosis, arthritis or rheumatism, and heart diseases. For elderly men, the
third through fifth most common chronic ailments were heart disease, ulcers or
gastric diseases, and diabetes.</P>
      <P>Among the respondents, 16 percent said they smoked and 24 percent said they
consumed alcohol, while 34 percent said they did not exercise regularly. In
comparison, women exercised less than men, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>More than half of the respondents said they had undergone physical checkups over
the past year. The survey also found that the higher the individual's education
level, the more frequently they undergo physical exams.</P>
      <P>Comparing the findings with those recorded in a similar survey four years ago,
the number of smokers dropped from 19 percent to 16 percent, marking the most
significant improvement among various measurement indicators. The kidney
functions examination rate also went up significantly from 44 percent to 50
percent.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said the presence of chronic disease tends to be closely related to
personal lifestyle and health habits.</P>
      <P>Noting that regular health checkups and constant monitoring of blood pressure
and blood sugar levels can help prevent chronic diseases and cancer, she urged
senior citizens to make good use of the annual free checkup benefits under the
national health insurance program and free health services  offered by city and
county governments to improve their health and lives.</P>

      <P>A total of 2,500 volunteers will be recruited from students at 40 colleges and
universities nationwide to help promote sports on school campuses, the Ministry
of Education said in a statement Sunday.</P>
      <P>The aim of the campaign is to offer guidance and assistance to schools' physical
education programs and help schoolchildren develop the habit of exercising and
appreciate the benefit and enjoyment of participating in sports, a statement
issued by the ministry said.</P>
      <P>Under the program, well-trained and qualified volunteers will be dispatched
during the upcoming winter vacation to 103 elementary and junior high schools
across the country, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>Since 2006 when the ministry began recruiting college and university students to
offer such volunteer services, more than 2,000 students have been certified as
qualified to serve as sports promoters at schools around the country, it noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese students,  like their counterparts in neighboring countries, usually
face great academic pressure at school as a result of intense competition to get
into a good school at the next level, reducing the amount of time students, or

      <P>Taiwan's government, fearing that the panic selling that has overtaken world
stock markets could continue this week, decided Sunday to temporarily narrow the
limit on share price declines and extend a ban on short selling on the Taiwan
Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>Local shares, which normally are not allowed to rise or fall by more than 7
percent in any trading session, will now be limited to declines of 3.5 percent,
announced Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman Gordon Chen.</P>
      <P>The 7 percent limit-up remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>"The measures are aimed to cushion the impacts from the nosedives of the Dow
Jones Industrial Average in the U.S. and the bourses in Asia last Friday, " Chen
said at a press conference Sunday evening. "We wanted to give investors time to
observe market conditions."</P>
      <P>Chen and Finance Minister Lee Sush-der anticipated that the measure would be in
place for roughly one week, but with the uncertainty that remains in financial
markets around the world, they would not specify a firm timetable for the plan.</P>
      <P>The government will not, however, halt trading during this turbulent period.</P>
      <P>"We are not considering shutting down the market because our bourse's
fundamentals are still strong," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The FSC's Chen also announced that short-selling would be barred until the end
of October. A temporary ban on short-selling announced Sept. 30 was to have
expired Oct. 14.</P>
      <P>The government also decided to ask the management of the National Stabilization
Fund to continue to intervene in the market, probably for a month, to keep it
from falling too precipitously.</P>
      <P>The fund, consisting of four funds held by the government, began intervening
when Taiwan's market plunged last month and was supposed to pull back from the
market by Oct. 17 when its one-month authorization was to expire.</P>
      <P>The local market got a respite Friday when it was closed for the country's
National Day, as other Asian markets suffered steep losses. Japan's benchmark
Nikkei Index fell by 9.62 percent while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 7.19
percent.</P>
      <P>The Dow later opened down 600 points Friday before recovering to close 128
points, or 1.5 percent, lower.</P>
      <P>The finance ministers of the Group of 7 nations issued a five-point plan Friday
aimed at reversing the credit crisis that has engulfed global financial
institutions and sent markets tumbling.</P>
      <P>But it was unclear if the plan's commitment to protect major banks, revive the
mortgage financing market and get credit flowing more freely would calm investor
nerves when markets open in Asia Monday.</P>
      <P>Local officials were fearful that the global panic would continue to hit the
local bourse and push the benchmark index below 5,000 for the first time since
July 2003 when Taiwan was emerging from an economic slowdown caused by the SARS
crisis.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Taiex index reached its highest close for the year of 9,295 on May 19,
the day before President Ma Ying-jeou was inaugurated but has shed more than 40
percent of its value since then.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's 'diplomatic truce' favored by the U.S.: scholars</HEADLINE>

      <P>The United States backs President Ma Ying-jeou's tactic of pursuing adiplomatic
trucewith China and Beijing should do more to respond to Taiwan's good will, a
panel of U.S. scholars said in Taipei Sunday.</P>
      <P>There is a consensus of support of what Ma is doing in Washington and that the
overall view is that what he is doing is constructive, smart and strategic, said
Derek Mitchell, senior fellow of the U.S. think tank Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS).</P>
      <P>The scholars were speaking at an international forum titled "The Taipei-
Washington-Beijing Relations: A Common Agendaheld by the Taipei-based think tank
Foundation on International &amp; Cross-Strait Studies (FICS) and the CSIS.</P>
      <P>Since assuming the presidency May 20, Ma has pursued a "modus vivendi"
diplomatic strategy, papering over Taipei's differences with Beijing to find a
mutually beneficial equilibrium.</P>
      <P>It has also sought a "diplomatic truceto end a longstanding tug-of-war with
China over each other's allies and carve out a greater international presence
for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The lack of a tangible response to the strategy from Beijing, however, has
sparked criticism and suspicions that Ma's diplomatic approach is merely wishful
thinking.</P>
      <P>Mitchell urged China to do more to react to Taiwans good will.</P>
      <P>China got what it wanted from the Kuomintang government but right now it doesn't
know exactly what to do with it,Mitchell said, citing the question of Taiwan's
participation in the World Health Assembly as one example of Beijing having yet
to decide how much of a presence Taiwan should have in the international
community.</P>
      <P>He contended that the U.S. should encourage China to recognize that the window
of opportunity is closing and tell Beijing it should be thinking about the long-
term rather than than trying to wring concessions from Taiwan's government in
the short-term.</P>
      <P>Mitchell said Taiwan's main point of leverage with China is its people, and
Taiwan should therefore make a point to Beijing that it should respond to what
Ma is doing and to the wishes of Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mitchell also suggested that Taiwan needs to maintain its high road
in serving as asuccessful storyin terms of its democracy and open its society to
other countries in the world, while continuing to put the ball in China's court
for it to respond responsibly.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the same occasion, Douglas Paal, former chairman of the American
Institute in Taiwan and now the vice president for study at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, said Beijing may have already passively
consented to a diplomatic truce, citing as an example China's lack of action
thus far in responding to Paraguay's interest to switch diplomatic recognition
from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Paal contended, however, that in addressing a diplomatic truce and international
participation, there has to be an adherence to the ambiguous formula of a one-
China principle.</P>
      <P>Success in managing the diplomatic truce is complementary to achieving success
in international organizations,he added.</P>
      <P>Paal said Taiwan's participation in the international community comprises
different types of activities, including participation in established
international organizations such as those inside and outside the United Nations
system and participation in some form of representation in capitals that
recognize Beijing.</P>
      <P>He also contended that there should be greater freedom of travel for Taiwan's
officials to capitals and states that do not recognize Taipei and for Taiwan's
nongovernmental organizations and civil societies to perform their functions in
countries that recognize Bejing.</P>

      <P>The Fisheries Agency under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) has
launched a four-year assistance program to entice Taiwanese people to work on
local fishing boats, the agency said Sunday in a statement.</P>
      <P>Those willing to work on board Taiwanese fishing vessels would receive
NT$240,000 (US$7,300) in subsidies in the first and second years of their
employment,  NT$200,000 in the third year and NT$180,000 in the fourth year,
according to the agency.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries Agency encouraged local residents to take part in the program to
assist in the ailing domestic fishing industry, and added that relevant
information is available at local fishermen's associations where applications
for the 350 places under the program can be submitted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's fishing industry has long been plagued by an acute labor squeeze. Local
fishing vessels were allowed to hire Chinese fishermen offshore beginning 15
years ago to mitigate the shortage, but the local fishing sector would like to
attract more Taiwanese workers at a time when it wants to pursue sustainable
growth.</P>
      <P>The number of Chinese fishermen employed by Taiwanese fishing vessels hit a high
of some 25,000 in 2005.</P>
      <P>The figure has plunged to around 5,000 or 6,000 this year due to reduced
operations offshore or in open seas by local fishing boats because of a huge
spike in fuel prices.</P>

      <P>I think the U.S. will agree with President Ma that this notification that has
been sent to the Congress symbolizes the beginning of rebuilding trust between
the U.S. and Taiwan, Glaser told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Glaser, in Taipei to attend an international forum on the triangular relations
among Taipei, Washington and Beijing, said Taiwan was very unlikely to engage in
negotiations with China as long as it remained in an insecure and vulnerable
position.</P>
      <P>The sale, Glaser said, was a signal from the U.S. to "ensure the confidence of
people here and the administration, so they can deal with the mainland from a
position of strength.</P>
      <P>Many in Taiwan were concerned that approval of the arms package would be put off
until a new administration took power in the U.S. next year,  with government
critics suggesting the long delay indicated poor relations between Ma's
administration and the U.S. government.</P>
      <P>But Glaser suggested that reaching a consensus in the U.S. on all of the items
took time, and that the timing of the approval, which came after the regular
congressional session had already ended, was also critical to the trilateral
relations among Taiwan, China and the U.S.</P>
      <P>I think the U.S. just tried to, or at least took into account, some of the
mainland's sensitivities on these issues,she contended, saying there is never a
good time to announce the arms sales from Chinas point of view because Beijing
always opposes any sale of arms to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Glaser said it would have been especially bad timing from China's point of view
if the notification of the sales came during the Beijing Olympic Games held in
August.</P>
      <P>We do take into account certain factors because we would like to limit the
damage on U.S.-Chinese ties and I think it's in Taiwan's interest for us to
limit the damage to U.S.-Chinese ties, Glaser said.So the issue is when, not
whether.</P>
      <P>The arms package includes 30 Apache attack helicopters, 330 Patriot PAC-3
missiles, 182 Javelin middle-range anti-tank missiles, 32 sea-launched Harpoon
missiles, four E-2T aircraft system upgrades.</P>
      <P>The U.S. did not, however, approve diesel-electric submarines and Black Hawk
helicopters that Taiwan had sought.</P>
      <P>The sales were made under the auspices of the Taiwan Relations Act, which
authorizes the U.S. to sell defensive weapons needed by Taiwan to maintain a
sound defense.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Memorial service held for late fugitive in his hometown</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 12, (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than a thousand people attended amemorial service for late fugitive and
former lawmaker Wu Tse-yuan at his hometown in Wandan, Pingtung County Sunday.</P>
      <P>Notable among the attendees were Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman John Kuan, Wu's
younger brother Wu Jin-lin, who is currently the vice president of the
Examination Yuan, Legislative Yuan Deputy Speaker Tseng Yung-chuan and several
other KMT lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Cheng Ta-yi, a friend of the late fugitive and organizer of the service, lauded
Wu Tse-yuan's contribution to Pingtung County during his term as chief of the
southern Taiwan county between 1993 and 1997.</P>
      <P>The organizer screened a documentary highlighting Wu Tse-yuan's political career
and his work in Pingtung.</P>
      <P>Cheng said Wu's life was filled with hardship but he transcended those problems
during the latter stage of his life while he was on the run in China and devoted
himself to the study of the ancient Chinese classic Tao Te Ching.</P>
      <P>"His mind was filled with peace and joy rather than resentment and grief when he
left the world." Cheng said.</P>
      <P>He said that the deceased's family members and friends are compiling his
writings on Tao Te Ching with an eye to publishing it soon.</P>
      <P>On his part, Wu Jin-lin recalled his brother's work on behalf of his home county
and thanked those in attendance for taking part in the service.</P>
      <P>Wu was a political star of the KMT when he shattered Democratic Progressive
Party magistrate candidate Su Cheng-chang's re-election bid by winning the
election for magistrate of Pingtung County in 1993.</P>
      <P>But he began to lose grace with the public after he was convicted for taking
bribes in the construction of a wastewater processing plant in Banciao, Taipei
County, while serving in the Taiwan Provincial Government in 1992.</P>
      <P>He was sentenced to 15 years in jail by the Taiwan High Court in 1998 but was
released on bail for medical reasons.</P>
      <P>He won a seat in the legislature later the same year while he was free on bail,
but then jumped bail in 2001 while traveling overseas after failing in his bid
for re-election to the lawmaking body.</P>
      <P>After hiding in southern China for many years, he died Sept. 22 of diabetes in
Beijing.</P>

in literature to self-exiled mainland Chinese writer Gao Xingjian, saying that

unattractive; it is simple, and yet full of grace; it is easy, and yet
methodical."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>President's attendance at APEC summit unlikely: foreign minister</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs expressed pessimism Monday about the possibility of
President Ma Ying-jeou being allowed to take part in the annual informal
leadership summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) ,
despite improvement in Taiwan's relations with China.</P>
      <P>"The matter involves a high degree of difficulty," Francisco H.L. Ou said.</P>
      <P>However, Ou said the government will work toward the goal of sending an official
at the highest level possible to attend the summit on Ma's behalf.</P>
      <P>Ou was commenting on a proposal by Douglas Paal, former Taipei Office director
of the American Institute in Taiwan, that Ma seek to participate in the APEC
summit under a proper title.</P>
      <P>Raising the proposal during a conference held Sunday in Taipei, Paal, currently
vice president of the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,
said Ma's participation in the summit could be possible in the coming two to
three years thanks to his efforts to improve cross-Taiwan Strait relations
through a "modus vivendi" approach that advocates a "diplomatic truce" with
China.</P>
      <P>According to Paal, such an approach has received good responses from China, as
seen in the postponement of Paraguay's plan to switch diplomatic recognition
from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>APEC is one of the few international organizations that admits both Taiwan and
China as members. Due to China's opposition, Taiwan's president  has been barred
from attending the annual informal leadership meeting in person and instead has
had to name a special envoy on his behalf.</P>
      <P>It remains uncertain who will be appointed as Ma's envoy for the upcoming
informal APEC summit slated for Nov. 22-23 in Lima, Peru.</P>
      <P>The last summit held 2007 in Sydney, Australia was attended by Stan Shih,
founder of computer vendor Acer Inc., as the proxy of then President Chen Shui-
bian.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Top tourism official off to China to woo tourists</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top tourism official left for China Monday at the head of a promotion
mission to woo Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Janice Lai, director-general of the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, is visiting China in her capacity  as
chairwoman  of the nonprofit  Taiwan Tourism Association.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by executives of more than 100 travel agencies around Taiwan, Lai is
scheduled to spend two days in both Beijing and Nanjing to meet with national
and local Chinese tourism authorities.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the media at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, Lai expressed the
hope that Taiwan would attract around 20,000 Chinese tourists each month after
the number of cross-strait weekend charter flights and their destinations are
increased later this year.</P>
      <P>In Beijing, Lai is expected to meet with her Chinese counterpart, National
Tourism  Administration  Director  Shao  Qiwei,  for consultations on problems
facing the two sides in terms of tourism development across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lai and her group are also scheduled to organize Taiwan tourism workshops in
Beijing and Nanjing to discuss with Chinese officials and travel agency
operators issues that appear to be hampering the growth of Chinese arrivals to
Taiwan. The issues to be discussed include tour application procedures, flight
destinations and seats, pricing and quality, Lai said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not demanded that potential Chinese tourists to the island pay a
guarantee of 50,000 yuan in advance, she stressed.</P>
      <P>"It could be requirement of the Chinese travel agency operators, but Taiwan has
never made such demand," Lai said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Taiwan has also simplified  some procedures to facilitate Chinese
tourists, she said. For example, Chinese civil servants, students and retired
public functionaries can apply for tourism travel to Taiwan using photocopies of
their ID and travel documents, she added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the number of Chinese tourist arrivals usually increases during the
weekends when the nonstop cross-strait charter flights are in service, Lai said
that the number of such flights and the flight destinations should be increased.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA to offer subsidies to certain Kaohsiung growers for Jangmi losses</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
10/13/08  13:19:19
(By Steve Bercic)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) began accepting applications Monday for
subsidies to Kaohsiung County growers of corn, onions, leafy vegetables and
cauliflower who suffered crop losses when Typhoon Jangmi swept across Taiwan
late last month.</P>
      <P>Cash subsidies of NT$12,000 (US$370) per hectare will be offered to eligible
farmers, according to the county's Bureau of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The bureau said that as the county did not qualify for low interest loans or
cash subsidies under the Agricultural National Disaster Relief Regulations, it
applied to the COA for special subsidies because the losses suffered by growers
of corn, onion, leafy vegetable and cauliflower were particularly severe.</P>
      <P>The county suffered total crop losses of NT$60 million during Typhoon Jangmi.
The regulations state that losses must top NT$90 million for a county to qualify
for low-interest loans and NT$180 million to be eligible for cash subsidies.</P>
      <P>The bureau said the COA has agreed to provide special subsidies, adding that
affected growers can take documents of proof of their crop losses to the nearest
agricultural affairs office in their jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Applications will be accepted until Oct. 22, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>Following screening of the applications by the bureau and the COA's Agriculture
and Food Agency, the subsidies will immediately be dispersed to qualified
farmers.</P>
      <P>According to official tallies, Typhoon Jangmi caused an average of 15 percent
crop losses to about 1,100 acres of farmland in the county, translating into
nearly 200 acres of unharvestable crops.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan is Asia's best tourist destination: minister</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>On the occasion of the 69th Skal World Congress --  an annual convention  of
professionals  from the international  travel  and tourism  industry  --
Minister  of Transportation  and Communications Mao Chi-kuo on Monday urged
participants from all over the world to promote Taiwan as "Asia's finest tourist
destination."</P>
      <P>In Asia, Taiwan offers the most unique and friendly traveling experience that
will leave foreign tourists with the happiest memories, Mao said at the opening
of the convention in Taipei Monday. The government and private sector are
working together to develop tourism on the island by employing a series of
incentive measures and integrated policies, he added.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government launched a "Tour Taiwan 2008-2009" program on Feb. 15 with
an injection of NT$1 billion (US$31.25 million) into the country's tourism
industry and a goal of attracting four million international tourists this year
and 4.25 million in 2009.</P>
      <P>"We are trying to establish a high quality and highly unique tourism brand to
make Taiwan Asia's finest tourist destination, " Mao said.</P>
      <P>The minister noted that in its November and December 2007 TV programs, the
National Geographic Channel said "Taiwan may be Asia's best kept secret." The
New York Times in its issue of March 2 this year also referred Taipei as "one of
the most underrated tourist destinations in Asia," he added.</P>
      <P>"Our aim is to not only attract more foreign tourists to Taiwan but also to
enhance their level of satisfaction and desire to visit Taiwan again," Mao said.</P>
      <P>Echoing Mao's views, a panel of representatives from Skal International said
that Taiwan is a place worth visiting over and over again, as it offers a range
of travel experiences.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's beauty is not limited to its natural and man-made sceneries," Skal
International Taipei President Pauline Leung said. "The richness of its culture
and the friendliness shown by our people are major elements that touch your
heart."</P>
      <P>Earl Wieman, president of Skal International Taiwan, said some people might have
the misconception that Taipei is merely a concrete jungle, while others probably
do not know much about what they can do while in Taiwan. But, in fact, people
can find some of the most beautiful sceneries, the finest Chinese cuisine, the
richest culture, the safest streets and the most friendly people anywhere in the
world, he added.</P>
      <P>In line with the recent motto of "doing business among friends, " members of
Skal are encouraged to network with each other. The Skal Congress is considered
as an ideal meeting platform for members worldwide to not only to have a fun
week together, but also to enjoy the privileges of being members of the
organization.</P>
      <P>The 69th Skal World Congress attracted over 700 members, called "Skalleagues, "
from 176 Skal clubs in 59 countries. From Oct. 12-17 these tourism professionals
from around the world will not only attend many exciting events and social
functions, but will also join excursions to explore the beauty and other
attractions of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Skal, founded as an international association in 1934, is one of the largest
organizations of travel and tourism professionals in the world, embracing all
sectors of the travel and tourism industry. Its membership includes hoteliers,
travel agents, airline executives, and those working for the tourism media and
training for work in the many other branches of the industry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Performance of cross-strait charters barely satisfactory: CAA</HEADLINE>

      <P>The performance of the weekend cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights, marred by a
decreased number of flight destinations,  is  "barely  satisfactory, "  Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA) Director-General Lee Long-wen said Monday.</P>
      <P>Over the past 14 weeks since the charter flight services were launched, combined
passenger trips on Taiwanese and Chinese air carriers have reached approximately
200,000, with the passenger load factor averaging 84.8 percent, Lee said.</P>
      <P>However, he admitted, one of the contributing factors is that Taiwanese carriers
are now operating flights from only two Taiwan destinations.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks when asked about the issue by a lawmaker at ameeting of the
Legislative Yuan's Transportation Committee.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Legislator Huang Chao-shun said she believes the performance
of the weekend cross-strait charter flights deserves arating of only 25 on a
100-point scale, due to the reduction in the number of flight destinations.</P>
      <P>Refusing to rate the performance of the service, Deputy Minister of
Transportation and Communications Oliver F.L. Yu said the current performance is
"acceptable" because it meets market demand.</P>
      <P>Flight operations will break even on a passenger load factor of 65 percent and
the average passenger load factor of the weekend charter flights obviously has
exceeded that level, Yu noted.</P>
      <P>Under an agreement reached between Taiwan and China in June in Beijing, five
Chinese cities and eight Taiwanese destinations were opened to the nonstop
weekend cross-strait charter flight services that were launched on July 4.</P>
      <P>The cities were Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen and Nanjing in China, and
Taoyuan, Kaohsiung, Taichung, Taipei, Penghu, Hualien, Kinmen and Taitung in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While five Taiwanese airlines companies provided flights from Taipei, Kaohsiung,

      <P>It is not the time yet for the government to announce a halt to trading in the
domestic stock market despite the panic selling that has overtaken world stock
markets over the past week, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Hsieh
Hsiang-chuan said Monday.</P>
      <P>Although the Taiwan bourse also lost ground last week, it fared relatively
better than its U.S. and European counterparts, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>"All we need now is more confidence, " Hsieh said. "The administration is taking
every possible measure to stabilize the domestic bourse and calm the investors
in the face of disastrous stock nose dives that have sent shudders around the
globe.</P>
      <P>"I appeal to the country to face the problems courageously and to concertedly
work out solutions," he urged.</P>
      <P>In a contingency move, the government on Sunday temporarily narrowed the daily
limit on share price declines and extended a ban on short selling on the Taiwan
Stock Exchange in an attempt to avoid the panic selling that has overtaken world
stock markets since last week.</P>
      <P>Local shares, which normally are not allowed to rise or fall by more than 7
percent in any trading session, will be limited to declines of 3.5 percent
starting Monday, the Financial Supervisory Commission announced Sunday.</P>

      <P>Traffic conditions in Taipei City have improved markedly, as the number of
traffic accidents and traffic deaths have dropped since the beginning of this
year, the Taipei City Police Department said Monday.</P>
      <P>Forty-four citizens lost their lives in 43 traffic accidents in the first nine
months of this year, noticeably down from 70 people in 61 cases for the same
period last year, Taipei City police statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Of the 44 killed people, 16 were pedestrians, with 14 of them being over the age

by vehicles -- 12 cars and 4 large trucks -- rushing through the streets in
violation of traffic rules.</P>
      <P>Taipei in northern Taiwan is the country's largest city and has a population of
more than 2.5 million residents. Traffic congestion is common in its busy

      <P>Two Taipei city councilors of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
called Monday for comprehensive testing of all fire extinguishers at the city's
schools.</P>
      <P>Hung Chien-yi and Yen Sheng-kuan held a news conference to express their
concerns that many fire extinguishers at schools around the city are not up to
standard.</P>
      <P>In making their appeal, Hung and Yen displayed pictures of fire extinguishers at
Lishan Elementary School that posed safety concerns, including missing safety
pins from some of the extinguishers' triggers and serious corrosion of several
of the canisters.</P>
      <P>The councilors  expressed  doubts  about whether  the fire extinguishers were
merely "serving a decorative function," and they urged the Taipei Education
Department to carry out city-wide testing.</P>
      <P>Also attending the news conference was Wu Huei-lin, principal of Lishan
Elementary School, who said that the manufacturer conducts regular inspections
of the fire extinguishers every two months.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the school replaces any fire extinguishers that the manufacturer
decides are a safety problem.</P>
      <P>In response to the city councilors' calls, Wu Wen-chi, a division chief at the
Education Department, said that it will ask schools to carry out testing of all
their fire extinguishers within the next week.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City Fire Department made the same call and asked that the results of

    <HEADLINE>Cabinet to revise 2009 economic forecast downward</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet is expected in November to revise downward the economic growth
forecast for 2009, in light of the impact of the global financial crisis,
Council for Economic Planning and Development Chairman Chen Tain-jy said Monday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue during a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Economics
Committee, Chen admitted that the original projection of 5.08  percent  will be
"difficult  to achieve"  and "probably unattainable."</P>
      <P>Chen predicted that the financial crisis will be over by the end of the year,
but its substantive impact on Taiwan and the rest of the world is likely to last
for some time.</P>
      <P>If describing the crisis with weather terminology, Chen said the "typhoon's eye"
is looming over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It is our top priority to secure our financial system to protect houses from
collapsing," he said.</P>
      <P>Asked by legislators about the verity of a media report that the Cabinet is
planning to buy shares of private-owned banks with the National Development
Fund,  Chen dismissed the report as mere speculation.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Cabinet will not take such a measure into consideration because it
is unnecessary, as Taiwanese financial institutions are not as leveraged as
those in other countries.</P>
      <P>The CEPD chairman also indicated that the temporary move to halve the maximum
allowable daily drop in local shares from 7 percent to 3.5 percent for one week
starting Monday is not suitable to be carried out on a long-term basis because
it reduces capital mobility.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that the Cabinet has not ruled out the possibility of
extending the measure when its run expires at the end of the week.</P>
      <P>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned last week that the world economy is
experiencing a major downturn in the face of "the most dangerous financial shock
in mature markets since the 1930s."</P>
      <P>The IMF's latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) has forecast that economic growth
in advanced countries will be close to zero until at least mid-2009, while
growth in emerging and developing countries will slow to substantially lower
rates than in the recent past.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, growth is likely to reach 3.8 percent in 2008 and drop to 2.5 percent
in 2009, according to the WEO.</P>

      <P>A Tainan County Environmental Protection Bureau official who has been fighting
stage 3 colon cancer the past three years was halfway to fulfilling his dream of
circling Taiwan by bicycle after arriving in Taipei City Monday.</P>
      <P>Hou Chun-yen, the bureau's deputy director, and fellow cyclists who left Tainan
Oct.  10 paid a visit to the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) and were met by EPA Minister Stephen Shu-hung Shen.</P>
      <P>Hou and other cyclists  joined Shen in the signing of a declaration to push
efforts to save energy and cut carbon dioxide emissions in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After their stop in Taipei, Hou and his fellow cyclists hit the road again for
the northeastern county of Yilan, where they will start their ride down Taiwan's
eastern coastline to the south before returing to Tainan Oct. 17 if everything
goes as scheduled.</P>
      <P>Hou chose cycling  as his primary  form of exercise  and recuperation after
being diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer three years ago.</P>
      <P>To fulfill his dream of cycling around the island before succumbing to the
disease, Hou said he began intensive training six months ago to prepare himself
physically and mentally.</P>
      <P>"Now I found myself even stronger than I was three years ago and I'm more
confident in fighting cancer," Hou said.</P>
      <P>Hou and his group departed from Tainan at 5 a.m. Oct. 10 and cycled along a
northbound roadway and reached the coastal Danshuei township in the northern
county of Taipei in less than three days.</P>
      <P>Among Hou's fellow cyclists  from Tainan County  were two elementary school
students -- fourth grader Hu Teng-jen and sixth grader Lin Yu-hung.</P>
      <P>The two have not complained about their arduous journey on the road over the
past three days, and Lin, who noted he has learned a lot on the trip, said
completing the round-the-island tour would be an ideal graduation gift for him.</P>

weighted index losing 110.27 points, or 2.146 percent, to close at 5,020.44 at
the Taipei Stock Exchange Monday.</P>
      <P>Despite new measures to shore up stock market announced by the government the
previous day, including halving the daily decline limit from the normal 7
percent to 3.5 percent, the stock market opened by falling below 5,000 points
with all eight categories of stocks dropping.</P>
      <P>The local bourse opened at 4,996.06, fluctuating between 5,025.73 and 4,971,36.</P>
      <P>A total of 2.2 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$44.88

      <P>Construction issues fell by 2.8 percent, while mechanical and electronics issues

foodstuff shares fell by 0.9 percent.</P>
      <P>Losers outnumbered gainers 1,357 to 226, with 252 issues remaining unchanged.</P>

coordinate the National Stabilization Fund to intervene may curb the sliding
trend, but it will not be favorable to foreign investors who want to unload

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the date of a key Beijing official's visit to Taiwan has yet to be set,
National Security Council (NSC) Secretary-General Su Chi said Monday it would be
best if the visit could take place before this year's APEC summit slated for
Nov. 22-23 in Lima, Peru.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks while fielding questions from lawmakers about the planned
visit by Chen Yunlin, China's top liaison with Taiwan and president of Beijing's
quasi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Speaking during a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Judiciary and Organic Laws
and Statutes Committee, Su said that the issue of whether President Ma Ying-jeou
would meet Chen is being arranged by the NSC, the Mainland Affairs Council and
ARATS' counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), following past
precedents.</P>
      <P>Su noted that Chiang Pin-kung, Chen's Taiwanese counterpart in his capacity as
SEF chairman, met Chinese President Hu Jintao during a visit to Beijing in June.</P>
      <P>Addressing  some  lawmakers'  concerns  over  the  protocol arrangements for a
possible Ma-Chen meeting, Su asserted that Ma will certainly uphold dignity and
parity when meeting with Chen.</P>
      <P>But Su did not disclose whether Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) , would attend the annual informal leadership summit of the
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum on Ma's behalf.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been working on a list of
possible representatives for Taiwan to the leadership summit. But Su said he was
not in a position to make the list public.</P>
      <P>Chen is slated to visit Taiwan in late October or early November, and will hold
talks with Chiang in a follow-up to a landmark meeting between the two men in
Beijing in June, in which the two sides clinched two accords on weekend charter
flights and Taiwan's wider opening to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Issues regarding cross-Taiwan Strait transportation services, including the
establishment of regular cargo charter flights and expansion of weekend
passenger charter flights, as well as financial supervisory cooperation and
crime-fighting, will be high on the agenda of the second round of talks.</P>
      <P>Chen would be the highest-ranking official from the People's Republic of China
ever to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The opposition  Democratic  Progressive  Party  and several pro-independence
groups have announced that they will jointly organize a large demonstration on
Nov. 2 to voice their anger about President Ma's policies of building closer
relations with China, and what they consider to be his administration's poor
performance since taking office on May 20.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>As part of efforts to reduce the tax burden for middle-class taxpayers at a time
when the economy is in decline, the government is seeking to raise the amount of
allowable deductions for personal income taxes, Finance Minister Lee Sush-der
said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the government is considering a plan which calls for raising
the standard deduction amount for single taxpayers to NT$60,000 (US$1,852) from
the current level of NT$46,000 and the standard deduction amount for married
couples to NT$120,000 from the current level of NT$92,000.</P>
      <P>Deductions for education expenses will be raised from the current NT$25,000 per
household to NT$25,000 per person per household.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, both the salary deduction amount and deduction amounts for physically
and mentally challenged taxpayers will be raised to NT$100,000, from the current
level of NT$78,000 and NT$77,000, respectively, according to a source of the
Taxation Reform Committee.</P>
      <P>Lee said the plan to increase the amount tax payers can deduct from their taxes
will be discussed Tuesday at the Taxation Reform Committee, an ad hoc group
established by the government administration to streamline the country's
taxation system.</P>
      <P>Once the plan is passed by the committee, it will be referred to the Executive
Yuan as part of an amendment to the existing laws governing taxation and
relevant regulations, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Many people are hoping that the amendment can be passed into law before this
current legislative session wraps up at the end of this year, so the law could
be implemented hopefully by May 2010 at the earliest, Lee added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) denied Monday a media
report that some of its members are banding together to push for a Cabinet
reshuffle before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yang Chiung-ying,  also a KMT legislative whip, rebutted the report
as sheer speculation, arguing that the KMT caucus fully supports the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>According to the media report, Taiwan's five-month-old Cabinet, plagued by low
approval ratings amid global financial turmoil, is facing increasing calls for a
reshuffle from opposition lawmakers and even some from the KMT itself.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, another KMT legislator, Hung Hsiu-chu, said some KMT
lawmakers might be unsatisfied with the performance of some individual Cabinet
members. But none of them are banding together to force a Cabinet reshuffle,
Hung said, adding that the KMT caucus would like to see the government stand
firm amid the current global financial turmoil.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT lawmakers, including Lu Shiow-yen, Lo Shu-lei, Chen Chieh and
Hung Hsiu-chu, raised issues about the reported replacement of Cabinet members
during a hearing at the Legislative Yuan Monday.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der was among those
fingered by the lawmakers because of more than 40 percent decline of the local
bourse's benchmark index since the new Cabinet took over May 20 and fell below
5,000 Monday for the first time since July 2003.</P>
      <P>The embattled Lee, who had served in government finance agencies for three
decades before being appointed to his current post, said he has done whatever he
could to save the country from the impact of the global financial storm.</P>
      <P>Describing his performance as "not bad, " Lee said that although he had not
necessarily met the people's expectations, he would continue to humbly face up
to the challenge.</P>
      <P>Aside from Lee, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan and Executive Yuan Secretary-General
Hsieh Hsiang-chuan were also blamed for failing to save the plummeting stock
market.</P>
      <P>In trading Monday, local shares fell below the psychological barrier of 5,000
points before finishing 110.27 points lower at 5,020.44. The decline came
despite the intervention of government funds.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, a heavyweight KMT member who enjoys high
public satisfaction ratings, also expressed his support for the under-fire
Cabinet and called for internal party unity.</P>
      <P>Hu said it was most important now to pursue political stability and to assist
the government in helping pull the country through the current financial
turmoil.</P>

      <P>The split within the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) over whether
to support or distance itself from scandal-plagued former President Chen Shui-
bian surfaced Monday when local and central party officials scuffled with each
other over the issue.</P>
      <P>Huang Ching-lin, director of the DPP's Taipei City chapter, and a group of the
former president's supporters went to DPP headquarters to demand that DPP
Secretary-General Wang Tuoh apologize and resign for remarks made two days ago
that were critical of Chen.</P>
      <P>Wang said Saturday that "emotional and moral support seems to have become a fad"
within the DPP, so that many DPP members have neglected the more important issue
of what is really right and what is really wrong.</P>
      <P>As Wang  was  not  in  the  office  Monday,  DPP  Deputy Secretary-General Hung
Yao-fu received the group.</P>
      <P>When Hung addressed the group, however, he bluntly reminded Chen's supporters
that "Huang was the first person who called on the DPP to strip Chen Shui-bian's
party membership" soon after the former president and his family were hit with
allegations of corruption.</P>
      <P>Unhappy with Hung's remarks, Huang pushed and then grabbed him, causing the
situation to spiral out of control, as supporters from both sides joined in the
fray.</P>
      <P>Huang later said he had never asked the party to expel the former president and
that the Taipei chapter of the DPP had only discussed whether the party should
strip the DPP membership of Chen's wife Wu Shu-jen, and their son and daughter-
in-law.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Hung's remarks "smeared my character," Huang said he would not
rule out the possibility of suing Hung for defamation.</P>
      <P>Hung refused to apologize to Huang over his remarks, however, insisting that he
told the truth and that DPP legislative caucus convener Ker Chien-ming could
vouch for his statement.</P>
      <P>While agreeing that party members at a local DPP chapter have the right to
express themselves and hold different views from the party leadership, Hung said
they should not lead a group of activists to the party's head office to stage a
protest.</P>
      <P>"The party central must maintain authority and discipline," he said.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen expressed regret over the fracas,
which she compared to an "accidental blowup."</P>
      <P>In an attempt to prevent the party split from getting worse, she asked all
workers at the DPP head office not to join any activities that are either in
support of or against the former president, and at the same time refrain from
expressing personal views on issues related to him.</P>

      <P>Lai explained that the projected revenue amount is not realistic as it is based
on forecast economic growth of 5.08 percent, when actual growth is likely to
reach just 2.5 percent.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Pan Meng-an said that the budget bill's projected tax revenues are
NT$40 billion higher than could be expected based on the lower growth forecast.</P>
      <P>He added that the projected revenue includes NT$22 billion in the planned sale
of shares in Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp. which has not been approved by the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>In response, KMT caucus deputy whip Wong Chung-chun said that the budget was
worked out in May and June and has already been sent to the various legislative
committees for review and that it will not be sent back to the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the projected revenue cannot be calculated exactly due to changing
economic conditions, Wong said that adjustments can be made to make up for
shortfalls in revenue.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the budget bill will not be sent back to the Executive Yuan as
doing so would affect the process of legislative review which must be completed
within a specific time period according to the law.</P>
      <P>As for the planned sale of Taiwan Tobacco shares, Wong noted that the KMT caucus
is also opposed to it, assuring that the legislative committees will closely
review the planned spending in the budget and make cuts as necessary.</P>
      <P>He added that if adjustments fail to balance the budget, the government will
borrow money to cover the difference.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has no plans to reshuffle the Cabinet at present, a
presidential aide said Monday in response to media speculation that lawmakers in
the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) are pushing for a new ministerial lineup.</P>
      <P>Responding to lawmakers' questions on the issue in a legislative committee
hearing, Presidential Office Secretary-General Chan Chun-po said the president
is not thinking of a Cabinet overhaul at this time.</P>
      <P>Out of his concern for people's livelihoods in the face of volatile conditions
at home and abroad, the president has encouraged the Cabinet to quickly put
policies in place that respond to the challenges and stabilize the local
financial environment, Chan said.</P>
      <P>Local media has reported in recent days that a group of maverick KMT lawmakers
have demanded that the president make changes in the Cabinet in view of the
administration's plunging approval ratings since Ma took office in May.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, the KMT lawmakers also prepared a list of what they
called "failing Cabinet members" that reportedly includes Premier Liu Chao-
hsiuan, Finance Minister Lee Sush-der, and Cabinet Secretary-General Hsieh
Hsiang-chuan.</P>

      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), Taiwan's top financial regulator,
denied Monday that it was planning to have Taishin Financial Holding Co. merge
with Fubon Financial Holding Co.</P>
      <P>FSC Chairman Gordon S. Chen made the denial when asked to clarify media reports
that he had met with Fubon Financial Chairman Daniel Tsai in secret on Oct. 9 to
find out whether his group might consider a merger with Taishin Holdings.</P>
      <P>Fitch Ratings revised its outlook on the group from "stable" to "negative" on
Oct. 9,  citing its declining profitability and inadequate reserves against
unsecured consumer lending. It also suffered from the recent collapse of Lehman
Brothers -- one of Wall Street's most prestigious players.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he knew nothing about the merger plan, and that he would respect
the mechanisms of the financial market.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that the FSC would "gladly expect" financial institutions in
Taiwan to consolidate through mergers.</P>
      <P>Fubon Financial also denied Monday that its executives had ever discussed any

      <P>The Taichung  Home Care Services Association, the first group of its kind in
Taichung to train and find employment for local caregivers, said Monday it is
straining to meet strong demand for full-time help in the central city.</P>
      <P>The organization, which trains local residents for the profession and then helps
them find employment upon graduation, books jobs for about 80 percent of the 30
graduates it prepares per quarter, said Association Chairman Huang Kuo-ta.</P>
      <P>Those who do not get jobs, Huang said, usually decided not to become caregivers
after completing their training.</P>
      <P>Despite Taiwan's rising unemployment rate, the city's home care service sector
still faces a shortage of local manpower amid rising demand, Huang said, leaving
many individuals needing full-time care without the help they require.</P>
      <P>Those applying to the association for a local caregiver have to wait in a line
behind other applicants, much like a 76-year-old ailing grandmother surnamed
Chung who has applied for help but has yet to receive it after a 30-day wait.</P>
      <P>The lower half of Chung's body was paralyzed three years ago after a traffic
accident. Despite having a son and two daughters, none of them can provide the
full-time care she needs because of their jobs.</P>
      <P>Chung previously employed a foreign caregiver, but eventually fired the employee
because of bad communications caused by a language barrier, Huang said, leaving
her at the mercy of the local caregiver shortage in the city.</P>
      <P>Association Director Chang Chi-fang said most of the applicants are senior
citizens like Chung whose family members cannot stay with them. She urged local
middle-aged women to join the 90-hour training program that comes with an
employment guarantee.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Monday that it has
decided to hold a protest march on Oct. 25, the nation's Retrocession Day, in
Taipei to call for safeguarding national sovereignty and improving the economy.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen made the remarks after the party held a coordination
meeting on major issues during which the party discussed on how to deal with the
planned visit by China's top negotiator with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, president of China's Association of Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) , reportedly will visit Taiwan in late October or early
November.</P>
      <P>"The march is targeted at the government and this is why the DPP will not overly
tie the march to Chen's planned visit, " Tsai said, adding that the date of the
march was moved ahead one week from the originally scheduled date in late
October or early November.</P>
      <P>On former President Chen Shui-bian's possible participation in the protest
march, Tsai said "anyone who identifies with the call of the march will be
welcome to take part, regardless of party affiliation."</P>
      <P>On whether Chen's participation in the march will blur its focus, Tsai said she
was confident that it wouldn't be the case, citing the Aug. 30 protest march as
an example.</P>
      <P>That march, called "The People's Outcry, " was organized by the pro-independence
Taiwan Society to highlight its call for the protection of Taiwan's sovereignty,
improvement of the economy and the enactment  of sunshine  laws,  drawing  tens
of thousands participants.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian, who along with his family members, is facing corruption and
money-laundering allegations, said recently that he would take part in the march
if he had not been detained.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-tsang, director of the DPP's Department of Culture and Information,
said Monday that the protest march will end at Ketagalan Boulevard in front of
the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>After Chen Yunlin's visit, the DPP will hold a "Taiwan-centric" evening rally,
tentatively set to be staged in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, Cheng added.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan announced Monday that
she was leaving the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) after the pro-
independence party demanded that she resign from her government post within
three days.</P>
      <P>Lai said in a statement that she had discussed her withdrawal from the party
with former President Lee Teng-hui, who is regarded by the TSU as its "spiritual
leader," and received his understanding.</P>
      <P>The TSU's Central Executive Committee threatened earlier in the day to strip her
of her party membership if she did not resign from the MAC in protest over what
it believes is the Ma Ying-jeou administration's excessive tilt toward China.</P>
      <P>It also objected to Lai, in her capacity as a TSU member, hosting Chen Yunlin,
chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS), during his visit to Taiwan in late October or early November.</P>
      <P>Lai said she was surprised by the TSU decision and felt bewildered.</P>
      <P>Since taking office May 20, Lai said she has spared no effort to safeguard
Taiwan's interests and mitigate any possible impact and damage to the country's
interests  when outlining measures to liberalize cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>As a Cabinet member, however, she had to respect the law, and before policies
delivered tangible results, she "could only do, not speak, " she  said.  The
situation,  Lai added,  had led to misunderstandings, which she regretted.</P>
      <P>In the statement, Lai said she understands that as an opposition party, the TSU
must monitor the government, helping democracy become more deeply rooted in
Taiwan. She therefore decided to withdraw from the party and concentrate her
efforts on public affairs.</P>
      <P>Lai also noted that she will not join any other existing political party after
leaving the TSU, but will maintain her "center left" leanings and continue her
efforts to protect the long-term interests of Taiwan's people.</P>

      <P>Taiwan looks forward to doubling the number of Chinese visitor arrivals to
20,000 per month by the end of this year, the country's tourism chief said
Monday upon her arrival in Beijing to promote travel in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Janice Lai, director-general of the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation  and Communications,  said she will introduce to Chinese travel
agents and ordinary citizens Taiwan's tourist attractions during her five-day
visit, which will also take her to Nanjing.</P>
      <P>Traveling with executives of more than 100 travel agencies from around Taiwan,
Lai is visiting China in her capacity as chairwoman of the nonprofit Taiwan
Tourism Association.</P>
      <P>Lai said she believed  increasing  the number  of nonstop cross-Taiwan Strait
charters on weekends would support higher arrival numbers.</P>
      <P>Since Chinese nationals began visiting Taiwan on July 18 under an agreement
expanding cross-Taiwan Strait tourism reached in mid-June, 85 percent of Chinese
tourists to Taiwan have come from provinces or cities where the nonstop flights
are available.</P>
      <P>Lai said she keenly hoped that Chen Yunlin,  China's top negotiator  with Taiwan
in his capacity as president  of the quasi-official Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), could wield his influence to push for
increases in both the number of such flights and Chinese destinations after his
planned visit to Taiwan later this year.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to visit Taiwan in late October or early November for a new
round of talks with his Taiwanese counterpart, Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the
Straits Exchange Foundation, on a range of issues.</P>
      <P>The two are expected to discuss new cross-strait flight routes and destinations
as well as the opening of direct shipping links and direct cargo charter flights
as well as cross-strait cooperation in fighting crime.</P>
      <P>If the number and destinations of the existing weekend direct flights can be
increased, Lai said she believes that the number of Chinese tourists to Taiwan
will increase from the current 10,000 per month to 20,000 by year's end.</P>
      <P>During her current visit, Lai said she will do her utmost to convince Chinese
tour operators and ordinary citizens of the joy of sightseeing in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A series of workshops will be organized to have direct contact with Chinese
travel agents and prospective travelersr and introduce to them various short-
stay tour packgages that could be attractive to Chinese salaried workers looking
for a quick getaway.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Monday that Taiwan has ample foreign reserves and a
high savings rate and urged the public not to lose faith in the nation's
economic outlook.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks to shore up public confidence as share prices continued to
fall in the local bourse despite rebounds Monday from Friday's precipitous
declines in most other world markets.</P>
      <P>The premier, speaking at an architecture award presentation ceremony, said the
financial crisis was essentially triggered by excessive money manipulations,
resulting in a widespread credit crunch.</P>
      <P>But he pointed out that Taiwan enjoys a number of advantages, such as its ample
foreign reserves. As of the end of September, Taiwan had foreign reserves of
US$281.13 billion, ranking fifth in the world behind China, Japan, Russia and
India.</P>
      <P>"This, coupled with Taiwan's high private savings rate of 20 percent, means that
Taiwan has no capital liquidity problem, " he said.</P>
      <P>In addition,  Taiwan's banking system is yet to be fully internationalized,
leaving it insulated from the financial crisis like a sort of a firewall.</P>
      <P>"The fallout of global stock market meltdown will not spill over to Taiwan
immediately," the premier said.</P>
      <P>He also praised Taiwan's manufacturing sector as a bedrock of the nation's
economy, saying it has laid a solid foundation for the country, and said the
problems of inflation and high fuel prices have gradually come under control.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has already channeled funding starting this year to
stimulate the economy and strengthen its support of underprivileged families, he
urged the public not to lose faith in Taiwan.</P>

interests  when outlining measures to liberalize cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>As a Cabinet member, however, she had to respect the law, and before policies
delivered tangible results, she "could only do, not speak, " she  said.  The
situation,  Lai added,  had led to misunderstandings, which she regretted.</P>
      <P>In the statement, Lai said she understands that as an opposition party, the TSU
must monitor the government, helping democracy become more deeply rooted in
Taiwan. She therefore decided to withdraw from the party and concentrate her
efforts on public affairs.</P>
      <P>Lai also noted that she will not join any other existing political party after
leaving the TSU, but will maintain her "center left" leanings and continue her
efforts to protect the long-term interests of Taiwan's people.</P>

      <P>Taiwan looks forward to doubling the number of Chinese visitor arrivals to
20,000 per month by the end of this year, the country's tourism chief said
Monday upon her arrival in Beijing to promote travel in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Janice Lai, director-general of the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation  and Communications,  said she will introduce to Chinese travel
agents and ordinary citizens Taiwan's tourist attractions during her five-day
visit, which will also take her to Nanjing.</P>
      <P>Traveling with executives of more than 100 travel agencies from around Taiwan,
Lai is visiting China in her capacity as chairwoman of the nonprofit Taiwan
Tourism Association.</P>
      <P>Lai said she believed  increasing  the number  of nonstop cross-Taiwan Strait
charters on weekends would support higher arrival numbers.</P>
      <P>Since Chinese nationals began visiting Taiwan on July 18 under an agreement
expanding cross-Taiwan Strait tourism reached in mid-June, 85 percent of Chinese
tourists to Taiwan have come from provinces or cities where the nonstop flights
are available.</P>
      <P>Lai said she keenly hoped that Chen Yunlin,  China's top negotiator  with Taiwan
in his capacity as president  of the quasi-official Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), could wield his influence to push for
increases in both the number of such flights and Chinese destinations after his
planned visit to Taiwan later this year.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to visit Taiwan in late October or early November for a new
round of talks with his Taiwanese counterpart, Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the
Straits Exchange Foundation, on a range of issues.</P>
      <P>The two are expected to discuss new cross-strait flight routes and destinations
as well as the opening of direct shipping links and direct cargo charter flights
as well as cross-strait cooperation in fighting crime.</P>
      <P>If the number and destinations of the existing weekend direct flights can be
increased, Lai said she believes that the number of Chinese tourists to Taiwan
will increase from the current 10,000 per month to 20,000 by year's end.</P>
      <P>During her current visit, Lai said she will do her utmost to convince Chinese
tour operators and ordinary citizens of the joy of sightseeing in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A series of workshops will be organized to have direct contact with Chinese
travel agents and prospective travelersr and introduce to them various short-
stay tour packgages that could be attractive to Chinese salaried workers looking
for a quick getaway.</P>

are produced by small causes. He knows the evidence and reality of what cannot
be perceived by the senses. Thus he is enabled to enter into the world of ideas
and morals."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Women's groups call for boycott of Chinese products</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of several local women's rights groups staged a demonstration in Taipei
Tuesday demanding that the Department of Health reject all Chinese products or
mandate stricter inspection of these products.</P>
      <P>During their demonstration  outside the DOH's office,  the protesters also
demanded that China take responsibility for the export of melamine-adulterated
food products to Taiwan.  They requested that DOH Minister Yeh Ching-chuan raise
the issue directly with Chen Yunlin, chairman of China's semi-official
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, who is expected to visit
Taiwan between late October and early November.</P>
      <P>The protesters claimed that the way the DOH has dealt with melamine-tainted food
scare shows that the government is incapable of handling problems related to
low-quality Chinese imports. They urged consumers to boycott all Chinese
products such as clothing, shoes and food and buy only Taiwan-made products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been engulfed in a food scare since the beverage products of a number
of Taiwanese companies were recently found to contain melamine. The
contamination occurred because milk power or non-dairy creamer imported from
China was used as an ingredient.</P>
      <P>However, some of the products were allowed to remain on store shelves last month
for a period when the DOH altered the standard for acceptable levels of melamine
content in food to 2.5 ppm. The policy, which obviously failed to meet
consumers' expectations for "zero content," led to the resignation of then-DOH
Minister Lin Fang-yue.</P>
      <P>The DOH has since reset its standard for melamine content at "undetectable"
using  the  most  sensitive  test  --  liquid chromatography/tandem mass
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) -- which can detect melamine levels as low as 0.05 ppm.</P>
      <P>The change has resulted in the recall of a number of milk powder products by the
leading manufacturer Nestle earlier this month. The products, which were made in
China, were previously declared as melamine-free because the equipment employed
to test them was less sensitive.</P>
      <P>Melamine, an industrial chemical, can cause kidney stones and kidney failure if
consumed in sufficient quantity. Baby formula containing the toxic chemical has
caused at least six deaths and sickened more than 53,000 children in China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Food scare highlights need for Taiwan's entry to WHO: ministry</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that the World Health
Organization (WHO) took notice of Taiwan's protests against the WHO's handling
of the Chinese tainted milk scandal and that the importance of Taiwan's
participation in the world body is manifested in the incident.</P>
      <P>"The international  community understands  more clearly how important and
necessary it is for Taiwan to participate in the WHO, " said Paul Chang,
director-general  of MOFAs  Department  of International Organizations, at a
regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>His statement came in response to a reporter's question on whether Taiwan's
protests against the world health body's handling of the matter were in vain.</P>
      <P>The MOFA protested after the WHO, in requesting information from Taiwan
authorities  on  the  effects  of  China-produced melamine-adulterated dairy
products, sent an e-mail to China and copied it to Taiwan, referring to Taiwan
as "Taiwan, China."</P>
      <P>Chang said the foreign ministry made contact three times with the WHO through
its representative office in Geneva to protest against the WHO's failure  to
contact  Taiwan  directly  on the food contamination issue and against the WHO's
downgrading of Taiwan's status in dealing with the matter.</P>
      <P>Former Department of Health Minister Lin Fang-yue also wrote to WHO Director-
General Margaret Chan on Sept. 26 to sternly express Taiwan's objections, he
added.</P>
      <P>Chang, however, refused to confirm whether the scheduled Sept. 30 meeting
between Taiwan's Representative to Geneva Shen Lyu-shun and the WHO took place.
Shen has regular and direct contact with WHO officials, but in keeping with an
understanding between Taipei and Geneva, the details of those contacts cannot be
disclosed, Chang added.</P>
      <P>The WHO took notice of our position, " Chang said. "But frankly speaking,
Taiwan's participation  in the WHO would require a comprehensive solution."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) voluntarily reported to the WHO by
e-mail on Sept. 16 that some Taiwan products containing toxic dairy ingredients
from China had been sold to Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Taiwan -- though not a member of the WHO and excluded from the International
Health Regulations (IHR) framework due to pressure from China -- decided in 2005
to nonetheless voluntarily adhere to the IHR, and designated the CDC to handle
its contacts with the WHO.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been trying to gain entry to the World Health Assembly -- the WHOs
decision-making body -- as an observer, but its efforts have been obstructed by
China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing ordered Tuesday the immediate recall
of frozen octopus balls imported from China, instructing that retailers remove
them from store shelves and send them to the relevant  government authorities
for melamine testing.</P>
      <P>Yang gave the directive after officials of the Cabinet-level Department of
Health (DOH) inspected a trading company Monday in Kaohsiung County, southern
Taiwan, which was found to have imported the Japanese-style snack from China's
Shangdong Province.</P>
      <P>Yang demanded that local vendors send any questionable China-made octopus balls
to the county public health authorities or the DOH for examination, as frozen
octopus balls imported by a trading company in Japan from China's Fujian
Province were found to contain the toxic chemical melamine.</P>
      <P>Melamine is an industrial chemical used by some Chinese food makers to produce a
falsely high level of protein in a wide variety of foodstuff.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH officials, the Kaohsiung County trading company by late
July had already sold the 7,377 kilograms of frozen octopus balls in 900 boxes
that it imported from Shangdong to a local distributor.</P>
      <P>Acting on information provided by the Kaohsiung County, the Kaohsiung City's
health bureau confirmed later Tuesday that the Kaohsuing County distributor has
sold all the product to a retailer in central Taiwan's Taichung area. No octopus
balls of the shipment was sold to Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Kaohsiung County's health bureau has informed its Taichung County
counterpart of the incident and sought a joint cooperation to detect the
questionable imports.</P>
      <P>In August, panic arose among Taiwan consumers after it was found that shipments
of 25 tons of milk powder imported from China contained melamine.</P>
      <P>The government has asked for compensation for Taiwanese consumers from the
culpable Chinese companies.</P>
      <P>The food scare over China-made products has become a sensitive issue in
bilateral relations at a time when a key Beijing official is preparing to visit
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, China's top liaison with Taiwan in his capacity as the president of
the quasi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS),
is slated to visit Taiwan late this month or early November and hold talks with
his Taiwanese counterpart -- Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang
Pin-kung -- on two-way exchanges.</P>
      <P>Issues regarding cross-Taiwan Strait transportation services, including the
establishment of regular cargo charter flights and expansion of weekend
passenger charter flights, as well as financial supervisory cooperation and
crime-fighting, will be high on the agenda of the second round of talks.</P>
      <P>Chen would be the highest ranking official of the People's Republic of China to
visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen clinched two accords on weekend charter flights and Taiwan's
wider opening to Chinese tourists in a historical ice-breaking meeting in June

      <P>The government should demand that domestic retailers of bulk commodities adjust
their prices downward to reflect falling global prices, the Consumers' Group
suggested Monday.</P>
      <P>Although the global prices of bulk commodities, such as wheat, soybeans, rice
and corn, dropped sharply recently, local consumers did not benefit from the
price drop as retailers did not lower their prices accordingly, said Hsieh Tien-
jen, acting chairman of the group.</P>
      <P>For example, Hsieh said, despite the fact that world flour prices fell
significantly recently, the domestic prices of bread and noodles remained high.</P>
      <P>In addition, most of the special zones set up by six supermarket and hypermarket
chains around the country for fair-price goods have not provided sufficient
information and have covered only a few product items, he noted.</P>
      <P>In response,  the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Industrial Development Bureau
said that the factory price of flour dropped to NT$499.26 per 22-kilogram
package in mid-September from NT$584.04 per package in April. But as the sale
price of flour products are linked to the purchasing behavior of wholesalers and
pricing strategy of retailers, it is not appropriate for the government to
interfere in the market economy, it added.</P>
      <P>The bureau also said that it will ask the Consumer Protection Commission under
the Executive Yuan to closely scrutinize the operations of the fair-price
special zones.</P>
      <P>However, Liu Ching-fang, an official of the commission, rebutted that the
special  zones were set up in accordance  with the administrative guidelines,
which are not based on any specific provisions in the law, therefore the
establishment of such zones is not mandatory and not subject to regulations.</P>
      <P>Liu added that with the current sluggish domestic economy, there is a need to
maintain the special zones.</P>
      <P>She acknowledged that the space for the special zones had been squeezed to make
room for promotional campaigns during the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Chung Yuan
ghost festival.</P>
      <P>She added that the commission will provide the latest issue of Consumer Reports
Magazine, which carries related reports, to the six supermarket and hypermarket
chains in the hope that they will stick to their commitment to help consumers
cope with surging product prices.</P>

      <P>A group of students from Kaohsiung National First University of Science and
Technology in southern Taiwan won an award Tuesday for creative application at
the 2008 National Wind Power Invention Contest with their entry of a wind-
powered bicycle headlight.</P>
      <P>Given the spiraling price of gasoline this year, which has fueled inflation,
cutting energy costs has been a major concern for many consumers. Harnessing
wind power is considered one of the possible solutions.</P>
      <P>The wind-powered bicycle headlight utilizes head-on wind, while the bike is in
motion, to generate electricity as a source of energy for the headlight. The

      <P>Budding British opera singer Paul Potts, who achieved instant fame after an
appearance on a television singing competition, was to open the Taiwan leg of
his world tour Tuesday night.</P>
      <P>Potts, visiting Taiwan for the first time, will sing in Taichung, Taipei and
Tainan on Oct. 14, Oct. 16 and Oct. 18, respectively.</P>
      <P>Described  by one  blogger  as "failure,  hope,  futility, perseverance, and
victory personified, " Potts rose from obscurity when he stunned an audience and
the judges on the UK talent search show "Britain's Got Talent" with his
rendition of the operatic aria Nessun Dorma from the final act of Puccini's
Turandot.</P>
      <P>Following that performance, which was aired on June 9, 2007, the tenor
eventually won the competition and almost immediately released an album called
"One Chance" in mid-July 2007 that had sold 2 million copies by the end of the
year.</P>
      <P>Potts will be joined during his swing through Taiwan by a top-notch Filipino
soprano. Potts will sing the melody while the soprano harmonizes, according to
organizers.</P>
      <P>Potts said he became addicted to operas at the age of 16 when he began listening
to opera music performed by Spanish tenor Jose Carreras, who gained fame with a
wider audience as one of the Three Tenors along with tenors Placido Domingo and
the late Luciano Pavarotti, who died in 2007, in a series of mass concerts that
began in 1990 and last until 2003.</P>
      <P>But he also regularly listens to other forms of music and enjoys English rock
band Queen and Swedish pop group Roxette.</P>
      <P>Potts said he especially liked "Chasing Cars" -- the third single from the
fourth album by Snow Patrol, a Northern Irish/Scottish alternative rock band.</P>
      <P>The tenor reaffirmed, however, that he will concentrate on singing opera in the
future and will not consider performing pop or rock songs.</P>
      <P>Potts said that although he does not intend to sing Chinese songs on this tour
of Taiwan, he will consider adding some to his repertoire if he has a chance to
perform in Taiwan again in the future.</P>
      <P>Potts spent his 38th birthday with his wife during a party at a Taipei hotel
Monday and made a wish that he could perform in Taiwan as often as possible.</P>
      <P>Potts was a mobile phone salesman aspiring to be an opera singer before he
achieved fame on "Britain's Got Talent."</P>

    <HEADLINE>KRTC to offer discounts to I-Pass holders using MRT</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) said Tuesday that it will offer
discounted prices to I-Pass holders using the southern port city's MRT, starting
Oct. 22.</P>
      <P>That is the date when regular fares will be applied to the two lines in the
system. During the first week of the Orange line's operations since Sept. 14,
passengers were able to ride for free, while prices were set at just NT$15 for
the Sept. 22 - Oct. 21 period on both the Red and Orange Lines.</P>
      <P>The KRTC said that the level of discount for I-Pass holders has not yet been
determined, although it had earlier planned to offer a 75-percent discount.</P>
      <P>Huang Yi-chung, director of the KRTC's Public Affairs Department, said that as
the percentage of Kaohsiung residents using the MRT is relatively low, the
company has had trouble boosting daily passenger numbers.</P>
      <P>Ridership on the system has remained at between 100,000 and 200,000 per day,
with the number rising to around 250,000 on holidays, Huang said.</P>
      <P>These figures show that most Kaohsiung residents view the MRT as "a tourist and
leisure train," Huang claimed.</P>
      <P>The KRTC's main task at present is to try to encourage people to change their
commuting habits and switch to using the MRT to get to and from work, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew clarified Tuesday that the government's
liberalization policy toward China did not constitute being "pro-China" or
"tilting toward China, " as he rejected criticism that the administration's
approach was sacrificing the country's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Siew argued that easing the restrictions on cross-Taiwan Strait economic
activities is a "necessary" step to promote Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>He also contended that the Chinese market is one that Taiwan should pursue,
because compared with other non-Chinese speaking countries, Taiwan enjoys an
edge in terms of language and social customs while doing business in China.</P>
      <P>The recent improvement in relations between Taiwan and China has presented many
opportunities to foreign businesses, as foreign companies can base their
operations and recruit talent in Taiwan, making Taiwan their springboard to
China, he said.</P>
      <P>Siew said cross-strait transportation will become more convenient if the two
sides reach an agreement on the opening of more direct nonstop cross-strait air
routes during upcoming negotiations expected to take place between late October
and early November in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The development would put Taiwan in a more advantageous position, he indicated.</P>
      <P>The vice president made the remarks while delivering a speech at a Rotary Club
meeting held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In the months since the Kuomintang's Ma Ying-jeou was inaugurated as president
on May 20, Taiwan has adopted a series of liberalization measures toward China,
including launching nonstop cross-strait charter flights on weekends, expanding
the admission of Chinese tourists to Taiwan, allowing cross-strait currency
trading, and raising the cap on China-bound investment by local enterprises from
40 percent of their net worth to 60 percent.</P>
      <P>Other measures under planning include opening Taiwan to Chinese investors and
relaxing restrictions on China-bound investment by Taiwanese semiconductor
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>In protest over what it believes is the Ma administration's excessive tilt
toward China, the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union on Monday (TSU)  threatened
to strip Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan of her party
membership unless she resigned from the government post within three days.</P>
      <P>In response, Lai chose to relinquish her TSU membership.</P>

      <P>A specialty food center, opened on Oct. 1 for trial operations by the Kaohsiung
city government in a large- scale shopping mall, is slated to be formally
inaugurated on Oct. 25, Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The prime aim of the center is to provide a convenient and comfortable place
where Chinese tourists can pick up high-end, typical, locally-produced food or
other items," Chen told reporters following a municipal meeting.</P>
      <P>Although the number of Chinese tourists coming to the port city has been low
since the central government opened up Taiwan to more mainland tourists in July
with various incentive measures, Chen said the city has attracted many foreign
tourists from other countries, such as Japan.</P>
      <P>The center, featuring fine local products in a space of 826 square meters, is
located in the first-floor basement of the city's largest shopping center - the
Dream Mall.</P>
      <P>Liu Hsin-cheng, head of te city's Economic Affairs Bureau, said that Japanese
tourists have made up the bulk of visitors to the center since it began trial
operations on Oct. 1.</P>
      <P>Citing bureau statistics, Liu said that some 130,000 Japanese tourists have
visited Kaohsiung City this year to date, up from the previous year's level of
110,000.</P>
      <P>"I am confident that the number of Japanese visitors to Kaohsiung will exceed
200,000 by the end of this year," Liu said.</P>

      <P>In the next several years, the global market for display equipment will
increasingly concentrate on four "emerging" technologies -- flexible display,
touch screen, public information display, and three-dimensional display,
according to a survey by market analyst Displaybank.</P>
      <P>Displaybank's Taiwan chapter forecast in a statement that the market for all
four of these technologies will expand fast in the next decade, achieving annual
growth rates in output value ranging from 28 percent to 143 percent.</P>
      <P>For individual product lines, the market research showed that the mainstream
thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) will reach its production
peak in the next two to three years, and after that, the organic light-emitting
diode (OLED) will phase in to seize an increasingly larger market share.</P>
      <P>After OLED, flexible display will become the next mainstream product when
related manufacturing technologies mature, according to Displaybank's analysts.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the annual average composite growth rates for flexible display will
be as high as 126 percent for 2008-2017, while the flexible display products
will account for 25 percent of the production output of all display devices in
2017, the analysts said.</P>
      <P>3D display, they said, will also see strong growth in the next four years, and
before 2012, its annual average composite growth rate will reach 143 percent.</P>
      <P>As for public information display, the annual average composite growth rates is
likely to reach 28 percent for 2008-2012; while the annual average composite
growth rate of touch screen displays will be between 31 percent to 35 percent,
depending on the size of screen, according to the forecast.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) recently introduced a new
method to test for water or mud toxicity using a small insect, the Hyalella
azteca, significantly reducing the time and cost of toxicity testing, the agency
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the Environmental Analysis Laboratory under the EPA, the Hyalella
azteca, an amphipod of about 5 millimeters long that is common in aquatic
systems, has already been used for toxicity testing by the United States'
Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Geological Survey.</P>
      <P>"The insect adapts easily to environments of a wide range of temperatures, from
10 to 35 degrees Celsius. Their individual differences are imperceptible, and
they are sensitive to toxic materials, such as pesticides and heavy metals, "
Yang Hsi-nan, a researcher of the laboratory said at a press conference,
speaking about advantages of using the insect.</P>
      <P>In addition, Yang said it only takes about 10 days for scientists to see how
toxic the water or mud being tested is, based on the effects that any toxic
chemicals would have on the insects.</P>
      <P>The insects are also very easy to reproduce in laboratories, according to Yang.</P>
      <P>It only takes seven days to raise the Hyalella azteca before it can be used for
testing purposes, while traditional tests with Cyprinus carpio--a kind of fish,
take one to two months, Yang added.</P>
      <P>He said that several tests on riverbed mud toxicity with the Hyalella azteca are
already underway.</P>
      <P>The new method was introduced to Taiwan by a group of experts of the laboratory
who were sent to the Columbia Environmental Research Center in the United States
to study biological toxicity testing technology.</P>
      <P>Biological toxicity testing is a method of using live insects or animals to
examine the toxic level of a body of water or river bed mud.</P>
      <P>Insects that are frequently used for toxicity testing are the Cyprinus carpio,
Neocaridina denticulata --a shrimp-- and Daphnia similis--a water flea.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Tuesday that a sovereign wealth fund run by
Taiwan would integrate government capital and be used to launch construction
projects, develop new industries, and provide temporary assistance to local
businesses.</P>
      <P>Revisiting an issue that sparked controversy when first suggested by the
government on Oct. 1 as a way to stimulate the economy, Siew said at a Rotary
International gathering that if a fund were launched by Taiwan, it would differ
from those run by other countries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's fund, as described by Siew, would focus more on domestic development
while funds run by other countries tend to emphasize strategic investments
around the globe to promote their national or economic interests.</P>
      <P>Siew acknowledged that the present global financial turmoil would inevitably
affect Taiwan, but insisted the country did not face serious capital liquidity
problems.</P>
      <P>He believed, however, that if the government's various assets, such as equities,
land, capital from public-run companies and foreign exchange reserves could be
integrated, the government would have more chips at its disposal to boost the
economy.</P>
      <P>The fund,  he said,  would serve as an expanded national development fund that
could invest in developing new industries, carrying  out  public  construction
projects  or  assisting soundly-structured companies in tiding over temporary
financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>In fact, Siew said, it would not even have to be called a "sovereign wealth
fund."</P>
      <P>During his speech, Siew also proposed a reduction in the inheritance and gift
taxes as incentives to draw more overseas capital back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>That would generate more job opportunities and improved business prospects,
leading to increases in tax revenues and growth in domestic economic
development.</P>
      <P>Siew said that with the government's short-term provisional measures to combat
the current financial crisis and its long-term package of systemic reforms, he
was cautiously optimistic about Taiwan's economic future.</P>

      <P>The proposed construction of a bridge linking Taiwan-held  Kinmen island and the
city of Xiamen in southeastern China should take into consideration national
security, an official of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>MAC Deputy Chairman Fu Don-cheng made the remarks at a public hearing at the
Legislative Yuan on withdrawing stationed troops in Kinmen and Matsu and
building the Kin-Xia bridge.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Competitiveness Forum, a Taiwan think tank, sponsored the hearing on
the bridge, which would span 8.6-11.4 kilometers depending on which of the three
proposed designs was chosen.</P>
      <P>"Other factors to be considered in the construction of the bridge include a
review of the development of cross-strait relations, the construction cost and
its efficiency, and the willingness and cooperation of China," Fu said.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng, who is keen to build the bridge to boost
the local economy, said President Ma Ying-jeou on a recent visit to Kinmen had
been open to its construction and instructed the Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD) to assess the project.</P>
      <P>"But the issue was stalled because of the reservations of the Ministry of
National Defense and other government agencies, " Lee said.</P>
      <P>MND officials said recently that an overall assessment of Kinmen's strategic
status needed to be conducted before considering building the bridge.</P>
      <P>CEPD Deputy Minister San Gee said that whether or not to withdraw troops from
Kinmen and Matsu, once the front lines of Taiwan's defenses against China, or
build a bridge linking Kinmen and Xiamen will have to take into account the

      <P>Autumn is the best time to observe one of nature's wonders in Taitung County in
eastern Taiwan, where Taiwan Golden Rain Trees are splashing a lovely bright
yellow before their blossoms on the top of the canopy fall like golden showers
to make way for a sea of pink seed pods.</P>
      <P>Experts in the local travel industry said Tuesday that the best locations to
admire the colorful foliage change in Taitung County include the mountainous
areas along the route linking the townships of Jinfong, Daren and Dawu, areas
along Taiwan provincial road No. 11, the East Rift Valley near the Luye tea
farm, and areas along County Road No. 197.</P>
      <P>The Golden Rain Tree is a medium-sized deciduous tree with a dense round crown
composed of ascending branches. It grows to about 15 meters tall. During the
cooler season of autumn, its flowering panicles burst into a yellow shower of
blossoms on the top of the canopy.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the clusters of flowers reach their peak and fall, another
beautiful stage occurs when the trees go into their seed pod cycle, with the
delicate pink lantern-like capsules creating another colorful transformation by
turning pink, red and then brown.</P>
      <P>The Golden Rain Tree found in Taiwan is an indigenous subspecies called the
Koelreuteria elegans formosana and said to be more beautiful than the variety
found in other countries.</P>
      <P>The subtropical trees can also be found in Taiwan's major cities, including
Taipei and Taichung.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A volunteer river patrol team in Tainan County, armed with the authority to
collect evidence of environmental crime, has successfully uncovered water
polluters and helped bring them to justice, a local government official said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the official from the county government's Bureau of Environmental
Protection, the patrol team consisting of about 200 volunteers from various
walks of life had reported 87 suspected cases between January and September.</P>
      <P>Of those cases, 34 were confirmed with evidence gathered by the team, the
official said. Most of the confirmed cases were major violations, resulting in
fines totaling NT$3.8 million.</P>
      <P>Like river patrol teams in other cities and counties, the group in Tainan County
was originally only authorized to report suspected cases to the local
government, which would then be pursued by the local environmental protection
bureau.</P>
      <P>Their efforts were often wasted. Prosecutors gave little weight to the
unofficial group's reports, and the trail of evidence had often disappeared when
government investigators decided to pursue their tips.</P>
      <P>Facing a shortage of manpower to handle environmental probes, the Tainan County
government decided in December 2006 to authorize the volunteer team to gather
evidence of wrongdoing, a decision that has led to more efficient monitoring of
the county's rivers, which are often used as wastewater receptacles.</P>
      <P>Empowered to gather evidence, the volunteers could collect wastewater discharged
by factories during the five minutes it took to disappear into once clean
rivers.</P>
      <P>"Waiting  futilely  during the five minutes for government authorities to do the
same task was not smart because it allowed the best time to collect persuasive
powerful evidence to go by, " the county government official said.</P>
      <P>"Most of the team members are local residents, who know how to trace wastewater
movements and where to find sources of pollution, " he added.</P>
      <P>The evidence gathering authority allows them to examine pollution sources,
request related data from operators of suspected sources, collect samples, and
take photos and video recordings.</P>
      <P>The team receives subsidies from the central government to buy the necessary
devices and equipment to hunt down polluters, such as ice buckets, sample
bottles, PH level paper strips, and video cameras.</P>
      <P>The Tainan County government has encouraged local residents to join the team,
but members have to be trained by the bureau before they can participate in the
team's missions.</P>
      <P>The training helps them obtain professional knowledge, such as how to identify
contaminated  water and collect samples from suspicious sources, the official
said.</P>
      <P>Group members also learn how to open drainage covers on the road to inspect
water quality and how to avoid threats posed by suspected firms during the
evidence gathering process, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will convene an international forum this week
focusing on melamine's risk to health, as well as measures to prevent
contamination of the toxic chemical in food, the agency announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>International experts from the European Union, Australia and New Zealand are
confirmed to attend the forum to be held on Thursday and Friday, said Wang Je-
chau, the DOH's spokesman, adding however that his agency is still confirming
the name list.</P>
      <P>In addition, a two-hour web conference with officials and experts from the
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be held on Thursday to
discuss how to assess the risk of melamine in food and methods to analyze the
chemical in foods.</P>
      <P>A roundtable on policy and cooperative strategies to prevent melamine-
adulterated food in international trade will also be held Friday morning, the
DOH stated.</P>
      <P>The forum will take place from Oct. 16 afternoon to Oct. 17 , at the Howard
Plaza Hotel in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The proceedings of the meeting will be conducted in English and will be
broadcast live in a hall in the hotel opened to the public, the DOH said.</P>
      <P>The toxic chemical melamine, normally used to make plastics and fertilizers, was
found to have been added by milk collection stations into diluted milk in order
to give the appearance of high protein in tests.</P>
      <P>Four infants who consumed baby formula made with melamine-tainted milk have died
in China, with 54,000 others sickened and more than 10,000 still hospitalized.</P>
      <P>Food made with ingredients containing melamine-tainted milk powder and
vegetable-based protein were also found in many countries in the world. Imports
of Chinese milk powder and food products have been banned or recalled in more
than a dozen countries, including the European Union, Malaysia, Singapore and
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the chemical seemed to be ubiquitous in food products, as it is found
in instant beverages, cakes, breads and chocolate, and has caused general panic
among consumers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's former DOH minister Lin Fang-yue recently stepped down for not being
able to ease consumers' worries, after only four months in office.</P>
      <P>No official from the World Health Organization (WHO) will attend the forum even
though the WHO was invited, according to the premilinary name list of
participants.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese octopus balls seized in Taichung for melamine testing</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Seventeen boxes of frozen octopus balls imported from China and suspected of
containing melamine -- a harmful industrial chemical -- were seized at a local
company in central Taiwan Tuesday, officials said.</P>
      <P>Acting on information from the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH), health
officials in Taichung County rushed to a company in the county's Tatu township
and confiscated the questionable octopus balls, county officials told reporters.</P>
      <P>It will take two or three days for test results to be made available to reveal
whether the food products -- made of diced octopus and usually served with
noodles or as barbecue skewers -- actually contain melamine, a Taichung county
official said.</P>
      <P>The items were imported in July by a trading company in southern Taiwan's
Kaohsiung County and later sold to a Taichung distributor.</P>
      <P>Authorities conducting the raid Tuesday were able to seize only 17 boxes, out of
a total shipment of 900 boxes, because the rest of the products had already been
sold by the Taichung distributor to local vendors, Taichung county officials
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh Ting-hung, deputy director-general of the DOH's Bureau of Food
Safety, advised the public Tuesday not to panic because the shipment does not
necessarily contain melamine, even though some China-made octopus dumplings
imported to Japan from the southeastern Fujian province were recently found to
contain the chemical residue.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing earlier the same day ordered an
immediate recall of frozen octopus balls imported from China and demanded that
retailers in Kaohsiung remove them from store shelves and send them to relevant
government authorities for melamine testing.</P>
      <P>Yang gave the directive after DOH officials searched the premises of the
Kaohsiung trading company, which imported the snacks from China's Shandong
Province.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH officials, the Kaohsiung County trading company by late
July had already sold the 7,377 kilograms of frozen octopus balls that it
imported, to a local distributor.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung county officials confirmed later Tuesday that the Kaohsuing County
distributor had sold all the products to the Taichung distributor.</P>
      <P>Melamine is an industrial chemical used by some Chinese food makers to produce a
falsely high level of protein in a wide variety of foodstuff. The chemical is
used to make plastics.</P>
      <P>In August, a shipment of 25 tons of China-made milk powder containing melamine
were found to have been sold in Taiwan, causing panic among Taiwanese consumers.</P>
      <P>So far, no cases of deaths from melamine contamination have been reported in
Taiwan. But media reports said a four-year-old daughter of aTaiwanese
businessman and his Chinese wife who reside in Fujian province part of the time
was diagnosed in Taiwan to have kidney stones after drinking the melamine-
contaminated milk powder.</P>
      <P>In China, food tainted with melamine were found to have killed four infants and
sickened more than 50,000 others.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 860 passengers riding the Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit system have been
fined since it opened in March this year, with most of them guilty of violating
food consumption rules, according to statistics released by the city's Mass
Rapid Transit Bureau Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Bureau official Li Kuo-pao said that between April 7, when the MRT's rules began
being enforced after a one-month grace period, to Oct. 13, 860 passengers were
fined a total of NT$1.13 million, of which NT$735,250 has been collected.</P>
      <P>Li estimated that up to 90 percent of the fines were imposed on passengers who
were caught eating on the trains,  with other infringements including carrying
non-caged pets into the trains' compartments and the irregular switching-on of
alarms and other devices.</P>
      <P>Although more than 27 million passengers have taken the MRT's two lines as of
Oct. 13, riders are still breaking the rules because they remain unfamiliar with
them, Li said.</P>
      <P>Eating in Kaohsiung MRT stations and on trains is prohibited, with violators
fined NT$1,500.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) said Tuesday that
although Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan had announced
her withdrawal from the party a day earlier, the TSU would still follow the
decision of its Central Executive Committee to expel her.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei told reporters that the decision was made because
Lai could not fulfill the originally intended purpose of having her accept the
post in the Kuomintang government.</P>
      <P>Huang explained that TSU supporters are worried that President Ma Ying-jeou's
policies have tilted too much toward China, and believe Lai has been unable to
do anything about it.</P>
      <P>"The TSU has observed her for five months, and yet the situation has not
improved. Therefore, the Central Executive Committee demanded yesterday that Lai
must resign from her MAC post within three days or the TSU would strip her of
her party membership," he said.</P>
      <P>In a statement announcing her withdrawal from the TSU a day earlier, Lai said
that in handling cross-Taiwan Strait relations, many things can be done but not
publicized prematurely, and that as a Cabinet member, she must respect the law.</P>
      <P>She pledged that she will continue her efforts to serve the interests of
Taiwan's people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Low salaries top headache for young wage earners: CLA survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Low wages are the number one job problem facing young wage earners while
declining physical strength is the biggest worry for those nearing retirement
age, according to the results of a survey released by the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level CLA conducted the survey in September to gain a better
understanding of the living and job conditions of local wage earners, with 4,040
valid samples collected.</P>
      <P>Asked about job-related problems, 39 percent of the respondents in the 15-24 age
group cited "low wages" as their top headache and 30.7 percent listed "lack of
professional skills or expertise" as their biggest hurdle.</P>
      <P>For prime working age individuals in the 25-44 age group, the top two concerns
were low wages (28.6 percent) and difficulties in balancing family life and
their jobs.</P>
      <P>To those aged between 45-64, the three major concerns were falling physical
vigor (34.4 percent) , worries over being laid off (22.6 percent) and worries
about being unable to receive their pensions (20.5 percent).</P>
      <P>Analyzing the poll results, CLA officials said young and prime working age wage
earners tended to feel they are having a hard time making ends meet and that
young workers are particularly concerned about their lack of professional
skills.</P>
      <P>The poll findings also showed that the older the wage earners, the more they
worry about job security and retirement benefits.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that the intention to change jobs is highest among young
workers at 41.4 percent and the lowest among those in the 45-64 age group.</P>
      <P>Up to 74.5 percent of the overall respondents said they have no intention to
change jobs or change to other professions.</P>
      <P>Among those intending to change jobs, 40.6 percent said they hope to move to
different professions and 30.9 percent said they look forward to being
transferred to departments where their potential can be better developed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kaohsiung Port's container handling volume unchanged from 2007</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of containers handled at Kaohsiung harbor in southern Taiwan during
the first eight months of this year showed no growth from the same period of
2007, prompting worries that the port might not maintain its status as one of
the top 10 container ports in the world.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Department of Aviation and Navigation under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications pointed out that Kaohsiung port handled 6.72
million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) between January and August --  the same
level as during the corresponding period in 2007.</P>
      <P>Previously released official statistics showed that for the January-August
period of 2007, Kaohsiung harbor recorded an increase of 4.4 percent, or 283,380
TEUs, over the same period of 2006.</P>
      <P>For all of 2007, the port handled 10.25 million TEUs, setting a new record and
representing an increase of 4.9 percent over the previous year.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung was the world's third-largest container port in 2000, but its ranking
has slipped in recent years. It retained its status as the sixth-largest
container port in the world in 2006, but it slipped two places to become No. 8
in 2007.</P>
      <P>The stagnant growth in container handling volume in the first eight months has
triggered concern among officials about whether Kaohsiung port might be removed
from the top 10 list this year.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung is currently lagging behind the five ports that ranked from first to
fifth last year: Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Busan. It is also
behind China's Ningbo and Guangzhou ports, which placed 11th and 12th,
respectively, last year.</P>
      <P>Because the other three ports -- Dubai, Rotterdam and Hamburg -- that ranked
sixth, seventh and ninth, respectively, last year still have not publicized
updated container volume statistics, it is unclear whether Kaohsiung can remain
among the top 10 container ports in the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Income tax deductions to be increased from 2009: officials</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Income tax deductions will be largely increased from 2009, government officials
announced Tuesday after a meeting of the Executive Yuan's Tax Reform Commission
(TRC).</P>
      <P>According to the officials, TRC commissioners reached a consensus during the
meeting that the amounts of various tax deductions will be increased from next
year to ease wage earners' tax burdens.</P>
      <P>In terms of the consensus, the standard deduction for single persons will be
raised to NT$60,000 per person from the current NT$46,000 and will be increased
for married couples filing together to NT$120,000 from NT$92,000 at present.</P>
      <P>The standard salary deduction will also be raised to NT$100,000 from the present
NT$78,000; deductions for education expenses will be increased to NT$25,000 per
person from the current NT$25,000 per household; and deductions for the disabled
will be raised to NT$100,000 from NT$77,000.</P>
      <P>If the tax deduction  increase proposal is passed by the Legislative Yuan, the
officials said, local taxpayers will be able to enjoy such benefits when they
file their tax returns for their 2009 incomes in 2010.</P>
      <P>The deduction increase plan, if passed, will cost national coffers an estimated
NT$15.3 billion, the officials said.</P>
      <P>As to whether the income tax rates will be adjusted downward, the officials
said, it needs further discussion. Probably, they said, new income tax rates
could be adopted in 2010.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ex-Investigation Bureau chief retracts accusation against ex-boss</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Yeh Sheng-mao, former chief of the Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of
Justice, openly admitted for the first time Tuesday that he did not inform his
superior of the ex-first  family's  possible  involvement  in  money-laundering,
backtracking on a previous charge.</P>
      <P>When Yeh's potential involvement in concealing information related to the money-
laundering allegations surfaced in August, he indicated that he had informed his
superior, State Public Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming, of the information
obtained from abroad, in a meeting in early February.</P>
      <P>But at Tuesday's trial hearing, Yeh admitted that he had not advised his boss of
the contents of reports from the Egmont Group, an international anti-money
laundering organization, on the first family's overseas bank accounts.</P>
      <P>He apologized to Chen Tsung-ming in court, saying "I was wrong" several times
during the trial hearing at the Taipei District Court.</P>
      <P>Yeh was indicted on Aug. 28 for concealing and not investigating information on
overseas bank accounts held by Chen Shui-bian's family members in the Cayman
Islands in the Caribbean.</P>
      <P>Yeh admitted on Sept. 2 that he handed the information to Chen Shui-bian in
February while Chen was still serving as president.</P>
      <P>His confession led prosecutors to bring an extra charge of leaking classified
information against him, paving the way for his detention on Oct. 6.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Yeh also testified  Tuesday that he passed on information on alleged
money-laundering activities of the former first family to former President Chen
Shui-bian as early as December 2006.</P>
      <P>He said that an anti-money laundering center at the Investigation Bureau
received information from Jersey in the Channel Islands in December 2006 on
overseas funds deposited there by Chen's family.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he called Lin Teh-hsun, then director of the president's office, two or
three days later to tell him he had received a report, without mentioning its
contents, but later passed the information on to Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen admitted in mid-August that his wife Wu Shu-jen had wired abroad an
unspecified amount of money that he had received as campaign contributions.</P>
      <P>Chen confessed that he had not been faithful in reporting the election campaign
expenses for his two mayoral elections and two presidential elections between
1993 and 2004 but claimed that he was unaware that the surplus funds were wired
abroad by his wife until early this year.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he also received information On Dec. 12, 2007 from the Cayman Islands
inquiring about Chen, his son, his daughter-in-law and the daughter-in-law's
father, through the Egmont Group.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he again called Lin in mid-December and late December about receiving
inquiries from the Cayman Islands, and passed on the compiled information to
Chen in early February this year.</P>
      <P>The former Investigation Bureau chief said that Chen, after being informed of
related information or letters, would tell him that a lot of the funds were used
on diplomatic missions and that he would handle the matter.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that in view of Chen's "stature and dignity, " he had believed that the
former president would handle the matter properly.</P>
      <P>In addition, as the chief of the Investigation Bureau, Yeh said, "I could not
doubt his words" and "had a duty to respect and obey him."</P>
      <P>Yeh said that he had soul-searched  since Chen's  alleged money-laundering
scandal came to light in August, especially while being detained over the past
week. He felt remorseful for being "careless and foolish."</P>
      <P>Judge Tseng Cheng-lung said based on Yeh's position, it would be hard to believe
that he truly felt the information he passed on to Chen was unrelated to
criminal activity, and that the court would consider Yeh's attitude when meting
out punishment.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 11,000 grey-faced buzzards passed Kenting National Park in
southeastern Taiwan Tuesday, setting a single-day record, a park administration
specialist said.</P>
      <P>Tsai Yi-jung said that since the administration began the systematic
investigation of the number of the birds passing Kenting, the previous one-day
high was 8,300 on Oct. 11, 2005, while the largest number for a season was
35,800 in 2006.</P>
      <P>Tsai noted that as of Tuesday, more than 24,000 grey-faced buzzards had passed
Kenting.</P>
      <P>The birds usually fly through Taiwan between Oct. 1 and Oct. 20, with the
largest numbers of migrating birds seen one or two days after Oct. 10.</P>
      <P>This year, the massive movement started Oct. 9, with more than 3,000 flying
toward sea Oct. 10. Since then, the number has averaged between 1,000 and 3,000
per day.</P>
      <P>The grey-faced Buzzard is an Asian bird of prey. It is typically between 41-46
cm in length, making it a medium-sized raptor. It breeds in eastern Russia,
northern China, Korea, and Japan, and winters in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Lee Chin-hung, a Ph. D. candidate at National Normal Taiwan University who has
helped the National Geographic Channel film a documentary of the birds'
migration over the past year, said that he found the migratory route of the
birds was not always fixed and that some were actually wintering in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Low wages are the number one job problem facing young wage earners while
declining physical strength is the biggest worry for those nearing retirement
age, according to the results of a survey released by the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level CLA conducted the survey in September to gain a better
understanding of the living and job conditions of local wage earners, with 4,040
valid samples collected.</P>
      <P>Asked about job-related problems, 39 percent of the respondents in the 15-24 age
group cited "low wages" as their top headache and 30.7 percent listed "lack of
professional skills or expertise" as their biggest hurdle.</P>
      <P>For prime working age individuals in the 25-44 age group, the top two concerns
were low wages (28.6 percent) and difficulties in balancing family life and
their jobs.</P>
      <P>To those aged between 45-64, the three major concerns were falling physical
vigor (34.4 percent) , worries over being laid off (22.6 percent) and worries
about being unable to receive their pensions (20.5 percent).</P>
      <P>Analyzing the poll results, CLA officials said young and prime working age wage
earners tended to feel they are having a hard time making ends meet and that
young workers are particularly concerned about their lack of professional
skills.</P>
      <P>The poll findings also showed that the older the wage earners, the more they
worry about job security and retirement benefits.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that the intention to change jobs is highest among young
workers at 41.4 percent and the lowest among those in the 45-64 age group.</P>
      <P>Up to 74.5 percent of the overall respondents said they have no intention to
change jobs or change to other professions.</P>
      <P>Among those intending to change jobs, 40.6 percent said they hope to move to
different professions and 30.9 percent said they look forward to being
transferred to departments where their potential can be better developed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kaohsiung Port's container handling volume unchanged from 2007</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of containers handled at Kaohsiung harbor in southern Taiwan during
the first eight months of this year showed no growth from the same period of
2007, prompting worries that the port might not maintain its status as one of
the top 10 container ports in the world.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Department of Aviation and Navigation under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications pointed out that Kaohsiung port handled 6.72
million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) between January and August --  the same
level as during the corresponding period in 2007.</P>
      <P>Previously released official statistics showed that for the January-August
period of 2007, Kaohsiung harbor recorded an increase of 4.4 percent, or 283,380
TEUs, over the same period of 2006.</P>
      <P>For all of 2007, the port handled 10.25 million TEUs, setting a new record and
representing an increase of 4.9 percent over the previous year.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung was the world's third-largest container port in 2000, but its ranking
has slipped in recent years. It retained its status as the sixth-largest
container port in the world in 2006, but it slipped two places to become No. 8
in 2007.</P>
      <P>The stagnant growth in container handling volume in the first eight months has
triggered concern among officials about whether Kaohsiung port might be removed
from the top 10 list this year.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung is currently lagging behind the five ports that ranked from first to
fifth last year: Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Busan. It is also
behind China's Ningbo and Guangzhou ports, which placed 11th and 12th,
respectively, last year.</P>
      <P>Because the other three ports -- Dubai, Rotterdam and Hamburg -- that ranked
sixth, seventh and ninth, respectively, last year still have not publicized
updated container volume statistics, it is unclear whether Kaohsiung can remain
among the top 10 container ports in the world.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Yeh Sheng-mao, former chief of the Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of
Justice, openly admitted for the first time Tuesday that he did not inform his
superior of the ex-first  family's  possible  involvement  in  money-laundering,
backtracking on a previous charge.</P>
      <P>When Yeh's potential involvement in concealing information related to the money-
laundering allegations surfaced in August, he indicated that he had informed his
superior, State Public Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming, of the information
obtained from abroad, in a meeting in early February.</P>
      <P>But at Tuesday's trial hearing, Yeh admitted that he had not advised his boss of
the contents of reports from the Egmont Group, an international anti-money
laundering organization, on the first family's overseas bank accounts.</P>
      <P>He apologized to Chen Tsung-ming in court, saying "I was wrong" several times
during the trial hearing at the Taipei District Court.</P>
      <P>Yeh was indicted on Aug. 28 for concealing and not investigating information on
overseas bank accounts held by Chen Shui-bian's family members in the Cayman
Islands in the Caribbean.</P>
      <P>Yeh admitted on Sept. 2 that he handed the information to Chen Shui-bian in
February while Chen was still serving as president.</P>
      <P>His confession led prosecutors to bring an extra charge of leaking classified
information against him, paving the way for his detention on Oct. 6.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Yeh also testified  Tuesday that he passed on information on alleged
money-laundering activities of the former first family to former President Chen
Shui-bian as early as December 2006.</P>
      <P>He said that an anti-money laundering center at the Investigation Bureau
received information from Jersey in the Channel Islands in December 2006 on
overseas funds deposited there by Chen's family.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he called Lin Teh-hsun, then director of the president's office, two or
three days later to tell him he had received a report, without mentioning its
contents, but later passed the information on to Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen admitted in mid-August that his wife Wu Shu-jen had wired abroad an
unspecified amount of money that he had received as campaign contributions.</P>
      <P>Chen confessed that he had not been faithful in reporting the election campaign
expenses for his two mayoral elections and two presidential elections between
1993 and 2004 but claimed that he was unaware that the surplus funds were wired
abroad by his wife until early this year.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he also received information On Dec. 12, 2007 from the Cayman Islands
inquiring about Chen, his son, his daughter-in-law and the daughter-in-law's
father, through the Egmont Group.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he again called Lin in mid-December and late December about receiving
inquiries from the Cayman Islands, and passed on the compiled information to
Chen in early February this year.</P>
      <P>The former Investigation Bureau chief said that Chen, after being informed of
related information or letters, would tell him that a lot of the funds were used
on diplomatic missions and that he would handle the matter.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that in view of Chen's "stature and dignity, " he had believed that the
former president would handle the matter properly.</P>
      <P>In addition, as the chief of the Investigation Bureau, Yeh said, "I could not
doubt his words" and "had a duty to respect and obey him."</P>
      <P>Yeh said that he had soul-searched  since Chen's  alleged money-laundering
scandal came to light in August, especially while being detained over the past
week. He felt remorseful for being "careless and foolish."</P>
      <P>Judge Tseng Cheng-lung said based on Yeh's position, it would be hard to believe
that he truly felt the information he passed on to Chen was unrelated to
criminal activity, and that the court would consider Yeh's attitude when meting
out punishment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Income tax deductions to be increased from 2009: officials</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
10/15/08  11:48:17
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Income tax deductions will be largely increased from 2009, government officials
announced Tuesday after a meeting of the Executive Yuan's Tax Reform Commission
(TRC).</P>
      <P>According to the officials, TRC commissioners reached a consensus during the
meeting that the amounts of various tax deductions will be increased from next
year to ease wage earners' tax burdens.</P>
      <P>Up to 3.6 million households, or roughly 70 percent of the total, will benefit
from the proposed increases of the four deductions, officials said.</P>
      <P>In terms of the consensus, the standard deduction for single persons will be
raised to NT$60,000 per person from the current NT$46,000 and will be increased
for married couples filing together to NT$120,000 from NT$92,000 at present.</P>
      <P>The standard salary deduction will also be raised to NT$100,000 from the present
NT$78,000; deduction for education expenses will be increased to NT$25,000 per
person from the current NT$25,000 per household; and deduction for the disabled
will be raised to NT$100,000 from NT$77,000.</P>
      <P>If the tax deduction  increase proposal is passed by the Legislative Yuan, the
officials said, local taxpayers will be able to enjoy such benefits when they
file their tax returns for their 2009 incomes in 2010.</P>
      <P>The deduction increase plan, if passed, will cost national coffers an estimated
NT$15.3 billion, the officials said, adding that salaried people will benefit
from the increased salary deduction. Salaries have traditionally accounted for
75 percent of total income tax revenues.</P>
      <P>As to whether the income tax rates will be adjusted downward, the officials
said, it needs further discussion. Probably, they said, new income tax rates
could be adopted in 2010. If so, new tax rates will be used in 2011 when
taxpayers file reports on their 2010 incomes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Estate, gift tax rates may be lowered to 10%: finance minister</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance may opt to cut the maximum inheritance and gift tax
rates to 10 percent to lure funds back to Taiwan and buoy the domestic economy,
Finance Minister Lee Sush-der said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's Tax Reform Commission has already drawn up five versions of
an estate and gift tax reduction plan, but Lee said at a Legislative Yuan
Finance Committee hearing that his agency is leaning toward the Council for
Economic Planning and Development's proposal to lower the maximum rates to 10
percent.</P>
      <P>At present, the maximum marginal inheritance tax and gift tax rates are both 50
percent, a rate many economists believe compels wealthy Taiwanese to send their
money abroad to avoid paying taxes.</P>
      <P>"The Finance Ministry's stance is that it hopes inheritance and gift tax rates
can be lowered as much as possible. That would lure capital back to Taiwan and
bring greater vitality to the economy, " Lee said.</P>
      <P>The tax reduction plan, however, will have to submitted to Premier Liu Chao-
shiuan for approval, Lee said. Any tax reform plan has to be referred to the
Legislative Yuan for final approval.</P>
      <P>Lee said the new, lower estate and gift tax rates, if approved, will cost
national coffers an estimated NT$20 billion a year.</P>
      <P>According to the Finance Minitry, the inheritance and gift taxes are among the
least significant of the government's revenue sources, accounting for NT$28
billion in revenues in 2007.</P>
      <P>Lee has argued, however, that those receipts could be easily replaced by
increased tax revenues from brisker economic activity.</P>
      <P>In addition, according to Finance Ministry officials, only a small number of
people who have potential tax liabilities actually pay the taxes under existing
legal provisions.</P>
      <P>Only 4,900 of the 100,000 people with potential inheritance tax liabilities and
only 40,000 of the 200,000 with potential gift tax liabilities actually paid the
taxes in 2007, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In addition, most of the 4,900 paying inheritance tax were from the middle class
rather than wealthy individuals with over NT$100 million in tax liabilities, who
would be the main targets of the lower tax rates.</P>

      <P>The Taipei City government, under pressure from city councilors, acknowledged
Tuesday that a number of trees and plants in Taipei's parks have toxic fruit or
leaves and promised not to plant such trees in the future.</P>
      <P>At a Taipei City Council hearing Tuesday, Kuomintang (KMT) Councilor Ou Yang
Long asserted that of the more than 800,000 trees and plants in Taipei, 25
percent have toxic fruit or leaves.</P>
      <P>Those who come into contact with the leaves or eat the fruit may contract
allergies or develop symptoms such as dizziness  and vomiting, Ou Yang said.</P>
      <P>Chen Jia-chin, the director of Taipei City's Parks and Street Lights Office,
acknowledged that 68 kinds of trees planted in city parks and along sidewalks
have toxic elements.</P>
      <P>The Odollam erberus tree, the Pagoda tree, the Chinese tallow tree and the
paperbark were among those identified by Chen as being potentially hazardous.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that people should not touch the leaves or eat the fruit from
these trees and plants but said his office had no plans to remove them.</P>
      <P>He promised, however, that no more trees and plants that might pose a health

      <P>The World Trade Organization clarified Tuesday that a Chinese official at a WTO
committee meeting referred to the widespread adulteration of milk with the toxic
chemical melamine as an "incident," rather than as an "accident" as previously
reported.</P>
      <P>The WTO correction is an indication of the Chinese government's sensitivity to
the international community's reaction to the latest in a string of Chinese food
safety debacles that have raised concerns around the world.</P>
      <P>The Chinese description of the issue as an "accident" was seen by the news media
as an attempt by Chinese authorities to play down the issue.</P>
      <P>In the original summary of the Sanitary and Phytosanitary committe meeting, a

"accident, " but apparently the Chinese delegation did not mean to use the word
"accident" as understood in English.</P>

      <P>Academia Sinica would be pleased to name U.S. biochemist Roger Y. Tsien, a
winner of the 2008 Nobel Prize in chemistry, as an honorary academician and
invite him to visit Taiwan, the head of Taiwan's top research institution said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Academia  Sinica President  Chi-Huey  Wong seconded  ruling Kuomintang
Legislator Liao Cheng-ching's suggestion at a Legislative Yuan Education and
Culture Committee hearing that Academia Sinica name Tsien as an honorary
academician and invite him to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsien, a professor with the University of California, San Diego, won the Nobel
Prize in chemistry with Osamu Shimomura and Martin Chalfie last week for the
discovery and development of the green fluorescent protein, which can be used as
a tool to monitor the movement of cells and their affiliated proteins.</P>
      <P>Tsien, who has lived his entire life in the United States and was born to
parents from China, was previously rejected as an academician by Academia Sinica
academicians. Wong said the "honorary academician" title was more suitable.</P>
      <P>"Given that Tsien grew up in the United States, does not speak Mandarin and was
not educated in Taiwan, nominating him to become an 'honorary academician' would
be more feasible, " the Academia Sinica president said.</P>
      <P>Wong, also a biochemist, added that he was well acquainted with Tsien and had
known for sure that Tsien would some day become a Nobel laureate.</P>
      <P>"I will meet Tsien at international workshops or symposiums this year and I'd
like to extend an invitation to him then to visit Taiwan whenever it's
convenient for him, " Wong said.</P>
      <P>According  to Academia  Sinica regulations,  signatures  of endorsement from 10
academicians are required to enable a nominee to become an honorary academician.</P>
      <P>The Convocation of Academia Sinica consists of more than 240 academicians,
including  6  Nobel  laureates.  Unlike  regular academicians,  honorary
academicians do not necessarily perform research or attend meetings at the
Academia Sinica campus.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Researchers find method to extract DHA from algae</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Researchers at the Tainan-based National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) have
invented a new way to extract pollution-free docosa hexaenoic acid (DHA) from an
indigenous species of algae that could revolutionize the way the supplement is
produced commercially, academic sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Team members said DHA is normally  derived from fish and shellfish, but minute
quantity of toxins -- such as methyl mercury or dioxins -- may migrate from the
fish to the DHA, a common nutritional additive used in food or animal feeds.</P>
      <P>Chen I-min, an NCKU assistant professor and the co-leader of the project, said
this contamination led the team to search for new avenues to extract DHA, and it
decided to further investigate the possibility of deriving DHA from algae.</P>
      <P>The researchers first selected an alga species as the subject of their
experiment and then induced fermentation among algae to observe their DHA
productivity, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Yang Huey-lang, a professor at NCKU's Institute of Biotechnology, noted that the
results proved the algae can produce DHA in quantity and without man-made
pollutants, indicating its potential as a food ingredient.</P>
      <P>Yang said several Taiwan-based biotech companies have showed interest in the
process and its related technologies and in applying the method to mass
production.</P>
      <P>DHA is a highly touted food supplement that is said to help reduce the risk of
heart disease or mitigate DHA deficiences that may lead to diseases such as
Alzheimer's.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, after presenting the results to the 2008 annual meeting of the
European Aquaculture Society, the team's achievements were highly praised and an
award in the "Best Poster" section was given to the team, according to the
university.</P>

      <P>A high-speed ferry was officially launched at Taichung Harbor Wednesday, paving
the way for the opening of regular passenger and cargo ferry services between
Taichung and Makong on Penghu Island later this month.</P>
      <P>A host of honorary guests, including Vice President Vincent Siew's wife,  Chu
Chu-hsien,  Taichung County Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng and Taichung City Mayor
Jason Hu, attended a ribbon cutting ceremony for the high-speed OceanLaLa, owned
by Excalibur International Marine Corp.</P>
      <P>The guests were able to board and tour the vessel but did not get a chance to
set out to sea, because Excalibur International opted against testing waves
estimated by the Central Weather Bureau at between three and four meters high.</P>
      <P>The Taichung-Penghu ferry services will begin later in October if trial runs of
the OceanLaLa in coming days are successful and the Taichung Harbor Bureau
grants permission for the service to begin, said Excalibur International founder
Chiao Jen-ho, formerly a vice chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation.</P>
      <P>If everything goes smoothly, Chiao said, the Singapore-built OceanLaLa will also
sail between Penghu and China's southeastern coastal city of Xiamen beginning at
the end of October, in addition to the Taichung-Penghu route.</P>
      <P>The OceanLaLa is expected to offer visitors from Taiwan to China a new travel
option under the expanded "mini three links" formula, using Penghu -- about 41
kilometers off the southwest coast of Taiwan proper -- as a transit stop, Chiao
said.</P>
      <P>The 2,300-ton OceanLaLa will sail the Taichung-Penghu route at a speed up to 35
knots, covering the distance in two and a half hours, said Lu Chu-chun, an
Excalibur International spokesman.</P>
      <P>It would depart Taichung Harbor at 8 a.m. each day and return from Makong at 7
p.m. the same day.</P>
      <P>The ferry service will be priced competitively, Lu said, with a one-way ticket
costing NT$1,300 (US$40), compared to NT$1,610 (US$50) for an airplane ticket.</P>
      <P>The OceanLaLa can accommodate up to 536 passengers, along with 54 cars and six
tourist buses. An extra charge of NT$3,000 (US$95) will be collected per car
aboard.</P>
      <P>The Taichung Harbor Bureau looks forward to seeing tourism grow in central
Taiwan after the launch of the OceanLaLa -- the first passenger ferry service to
use the harbor since it was opened in 1976, harbor officials said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong on Wednesday announced a series of policies aimed at fostering the
territory's relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The policies are carried in the government's 2008-09 Policy Address, which was
given by Chief Executive Donald Tsang in the Legislative Council Wednesday
morning.</P>
      <P>Speaking about regional integration, Mr. Tsang said that the semi-official Hong
Kong Trade Development Council (TDC) will set up an office in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"The preparatory work is now at the final stage," he said.</P>
      <P>The aim is to strengthen exchanges and co-operation with Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Mr. Tsang also said that the government is encouraging local industrial and
business leaders, as well as Taiwanese businessmen in Hong Kong, to form a Hong
Kong-Taiwan Business Co-operation Committee.</P>
      <P>"The committee will facilitate direct communications between enterprises from
both places and foster closer co-operation in areas such as trade, investment
and tourism," he said.</P>
      <P>According to Tsang,  the Immigration  Department will also introduce two new
measures in January 2009 to provide greater convenience for frequent business
visitors and tourists from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The two new measures include:</P>
      <P>-Removing the restriction that limits a person to two iPermit applications---
applications for visa through the Internet--- within each 30-day period;</P>
      <P>-Extending the limit of stay in Hong Kong from 14 days to 30 days for holders of
iPermits and multiple-entry permits.</P>
      <P>Mr. Tsang also revealed that the government has set up an inter-departmental
steering committee to examine and co-ordinate the overall strategy and plans on
closer economic and trade ties with Taiwan.</P>

      <P>State-run Taiwan Sugar Corporation (TSC) has decided to expand the scale of its
organic farming operations in response to strong public demand, a press released
issued by the company said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The public enterprise will expand the land area devoted to cultivating organic
rice from the current 25 hectares to 113 hectares, which is expected to increase
annual output to 450 metric tons.</P>
      <P>At the same time, TSC will also extend its organic fruit and vegetable
cultivation to several townships in the Kaohsiung and Yunlin areas, through
which it hopes to expand its output to 300 metric tons of produce each year, the
press release said.</P>
      <P>Currently, the company maintains organic fruit and vegetable farms totaling 3.4
hectares of land in Huwei township in Yunlin County, Shanhua township in Tainan
County and Nanzih district in Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Due to a recent public scare over China-made foodstuffs after it was found that
milk powder tainted with melamine from China had been imported to and sold in
Taiwan, local demand for safe food had surged in recent weeks, pushing Taisugar
to step up its organic farming.</P>
      <P>Taisugar began its small-scale organic plantation of rice and vegetables in
2000, and its produce was only sold at its chain of convenience stores in
limited supplies, according to the press release.</P>
      <P>At present, the organic produce grown by TSC can be found at over 40 convenience
stores of the Matsusei chain and exclusive organic product stores in the Tainan,
Kaohsiung, Taichung and Taoyuan areas.</P>

      <P>Two Taiwanese students have been severely beaten by several faculty members and
students from Xiamen University in southeast China's Fujian province, Taiwan's
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The two young men, Hsueh An-cheng and Liao He-jun, - both students at Xiamen
University - were beaten Monday night. They were immediately taken to Chung Shan
Hospital in Xiamen.</P>
      <P>According to the SEF, Hsueh suffered a broken nose and was released from the
hospital after medical treatment. Liao sustained more wounds and received 40
stitches to the face and 100 stitches to the body.</P>
      <P>Liao remains in hospital in stable condition, a SEF official told CNA.</P>
      <P>The SEF cited witnesses as saying that the two Taiwanese students were eating at
a restaurant just outside the campus when they were beaten. Witnesses said that
the two students were being very noisy. This led to people at a nearby table
becoming very upset, to the extent of beating the two Taiwanese students.</P>
      <P>Upon receiving  information  about  the incident,  the SEF immediately made a
telephone call and then sent a formal letter to ARATS, asking for assistance.</P>
      <P>The SEF requested that the ARATS provide medical attention to the students,
investigate the actual cause of the incident, punish those involved and assist
in matters of compensation.</P>
      <P>According to the SEF, the ARATS has designated Xiamen police to investigate the
incident.  The SEF has also asked the Taiwan Businessmen Association in Xiamen
to send personnel to the hospital to look after the two students.</P>
      <P>The SEF expressed regret over this incident and warned Taiwanese students in
China to be cautious and to be aware of their safety.</P>
      <P>In addition, the SEF is reminding Taiwanese people in China to call their
24-hour hotline at 886-2712-9292 whenever they face problems.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations that are responsible for
handling cross-strait affairs in the absence of formal government relations.</P>
      <P>Xiamen City is a port city in mainland China where many Taiwan businessmen and

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese director Tsai Ming-liang was personally received Tuesday by the
director of the Louvre Museum in Paris, less than a month before shooting begins
at the famous museum for Tsai's latest film called "Visages."</P>
      <P>The director, along with leading actress Laetitia Casta and actor Lee Kang-
sheng, were welcomed by Henri Loyrett,  the museum's director, and they gathered
in front of Leonardo da Vinci's painting "St. John the Baptist," the face, or
"visage" of Tsai's new endeavor.</P>
      <P>The movie, a tribute to French New Wave cinema, will be a film within a film. It
tells the story of a Chinese filmmaker who heads to the Louvre to shoot a film
that revolves around the myth of Salome and her request to her father Herod that
St. John the Baptist be beheaded.</P>
      <P>Tsai said during the planning of the film that he was willing to shoot any
painting except for da Vinci's Mona Lisa, and when reminded of Tsai's comment
Tuesday, Loyrett laughed and agreed with the sentiment.</P>
      <P>Tsai also asked Loyrett if the painting of St. John the Baptist could be
exhibited in Taiwan when the film appears in movie theaters.</P>
      <P>"It is possible for you to film wherever you want or borrow any painting, but
you absolutely cannot borrow Mona Lisa, " Loyrett replied.</P>
      <P>"Visages" is the museum's latest collaboration with filmmakers to create
thematic productions based on its collection.</P>
      <P>The release in 2006 of "The Da Vinci Code, " which showcased the museum in a
number of its scenes, boosted the museum's popularity, with a record-breaking 84
million visitors setting foot in the Louvre in 2007.</P>
      <P>"Visages, " a French-Taiwanese production, will also be another cross-cultural
collaboration of different artistic elements, Loyrett noted, following the
architectural cooperation with I. M. Pei in 1983 to construct the Louvre
Pyramid, now a Paris landmark.</P>
      <P>Loyrett  went  on to express  his hope that the Louvre's significance would
transcend borders through Tsai's creation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai said he felt very proud and happy that a Taiwanese work would be
chosen to feature the museum.</P>
      <P>He believed that the Louvre wanted to show that cultural value could be
preserved in movies, and said this Taiwanese production with French assistance
would redefine art and show that movies are a type of culture as well.</P>
      <P>After three years of preparation and NT$200 million in investment from Taiwan,
France, the Netherlands and Belgium, shooting of the film is expected to begin
Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>Tsai will spend two and a half months in France and then shoot the remaining
scenes in Taipei early next year.</P>
      <P>The production has already been tapped as a possible hit at next year's Cannes
International Film Festival.</P>

      <P>Police authorities have made adequate security arrangements for a visit to
Taiwan by a top Beijing negotiator to ensure his safety, National Police Agency
(NPC) Director-General Wang Cho-chiun said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Although it is the National Security Bureau that is primarily responsible for
security during the Beijing official's visit, the police are well prepared to
protect his safety at his place of accommodation and while he is attending
activities in Taiwan, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks while answering questions by ruling Kuomintang  (KMT)
Legislator Lee Chia-chin,  who urged police authorities to get ready for the
upcoming visit by Chen Yun-lin, president of the quasi-official Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , which is slated for late October
or early November.</P>
      <P>"However, it remains unclear which hotel Chen will stay at and what activities
he will engage in while in Taiwan," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Chen is slated to hold talks in Taipei with his Taiwanese counterpart,  Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung,  on cross-strait
transportation issues, including the establishment of regular cargo charter
flights and expansion of weekend passenger charter flights, and on cross-strait
cooperation in the areas of financial supervision and crime fighting.</P>
      <P>The Chiang-Chen meeting in Taipei will be a follow-up to a landmark meeting
between the two men in Beijing in June, in which they clinched two accords on
weekend charter flights and Taiwan's wider opening to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>In light of Chen's highly sensitive status as China's top liaison with Taiwan in
the absence of contact between the two governments, Lee called for the highest
degree of protection of Chen's personal safety while the official is in Taiwan,
in order to avoid any possible complications in bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said it will stage
a large-scale anti-China demonstration Oct. 25 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen Cheng-wen, head of the DPP's Kaohsiung City committee, said the response
among supporters has been enthusiastic. He estimated that 165 fully loaded tour
buses will transport people from Kaohsiung to Taipei to join the protest.</P>
      <P>To achieve the DPP's target of 1 million protestors, Kaohsiung city councilors
and DPP members have been assigned to mobilize supporters and have each been
allotted a quota, Chen Cheng-wen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Children whose father or mother have cancer can be tormented by the experience,
a survey has revealed, with most children feeling financial woes but some also
suffering severe emotional disturbances.</P>
      <P>According to a survey released Wednesday by the Taipei-based Hope Society for
Cancer Care, 88 percent of 323 respondent cancer families -- defined as families
with children in elementary or junior high school whose father, mother or both
parents are afflicted with cancer -- said the most obvious impact of cancer on
their home life was the financial strain brought by the disease.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 20 percent of the cancer patients who responded said they
still must work to maintain their livelihood.</P>
      <P>Only 30 percent of the polled cancer families obtained financial aid through
social welfare organizations while 10 percent of the families said they relied
on relief from relatives and friends.</P>
      <P>Chien Huei-lan, an executive member of the society, said that although the
national health insurance system covers part of cancer patients' medical
treatment costs, it does not pay for new and expensive targeted medication.</P>
      <P>And medication is only part of the high expenses a cancer patient has to face,
which also include spending on caregivers and special nutrition, she said.</P>
      <P>Some patients were also faced with the challenge of a declining income because
they needed to take work leaves to seek medical treatment.</P>
      <P>In his study in the survey, Lu Chun-hung, a lecturer at Soochow University's
Department of Social Work, said 80 percent of the children will experience
negative emotional disturbances such as sorrow, anxiety, and anger after
learning their parents have been diagnosed with the disease.</P>
      <P>But he also found that 53 percent of the children in cancer families became more
clever and learned how to handle situations.</P>
      <P>In coping of their parent's affliction, some children take it on themselves to
replace the parent and mature prematurely while others suffer behavioral
degeneration and emotional blocks that holds them back in school and in their
relationships with friends, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Chien concluded that economically-challenged cancer families not only need more
support from the national health insurance system and social welfare policies,
the children also need assistance that will help them surmount the dark clouds
hovering over their family.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan-produced box office hit, Cape No. 7, won the Best Narrative Film
Award at the 2008 Louis Vuitton Hawaii International Film Festival Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to information posted on the festival's Web site, an international
jury screened 150 entries from 36 countries based on the Hawaii film festival's
mandate "to entertain, enlighten and empower."</P>
      <P>Other awards were presented for the best documentary, the best short film, the
best film in Hawaii, achievement in acting, plus a Viewers Choice Award, a
Maverick Award, and an award from the Network for the Promotion of Asian Cinema.</P>
      <P>Vanessa Shih, minister of the Government Information Office (GIO), has extended
congratulations on behalf of the government to the film's director Wei Te-sheng,
who was present at the festival, according to officials at the GIO's Department
of Motion Picture Affairs.</P>
      <P>The officials said that in addition to receiving a cash award of NT$100,000, Wei
will be entitled to a government subsidy to cover 20 percent of the movie's
NT$50 million (US$1.54 million) budget.</P>
      <P>The Hawaii film festival award was the third in row for Cape No. 7, which also

Japan, in September, as well as three awards -- the Grand Prize, the Best Music
and Best Cinematography awards -- at the 2008 Taipei Film Festival in June
before the film was released commercially.</P>
      <P>Cape No. 7 is a romantic comedy and Wei's first full-length motion picture. It
is still being screened in movie theaters around Taiwan, with box office takings
already surpassing NT$400 million (US$12.34 million) -- the second highest in
Taiwan, next to the NT$775 million for the Hollywood blockbuster Titanic.</P>
      <P>The film tells two interrelated stories. One is a love story about a Japanese
man leaving his Taiwanese girlfriend in what is now Pingtung County in southern
Taiwan when Japan gave up its colonial rule of the island. The other is about
the dreams of a group of young, amateur Taiwanese musicians.</P>
      <P>In her congratulatory message to Wei, Shih wished him further success with his
next feature film, Seediq Bale, on which shooting is scheduled to begin in
autumn next year.</P>
      <P>Seediq Bale is a story about the Wushe Incident of 1930, in which Seediq warrior
Mona Rudao led the aboriginal people from his tribe in an armed rebellion
against the Japanese occupiers in Nantou County.</P>
      <P>They killed 125 Japanese and wounded more than 200 others. In retaliation, the
Japanese colonial government deployed 2,000 soldiers and police officers who
placed the Seediq tribe under siege for months. Mona, along with some 300 of his
warriors, refused to surrender and killed themselves.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 61 percent of Taiwan's white- collar workers are afraid they would be
laid off amid the sluggish economic situation in the country, according to the
results of a survey released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Some 25.7 percent of the respondents said their companies were seemingly
prepared to streamline the work force, while 8.8 percent said their companies
had already cut the number of employees, the survey conducted by the 104 Job
Bank showed.</P>
      <P>A little more than 16 percent of the employees polled said their enterprises had
not filled the vacancies left by departing workers, while 45.7 percent said they
were not aware of any job-cutting plans by their employers.</P>
      <P>Around 6.5 percent of the respondents said they thought they would "very
probably" be laid off, in contrast to 55.1 percent who said that they "could"
face that fate.</P>
      <P>Twenty-two of the white-collar workers polled said they were confident that they
would not be fired, while 16.5 percent said they were fully convinced they would
be laid off, the survey found.</P>
      <P>Regarding bonuses, 29.3 percent were apprehensive that their year-end bonuses or
cash rewards would be adversely affected by sagging business, while 28.9 percent
said that their benefits had been cut.</P>
      <P>Some 8.6 percent complained of a salary cut due to their companies' operating
losses, but 3.4 percent of the white-collar workers said they had received a pay
raise.</P>
      <P>In view of the financial crisis that has swept many countries across the globe,
32 percent of the office workers polled contended that the bio-medical sector
would not be affected but instead would score a brilliant performance.</P>
      <P>Industries related to astrological readings, foodstuff, gas and electricity, and
telecommunications were cited by most of the respondents as sectors less
vulneralbe to the effects of sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, construction, tourism, auto manufacturing, financial
insurance, and department stores are the businesses most likely to come under
strong pressure as a result of the present economic recession, according to the
poll.</P>
      <P>The public opinion survey was conducted from Sept. 30 to Oct. 4. It collected
3,919 valid questionnaires and had a margin of error of 1.57 percent.</P>

      <P>A textile exhibition featuring healthy, bio-friendly and hi-tech fibers opened
at the World Trade Center in Taipei Wednesday, according to the organizer.</P>
      <P>The 2008 Taipei Innovative Textile Application Show (TITAS) attracted some 250
exhibitors, including companies from India, Japan and China, that are showcasing
their latest innovative products at 500 booths, said the organizer, the Taiwan
Textile Federation (TTF).</P>
      <P>TTF secretary-general Huang Wei-ji said that the TTF collaborated for the first
time with certified manufacturers such as Far Eastern Textile and Control Union
to plan a special organic cotton section that would serve as a showpiece for
"green industry opportunities."</P>
      <P>Huang also noted that several Taiwanese manufacturers have unveiled new products
that use bio-friendly materials such as natural bamboo, charcoal and corn
fibers.</P>
      <P>Innovative products are even more important in light of the economic downturn,
said Huang Hua-de, chairman of TEXMA International Co., a local manufacturer
that has developed fabrics with the use of recycled plastic bottles. TEXMA's
export orders are expected to increase sharply this year, he said.</P>
      <P>TITAS is being held with the support of the National Cotton Council of America
and several textile-related domestic corporations such as Nan Ya Plastics and
Formosa Chemicals &amp; Fiber.</P>
      <P>The show will end on October 17.</P>

      <P>The Taipei District Prosecutors Office sought to detain Yu Chen-shien, a former
minister of the interior, Wednesday on charges connected to a case of alleged
bribery.</P>
      <P>Yu was intercepted by law-enforcement personnel at Kaohsiung International
Airport Wednesday while he was attempting to leave the country after being
listed as a potential suspect in the case of alleged bribery in connection with
the construction of an exhibition hall in the Taipei suburban district of
Nangang in 2003.</P>
      <P>Yu was then taken to the Taipei District Prosecutors Office where he was
questioned about his role in the case.</P>
      <P>Lin Chin-tsun, deputy chief prosecutor of the office, said after the questioning
that the prosecutor in charge of the case filed for a court order to detain Yu
after the investigator found that Yu was possibly involved in leaking
confidential government information, profiteering, and colluding with witnesses
in the case.</P>
      <P>Lin said Yu was barred from leaving the country before the prosecutors office
summoned him on Oct. 7 to report to the office Thursday as a potential suspect.</P>
      <P>Earlier Wednesday the prosecutor sent another summons asking Yu to report to the
office that day after it was learned that the suspect was preparing to leave the
country, Lin said.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecutors office, Yu is suspected of leaking the names of
members of a committee that was responsible for screening the bids for the
costly construction of the Nangang Exhibition Hall.</P>
      <P>Yu made the name list available to the company that eventually won the bid,
during his tenure as minister of the interior in the period 2002-2004, the

    <HEADLINE>Official makes pitch in support of direct postal links with China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Direct postal links between Taiwan and China would reduce the delivery time and
save costs to the benefit of both sides, an official familiar with the postal
industry said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The official, who requested anonymity, made the statement after Yang Yi, a
spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said earlier in the day in Beijing
that the launch of direct postal links will be on the agenda of the cross-strait
negotiations to be held late this month or early November in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The lack of postal links resulted partly from the fact that there were no direct
cross-strait air links prior to the weekend direct charter flights that were
launched on July 4, the official explained.</P>
      <P>Currently,  all China-bound mail distributed either by the state-run Chunghwa
Postal Co., Ltd. or private express delivery companies are sent to China via a
transit point and are handled by one or more forwarding agents, the official
said.</P>
      <P>In the best case scenario, which means minimum time between the air transfers,
it takes one day for express mail from Taiwan to arrive at the delivery point in
China, the official said.</P>
      <P>But more often it takes three days, the official said, adding that direct postal
links would ensure one-day delivery.</P>
      <P>However, this would not apply to ordinary post which would take one week to
twelve days to deliver, according to the official.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, there is no postal clearance mechanism between Taiwan and China at
this time, which means each side is responsible for compensation to the sender
if registered post is lost by the other side.</P>
      <P>This puts Taiwan at an advantage, in light of the fact that the volume of mail
from Taiwan to China is much more than that sent from China to Taiwan, said the
official.</P>
      <P>The official welcomed China's decision to include the issue in the forthcoming
talks, and said he looked forward to seeing the nagging problem settled once and
for all.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two legislators told Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi  Wednesday  that the
government's  income subsidy plan implemented from October to help "near poor"
people cope with price hikes lacks legal foundation.</P>
      <P>Wu Yu-sheng, a legislator of the ruling Kuomintang, said at a meeting of the
Legislative Yuan's Internal Administration Committee that the subsidy plan is a
matter of urgency because many low-income families need help.</P>
      <P>Wu said that although he supports the NT$20.2 billion (US$ 623.46 million)
allocation requested by the government to implement the plan in 2009, the
interior minister must first provide a legal basis to justify the planned
budget.</P>
      <P>Chiu Yi-ying,  a legislator  of the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party,
claimed that the NT$5.7 billion to be spent by the government on the plan in the
final quarter of 2008 and the NT$20.2 billion it has requested for 2009 are both
"unlawful."</P>
      <P>She said she and other DPP legislators  will introduce a resolution to freeze
the budget request.</P>
      <P>In response, the interior minister acknowledged there were some errors in
formulating the subsidy plan. He said he will consult with budget experts on how
to straighten out the proposal.</P>
      <P>The income subsidy plan is intended to help 1.35 million people in 450,000
families that are at risk of falling into poverty because of continuous hikes in
commodity prices during the past months.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, one employed member in each family whose annual income is below
NT$300,000 and whose assets are worth less than NT$3.9 million would be entitled
to between NT$3,000 and NT$6,000 per month for six months.</P>

      <P>Sixty-four percent of the people in Taiwan approve of a visit to the country by
a top China negotiator for high-level talks, according to the results of a poll
released by the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>But 52 percent of the respondents also said that China should first apologize
for selling its toxic dairy products to Taiwan, before Chen Yunlin, president of
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, can visit Taiwan to hold
talks with his counterpart Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Straits Exchange
Foundation.</P>
      <P>Liu Te-hsun, MAC spokesman and vice chairman, urged China to address the
mainstream concern of the Taiwan people so as to lay a solid foundation for the
development of harmonious relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that 64.29 percent of the respondents support the Chiang-Chen
meeting, which is expected to take place in Taiwan later this month or early
November.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is planning to hold a
demonstration Oct.  25 to protest what it called the incompetence of President
Ma Ying-jeou's administration and to drive home its call for the safeguarding of
Taiwan's sovereignty. The party also aims to highlight what is said is the
inappropriate timing of Chen's visit amid a public scare over imports of toxic
milk products from China.</P>
      <P>The scheduled Chiang-Chen meeting will be a follow-up to a landmark meeting in
Beijing between the two in mid-June during which both sides reached an agreement
on weekend cross-strait charter flights and the expansion of the number of
Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the poll results, 64.29 percent of the Taiwan public support the
upcoming Chiang-Chen meeting, with 55.51 percent saying that they do not think
Chen's visit would undermine national dignity or interests.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that 64.85 percent of those polled think the Chinese
government is unfriendly toward Taiwan government and 45.98 percent think that
the Chinese government is unfriendly toward the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the results of the survey, National Chengchi University professor
Chao Chien-min said that "there is no need to worry about that issue."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that in previous polls, the ratio of people who thought that
China was friendly toward Taiwan never surpassed 2 percent.</P>
      <P>But in the latest survey, those who think China is friendly toward the Taiwan
government and the Taiwan people accounted for 24 and 39 percent of the
respondents, respectively, he noted.</P>
      <P>"This shows that the recent improvement in cross-strait relations has more or
less changed the Taiwan people's stereotypical impression of China," he
concluded.</P>
      <P>The survey, commissioned by the MAC and conducted by the Taiwan-based China
Credit Information Service between Oct. 10 and 12, collected a total of 1.081
effective samples and had a margin of error of 2.98 percentage points.</P>

      <P>Taiwan welcomed its 3 millionth visitor this year -- a South Korean -- with
fanfare Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau Deputy Director-General Steven T. Y. Kuo Su presided over a
welcome ceremony at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport for Kim In-Tae, and
presented him with an NT$300,000 (US$9,260) debit card to spend in Taiwan,
locally produced millet liquor, necklaces and other gifts.</P>
      <P>Kuo Su expressed the hope that more foreign visitors will come to Taiwan for
sightseeing, and that Taiwan will be able "to welcome its 4 millionth visitor by
the end of the year."</P>
      <P>Kim, who traveled to Taiwan with his family members for a scheduled four-day
visit, said "it was indeed a pleasant surprise" to learn that he was the 3
millionth visitor.</P>
      <P>He was also happy to be showered with so many gifts and to be given NT$300,000
to spend in Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Kim said that when he returns to South Korea, he will encourage his friends and
relatives to visit Taiwan and he hopes that one of them will be the lucky 4
millionth visitor.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau officials said that they had invited more than 400 foreign
journalists and 600 travel agents to visit Taiwan between January and September,
in the hope that these professionals would promote Taiwan's fun travel and rich
tourism resources.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau is also working with the media, PR companies and air carriers
in Asia and major countries in Europe and the Americas to promote Tour Taiwan
Years 2008-2009.</P>
      <P>Tourism officials said that these measures are aimed at developing new emerging
markets, attracting new visitors, and tapping into the Japanese market more
heavily. Japan has traditionally been the largest source of foreign visitors to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The officials said that they also have various promotion programs in place in
Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Malaysia and other Asian countries, with the aim of
reaching the 4 millionth visitor mark by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>Taiwan welcomed its 3 millionth visitor this year -- a South Korean -- with
fanfare Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau Deputy Director-General Steven T. Y. Kuo Su presided over a
welcome ceremony at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport for Kim In-Tae, and
presented him with an NT$300,000 (US$9,260) debit card to spend in Taiwan,
locally produced millet liquor, necklaces and other gifts.</P>
      <P>Kuo Su expressed the hope that more foreign visitors will come to Taiwan for
sightseeing, and that Taiwan will be able "to welcome its 4 millionth visitor by
the end of the year."</P>
      <P>Kim, who traveled to Taiwan with his family members for a scheduled four-day
visit, said "it was indeed a pleasant surprise" to learn that he was the 3
millionth visitor.</P>
      <P>He was also happy to be showered with so many gifts and to be given NT$300,000
to spend in Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Kim said that when he returns to South Korea, he will encourage his friends and
relatives to visit Taiwan and he hopes that one of them will be the lucky 4
millionth visitor.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau officials said that they had invited more than 400 foreign
journalists and 600 travel agents to visit Taiwan between January and September,
in the hope that these professionals would promote Taiwan's fun travel and rich
tourism resources.</P>

in Asia and major countries in Europe and the Americas to promote Tour Taiwan
Years 2008-2009.</P>
      <P>Tourism officials said that these measures are aimed at developing new emerging

heavily. Japan has traditionally been the largest source of foreign visitors to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The officials said that they also have various promotion programs in place in
Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Malaysia and other Asian countries, with the aim of

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two legislators told Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi Wednesday that the
government's income subsidy plan implemented from October to help "near poor"
people cope with price hikes lacks legal foundation.</P>
      <P>Wu Yu-sheng, a legislator of the ruling Kuomintang, said at a meeting of the
Legislative Yuan's Internal Administration Committee that the subsidy plan is a
matter of urgency because many low-income families need help.</P>
      <P>Wu said that although he supports the NT$20.2 billion (US$ 623.46 million)
allocation requested by the government to implement the plan in 2009, the
interior minister must first provide a legal basis to justify the planned
budget.</P>
      <P>Chiu Yi-ying,  a legislator  of the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party,
claimed that the NT$5.7 billion to be spent by the government on the plan in the
final quarter of 2008 and the NT$20.2 billion it has requested for 2009 are both
"unlawful."</P>
      <P>She said she and other DPP legislators  will introduce a resolution to freeze
the budget request.</P>
      <P>In response, the interior minister acknowledged there were some errors in
formulating the subsidy plan. He said he will consult with budget experts on how
to straighten out the proposal.</P>
      <P>The income subsidy plan is intended to help 1.35 million people in 450,000
families that are at risk of falling into poverty because of continuous hikes in
commodity prices during the past months.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, one employed member in each family whose annual income is below
NT$300,000 and whose assets are worth less than NT$3.9 million would be entitled
to between NT$3,000 and NT$6,000 per month for six months.</P>

      <P>Former Minister of the Interior Yu Chen-shien was detained Wednesday on charges
connected to a case of alleged bribery.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court granted prosecutors' request for Yu's detention on
grounds that he was possibly involved in leaking confidential government
information and profiteering, and may have colluded with witnesses in the case.</P>
      <P>Yu was intercepted by law-enforcement personnel at Kaohsiung International
Airport Wednesday while he was attempting to leave the country after being
listed as a potential suspect in the case of alleged bribery on a construction
project for an exhibition hall in the Taipei suburban district of Nangang in
2003.</P>
      <P>Yu was taken to the Taipei District Prosecutors Office where he was questioned
about his role in the case.</P>
      <P>Lin Chin-tsun, deputy chief prosecutor of the office, said after the questioning
that the prosecutor in charge of the case had filed for a court order to detain
Yu.</P>
      <P>Lin said Yu was barred from leaving the country before the prosecutors office
summoned him on Oct. 7 to report to the office Thursday as a potential suspect.</P>
      <P>Earlier Wednesday the prosecutor sent another summons asking Yu to report to the
office that day after it was learned that the suspect was preparing to leave the
country, Lin said.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecutors office, Yu is suspected of leaking the names of
members of a committee that was responsible for screening the bids for the
costly construction of the Nangang Exhibition Hall.</P>
      <P>Yu made the name list available to the company that eventually won the bid,
during his tenure as minister of the interior in the period 2002-2004, the

      <P>Sixty-four percent of the people in Taiwan approve of a visit to the country by
a top China negotiator for high-level talks, according to the results of a poll
released by the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>But 52 percent of the respondents also said that China should first apologize
for selling its toxic dairy products to Taiwan, before Chen Yunlin, president of
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, can visit Taiwan to hold
talks with his counterpart Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Straits Exchange
Foundation.</P>
      <P>Liu Te-hsun, MAC spokesman and vice chairman, urged China to address the
mainstream concern of the Taiwan people so as to lay a solid foundation for the
development of harmonious relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that 64.29 percent of the respondents support the Chiang-Chen
meeting, which is expected to take place in Taiwan later this month or early
November.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is planning to hold a
demonstration Oct.  25 to protest what it called the incompetence of President
Ma Ying-jeou's administration and to drive home its call for the safeguarding of
Taiwan's sovereignty. The party also aims to highlight what is said is the
inappropriate timing of Chen's visit amid a public scare over imports of toxic
milk products from China.</P>
      <P>The scheduled Chiang-Chen meeting will be a follow-up to a landmark meeting in
Beijing between the two in mid-June during which both sides reached an agreement
on weekend cross-strait charter flights and the expansion of the number of
Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the poll results, 64.29 percent of the Taiwan public support the
upcoming Chiang-Chen meeting, with 55.51 percent saying that they do not think
Chen's visit would undermine national dignity or interests.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that 64.85 percent of those polled think the Chinese
government is unfriendly toward Taiwan government and 45.98 percent think that
the Chinese government is unfriendly toward the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the results of the survey, National Chengchi University professor
Chao Chien-min said that "there is no need to worry about that issue."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that in previous polls, the ratio of people who thought that
China was friendly toward Taiwan never surpassed 2 percent.</P>
      <P>But in the latest survey, those who think China is friendly toward the Taiwan
government and the Taiwan people accounted for 24 and 39 percent of the
respondents, respectively, he noted.</P>
      <P>"This shows that the recent improvement in cross-strait relations has more or
less changed the Taiwan people's stereotypical impression of China," he
concluded.</P>
      <P>The survey, commissioned by the MAC and conducted by the Taiwan-based China
Credit Information Service between Oct. 10 and 12, collected a total of 1.081
effective samples and had a margin of error of 2.98 percentage points.</P>

      <P>Huang also noted that several Taiwanese manufacturers have unveiled new products
that use bio-friendly materials such as natural bamboo, charcoal and corn
fibers.</P>
      <P>Innovative products are even more important in light of the economic downturn,

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Ministry (MOFA) said Thursday that the ministry's
representative office has certified the death certificate issued for Taiwan's
second richest man, Wang Yung-ching, who passed away in New York Wednesday
morning, and that it will provide all necessary help to Wang's family.</P>
      <P>Wang, founder of Formosa Plastics Group, died from a myocardial infarction at
the age of 92, according to media reports.</P>
      <P>"The certification  for Wang's death certificate  has been completed, " MOFA
spokesman Henry Chen said at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>"Besides expressing our condolences, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is willing
to provide all necessary assistance to his family," he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the MOFA's representative office in New York was informed on
Wednesday afternoon of Wang's death, Chen said the ministry only certified the
authenticity of the death certificate rather the contents of the document,
refusing to reveal the cause of Wang's death. However, it is believed that the
cause of his death was myocardial infarction-caused cardiorespiratory failure.</P>
      <P>Wang was an influential entrepreneur who founded a large business empire in
Taiwan. According to the 2008 Forbes survey, he was the 178th richest person in
the world with an estimated net worth of US$5.5 billion.</P>
      <P>He was born in Hsintien township, Taiwan. Despite lacking any formal schooling
beyond elementary school, he is currently ranked second on the Forbes list of
Taiwan's Richest.</P>
      <P>Wang's group is the parent company of several major publicly traded companies,
including Formosa Plastic Corp., Nan Ya Plastics Corp. and Formosa
Petrochemical.</P>
      <P>In June 2006, after he stepped down from his position as the day-to-day head of
the company and handed over the business empire to his brother and daughters,
Wang remained chairman of the boards of Nan Ya Plastics, Formosa Chemistry &amp;
Fiber Corp. and Cyma Plywood &amp; Lumber Co.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan approved Thursday an inheritance and gift tax rate reform
proposal submitted by the Ministry of Finance which cuts the maximum marginal
rate to a uniform 10 percent.</P>
      <P>The inheritance tax deduction will be increased to NT$12 million (US$369,230)
from the current NT$7.79 million, while the gift tax reductions will be raised
to NT$2.2 million from NT$1.1 million.</P>
      <P>At present, the maximum marginal inheritance tax and gift tax rates are both 50
percent -- a rate many economists believe compels wealthy Taiwanese to send
their money abroad to avoid paying taxes.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Lee Sush-der said a day earlier that the new estate and gift
tax rates will cost the government an estimated NT$20 billion a year.</P>
      <P>However, he added that those losses could easily be made up by increased tax

      <P>The Grand Hotel has announced a plan to reduce its staff by 10 percent as part
of its efforts to prevent the enterprise's financial situation from worsening,
but the hotel's labor union has protested the management's move, insisting on
its members' right to work.</P>
      <P>"Employees  should perform services  well,  but it is the responsibility of
management to make a profit, " Lee Huan-yang, the union's spokesman, said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA Wednesday, Johnson Chiang, the hotel's president, said
that the hotel has been operating in the red for five consecutive years and that
its losses for this year alone amounted to NT$150 million (US$4.63 million) as
of the end of September.</P>
      <P>The only exception, he added, was the surplus of NT$28,000 in 2007 from income
from non-operating  revenues  such as stock investment.</P>
      <P>Chiang pointed out that the hotel's operating expenses are roughly double those
of its competitors, adding that he can only improve the business'  finances  by
shutting down unprofitable departments.</P>
      <P>For example, the hotel will lay off five employees at the Li Bai Lounge by the
end of this month, and 87 more at the Yuan Shan Club of Kaohsiung in southern
Taiwan, with the date yet to be determined.</P>
      <P>Apart from these layoffs,  Chiang said he will also make adjustments to the
hotel's workforce according to seasonal needs and demand.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chiang explained that the hotel's contract with the labor union
obligates the hotel to pay staff triple their salary on national and typhoon
holidays, making it harder for the hotel to make ends meet in light of the
present economic slowdown.</P>

Wang Yung-ching, who died Wednesday in New Jersey at 92, will be flown back from
New York to Taiwan Friday morning, the FPG said in a statement Thursday.</P>
      <P>The statement said EVA Air plane carrying Wang's body will arrive at Taiwan's
Taoyuan International Airport at 5:15 a.m. Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, Wang and his wife traveled to the United States on
Oct. 11 for an inspection of the assembly lines of the company's factories
there, and had originally intended to stay seven to 10 days.</P>

Since then, his businesses have expanded to the realms of medical, biotech,
thermo power station, automobile, electronics, silicon wafer and kitchen waste
recycling and reuse.</P>

the FPG group had 95,538 employees, with a total revenue of NT$1.967 trillion
and total assets of NT$2.462 trillion.</P>
      <P>The FPG was the most profitable enterprise in Taiwan last year, achieving after-

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will make public Friday
details about its planned Oct. 25 march, including the estimated number of
participants, aimed at calling for the safeguarding of Taiwan's national
sovereignty, according to a party official.</P>
      <P>DPP Information and Culture Department Director Cheng Wen-tsan said Wednesday
after a weekly meeting of the DPP Central Standing Committee that the rally will
highlight three appeals: "protesting the one-China market, " "opposing the
incompetent government" and "opposing the hollowing out of Taiwan's
sovereignty."</P>
      <P>To realize the goals, the DPP is working hard to encourage citizens from all
walks of life to join the event to demonstrate their resolve to uphold Taiwan's
sovereignty, Cheng noted.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen also urged everyone who supports the rally's aims to
join the event, regardless of their political affiliation.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the rally will be held to protest the upcoming visit by Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits President Chen Yunlin, Beijing's top
negotiator on Taiwan-related issues, who is slated to make his first trip to the
island at the end of October or early November for talks with his Taiwanese
counterpart Strait Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung.</P>
      <P>Also on Wednesday, the DPP issued a statement under the title of "boycott
Chinese substandard goods and protect Taiwan" which said that the DPP, in
conjunction with all sectors of society, will launch a series of activities from
the end of this month to express the Taiwan people's discontent with the
government, their attitude toward China,  and their desire  to make their voices
heard in the international community.</P>
      <P>Another focus of discussion during the meeting was DPP Deputy Secretary-General
Chen Chi-mai's offer to resign amid criticism over his taking part in an event
several days ago to show support for former President Chen Shui-bian, who is
being investigated on allegations of corruption and money laundering.</P>
      <P>Agreeing with committee member Chai Trong-rong's proposal to retain Chen for his
outstanding performance, the DPP chairwoman said that she would not approve his
resignation, according to Cheng.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan will not sign CEPA with China: MAC chair</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan definitely will not sign a Closer Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)
with China, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"A CEPA was clinched between Hong Kong and China, but Taiwan is not Hong Kong,
and Taiwan certainly will not ink a similar pact with China," Lai stressed while
answering questions from lawmakers of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) during a legislative committee meeting.</P>
      <P>"The MAC has not, nor will it, authorize the quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation  (SEF)  to negotiate  with China's Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) on that issue, " Lai asserted.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong and China inked a CEPA in June 2003, helping to open up a huge market
for Hong Kong goods and services and effectively improving Hong Kong's economy.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers voiced concern that if Taiwan signed a CEPA with China it would
harm Taiwan's national dignity and its independent status.</P>
      <P>The DPP and other pro-independence groups are very disgruntled over a planned
visit to Taiwan in late October or early November by ARATS President Chen Yunlin
who serves as China's top negotiator with Taiwan -- fearing that it might lead
to Taiwan tilting further toward China.</P>
      <P>Although the date of Chen's visit has yet to be fixed, the DPP is planning to
hold a large anti-China protest in Taipei Oct. 25.</P>
      <P>Chen and his Taiwanese counterpart, SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, for the first
time for talks in a historical meeting in June in Beijing, in which two accords
on weekend charter flights and Taiwan's wider opening to Chinese tourists were
clinched.</P>
      <P>Issues regarding cross-Taiwan Strait transportation services, including the
establishment of regular cargo charter flights and expansion of weekend
passenger charter flights, as well as financial supervisory cooperation and
crime-fighting, will be high on the agenda of their second round of talks in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen would be the highest-ranking official from the People's Republic of China
ever to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The major opposition party and other pro-independence groups will also jointly
stage a large demonstration Nov. 2 to protest the government's polices to build
close links with China since President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May this
year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou saluted Thursday the extraordinary contributions that
Taiwan's "God of Business, " Wang Yung-ching, made to the country. Wang, founder
of the Formosa Plastics Group, died in New York earlier in the day at the age of
92.</P>
      <P>"The president was sad upon learning of Wang's death and he offered his highest
respects to the man who made unprecedentedly outstanding  contributions  to
Taiwan's economic development, " Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said
at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Ma made a phone call to the late Wang's family to express his condolences
immediately upon learning of his death, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The president and the late Formosa Plastics Group founder were more than just
acquaintances -- they ran, debated and ate the traditional Taiwanese delicacy
oyster noodles together, Wang Yu-chi said.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is almost a professional runner, ran the 5,000-meter race with Wang
Yung-ching more than 10 times over the past two decades at the Formosa Plastics
Group's annual corporate games.</P>
      <P>The president said the late Wang -- a rags-to-riches model who showed lifelong
diligence in his work and who lived a simple and frugal life despite his
position as founder of the most financially successful business group in Taiwan
-- represented the core values of Taiwan, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>The president particularly  mentioned his respect for Wang Yung-ching's resolute
leadership in efforts to promote environmental protection and sustainable
growth, Wang Yu-chi said.</P>
      <P>A man of far-reaching vision, Wang Yung-ching began contributing to educational
and medical development on the Chinese mainland more than 10 years ago, despite
tight regulations imposed by the Taiwan authorities.</P>
      <P>One of the most renowned examples of the tycoon's philanthropy in China was the
launch of his "Engineering of Hope" project under which some 10,000 elementary
schools were built across the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice President Vincent Siew also paid tribute to the the Formosa
Plastics Group's founder, saying he will never be forgotten by the people of
Taiwan because of his lifestyle and his contributions to the country.</P>
      <P>Siew, who once served as minister of economic affairs and head of the Council
for Economic Planning and Development, said he had maintained a friendship of
more than 30 years with Wang Yung-ching and could be the one official who knows
best how instrumental Wang was to the successful take-off of Taiwan's economy in
the 1960s.</P>
      <P>"Wang Yung-ching's establishment of the Sixth Naphtha Cracking Plant helped lay
a solid foundation for Taiwan's petrochemical industry, which in turn fueled the
development of the plastics manufacturing industry and many other related
industries, " Siew related.</P>
      <P>Siew added that long before the late Wang spent a fortune to build  schools  in
China,  he had established  many colleges, universities and vocational schools
around Taiwan to provide free career education to youths from disadvantaged and
aboriginal families to enable them to pull their own weight after they
graduated.</P>
      <P>"Wang Yung-ching even directed the Formosa Plastics Group to build housing units
in Guatemala -- a country with which his group had no business relations -- to
help house the poor and the homeless there," Siew added.</P>
      <P>Wang Yung-ching, born in the era of subsistence when Taiwan was under Japanese
colonial rule, came from humble beginnings that saw him working at the age of 15
as a rice shop apprentice in the southern city of Chiayi. Although he did not
always earn money, he was a hard-working youth, carrying the rice sacks on his
back to deliver them to the homes of the shop customers. Whenever he had spare
time, he visited the customers to check whether their rice bins were running low
or were empty.</P>
      <P>The "God of Business" grew from that rice shop apprentice who worked hard and
became a shrewd businessman by the time he reached his early 20s.</P>
      <P>One of the major business conglomerates in Taiwan, the Formosa Plastics Group is
the most efficient corporate group in the country in terms of profit-making,
with its business turnovers topping NT$1.97 trillion (US$60.7 billion) in 2007
and countable assets valued at more than NT$2.46 trillion.</P>
      <P>Wang Yung-ching's daughter Wang Juei-hua said that her father often said to his
children that "what your hands can hold is limited, but once you open your
hands, the whole world is yours."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A new alliance of women's groups in Taiwan was formed on Thursday with the
primary goal of writing a report to the United Nations about the status of
women's rights in the country.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  Committee  on the Elimination  of all forms  of Discrimination Against
Women, or CEDAW, aims to complete the report by the year 2010, members told
reporters Thursday.</P>
      <P>Jih Huey-rong, one of the officials on the Committee, said that in the past two
decades, 185 nations have joined the U.N.'s CEDAW. However, due to political
reasons, Taiwan has not been able to join this organization.</P>
      <P>China, which considers Taiwan one of its provinces, strongly opposes Taiwan
joining any international organization reserved for nations, including the U.N.
and U.N. groups, such as the World Health Organization. In 2007, Taiwan's
application to formally enter the committee was rejected by the U.N. Secretary
General.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan is not a member of the U.N. or the U.N.'s CEDAW, its report will be
sent via non-governmental organizations to the U.N. in hopes that Taiwan may
eventually be allowed to join the U.N. Committee.</P>
      <P>Jih, who is the chairperson of one of the groups on Taiwan's Committee, said on
Thursday that Taiwan's report on Taiwanese women's rights will look at issues
including sexual discrimination in work places, as well as violence against
women.</P>
      <P>A total of eleven woman's groups in Taiwan have joined the local committee. They
include: the Garden of Hope Foundation, Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation, End
Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism (ECPAT) ,  Modern Women's Foundation,  Young
Women's Christian Association, Taiwan Coalition Against Violence, Zonta
International District 31, Hope Workers' Center, National Union of Taiwan
Women's Association (NATWA) , College of Humanities and Social Science of
Soochow University and the Rerum Novarum Center.</P>
      <P>The U.N.'s Committee is an expert body established in 1982 and composed of 23
experts on women's issues from around the world. The Committee's mandate is to
watch over the progress of women's rights around the world.</P>

      <P>The Child Welfare League Foundation is urging people to enthusiastically adopt
abandoned children and take care of them, a foundation spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman made the remarks during a news conference at the Children's
Recreation Center in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Some parents abandon their children  because  of financial problems, some
because the children are suffering from serious diseases, and others because
they are in prison and cannot look after their children, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Recent government statistics show that the number of local families willing to
adopt children has dwindled over the past few years, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The country's sluggish economy is one of the main reasons behind the drop in the
number of families willing to adopt children, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>To make matters worse, some families that have adopted children plan to give up
the children because of financial woes, he said.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also called on the general public to donate money to help fund the
foundation's child adoption program.</P>
      <P>"Philanthropic ambassador" Patty Tsai, wife of EasyCard Corp. Chairman Sean
Lien, during the press conference urged the public to do more to help abandoned
children by donating more funds to the child adoption program.</P>
      <P>Lien is the son of ruling Kuomintang Honorary Chairman Lien Chan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Time for Taiwan to strengthen relations with ASEAN: VP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
10/16/08  19:34:44
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew declared Thursday that now is the right time for
Taiwan to strengthen relations with countries in the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations  (ASEAN)  as  the  group  of countries  is undergoing
transformations and is improving cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Why now?  Because  with the improvement  of Taiwan-China relations, obstructions
in the exchanges between Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries are decreasing,
Siew said, adding that the strong presence of Taiwanese businesses in the region
can help Taiwan strengthen ties with ASEAN countries.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFAs) working meeting for the Southeast Asian region and the first
coordination meeting of the ministry's newly formed task force on relations with
ASEAN.</P>
      <P>The meeting was carried out under the instruction of President Ma Ying-jeou to
have Taiwan actively participate in the integration of the Asia Pacific region
and ASEAN. It is the first such meeting after the MOFA established the ASEAN
task force -- a strategic inter-agency group aimed at strengthening relations
with the region and preventing Taiwan from being marginalized.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries are closely related in economy
given the substantial volumes of trade and investment between the two sides, as
well as exchanges in foreign labors, education, culture and tourism, Siew said
Taiwan has great leverage in strengthening ties with ASEAN countries.</P>
      <P>These  all serve as very good bargaining  chips in the interaction with
Southeast Asia,the vice president said.</P>
      <P>Siew contended that -- as the ASEAN will become a single market next year after
the ASEAN Charter goes into effect -- the government should seize the
opportunity in the expansion of ASEAN Plus One, ASEAN Plus Three or ASEAN Plus
Six, and start drawing on collective wisdom and absorb all useful ideas to let
the Republic of China become a partner of the ASEAN countries.</P>
      <P>I know this is not an easy task but if we can do so, I believe we will play a
more constructive role in this region given Taiwans participation and
contribution in the economies of ASEAN countries over the years,Siew said.</P>
      <P>Established in Thailand in 1967, ASEAN is made up of 10 member countries --
Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Its objectives, apart from promoting regional
peace, include the acceleration of economic growth, social progress and cultural
development among its members.</P>

      <P>The National Palace Museum will hold a special exhibition from Oct. 24 to Jan.
4, 2009 to herald the establishment of the museum's southern Taiwan branch in
Chiayi County, scheduled for completion in 2011.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, titled "Exploring Asia: Episode One of the National Palace
Museum's Southern Branch," will take place at the Chiayi Performing Arts Center.
It will display 117 items featuring six themes -- Buddhist sculptures, Asian
scriptures, fabrics and textiles in Asia, blue and white porcelains from Asia,
Asian tea cultures and traditions, and Western trends in Asian culture.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is intended to help visitors understand the patterns of cultural
transmission, dissemination and evolution in Asia.</P>
      <P>Fung Ming-chu, deputy director of the museum, and Chiayi County Magistrate Chen
Ming-wen opened the boxes containing the exhibits at a press conference Thursday
and allowed media workers to see some of the highly treasured items.</P>
      <P>The most conspicuous among the items was the Dragon Sutra manuscript, which was
completed in A.D. 1669 under the reign of Qing Dynasty Emperor Kangxi.</P>
      <P>The sutra was written in gilt standard Tibetan script on both sides of celadon
blue stationery, with each page measuring 87.5 cm. by 33 cm. The manuscript has
108 sets in all, comprising 100,000 pages. The sutra contains the Kangyur -- the
Tibetan translation of the teachings of Sakyamuni Buddha.</P>
      <P>The text of the sutra is accompanied by more than 700 colorful images of
Buddhas, bodhisattvas, dharmapalas, patriarchs and arhats.</P>
      <P>Fung said that an ornamental Koran will be on display in the same room as the
Dragon Sutra manuscript.</P>
      <P>"Each of the exhibits is a treasured masterpiece," she said, pointing to a 15th
century blue and white vase from Vietnam featuring a motif of phoenix with a
peony flower design.</P>
      <P>Other masterpieces on display will include Gandharan style stone-carved Buddha
statues, Indian embroideries, and Chinese tea sets, she added.</P>
      <P>According to Fung, the exhibition will be the first of a series of thematic
presentations by the museum in the lead-up to the launch of its southern Taiwan

      <P>President Ying-jeou endorsed Thursday a proposal to stimulate  consumer spending
and boost investment, promising that he will take the lead at the proper time to
achieve those goals.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's economic fundamentals remain healthy and I am very confident that the
country will weather the current financial storm," Ma said in response to the
proposal put forward by a group of trade association leaders during a meeting at
the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Ma urged the public to maintain cautious optimism despite the current economic
downturn in Taiwan and the rest of the world, arguing that Taiwan's enterprises
are still vigorous and competitive amid robust foreign competition.</P>
      <P>Citing a recent USA Business Week report on the world's top 100 information
technology companies, Ma said that Taiwan had the second highest number of
companies on the list, after the United States. Eighteen Taiwanese companies
were listed, he said.</P>
      <P>In light of the global credit squeeze and economic crisis, the government has
also adopted a series of countermeasures, including lowering the gift and
inheritance tax rate from 50 percent to 10 percent and reducing several other
taxation rates and the stock transaction rate, to help re-build public
confidence and reinvigorate Taiwan's economy, the president said.</P>
      <P>He pledged that the government will do its best to increase investment in public
construction projects to offset the negative growth over the past eight years
and help boost local demand.</P>
      <P>If the Legislative Yuan approves the budget for the government's 12 mega-project
program by the end of this year, this would mean that more capital would be
injected into the economy starting January next year, he added.</P>

      <P>More than half of Taiwan's workplaces have enforced a non-smoking policy, in
keeping with government regulations that will take effect next year, the results
of a recent survey indicated.</P>
      <P>Some 55.8 percent of Taiwan's corporations have declared their premises smoke-
free, according to a survey released by the Bureau of Health Promotion (BHP)
under the Cabinet-level Department of Health.</P>
      <P>Another 17.7 percent have designated indoor smoking areas, while 25.5 percent
maintain no restrictions on smoking, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 63.6 percent of the respondents were aware of the
government's new initiative, with 17 percent of that number knowing the exact
implementation date.</P>
      <P>The government adopted a package of amendments to the Tobacco Hazards Prevention
and Control Act on July 11 to impose stricter anti-smoking regulations starting
Jan.11 next year.</P>
      <P>The regulation prohibits smoking in indoor workplaces that are occupied by more
than three people, as well as in all public areas within a workplace, such as
stairwells and hallways, which are often used as "smoking zones."</P>
      <P>Workplaces caught breaking the rule will be fined between NT$10,000 and
NT$50,000, and individual violators will be subject to fines of NT$2,000 to
NT$10,000.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the survey showed that since 2003 when a smoke-free project was
launched, the rate of smoking at worksites in Taiwan has dropped from 24.2
percent to 20 percent this year. Alongside that drop, the rate of people
quitting smoking has risen from 5.8 percent in 2003 to 11 percent this year,
according to the poll.</P>
      <P>The figures demonstrate a higher level of public awareness of the dangers of
smoking and breathing second-hand smoke, and greater sensitivity to the issue,
the survey indicated.</P>
      <P>The highest rate of smoking was recorded among construction workers and those in
the transportation and storage industry, at 39.5 percent and 34 percent,
respectively.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A rice production plant in southern Taiwan's Tainan County is trying to promote
a farming technique that replaces pesticides with ducks, plant owner Huang Li-
chin said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang said the method of cultivation allows rice fields to be playgrounds for
ducks, which eat insects and apple snails that harm rice crops and whose
excrement can be used as organic fertilizer.</P>
      <P>But since Fangjung Rice Plant launched the program to use ducks in rice farming
in 2006, only six farmers have participated in it, with the total farmland using
this method reaching only three hectares, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Hoping that more farmers and consumers will support this unique organic farming
technique, Huang said she is trying to get produce generated under the program
certified as organic produce. She said she is confident this can be achieved
within one year.</P>
      <P>Huang explained that three years is the minimum time it takes for a farm's
produce to pass organic examinations.</P>
      <P>Contract farmers have to abide by certain regulations. They have to grow the
strain selected by the rice production plant and cannot use any pesticides or
chemical fertilizers, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Persuading farmers to switch from the pursuit of production volume to quality is
the most difficult part of promoting the farming technique, even though farmers
know that it is a good technique passed down by their ancestors, Huang said.</P>
      <P>She is the fourth-generation owner of the plant that was founded in 1926.</P>
      <P>The six contract farmers currently using this method raise ducks beside their
rice farms. Three farmers who cultivate a 1.68-hectare plot of land together
have had to raise about 500 ducks to help them with their organic efforts, Huang
said.</P>
      <P>"We experimented with creatures like frogs and chicken in carrying out the
mission, but found that ducks are the most effective, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>All produce grown on farmland using this special technique have passed pesticide
tests, she emphasized.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that while ducks eat rice too when there are not many bugs around,
they are still beneficial to farmland. She added that having ducks in rice
fields is also a good way to attract tourists to the area.</P>

      <P>Scientists at three universities in Taiwan have developed a new non-invasive
diagnostic tool which combines the functions  of virtual  biopsy and molecular
imaging  and can significantly  improve  clinical  diagnosis  of skin  diseases,
researchers said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Experiments conducted on laboratory animals using the new tool have been
successfully completed and the results show that the tool can effectively detect
indications of oral cancer on hamsters, team members said.</P>
      <P>They added that they are looking forward to conducting human testing.</P>
      <P>The team --  led by Shieh Dar-bin of National Cheng-Kung University, Sun Chi-
kuang of National Taiwan University, and Lin Kuan-jiuh of National Chung-Hsing
University -- has already presented its findings in several scientific papers in
the journals Optics Express and Advanced Materials.</P>
      <P>Shieh, who is also an oral surgeon, said that in his past experience, it is very
difficult to determine whether a patient has developed oral cancer because it is
neither easy to spot the cancer nidus nor to carry out biopsy inside the mouth.</P>
      <P>But with the help of the tool -- dubbed "backward-propagating, multi-harmonic
optical tomography," Shieh said, the surgeons can more easily determine the
location of the cancer nidus without any invasive measures.</P>
      <P>Shieh noted that since the experiments on animals have shown some promising
signs, they hope medical equipment manufacturers will become interested in
funding the project to refine the system and to produce the prototypes for
commercial use.</P>
      <P>Once the prototypes are made, Shieh indicated, the team can apply for permission
to carry out human testing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>International conference in Taipei discusses melamine issue</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) convened a conference Thursday at which
international experts discussed policy and control measures for the prevention
of melamine contamination of food and shared their experience in this area with
local health authorities and food safety personnel.</P>
      <P>Experts from Australia, New Zealand, France and Belgium are attending the two-
day forum, while a web conference is expected to be held with the United States
Food and Drug Administration.</P>
      <P>DOH Deputy Minister Sung Yen-jen said at the opening of the conference that his
agency expects to learn from the experiences of other countries in containing
melamine contamination.</P>
      <P>He said that he and DOH Minister Yeh Ching-chuan will however not attend the
conference to avoid political interference.</P>
      <P>At the conference, Slava Zeman, manager of the export food policy section of the
Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, said that Australia has a
comprehensive food safety system with robust controls in the whole chain,
including measures to prevent fraud.</P>
      <P>She noted that the most effective measures of controlling melamine and other
types of contamination of food are based on the food safety systems in the
producing or exporting countries.</P>
      <P>"Regulatory actions should target levels of concern, not the absence of
melamine," she stressed.</P>
      <P>According to another participant, the problem has to be tackled before it
reaches the consumer.</P>
      <P>If the authorities cannot avoid some isolated cases of fraud, they have to try
to detect the problem upstream and solve it before it causes harm to people,
said Emmanuel Foex, who works at the French Embassy in Beijing, China.</P>
      <P>The question of acceptable levels of melamine in food was also raised by the
Taiwan participants who asked why most countries had set the safety standard at
2.5 ppm without knowing the exact level of contamination from sources such as
the manufacturing process and packaging.</P>
      <P>In response, Emmanuelle Moons, an expert from Federal Agency For the Safety of
the Food Chain in Belgium, said that in Europe, the standard of 2.5 ppm was set
because it was considered a reasonable level to distinguish adulteration from
background contamination, and that the European Union took into consideration
the standards in other countries.</P>
      <P>Discussing Taiwan's experience, Chen Shu-kong, director-general of the Bureau of
Food and Drug Analysis under the DOH, said that only some brands of milk powder
imported to Taiwan were tainted with the toxic chemical and that the source of
the contamination was possibly the manufacturing process and packaging
materials.</P>
      <P>However, Kuo Hsu-sung, director of Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control,
presented the case study of Taiwan's leading food company which used a toxic non
dairy-creamer, imported from the Shandong Duqing company in China, as an
ingredient in its pre-mixed beverages.</P>
      <P>The chemical melamine is added to milk by some Chinese dairy farmers and milk
producers to produce a falsely high test result for protein content.</P>
      <P>In China, melamine contamination is believed to have caused at least four deaths
and sickened thousands of children who drank tainted infant formula.</P>
      <P>The problem has spread to other countries that import food products from China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'God of Management' helped change Taiwan's medical map</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's "God of Management, " whose enterprises  stretched from plastics,
petrochemicals  and high technology to automobiles, gas stations and biomedical
technology, was also instrumental in reshaping the country's medical map.</P>
      <P>Wang Yung-ching, founder of the Formosa Plastics Group -- the most financially
successful business group in Taiwan -- and a rags-to-riches model, died in New
York Thursday at the age of 92. Wang founded the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in
Taipei City in 1976 with the aim of providing care for Taiwan's middle-class and
less-privileged citizens, who had no access to cheap but good medical attention
prior to the 1970s.</P>
      <P>The Chang Gung Memorial Hospital was Taiwan's first general hospital for the
ordinary people and the first teaching hospital at which doctors did not accept
"red envelops" from the relatives of their patients.</P>
      <P>In establishing Chang Gung hospital, Wang spared no funds -- earned from his
business operations -- to hire top-notch medical professionals and management
personnel from home and abroad.</P>
      <P>At the same time, he also established a medical university and a nursing college
to train medical professionals.</P>
      <P>In less than 30 years, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital -- which now has branches in
Linko, Taipei County, Keelung City, Kaohsiung County and Xiamen in China -- has
become the largest hospital in Taiwan in terms of the number of beds and
doctors, and is considered the best medical institution in Taiwan in terms of
business management.</P>
      <P>Inspired by Chang Gung's successful business management model, other privately
run and owned hospitals have been established around Taiwan over the past 10
years, a development that has reshaped Taiwan's medical map. In the 1970s the
ratio of public to private hospitals was 8:2, but that figure has since been
reversed and is now 2:8.</P>
      <P>As the biggest hospital chain in Taiwan, Chang Gung hospitals now have the
largest number of National Health Insurance Program (NHIP) holders, commanding
8-9 percent of NHIP expenditure, which averages around NT$450 billion (US$13.88
billion) a year.</P>
      <P>The Chang Gung business model has inspired National Taiwan University Hospital
(NTUH) -- Taiwan's top public teaching hospital -- to change its style of
management.</P>
      <P>Emulating Chang Gung, NTUH began several years ago to expand its operations and
now has many branches scattered around the country.</P>
      <P>In his bid to make Chang Gung a first-class medical institution, Wang Yung-ching
was instrumental in installing the most advanced equipment and facilities in the
hospitals. The facilities included an operating theater and ward exclusively for
patients with congenital heart disease; an operating theater and ward
exclusively for children with craniofacial defects; and a clinic for the implant
of electronic ears for children with acoustic nerve defects.</P>
      <P>Wang, who was a victim of streptococcus pneumoniae, donated NT$500 million
earlier this year to allow citizens over the age of 75 to receive free
streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, Chang Gung invested billions of New Taiwan dollars in the
construction of Taiwan's first cyclotron for proton beam radiation  therapy  for
cancer  treatment.  The expensive cutting-edge facility -- which exists only in
Japan and the United States -- is expected to be installed in a Chang Gung
hospital by 2011.</P>

      <P>The Taiwanese subproject of a phase II clinical test for a cancer drug ADI-PEG
20 has been successfully completed and the drug should be on the market some
time next year following the phase III clinical testing, researchers at the
National Health Research Institute said Thursday.</P>
      <P>ADI-PEG 20 was first developed by the U.S.-based  Polaris Pharmaceuticals
several years ago. A subsidiary of the Taiwan-based Hsin Tung Yang group later
acquired exclusive distribution rights for the drug in Taiwan and China. The
group also invested in Polaris to gain the right to conduct clinical testing in
Taiwan, which will shorten the required time for review of a new drug in the
country.</P>
      <P>Financed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and commissioned by the
pharmaceutical companies, the phase II clinical tests were started late last
year by the National Health Research Institute, researchers said.</P>
      <P>According to researchers, ADI-PEG 20 is a protein drug that can break down the
arginine in human blood to inhibit the development of cancer cells.</P>
      <P>Arginine, an alpha-amino acid, plays a vital role in cell division, wound
healing, ammonia removal, immune functions, and the release of hormones.</P>
      <P>Once the arginine in blood is removed, cancer cells will lose their most
important source of nutrition, which then leads to their death, the researchers
said. Normal cells will survive the condition of arginine deprivation because
they can synthesize arginine within themselves, the scientists added.</P>

      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian filed a slander lawsuit Thursday against a
political pundit who claimed in a television program earlier this week that Chen
has a stash of money in Japan amounting to NT$30 billion (US$920.78 million).</P>
      <P>Chen's office said in a news release that he is suing Yao Li-ming, associate
professor at the Department of Administrative Management of Chinese Culture
University, for "aggravated defamation" because of Yao's allegation on ETtoday's
satellite cable TV news channel Oct. 13 that Chen has deposited NT$30 billion in
cash in Japan.</P>
      <P>"As a university professor, Yao should have been more careful with his words and
about his behavior," Chen's office said. It dismissed Yao's allegation as
"completely groundless."</P>
      <P>The "untruthful allegation" was subsequently quoted by other TV commentators and
newspaper reporters, causing serious damage to the former president's
reputation, the office stated.</P>
      <P>Asked about his reaction to the lawsuit, Yao said he has a witness to back up
his claim, which he insisted was not unfounded, because the information was
obtained via an "official" channel in Japan.</P>
      <P>Yao added that the lawsuit will provide an opportunity for him to expose in
court everything he knows about the matter.</P>
      <P>Chen and his family are being investigated on suspicion of embezzlement, bribery

      <P>China's top tourism official has promised to help pave the way for more Chinese
citizens to travel to Taiwan for sightseeing, a visiting Taiwan official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Janice Lai, director-general of the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, made the remarks on the sidelines of a
presentation in Nanjing on Taiwan's tourist attractions and resources.</P>
      <P>Lai is heading a 150-member delegation on a tourism promotion visit to China,
which already took her to Beijing.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, Shao Qiwei, director of China's National Tourism
Administration, told a Beijing workshop hosted by the Taiwanese delegation
Tuesday that Chinese authorities are studying measures to allow or encourage
more Chinese citizens to visit Taiwan for sightseeing purposes.</P>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait signed two landmark agreements in mid-June on
the opening of direct cross-strait weekend charter flights and further opening
of Taiwan to more Chinese tourists with effect from July 4.</P>
      <P>Under the agreements, Taiwan allows the entry of up to 3,000 Chinese tourists
per day, but the number of actual arrivals has so far fallen far short of
expectations.</P>
      <P>Lai said Taiwan is looking forward to doubling the monthly Chinese tourist
arrivals to 20,000 by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, expansions of the direct flight services will be high on
agenda of a new round of cross-strait talks scheduled for late this month or
early November.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, Lai paid a call on Zhou Naixiang, director of Jiansu Province's
tourism bureau, to exchange views on the promotion of bilateral tourist and
cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>More than 100 Chinese travel agents in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province, and
its surrounding areas, attended the Taiwan tourism presentation to get first-
hand information about resources and the latest developments in Taiwan's tourism
industry.</P>
      <P>A similar event in Beijing was also very successful, attracting more than 400
travel service executives or tour operators, Lai said, adding that the Taiwanese
delegation has been offering various tour packages, including short-stay ones
that could be attractive to Chinese salaried workers looking for a quick
getaway.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has given permission for the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC)
to set up an office in Taipei, which will be the special administrative region's
first official organization in Taiwan, HKTDC spokesman William Cheung told the
CNA Thursday.</P>
      <P>The council applied to the relevant authorities in Taiwan earlier this year to
establish an office in Taipei, and the approval was received Thursday, Cheung
said, adding that the HKTDC welcomed the decision.</P>
      <P>The council was established  in 1966 as the international marketing arm of Hong
Kong and now has 40 offices around the world, according to Cheung.</P>
      <P>The council has rented an office in Taipei, and will send one staff member from
Hong Kong, while other personnel will be recruited in Taiwan, Cheung said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei office is being established to enhance bilateral trade relations and
promote Hong Kong's services industry, with financial services, logistics, and
real estate being the focus, Cheung said. The Taipei office will also help to
boost cooperation between the two sides in technology development and the
entertainment industry, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is Hong Kong's fourth largest trade partner in terms of volume, with the
bilateral trade volume standing at US$33.25 billion for last year, Cheung said,
citing HKTDC statistics.</P>
      <P>The bilateral trade volume for the period January to August this year was US$22
billion, up by 2.4 percent from the year-earlier level, he noted. The breakdown
is US$17 billion from Taiwan's export volume to Hong Kong and US$5 billion from
Hong Kong export volume to Taiwan, Cheung said.</P>
      <P>He forecast that the Taiwan market will offer more business opportunities for
Hong Kong with the continued improvement of relations between Taiwan and China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The safety standard for melamine levels in food was one of the key issues at an
international conference held Thursday in Taipei, with most foreign experts
agreeing that 2.5 ppm of melamine would be an appropriate safety level.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's Department of Health (DOH) stipulates that foods containing
dairy ingredients, creamers and vegetable-based proteins are allowed on the
market only if they test negative for the toxic chemical using the sensitive LC-
MS/MS technique.</P>
      <P>LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography/tandem mass, is a technique with a detection
limit for melamine of 0.05 ppm, according to the DOH.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration uses LC-MS/MS methods that are capable of
determining melamine at levels of 0.25 ppm (parts per million) in powdered
infant formula, for which there is a stricter standard, and other dairy-
containing food products or ingredients.</P>
      <P>We're not encouraging people to close the level down as low as they can
impossibly go," said an FDA expert, adding that there are no safety concerns
with 2.5 ppm of melamine in foods.</P>
      <P>Experts invited by the DOH to attend the conference said earlier that a maximum
level of 2.5 ppm of melamine in food is acceptable, but that background
contamination levels need to be determined.</P>
      <P>Bonnie Sun Pan, a professor at the Department of Food Science, National Taiwan
Ocean University, told reporters that the international experts did not discuss
whether Taiwan's safety standard for melamine was too strict.</P>
      <P>But Sung Yen-jen, DOH deputy minister, said earlier that his agency had no
immediate plans to change the standard.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's safety standard for melamine levels in food caused controversy in late
September when then-DOH Minister Lin Fang-yue raised it to 2.5 ppm amid a food
scare over contaminated milk products imported from China. Lin later resigned,
mainly because of the public outcry over his decision.</P>
      <P>The current DOH minister, Yeh Ching-chuan, immediately after taking office,
decided that food products containing dairy and non- dairy ingredients must test
negative for melamine using the LC-MS/MS technique if they are to be allowed on
the market.</P>

      <P>She noted that the most effective measures of controlling melamine and other
types of contamination of food are based on the food safety systems in the
producing or exporting countries.</P>
      <P>"Regulatory actions should target levels of concern, not the absence of
melamine," she stressed.</P>
      <P>According to another participant, the problem has to be tackled before it
reaches the consumer.</P>
      <P>If the authorities cannot avoid some isolated cases of fraud, they have to try
to detect the problem upstream and solve it before it causes harm to people,
said Emmanuel Foex, who works at the French Embassy in Beijing, China.</P>
      <P>The question of acceptable levels of melamine in food was also raised by the
Taiwan participants who asked why most countries had set the safety standard at
2.5 ppm without knowing the exact level of contamination from sources such as
the manufacturing process and packaging.</P>
      <P>In response, Emmanuelle Moons, an expert from Federal Agency For the Safety of
the Food Chain in Belgium, said that in Europe, the standard of 2.5 ppm was set
because it was considered a reasonable level to distinguish adulteration from
background contamination, and that the European Union took into consideration
the standards in other countries.</P>
      <P>Discussing Taiwan's experience, Chen Shu-kong, director-general of the Bureau of
Food and Drug Analysis under the DOH, said that only some brands of milk powder
imported to Taiwan were tainted with the toxic chemical and that the source of
the contamination was possibly the manufacturing process and packaging
materials.</P>
      <P>However, Kuo Hsu-sung, director of Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control,
presented the case study of Taiwan's leading food company which used a toxic non
dairy-creamer, imported from the Shandong Duqing company in China, as an
ingredient in its pre-mixed beverages.</P>
      <P>The chemical melamine is added to milk by some Chinese dairy farmers and milk
producers to produce a falsely high test result for protein content.</P>
      <P>In China, melamine contamination is believed to have caused at least four deaths
and sickened thousands of children who drank tainted infant formula.</P>
      <P>The problem has spread to other countries that import food products from China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan completes phase II clinical testing of new cancer drug</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwanese subproject of a phase II clinical test for a cancer drug ADI-PEG
20 has been successfully completed and the drug should be on the market some
time next year following the phase III clinical testing, researchers at the
National Health Research Institute said Thursday.</P>
      <P>ADI-PEG 20 was first developed by the U.S.-based  Polaris Pharmaceuticals
several years ago. A subsidiary of the Taiwan-based Hsin Tung Yang group later
acquired exclusive distribution rights for the drug in Taiwan and China. The
group also invested in Polaris to gain the right to conduct clinical testing in
Taiwan, which will shorten the required time for review of a new drug in the
country.</P>
      <P>Financed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and commissioned by the
pharmaceutical companies, the phase II clinical tests were started late last
year by the National Health Research Institute, researchers said.</P>
      <P>According to researchers, ADI-PEG 20 is a protein drug that can break down the
arginine in human blood to inhibit the development of cancer cells.</P>
      <P>Arginine, an alpha-amino acid, plays a vital role in cell division, wound
healing, ammonia removal, immune functions, and the release of hormones.</P>
      <P>Once the arginine in blood is removed, cancer cells will lose their most
important source of nutrition, which then leads to their death, the researchers
said. Normal cells will survive the condition of arginine deprivation because
they can synthesize arginine within themselves, the scientists added.</P>

      <P>China's top tourism official has promised to help pave the way for more Chinese
citizens to travel to Taiwan for sightseeing, a visiting Taiwan official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Janice Lai, director-general of the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, made the remarks on the sidelines of a
presentation in Nanjing on Taiwan's tourist attractions and resources.</P>
      <P>Lai is heading a 150-member delegation on a tourism promotion visit to China,
which already took her to Beijing.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, Shao Qiwei, director of China's National Tourism
Administration, told a Beijing workshop hosted by the Taiwanese delegation
Tuesday that Chinese authorities are studying measures to allow or encourage
more Chinese citizens to visit Taiwan for sightseeing purposes.</P>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait signed two landmark agreements in mid-June on
the opening of direct cross-strait weekend charter flights and further opening
of Taiwan to more Chinese tourists with effect from July 4.</P>
      <P>Under the agreements, Taiwan allows the entry of up to 3,000 Chinese tourists
per day, but the number of actual arrivals has so far fallen far short of
expectations.</P>
      <P>Lai said Taiwan is looking forward to doubling the monthly Chinese tourist
arrivals to 20,000 by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, expansions of the direct flight services will be high on
agenda of a new round of cross-strait talks scheduled for late this month or
early November.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, Lai paid a call on Zhou Naixiang, director of Jiansu Province's
tourism bureau, to exchange views on the promotion of bilateral tourist and
cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>More than 100 Chinese travel agents in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province, and
its surrounding areas, attended the Taiwan tourism presentation to get first-
hand information about resources and the latest developments in Taiwan's tourism
industry.</P>
      <P>A similar event in Beijing was also very successful, attracting more than 400
travel service executives or tour operators, Lai said, adding that the Taiwanese
delegation has been offering various tour packages, including short-stay ones
that could be attractive to Chinese salaried workers looking for a quick
getaway.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has given permission for the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC)
to set up an office in Taipei, which will be the special administrative region's
first official organization in Taiwan, HKTDC spokesman William Cheung told the
CNA Thursday.</P>
      <P>The council applied to the relevant authorities in Taiwan earlier this year to
establish an office in Taipei, and the approval was received Thursday, Cheung
said, adding that the HKTDC welcomed the decision.</P>
      <P>The council was established  in 1966 as the international marketing arm of Hong
Kong and now has 40 offices around the world, according to Cheung.</P>
      <P>The council has rented an office in Taipei, and will send one staff member from
Hong Kong, while other personnel will be recruited in Taiwan, Cheung said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei office is being established to enhance bilateral trade relations and
promote Hong Kong's services industry, with financial services, logistics, and
real estate being the focus, Cheung said. The Taipei office will also help to
boost cooperation between the two sides in technology development and the
entertainment industry, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is Hong Kong's fourth largest trade partner in terms of volume, with the
bilateral trade volume standing at US$33.25 billion for last year, Cheung said,
citing HKTDC statistics.</P>
      <P>The bilateral trade volume for the period January to August this year was US$22
billion, up by 2.4 percent from the year-earlier level, he noted. The breakdown
is US$17 billion from Taiwan's export volume to Hong Kong and US$5 billion from
Hong Kong export volume to Taiwan, Cheung said.</P>
      <P>He forecast that the Taiwan market will offer more business opportunities for
Hong Kong with the continued improvement of relations between Taiwan and China.</P>

      <P>Automobiles on roads in Taiwan may soon be allowed to make right turns on red
lights, the National Police Agency (NPA) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Currently, right turns are only permitted on red lights when there is a right

      <P>The NPA said this will change if the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications passes the new regulation allowing right turns at all
intersections unless stated otherwise by a traffic sign.</P>
      <P>Under the new regulation, motorists will be required to come to a complete stop
and check that the way is clear before making a right turn on a red light, the
NPA said.</P>
      <P>The regulation has been introduced as a petrol saving and pollution  emission
cutting measure by reducing the number of automobiles idling at intersections,
the NPA said.</P>
      <P>The NPA has notified  police departments  under all local governments  around
the country to assess the feasibility  of implementing the new regulation,
including examining safety issues.</P>
      <P>Right turns on red lights are legal in most states in the United States and most

    <HEADLINE>Government urged to hold public debate on CEPA with China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several non-government organizations urged the government Friday to hold public
discussions or even a referendum on the issue of whether to sign a "closer
economic partnership arrangement" (CEPA) with China, which they claimed will
have a serious impact on Taiwan's economy, society and sovereignty.</P>
      <P>They made the appeal at a seminar titled "The Impact on Taiwan of Signing a CEPA
with China" held by the Policy Committee of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Describing Hong Kong's economy after signing a CEPA with China as a "bubble
economy, " Taiwan Labor Front President Ngou Giok-siong said that the Taiwan
government should take Hong Kong's example as a warning, "as China is always the
biggest winner in the game."</P>
      <P>"The government should have public discussions on whether to sign such a major
agreement with China or even hold a referendum on the issue, " Ngou said. "If
the government just goes ahead without considering the consequences, Taiwan will
end up as another Hong Kong."</P>
      <P>His expressed concerns came after Jiang Zengwei, deputy minister of China's
Department of Commerce, said on Sept. 8 that in order to promote economic and
trade normalization between China and Taiwan, the two sides can sign a CEPA like
the one China has with Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong and China inked a CEPA in June 2003, helping to open up a huge market
for Hong Kong goods and services and effectively improving Hong Kong's economy.</P>
      <P>These NGOs also expressed concerns that a CEPA-like economic agreement will be
included on the agenda during the visit of China's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) Chairman Chen Yunlin slated for late October
or early November, despite Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan
saying Thursday that Taiwan definitely will not sign such an agreement with
China.</P>
      <P>"What China is doing is trying to secure political power through the support of
the business community and speed up reunification by economic means," said Chen
Po-chih, chairman of the pro-independence non-government Taiwan Thinktank.</P>
      <P>Chen argued that an economic agreement like a CEPA will not only compromise
Taiwan's economic strength but will also eventually jeopardize the country's
sovereignty because "when Taiwan becomes more and more dependent on China,
Beijing can use the economy as means of political coercion."</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Twu Shiing-jer said that from the public health and food safety
point of view, a CEPA will put the Taiwan people's health in great danger,
citing the recent melamine-tainted milk products scandal as example.</P>
      <P>He pointed out the differences between Taiwan and China in food standards,
quality of medical services and public health, as well as people's way of
thinking and doing businesses, saying that a CEPA "is not what Taiwan needs.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese are not Chinese; Taiwan does not belong to China; and Taiwan is
better than China," Twu said.</P>

      <P>Staff of the Chinese company which had supplied non-dairy creamer to Taiwan's
beverage maker King Car have confirmed after visiting King Car's warehouse that
the supplies were from the company, Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yeh
Ching-chuan said Friday.</P>
      <P>After visiting King Car's production facility and warehouse in Taoyuan County in
northern Taiwan Thursday, three staff members from Duqing Co. in Heze City,
Shandong Province confirmed that the non-dairy creamer was supplied by their
company, Yeh said at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The Duqing men also admitted that none of the creamer supplied by Duqing and
stored in King Car's warehouse had been adulterated intentionally, according to
Yeh.</P>
      <P>Duqing contracted an international firm to choose randomly four samples of the
creamer bought by King Car for melamine tests Thursday.</P>
      <P>Two samples, examined by King Car and DOH National Laboratories of Foods and
Drugs, respectively, were found to be tainted with melamine. Two other samples
were sent back to China for tests to be conducted  respectively  by Duqing  and
an international  firm commissioned by the company, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The health minister  told legislators  that Duqing is now conducting its own
melamine tests in China.</P>
      <P>"If Duqing is to blame for King Car's losses due to the melamine contamination,
then Duqing will apologize and the government will help King Car file a claim
for compensation," Yeh stressed.</P>
      <P>The King Car Group reported on Sept. 21 that eight of its products, made with a
non-dairy creamer from China, contained melamine, and the company blamed the
presence of the toxic chemical on ingredients imported from China.</P>
      <P>However, Li Weiyi, spokesman of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said on Sept. 24
that Chinese laboratories did not find any traces of the chemical in the
Shandong-based company's products.@@</P>
      <P>Duqing manager  Li Hailing  echoed the Chinese  government spokesman's
statement, saying tests on products exported to Taiwan showed they were not
contaminated with melamine.</P>

      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) accepted Friday an offer by the
main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for the party to become a co-
organizer of a "safeguard Taiwan" rally scheduled for Oct. 25.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen extended the invitation in person during a visit to
TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei.</P>
      <P>At a news conference held after the meeting, Huang said the TSU will take an
active part in the event because the demonstration's theme is one of the party's
longstanding goals.</P>
      <P>On the DPP's invitation for the TSU's spiritual leader -- former President Lee
Teng-hui -- to take part in the demonstration, Huang said the 85-year-old Lee
seldom takes part in public rallies. However, Huang said he will help pass on
the message to Lee.</P>
      <P>The demonstration is being organized to protest the upcoming Taiwan visit by
Chen Yunlin, president of China's semi-official Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Taiwan in early November, Chen will hold talks with his
Taiwanese counterpart, Chiang Pin-kung of the Straits Exchange Foundation, to
discuss issues including the launch of cross-strait cargo charter flights and
direct shipping links and the establishment of more direct cross-strait air
routes.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP, the main objectives of the demonstration will be to reject
the "one China market, " a downgrading of Taiwan's sovereignty and an
incompetent government.</P>
      <P>The opposition has accused the Kuomintang administration led by President Ma
Ying-jeou of "tilting excessively toward China" and sacrificing  Taiwan's
sovereignty  in  adopting  a series  of liberalization measures toward China
since Ma's inauguration on May 20.</P>
      <P>These measures include launching nonstop cross-strait charter flights on
weekends, opening Taiwan up to more Chinese tourists, allowing cross-strait
currency trading, and raising the cap on China-bound investment by local
enterprises from 40 percent of their net worth to 60 percent.</P>
      <P>Other measures under planning include opening Taiwan to Chinese investment,
relaxing restrictions on China-bound investment by Taiwanese semiconductor
manufacturers,  and recognizing Chinese academic degrees.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), with its One-Chip AC
LED (alternating current light-emitting diode) technology, has been selected a
winner of the 2008 R&amp;D 100 Awards competition sponsored by the U.S.-based
R&amp;D Magazine.</P>
      <P>Receiving the honor on behalf of the ITRI at a gala awards banquet in Chicago
Thursday evening, Dr. Jon Hsu, deputy general director of ITRI's Electronics
&amp; Optoelectronics Research Laboratories, said that the technology innovation
was the result of efforts of an ITRI research unit over the past four years.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, Taiwan is the world leader in LED production in terms of
volume, while Japan is taking the lead in production value. The ITRI has
recognized the importance of technology innovation in order to develop LED
products of higher value.</P>
      <P>A LED is a semiconductor device that emits light under a direct current (DC)
power source of the right polarity and voltage. Currently, LEDs can only be
directly powered in an AC environment with AC-DC converter sub-assemblies.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that the ITRI research unit started the project to develop an AC LED
module four years ago and that after numerous experiments achieved a
breakthrough and developed much smaller and more energy efficient AC LED models.
Compared to DC LEDs, AC LEDs can reduce energy consumption by 15 percent to 30
percent.</P>
      <P>Recognizing the great commercial potential of the One-Chip AC LED, the ITRI has
applied for national as well as international patents, with 70 patents already
having been granted, according to Hsu.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that the institute has formed an alliance with 19 electronics and
optoelectronics manufacturers in Taiwan, including Epistar Corp., Lite-On
Technology Corp., Tyntek Corp. and Forward Electronics, to apply the technology
to the development of commercial products.</P>
      <P>With patent protection, ITRI is confident that Taiwan will remain a world leader
in One-Chip AC LED technology, with production value expected to reach NT$7.4
billion in two years, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The R&amp;D Magazine initiated the R&amp;D 100 Awards competition in 1963 by
selecting 100 research teams of technological products or processes expected to
enhance quality of life and efficiency.</P>
      <P>This year's winners include the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, National
Energy Technology Laboratory of the U.S., Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,

      <P>Taiwan's economic growth for 2009 is expected to register around 3 percent due
to the impact of the global economic downturn, Central Bank of the Republic of
China Governor Perng Fai-nan said Friday.</P>
      <P>Perng told the Legislative Yuan's Economics Committee that the forecast has been
made based on information collected from various international sources.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics forecast in August
that the country would post economic growth of 5.08 percent for 2009.</P>
      <P>On Monday, however, Council for Economic Planning and Development Chairman Chen
Tain-jy admitted that the projection will be "difficult to achieve" and
"probably unattainable."</P>
      <P>Chen said the Cabinet is expected in November to revise the forecast downward.</P>
      <P>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned last week that the world economy is
experiencing a major downturn in the face of "the most dangerous financial shock
in mature markets since the 1930s."</P>
      <P>The IMF's latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) has forecast that economic growth
in advanced countries will be close to zero until at least mid-2009, while
growth in emerging and developing countries will slow to substantially lower
rates than in the recent past.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, growth is likely to reach 3.8 percent in 2008 and drop to 2.5 percent
in 2009, according to the WEO.</P>

      <P>Police raided an amphetamine production facility in Pingtung County's Chaojhou
township Thursday night, arresting  two suspects  and seizing  nearly 55
kilograms  of semi-processed amphetamine and production equipment.</P>
      <P>Chaojhou township police said Friday that the semi-processed amphetamine has an
estimated street value of about NT$100 million (US$3.07 million).</P>
      <P>Arrested were a 26-year-old man surnamed Chou and a 20-year-old surnamed Wang,
both of whom are from the southern county of Pingtung, according to the Chaojhou
police department.</P>
      <P>After receiving  a tip,  police  staked out the suspected amphetamine production
facility in Chaojhou for 20 days before carrying out the raid Thursday night.</P>
      <P>Police said that the two men rented the place last year and began producing
amphetamines at the site about two months ago.</P>
      <P>The suspects told police that a man nicknamed "Black Wheel" left the
amphetamine-making equipment and ingredients to them after he died and that they
decided to start up the illicit operation because they were broke.</P>
      <P>Police said they were following up on the suspects' testimony and indicated that
initial investigations have not revealed any other accomplices in the illicit
operation.</P>
      <P>They said that the semi-processed amphetamine was less than a week from being
ready for sale on the street.</P>
      <P>The case will now be turned over to prosecutors to handle, police said.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese who sponsors a Mongolian child has bought a yurt to shelter her and
her family from severe weather in the landlocked country, the Taiwan Fund for
Children and Families said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wang Ming-jen, executive-director of the fund, said the donor, Chien Hsiu-chih,
who is the principal of Fongming Elementary School in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung,  began sponsoring  a sixth-grade girl named Erdenetuya in Mongolia
two years ago via the fund.</P>
      <P>Erdenetuya lived with her mother and younger brother in a rented yurt in Ulan
Bator. Her mother does odd-jobs on the street for a living, but had to stop
working for several months due to the wintry climate in Mongolia, where it
started to snow in September, leaving the family in a precarious position,
according to Wang.</P>
      <P>Chien and her family decided to buy a yurt for Erdenetuya's family after
observing from her photos that the rented dwelling was not strong enough to help
them cope with sandstorms and freezing winds of minus 30 degree Celsius during
the winter months.</P>
      <P>Chien spent NT$30,000 (US$920) buying the yurt and another NT$3,000 purchasing
mattresses for Erdenetuya and her brother, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The yurt that Chien bought was the first donated by a Taiwan national after the
fund built a dwelling village in Ulan Bator last year for disadvantaged
Mongolian children, according to Lin Li-wen, an executive of the fund involved
in sponsoring affairs in Mongolia.</P>
      <P>The village's 20 Mongolian yurts were all donated by Taiwan citizens, and each
yurt has the donor's name on it, Lin said, adding that the fund plans to expand
the village in the future to benefit more Mongolian children in need.</P>
      <P>Currently, a total of 2,844 Taiwanese are sponsoring 3,957 Mongolian children
via the fund, Lin noted.</P>

      <P>Taichung County's Public Health Bureau said Friday that samples from a recent
shipment of octopus balls from Shandong province in China were found to be free
of melamine.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) in recent days ordered the importer
to halt sales of the octopus balls -- a popular round dumpling -- as a
precautionary measure after trace amounts of melamine were discovered in similar
products tested in Japan.</P>
      <P>The DOH asked Kaohsiung County to check the octopus balls, which were imported
by a company registered in the county, but county officials found they had
already been sold to a distributor in Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, Kaohsiung County ordered the removal of octopus balls from local
supermarket shelves for melamine testing.</P>
      <P>Chu Nien-feng, director of Taichung County's health bureau, said Friday that
samples of the shipment in question were sent to the Bureau of Food and Drug
Analysis for testing and were found not to contain the toxic industrial chemical
used in plastics and fertilizers.</P>
      <P>He added that the shipment was safe for sale on the local market.</P>
      <P>The imported shipment came from a different supplier than those found to have
problems in Japan, which originated from Fujian province in southeastern China.</P>

      <P>The government has decided to set up an unemployment pre-warning system and
strengthen standard procedures to deal with labor-management disputes in
anticipation of heavy layoffs at local companies, which are being hurt by the
global economic downturn, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Those and other measures were agreed upon at an inter-agency meeting convened by
the Executive Yuan's Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Thursday to address issues
related to protecting workers' rights, the official said.</P>
      <P>The meeting, attended by representatives from the Ministry of Justice and
various central and local government agencies in charge of labor affairs, was
aimed at strengthening exchanges among those agencies, according to the CLA
official.</P>
      <P>Aside from setting up a pre-warning system and improving standard operating
procedures used to handle labor-management conflicts, the government also
decided to establish a single window to facilitate information exchange among
government agencies and set up a Web site to deal with labor-management
disputes.</P>
      <P>Those  at the meeting  also decided  to hold cross-agency coordination meetings
regularly to enable labor affairs officials to stay on top of changes in early
warning indicators of unemployment and help them effectively settle industrial
disputes, the labor council official said.</P>
      <P>CLA Minister Wang Ju-hsuan said that to ease public worries over potentially
heavy layoffs in the face of the global economic downturn, the government should
stand on the side of workers and give priority to protecting their working
rights, the council official said.</P>
      <P>Wang also advised employers facing operating difficulties to try and adjust
their management strategies to protect the interests of their employees before
they move to negotiate a layoff agreement with their staff.</P>

      <P>The 2010 Taipei International Gardening and Horticulture Exposition is expected
to attract exhibitors from 30 countries and some 6 million visitors, the Taipei
city government said Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is considered one of the world's major flower producers and exporters and
the expo, which will begin in the month of September in 2010, will be the first
time the island will be hosting a major international horticulture event.</P>
      <P>The expo, projected to feature 15 exhibition halls in four separate locations,
is expected to take place over a period of eight months.</P>
      <P>The exhibition space will include a Global Garden Area, where exhibitors from up
to 30 countries are expected to show off their flagship gardening and
horticultural products and technology, said Chen Hsiung-wen, director of the
city government's Department of Economic Development.</P>
      <P>The  organization  of  the  expo  is  authorized  by  the Hague-headquartered
International  Association  of Horticultural Producers,  a prestigious
international group in gardening and horticulture comprised of 33 members from
25 countries, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei city government is planning to grant NT$2.5 million (US$77,160) as
subsidy to each foreign country that organizes a group to take part in the expo,
he added.</P>
      <P>A soft opening is slated for Sept. 6, 2010, although the expo is officially
scheduled between Nov. 6, 2010 and April 25, 2011, Chen said.</P>
      <P>With an investment of NT$7.8 billion (US$240.74 million) , the expo will be held
at venues stretching from the Yuanshan Park, Fine Arts Park to the nearby
Xinsheng Park and the Dajia Riverside Park in Dazhi, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Championing a 3-R motto (reduce, reuse and recycle), all the 15 exhibition halls
will be powered by green energy, including solar and wind power,  and built with
environmentally  friendly building materials, Chen said.</P>
      <P>As the exhibition will be open daily from 9 a.m. till 10 p.m., there will be
"Blue Highway" boats sailing along the Dajia River for visitors to go from one
area of the expo to another and a "light sculpture" shows during the evening for
entertainment, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Admission will be NT$300 per ticket. Preferential tickets, including  group
tickets and nighttime tickets,  will also be available, Chen said, adding that
if visitors purchase a NT$2,500 open ticket, they can visit any hall of the expo
anytime throughout its eight-month duration.</P>

      <P>Although bidding for construction of the Taipei World Trade Center Nangang
Exhibition Hall is alleged to have involved corruption, there have been no
problems regarding the use of the premises, Huang Hsiao-kuan, the hall's
director said Friday.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the Taipei World Trade Center Nangang Exhibition Hall has hosted
six large-scale international exhibitions since opening on March 13 of this
year.</P>
      <P>Many of the participants in these exhibitions have expressed satisfaction with
the hall, he said.</P>
      <P>However, Huang pointed out that due to differences of opinion between the
construction company and the Construction and Planning Agency under the Ministry
of the Interior regarding the exhibition hall construction's completion date,
the builder may face fines.</P>
      <P>Huang also pointed out that although the bidding process for the construction
contract may have involved corruption, there have not been any major problems
with the exhibition hall itself, except for minor leakage in the pipelines.</P>
      <P>No major faults in terms of construction quality have been found whatsoever, he
added.</P>
      <P>The Nangang Exhibition Hall took more than 10 years to plan and construct. It
was built because the increasing number of large-scale international exhibitions
had overwhelmed the Taipei World Trade Center in the Xinyi District of Taipei
City.</P>
      <P>Former Minister of the Interior Yu Chen-shien was detained Wednesday on charges
connected to the case of alleged bribery in the bidding process.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecutor's office, Yu is suspected of leaking the names of
members of a committee that was responsible for screening the bids for the
costly construction of the hall.</P>
      <P>Yu allegedly made the name list available to the company that eventually won the
bid during his tenure as interior minister between 2002-2004, the office said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIT co-hosts conference on new nanotechnology dental implants</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) said Friday that its Commercial Section
will co-host a conference on dental implants at the Taiwan Medical University to
introduce Taiwanese dentists to new U.S. nanotechnology that dramatically
decreases the patient recovery time for dental implant surgery, while increasing
its success rate.</P>
      <P>Renowned American dentist Dr. Alan Meltzer will deliver the keynote address to
over 200 local dentists on how to incorporate this new technology into their
practices, the AIT said in a press release.</P>
      <P>Patients often request shorter treatment time so that they can minimize
inconveniences in life,Meltzer was quoted as saying in the AIT press
release.Even if patientsconditions are not ideal, we can still shorten surgery
recovery time by using nanotechnology implants.</P>
      <P>Taiwans official data shows that 47 percent of Taiwans population aged 12 and
older is missing at least one tooth. If left untreated, missing teeth can cause
a variety of health issues such as periodontal disease, loss of natural facial
contours, and even digestive problems, the AIT press release said, adding that
however, many people are hesitant to seek treatment fearing that it will take
too long.</P>
      <P>The length of treatment required for an implant is determined by the time it
takes for the implant to bond with the human bone, known as  osseointegration.
The  latest  dental  implants  employing state-of-the-art nanotechnology can
substantially reduce the time for osseointegration.</P>
      <P>Dr. Cheng Kuo-ching, a graduate of the Boston University School of Dental
Medicine, said in the AIT press release that as implant dentistry becomes
popular, patients demand better quality and a faster healing process.</P>
      <P>It is therefore essential to enhance bone bonding and improve stability,  Cheng
said.Implants  using  nanotechnology  can effectively expedite bone growth.</P>
      <P>The conference on the nanotechnology dental implants is slated to be held at the
Taipei Medical University on Oct. 19 at 9 a.m. A cocktail party is planned for
15:30 p.m.</P>
      <P>The AIT functions as the de facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan in the absence of
formal diplomatic relations between Taipei and Washington.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of sightseeing trips to Taiwan by Chinese citizens has been far lower
than expected since the two sides of the Taiwan Strait reached an agreement in
mid-June on opening Taiwan up to more Chinese tourists, a Shanghai daily
reported on its Web site Friday .</P>
      <P>According to the Workers' Daily, just over 21,000 Chinese tourists have visited
Taiwan since the agreement, signed by the heads of China's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits and Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation,
formally took effect on July 18.</P>
      <P>The figure represents only 28 percent of the maximum number of Chinese tourists
allowed to visit Taiwan under the agreement -- which the paper said established
a quota of 1,000 tourists per day in its initial stages.</P>
      <P>In fact, however, the deal allowed up to 3,000 tourists per day, and it was
unclear if the newspaper simply made a mistake or was reflecting an official
decision by Beijing to limit visits to Taiwan by its citizens in the months
following the agreement.</P>
      <P>The lower tourist numbers have been a disappointment to President Ma Ying-jeou's
administration, which had hoped more arrivals from China could provide a spark
to the stagnant local tourism sector.</P>
      <P>The report provided some insight to why tourist numbers have fallen below
expectations.</P>
      <P>In Shanghai the three travel agents authorized to offer tours to Taiwan under
the agreement have handled just over 3,700 Chinese tourists since the launch of
the agreement, well below their allowable limit of 900 tourists per month each,
according to the daily.</P>
      <P>A travel agent in Shanghai told the newspaper that the high costs and many
restrictions have discouraged many Chinese citizens from choosing tours to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that the price of a tour to Taiwan is as high as 12,000 yuan (US$1,760),
which is comparable to taking a trip to Europe.</P>
      <P>The fact that the cheapest tour to Taiwan costs an average of about US$80 per
day has led many Chinese citizens to opt against choosing the island as a travel
destination, he added.</P>
      <P>Another travel industry source, however, expressed the hope that the
announcement before the end of this year of the next group of travel agents
authorized to offer tours to Taiwan will give a boost to the number of Chinese
tourists visiting the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Record high number of grey-faced buzzards pass through Kenting</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 17 (CNA)
10/17/08  18:19:36

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of grey-faced buzzards passing through Kenting National Park in the
southernmost tip of Taiwan this year reached 39,300 as of Friday, breaking its
2006 record of 35,800, a park administration specialist said.</P>
      <P>More than 11,000 of the rare birds passed the Kenting National Park Tuesday,
setting a single-day record, Tsai Yi-jung said.</P>
      <P>The birds breed in eastern Russia, northern China, Korea, and Japan, and winter
in Southeast Asia. They usually fly through Taiwan between Oct. 1 and 20 on
their southward migration, with the largest numbers of migrating birds usually
seen one or two days after Oct. 10.</P>
      <P>Since the Kenting park administration began its systematic investigation of the
number of the birds passing Kenting, the previous one-day high was 8,300 on Oct.
11, 2005, while the largest number for a season was 35,800 in 2006, according to
Tsai.</P>
      <P>More than 5,000 birds passed Kenting Friday, pushing the number of the birds
passing Kenting this season over 39,000, Tsai said, adding that the number will
exceed 40,000 Saturday if only 650 fly over.</P>
      <P>This year, the massive movement started on Oct. 9, with more than 3,000 flying
toward the sea on Oct. 10. Since then, the number has averaged between 1,000 and
3,000 per day.</P>
      <P>Tsai attributed  the higher-than-average  daily  number  of grey-faced buzzards
passing Kenting this year mainly to the fact that the weather has been good in

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan promised Friday that the government will make sure the
sovereignty of the Republic of China is protected in its handling of the
upcoming visit to Taiwan by Beijing's top negotiator.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin,  president of the Beijing-based  semi-official Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), will be in Taipei to meet with his
Taiwanese counterpart, Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-
kung.</P>
      <P>They are expected to discuss issues ranging from the launch of cross-strait
cargo charter flights and direct shipping links to the establishment of more
direct cross-strait air routes.</P>
      <P>Asked during an interpellation session in the Legislative Yuan if he has any
plans to receive Chen, Liu said if he is to receive Chen, he will definitely do
so in his capacity as premier of the ROC.</P>
      <P>Also, Liu said the ROC flag and the portrait of ROC founding father Sun Yat-sen
will not be removed from the government offices where possible meetings between
ROC government officials and Chen take place.</P>
      <P>As Beijing does not recognize Taiwan's government, Chinese officials visiting
Taiwan have always avoided official meetings with government officials in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>There have also been cases in which mainland officials demanded that the ROC
flag not be displayed at venues where they visited.</P>
      <P>But Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said during the session
that ARATS has not made any such requests for Chen's visit, which has been set
for early November.</P>
      <P>On the opposition's demand that Beijing apologize to Taiwan over the scare over
melamine-tainted food before Chen visits, Premier Liu said the government has
formally asked for an apology from the mainland, but that he could not decide on
Beijing's behalf as to when the apology is to be offered.</P>
      <P>Lai noted that the government first raised the apology issue on Sept. 14
following the discovery of melamine in a shipment of Sanlu-brand milk powder
imported into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While Premier Liu reiterated the position during a legislative interpellation
session Sept. 30, the government later also passed on the message to Beijing
through the communication channels existing between the two sides, Lai said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Foundation raises funds for abandoned children</HEADLINE>

(By Nick Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Child Welfare Foundation plans to raise NT$15 million (US$460,603) before
the end of this year to care for abandoned children, whose numbers reached a
three-and-a-half-year high in the first half of 2008.</P>
      <P>The foundation needs the funds to cover the costs of housing and caring for the
abandoned children at its nursing homes across Taiwan to give them good
environments before they are entrusted to adoptive families.</P>
      <P>The foundation announced its plans at a news conference held at the Children's
Recreation Center in Taipei Thursday, where it also delivered a report on the
current scale of the problem in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A foundation representative urged the general public to donate money to help
fund the program, and said those interested in making a contribution could call
a hot line at (02) 2550-5959 or visit the foundation's Web site for more
information.</P>
      <P>A total of 525 children, or approximately 43 each month, were abandoned  in the
country last year,  said Alicia Wang,  the foundation's executive director,
citing statistics recently released by the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>A total of 315 children have been abandoned in Taiwan during the first half of
this year, marking an increase of 23 percent over the same period of last year
and representing the highest level in three and a half years, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Parents also made a total of 425 calls to the foundation during the January-June
period, expressing their desire to have their children adopted, as they are
short of money to raise them, Wang added.</P>
      <P>While financial problems are the main reason for the phenomenon, the foundation
said, children are also often abandoned because their parents are in jail and
cannot take care of them or because of the strain of caring for children with
serious diseases.</P>
      <P>Making the foundation's job more challenging is that local families interested
in adopting abandoned children generally reject children who are sick, older,
foreign or of aboriginal descent, while scores of families decline taking in
children whose parents are drug addicts or have criminal records.</P>
      <P>At the same time, recent government statistics show that the number of local
families willing to adopt children has dwindled over the past few years because
of the country's sluggish economy during that time.</P>
      <P>To make matters worse, some families that have adopted children plan to give
them up because of financial woes, the foundation indicated.</P>
      <P>Also on hand at the press event was "philanthropic ambassador" Patty Tsai, wife
of EasyCard Corp. Chairman Sean Lien, and officials of the program's sponsors --
including Far EasTone Telecommunications Co., one of the country's major cell
phone service providers.</P>
      <P>Founded in Taipei in 1991, the foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated
to promoting child welfare.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Local chemists invent shortest intermetallic quintuple bonds</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Taiwanese chemists have invented the shortest artificial metal-metal
quintuple bonds to date, which holds two chromium atoms at the distance of only
1.74 angstroms (0.174 nanometers), academic sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Yi-chou, a chemistry professor at the National Tsing Hua University in
Hsinchu, explained that the scientists have for long devoted  themselves  to
discovering  or  inventing  high-order inter-atomic bonds, such as quadruple,
quintuple, or even sextuple bonds.</P>
      <P>"The higher the order, the stronger the binding power, and wider the range of
application," added Tsai.</P>
      <P>A chemical bond is the attractive interactions between atoms or molecules. When
employing artificial bonds, scientist will be able to create novel compounds
that can be used in commercial products or other equipment.</P>
      <P>An American chemist,  Frank Albert Cotton,  first invented quadruple bonds in
1964; while the first man-made quintuple bonds did not come into existence until
as late as 2005, according to Tsai.</P>
      <P>Even though some scientists have claimed to produce sextuple bonds, it is very
difficult to reproduce the results, not to mention determine their genuine bond
orders, noted Tsai.</P>
      <P>To date, the shortest distance between two quintuple-bonded atoms is recorded at
1.80 angstroms.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese team -- joined by scientists from National Tsing Hua University,
National Chiao Tung University, National Taiwan University, and National Taiwan
Normal University -- first produced a pair of quintuple-bonded  chromium atoms
with an intermetallic distance of 1.82 angstroms.</P>
      <P>They later replaced the bond with potassium graphite, which further shortens the
interatomic distance to 1.74 angstrom, said Tsai.</P>
      <P>According to the online report of Nature Chemistry, a separate team in Germany
reported that they made a similar breakthrough in producing quintuple bonds at
almost the same time when Tsai's team reported their finding; however, the
German team's quintuple bonds are slightly longer, 1.75 angstroms, and the re-
evaluation suggested abond order of only 4.2.</P>
      <P>For future applications, Tsai said that for example, their findings can be used
to refine the catalysts employed in the manufacturing process of polyethylene
(PE) or polypropylene (PP).</P>
      <P>Such an improvement can lower the temperatures and pressure needed to produce PE
and PP, so that the production safety can be increased, added Tsai.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Experts see 2.5 ppm for melamine as appropriate safety standard</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 17 (CNA)
10/17/08  19:46:27
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>International experts reached a consensus at a conference in Taipei Friday that
the standard of 2.5 ppm of melamine in food is adequate to ensure human health
and stressed that cooperation between importing and exporting countries should
be enhanced.</P>
      <P>Despite the consensus, however, Taiwan's Department of Health (DOH) had no
immediate plans to modify its own more restrictive standard for melamine in
food, said agency spokesman Wang Je-chau, who said the forum was simply a
platform for experts to share their opinions.</P>
      <P>Debate has raged over the standard since late September, when consumers panicked
after a shipment of melamine-adulterated milk powder from China was found to
have entered Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Then DOH Minister Lin Fang-yue was forced to resign after setting a safety
standard of 2.5 ppm (parts per million) of the chemical in most foods and 1 ppm
for infant formula, as opposition politicians charged the standard was "loose"
and would put local consumers at risk.</P>
      <P>To appease consumer fears, the DOH now stipulates that processed foods and
ingredients will be allowed for sale only if they test negative for melamine
using highly sensitive  LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry), which can detect as little as 0.05 ppm of the chemical in food.</P>
      <P>That has led to disputes with local food suppliers, who have complained that
products that would be found acceptable in the European Union,  the United
States and elsewhere  were judged unacceptable in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At Friday's conference on control measures for melamine presence in food, most
experts agreed that the 2.5 ppm standard was an "action level" to prevent fraud,
meaning that it was an appropriate level to distinguish adulteration from
background contamination.</P>
      <P>The experts also echoed previous international advisories on the issue that
melamine, although toxic, is of low toxicity and thus poses low risk to human
health.</P>
      <P>Bill Jolly, deputy director of export standards of New Zealand's Food Safety
Authority, described trying to set standards for melamine at levels below 2.5
ppm as "more academic than practical, " arguing that only items containing
melamine in traces above that level needed to be dealt with for public health
purposes.</P>
      <P>New Zealand's  standard  for melamine  is 5 ppm for food ingredients, 2.5 ppm
for foods in their final form and 1 ppm for infant formula, according to a media
release issued by the country's Food Safety Authority Sept. 29.</P>
      <P>Kang Jaw-jou,  a professor in National Taiwan University's Institute of
Toxicology, appeared to take issue with the DOH's standard, arguing that while
all chemicals are toxic, and only the level of use and how they are used can
determine its toxicity.</P>
      <P>We cannot chase after zero detection or zero tolerance, which is impossible.
What we need is a standard based on risk assessment, not on numbers,Kang said.</P>
      <P>A number of the experts also argued that more attention needed to be placed on
prevention measures than testing methods,</P>
      <P>Slava Zeman, manager of the export food policy section of the Australian
Quarantine and Inspection Service, stressed the importance of control and
management measures at the source of food production.</P>
      <P>The most meaningful and almost the only way to really prevent the presence of
melamine in food is to look at the production controls and at the whole food
safety framework during production, Zeman said.</P>
      <P>She further suggested that cooperation between the authorities of exporting and
importing countries should be enhanced to ensure that necessary measures are
adopted during food production, including fraud prevention.</P>
      <P>Zeman feared that if people use extremely expensive testing methods, it would
raised the price of products to a level that nobody could afford.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Shu-kong, director-general of the Bureau of Food and Drug
Analysis under the DOH, a LC-MS/MS spectrometer costs about NT$9 million
(US$276,180), while a GC/MS machine, which is less sensitive but generally used
by other countries to test for melamine in foods, costs from NT$3 million to NT$
5 million.</P>
      <P>Experts also said that integrated  control between trading countries should be
improved. They praised Taiwans food safety system, but believed it could still
further enhance relationships with its trading partners, including China.</P>
      <P>In addition, they suggested better random and risk-based testing to verify
imported productssafety at ports of entry.</P>
      <P>Bonnie Sun Pan, a professor in the Department of Food Science at National Taiwan
Ocean University, said that risk communication in Taiwan needs to be enhanced
between food suppliers, consumers and government agencies, in order to ease
people's worries about tainted food.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) decided Friday to establish a think tank
to provide strategies to promote relations with countries in the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>The decision was made after a two-day coordination meeting of the ministry's
newly formed task force on relations with ASEAN.</P>
      <P>The meeting -- attended by eight representatives of Taiwan in the Southeast
Asian countries and 15 agencies under the Executive Yuan -- was held to follow
through on President Ma Ying-jeou's directive to have Taiwan actively
participate in the integration of the Asia Pacific region and ASEAN.</P>
      <P>It was the first such meeting after the MOFA established the ASEAN  task force,
a strategic  inter-agency  group aimed at strengthening relations with the
region and preventing Taiwan from being marginalized.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said the think tank, which will be comprised of senior
diplomats and experts well-experienced  in relations with ASEAN countries, will
advise the task force on its strategies and direction.</P>
      <P>This serves as a proof that we are not just paying lip service to the issue, but
really taking action (to improve relations with the ASEAN),Chen said.</P>
      <P>While Chen would not reveal more details related to the think tank, he said the
unit should be establishedthe sooner the better."</P>
      <P>The meeting provides a good beginning to the integration of agencies on the
establishment of a working network toward ASEAN,the MOFA said in a press
release.</P>
      <P>The ministry added that improved relations across the Taiwan Strait provides
Taiwan with more latitude to work with ASEAN countries, and said it will work
with related agencies to seize the opportunity and integrate resources to
continue to expand and consolidate relations with Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>The MOFA will also promote Taiwan's entry into the ASEAN mechanism to benefit
Taiwan's sustainability and development, the foreign ministry added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fears its trade-dependent economy could be marginalized if it is not
included in a regional free trade zone under negotiation that would include the
ASEAN countries and China, South Korea and Japan.</P>
      <P>Established in Thailand in 1967, ASEAN is made up of 10 member countries --
Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Its objectives, apart from promoting regional peace, include the acceleration of
economic growth, social progress and cultural development among its members.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Students to get free lunches by 2010 at the earliest: MOE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Education Cheng Jei-cheng said Friday that the ministry hopes to be
able to provide free lunches to all elementary and junior high school students
in Taiwan by 2010 at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the remarks at a question-and-answer session in the Legislative Yuan
during which the issue of children from underprivileged families who are unable
to afford the lunch fees at schools was raised.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Chin-lung of the ruling Kuomintang noted that the government has
appropriated NT$700 million this year to subsidize students from low-income
households, but "there are still many children who have not been included and
cannot afford to pay for lunch fees."</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the government has been generous in funding top-notched
universities, and that it should also fund the lunch program in all elementary
and junior high schools, adding that doing so "would only cost NT$19 billion
(US$179.88 million) a year."</P>
      <P>Providing students with free lunches is "a step in the right direction", Cheng
said, but he noted that "local governments should also shoulder responsibility
in financing the project."</P>
      <P>At present, in addition to the central government, a few local governments --
Hsinchu city and county, as well as Kinmen and Matsu -- are also funding their
lunch program, according to Cheng.</P>
      <P>"If the Ministry of Education has to shoulder all the expenses, it will have
financial problems," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Pressed by Tsai on when the free lunch will be possible, Cheng</P>
      <P>said the budget for next year has already been appropriated, but</P>
      <P>he is eying for 2010.</P>
      <P>"The ministry will coordinate with other government agencies and</P>
      <P>local governments, in hopes that the goal can be achieved in</P>
      <P>2010," he said.</P>
      <P>Lunches offered in elementary and junior high schools cost between NT$35 to
NT$50, and a student has to pay between NT$770-1,100 per month if a school month
is counted by 22 school days.</P>
      <P>According to government statistics, around 140,000 students, accounting for 5.6
percent of the elementary and junior high school student population, cannot
afford to pay for school lunches.</P>

      <P>A coach carrying 28 passengers caught fire while traveling northbound in the
Hsuehshan Tunnel early Friday, but firemen rushed to the scene quickly and put
out the blaze.</P>
      <P>No one was harmed in the accident.</P>
      <P>According to the National Highway Traffic Control Center, the fire that occurred
at 10:25 a.m. may have been sparked by the coach's overheated engine, but the
true cause of the blaze has yet to be established.</P>
      <P>The center temporarily stopped both northbound and southbound traffic to allow
fire trucks to reach the scene, which was close to the tunnel's exit on the
Taipei County side.</P>
      <P>The 28 passengers were students and faculty members of National Ilan University
who were on their way to Kaohsiung to take part in a national robotics
competition. They were evacuated to a rest area to wait for a replacement bus.</P>
      <P>The traffic in the tunnel returned to normal at around noon after the
demobilized bus was towed away.</P>
      <P>This was the second fire in the 12.9-kilometer tunnel since the second longest
road tunnel in Asia was inaugurated in June 2006. On Aug. 3 this year, a
northbound sedan also caught fire when it was 5.5 km into the tunnel, but
firemen rushed to the scene within 10 minutes to extinguish the blaze.</P>
      <P>No one was injured, and fire experts later determined the blaze was caused by
spontaneous combustion.</P>
      <P>The tunnel's self-defense fire brigade, as well as the fire brigades near both
ends of the tunnel in Taipei and Yilan counties, hold fire drills regularly to
keep their men in top firefighting form.</P>
      <P>The tunnel is the centerpiece of the 55-km No. 5 Freeway linking Taipei with

Friday.</P>
      <P>Both state-run oil refiner CPC Corp., Taiwan (CPC) and the private Formosa
Petrochemical Corp. will lower their prices for gasoline by NT$2 per liter and
prices for diesel by NT$2.2 per liter.</P>
      <P>CPC's price cuts will take effect Friday at midnight and Formosa's will go into
force at 1 a.m., Saturday.</P>
      <P>Following the latest adjustment, the price of 92-octane unleaded gasoline will
fall to NT$25.2 per liter, that of 95-octane unleaded will be NT$25.9 per liter
and that of 98-octane unleaded will fall to NT$27.4 per liter. The price of
diesel will fall to NT$22.3 per liter.</P>
      <P>This week's cuts follow gasoline and diesel price reductions last Friday of

    <HEADLINE>European offices to hold conferences on abolition of death penalty</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Alliance to End the Death Penalty (TAEDP) and three European offices
in Taiwan will organize a series of activities in early November to encourage
the abolition of the death penalty and help advance the debate on the issue in
Taiwan, the alliance said Friday.</P>
      <P>One of the centerpiece events will be a seminar Nov. 6-7 called "New
Perspectives on Abolishing the Death Penalty, " organized by the TAEDP and the
German Institute in Taipei.</P>
      <P>German  scholars  will  discuss  the issue  from different perspectives, such as
the relationship between the abolition of the death penalty and social safety,
victim protection and prison reform.</P>
      <P>"The objective of Taiwan's Criminal Code is to re-educate and reform prisoners,
not to kill them, " said a TAEDP worker, who expected that the events will help
promote human rights and encourage debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>The worker, who only gave her surname Chiu because she only volunteers for the
organization, also suggested that Taiwan should learn from Germany's
experience,  which includes  considerable achievements in prisoner re-education.</P>
      <P>According to the TAEDP, no individual has been executed in Taiwan since 2005,
but there are still 31 convicts who have been sentenced to death, including one
who was sentenced on the Double Ten national holiday, which is also the World
Day Against the Death Penalty.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above seminar, the French office will hold a conference on
Nov. 3 on "How Taiwan can move toward abolishing the death penalty, " in
partnership with National Taipei University and the Taiwan Law Society, with the
support of the European Economic and Trade Office.</P>
      <P>Two French experts, Sylvie Bukhari de Pontual, a lawyer and member of the Bar of
Paris, and Michel Forst, general secretary of the French National Consultative
Commission for Human Rights, will talk about the need of criminal code reform
regarding abolition of the death penalty and on the death penalty in the context
of international law, according to the office.</P>
      <P>A film featuring Robert Badinter, senator and former French Minister of Justice,
who is renowned for his activism in support of abolishing capital punishment in
France, will also be screened at the conference.</P>
      <P>British experts will also exchange their experiences with Taiwan on Nov. 13 and
14. They will discuss how to advance the process of getting rid of the death
penalty in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan needs open policies to retain, attract talent: expert</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  17 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's government should come up with more open policies to prevent a brain
drain and to attract foreign talent amid a global competition for human
resources, Johnsee Lee, president of Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI), suggested Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking to CNA during a telephone interview, Lee said Taiwan fell behind many
countries and places like Singapore, Hong Kong, China, and Malaysia in terms of
keeping and attracting professional talent.</P>
      <P>Many of Taiwan's technology talents, including researchers in the ITRI, have
been recruited to work in Singapore, said Lee, who is currently visiting Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia.</P>
      <P>What Taiwan lacks are favorable government measures to retain and attract
talent, Lee said.</P>
      <P>In addition to local research institutes' efforts to provide a better
environment to ease and prevent a brain drain, Lee said, Taiwan's government
should offer more assistance, which could include a more open attitude towards
allowing foreigners to work here, and favorable regulations related to talent
acquisition, including loosening guidelines on the kind of jobs foreigners are
allowed to do here and providing easier access to residency rights.</P>
      <P>Lee cited Singapore as an example Taiwan can learn from. Singapore recruited
leaders of and teams of research institutes in the United States and Europe with
high salaries. It also simplified the process for foreign professionals to
acquire work permits, residency, and naturalization.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that Taiwan's ITRI has made a lot of efforts in improving
teamwork and creating a good entrepreneurship environment to keep its talented
staff.</P>
      <P>The institute allows researchers to spend 10 percent of their work time to
research innovative topics that they are interested in, Lee said.</P>
      <P>ITRI also provides development capital to employees for profitable innovations
created during that part of their work time and researchers can receive 25
percent of the technology transfer fees on their inventions, Lee said.</P>
      <P>ITRI's staff are also free to give suggestions and criticism about the
institute's operations on its employee intranet, in the hope of inviting ideas
for the institute's improvement, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The ITRI also encourages researchers to study ways to develop innovations
beneficial to disadvantaged groups, energy saving, and health care, in order to
keep them in the institute by satisfying their need to make contributions to
society, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee is in Malaysia for the Frost and Sullivan 4th Annual Growth Innovation and
Leadership Summit, which was organized by the U.S. -based growth consulting
company Frost and Sullivan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) urged the government Friday to
immediately freeze the NT$5.71 billion (US$175.29 million) kept by the bankrupt
Lehman Brothers in two accounts of Polaris MF Global Futures Co. as good faith
deposits.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng said at a press conference that some 51,000 Taiwanese
investors who bought structured notes from Lehman Brothers suffered losses
totaling NT$40 billion, and that the government should follow the examples of
Japan and South Korea by freezing the funds of Lehman Brothers to protect the
rights of domestic investors.</P>
      <P>Wu also called for a thorough check to find out if the collapsed Wall Street
investment bank still has other funds and assets in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He lashed out at Securities and Futures Investors Protection Center Chairwoman
Chan Tsai-hung for remaining silent on the issue.</P>
      <P>"Did Chan know that Lehman Brothers still has NT$5.71 billion in cash in Taiwan?
If she didn't, she should step down. If she knew it but took no action, she
should all the more step down," Wu said.</P>
      <P>In response, Chan said her center has already sent a written notice to the
Cabinet-level Financial Supervisory Commission about the matter, and that the
center and the commission are actively pursuing the issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ted Ho. chairman of Polaris MF Global Futures, confirmed that Lehman
Brothers still has NT$5.71 billion in two accounts with his company, and that no
one is allowed to touch the funds.</P>
      <P>Ho said that although the trustee in the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy had
requested a takeover of the funds, his company had replied that the company had
to consult with related government authorities in Taipei on the matter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ex-Mega Holdings chief listed as suspect in money laundering probe</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Mega Financial Holding Co. Chairman Cheng Shen-chih was listed as a
suspect Friday in a probe into a snowballing  case involving alleged money-
laundering  by former President Chen Shui-bian and his family.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-nan, director of the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office, said prosecutors decided to change Cheng's status from a
witness to a potential defendant after discovering while questioning him earlier
in the day that he had shady financial dealings with other suspects in the money
laundering case.</P>
      <P>Cheng was released after being questioned.</P>
      <P>Also Friday, prosecutors investigating the high-profile money laundering case
raided offices of three of Taiwan's largest financial holding groups in search
of evidence of their involvement in the case.</P>
      <P>According  to Chen  Yun-nan,  prosecutors  discovered  that subsidiaries  of the
three business groups --  Mega Holdings, Chinatrust Financial Holding Co. and
China Development Financial Holding Corp. -- had suspicious money dealings with
bank accounts held by suspects in the money laundering case.</P>
      <P>To avoid affecting the bearish local bourse, prosecutors did not start the
massive search until after the market closed. The raid was still going on as of
press time.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-nan said all relevant personnel were very cooperative in the course of
operations. In addition to offices, residences of certain major shareholders of
the three financial groups were also searched.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, prosecutors suspect that some of Chen Shui-bian's
family's overseas funds might have come from companies in connection with
financial reforms during his presidential term.</P>
      <P>But Chen Yun-nan said Friday's operations had nothing to do with the so-called
controversial "second fianncial reforms" launched during Chen Shui-bian's tenure
in which local banks were encouraged to merge to expand their market shares.</P>
      <P>The  former  president,  his  wife,  son,  daughter-in-law, brother-in-law and
four others have all been named as potential defendants in the case.</P>
      <P>Two of Chen Shui-bian's trusted aides -- Chen Chen-hui and Lin Teh-hsun -- as
well as the former first lady's older brother Wu Ching-mao and Tsai Ming-tseh, a
brother of one of Wu's college classmates, are being detained for their
suspected roles in the case.</P>
      <P>Swiss authorities informed Taiwanese authorities that a sum of US$21 million was
wired to Swiss bank accounts belonging to Chen Shui-bian's daughter-in-law Huang
Jui-ching in 2007. The funds have since been frozen.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian admitted Aug. 14 that his wife Wu shu-jen wired US$20 million
abroad from his past campaign funds but said she did so without his knowledge.
He denied that members of his family were laundering money.</P>
      <P>The former president, who stepped down May 20 after eight years in office, is
already being investigated for allegedly embezzling NT$14.8 million from a
"state affairs fund" set aside for his discretionary use for official purposes
while he was head of state.</P>
      <P>His wife is on trial in the same embezzlement case.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOTC hopes rules can be eased to facilitate infrastructure plan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 17 (CNA)
10/17/08  23:48:35

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) expressed the hope
Friday that regulations governing the introduction of foreign laborers in free
trade zones could be eased for one of the government's 12 major infrastructure
projects.</P>
      <P>The Council for Labor Affairs (CLA) reaffirmed, however, its stance that any
move to bring in more foreign laborers could not undermine the job opportunities
of local people.</P>
      <P>An MOTC official was referring to the Taoyuan International Air City, which will
include a free trade zone (FTZ) . The ministry is hoping to ease current
regulations governing the FTZ to make it more attractive to foreign investors.</P>
      <P>The ministry hoped that existing labor regulations in local free trade zones,
such as paying the minimum wage and requirements that foreign laborers be
limited to 40 percent of a company's workforce and that Indigenous Peoples make
up at least 5 percent of a company's workforce, not apply to the air city.</P>
      <P>The official said that the ministry has sent two versions of a draft statute
governing the development of Taoyuan International Airport Park to the Executive
Yuan for approval.</P>
      <P>The first one follows existing regulations and would enforce the 40 percent cap
on foreign workers and payment of a minimum wage.</P>
      <P>The second version states that in special cases, companies seeking to invest in
the air city could apply for exemptions from the 40 percent cap and minimum wage
standards, and their applications would be jointly screened by the MOTC and the
Council of Labor Affairs.</P>
      <P>The MOTC also hopes to lower the ratio of Indigenous employees the minimum 5
percent to 1 percent, the official said.</P>
      <P>The official acknowledged, however, that "no company in a free trade zone has a
workforce where 40 percent of its workers are foreign laborers. It is not
certain which sectors in the air city would need a lot of foreign laborers."</P>
      <P>He said the ministry only put forth the second version because it does not want
potential investors to have any misgivings about hiring foreign laborers if they
had the need.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CLA spokesman Pan Shih-wei stressed that industrial development will
not rely on opening Taiwan to foreign workers, saying that they should be
complementary in nature.</P>
      <P>"The premise of opening up to foreign workers is that it should not affect the
working rights of local people," Pan said, adding that those jobs that are made
available to foreign laborers should be ones in which local people are not
interested and where labor shortages exist.</P>
      <P>He said that the CLA currently allows foreign laborers to work in households and
in the manufacturing, construction, and social welfare sectors.</P>
      <P>The logistics industry has in recent years hoped to introduce foreign laborers,
but the CLA said logistics companies are part of the service sector, which is
not facing a labor shortage.</P>
      <P>CLA statistics showed that there are more than 370,000 foreign laborers in
Taiwan, and the ratio of foreign laborers employed in various sectors depends on
their respective conditions.</P>
      <P>In the construction sector, for example, only major construction projects are
allowed to introduce foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>Some sectors have in recent years asked the CLA to exempt them from paying
foreign laborers the minimum wage, but the requests have been rejected by the
CLA to protect the workers' human rights.</P>

      <P>The government will announce Sunday evening whether the measure to narrow the

closely in the next two days before making a decision," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Local shares, which normally are not allowed to rise or fall by more than 7
percent in any trading session, have been limited to declines of 3.5 percent

      <P>The 7 percent limit-up remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>The measure has not prevented local share prices from tumbling along with world

      <P>A member of the first Chinese tour group allowed to travel to Taipei via the
Taiwan-held island of Kinmen disappeared from a Taipei hotel shortly after his
arrival and has since remained at large, the Tourism Bureau said in a statement
Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Guobin arrived in Taipei via a flight from Kinmen Sept. 30 -- the inaugual
day of the new cross-Taiwan Strait travel formula -- after reaching the island
on a ferry from Xiamen in the southeastern Chinese province of Fujian earlier
that day along with a tour group.</P>
      <P>Lin was nowhere to be found when the Chinese tour group leader conducted a roll
call the following morning. He remained missing on the group's scheduled
departing date Oct. 8.</P>
      <P>After an intensive search over the past 10 days failed, the National Immigration
Agency put Lin on the "wanted" list Friday, the Tourism Bureau statement said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the statement said, the Tourism Bureau decided to deduct NT$200,000
(US$6,153.8) from the travel agency's NT$1 million deposit as a fine. All local
travel agencies intending to host Chinese tour groups are required to deposit
NT$1 million as a guarantee.</P>
      <P>According to Lin's entry permit application form, he was a staff member of a
ready-to-wear garment factory.</P>
      <P>Travel sources said all members of the first tour group to travel to Taiwan via
Kinmen had been carefully screened and selected. It was hard to understand why
Lin, known as the boss of a garment factory in China, would abscond, the sources
said.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to attract more Chinese tourist arrivals, Taiwan began to
allow Chinese holidaymakers to fly to Taiwan via Kinmen Sept. 30.</P>
      <P>Oliver F.L. Yu, deputy minister of transportation and communications, said the
issue should be addressed in terms of the motivations of those who have absonded
and the frequency of such cases.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan opened its door wider to Chinese tourists July 4, three absconding
cases have been reported, including Lin's case.</P>
      <P>The remaining two cases involved Chinese citizens traveling to Taiwan via a
third place or country. On July 9, three Chinese women left the hotel their tour
group was staying without informing their group leader. Two of them came forward
to a local police office the following day, but the third one, identified as
Guan Xiaoyin, has remained at large.</P>
      <P>On July 14, a man disappeared from the hotel after arriving with a tour group
from a third place, but he was located the following day.</P>

bank accounts held by suspects in the money laundering case.</P>
      <P>To avoid affecting the bearish local bourse, prosecutors did not start the
massive search until after the market closed. The raid was still going on as of
press time.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-nan said all relevant personnel were very cooperative in the course of
operations. In addition to offices, residences of certain major shareholders of
the three financial groups were also searched.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, prosecutors suspect that some of Chen Shui-bian's
family's overseas funds might have come from companies in connection with
financial reforms during his presidential term.</P>
      <P>But Chen Yun-nan said Friday's operations had nothing to do with the so-called
controversial "second fianncial reforms" launched during Chen Shui-bian's tenure
in which local banks were encouraged to merge to expand their market shares.</P>
      <P>The  former  president,  his  wife,  son,  daughter-in-law, brother-in-law and
four others have all been named as potential defendants in the case.</P>
      <P>Two of Chen Shui-bian's trusted aides -- Chen Chen-hui and Lin Teh-hsun -- as
well as the former first lady's older brother Wu Ching-mao and Tsai Ming-tseh, a
brother of one of Wu's college classmates, are being detained for their
suspected roles in the case.</P>
      <P>Swiss authorities informed Taiwanese authorities that a sum of US$21 million was
wired to Swiss bank accounts belonging to Chen Shui-bian's daughter-in-law Huang
Jui-ching in 2007. The funds have since been frozen.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian admitted Aug. 14 that his wife Wu shu-jen wired US$20 million
abroad from his past campaign funds but said she did so without his knowledge.
He denied that members of his family were laundering money.</P>
      <P>The former president, who stepped down May 20 after eight years in office, is
already being investigated for allegedly embezzling NT$14.8 million from a
"state affairs fund" set aside for his discretionary use for official purposes
while he was head of state.</P>
      <P>His wife is on trial in the same embezzlement case.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government urged to freeze Lehman Brothers' funds in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) urged the government Friday to
immediately freeze the NT$5.71 billion (US$175.29 million) kept by the bankrupt
Lehman Brothers in two accounts of Polaris MF Global Futures Co. as good faith
deposits.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng said at a press conference that some 51,000 Taiwanese
investors who bought structured notes from Lehman Brothers suffered losses
totaling NT$40 billion, and that the government should follow the examples of
Japan and South Korea by freezing the funds of Lehman Brothers to protect the
rights of domestic investors.</P>
      <P>Wu also called for a thorough check to find out if the collapsed Wall Street
investment bank still has other funds and assets in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He lashed out at Securities and Futures Investors Protection Center Chairwoman
Chan Tsai-hung for remaining silent on the issue.</P>
      <P>"Did Chan know that Lehman Brothers still has NT$5.71 billion in cash in Taiwan?
If she didn't, she should step down. If she knew it but took no action, she
should all the more step down," Wu said.</P>
      <P>In response, Chan said her center has already sent a written notice to the
Cabinet-level Financial Supervisory Commission about the matter, and that the
center and the commission are actively pursuing the issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ted Ho. chairman of Polaris MF Global Futures, confirmed that Lehman
Brothers still has NT$5.71 billion in two accounts with his company, and that no
one is allowed to touch the funds.</P>
      <P>Ho said that although the trustee in the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy had
requested a takeover of the funds, his company had replied that the company had
to consult with related government authorities in Taipei on the matter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOTC hopes rules can be eased to facilitate infrastructure plan</HEADLINE>

10/18/08  12:32:53

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) expressed the hope
Friday that regulations governing the introduction of foreign laborers in free
trade zones could be eased for one of the government's 12 major infrastructure
projects.</P>
      <P>The Council for Labor Affairs (CLA) reaffirmed, however, its stance that any
move to bring in more foreign laborers could not undermine the job opportunities
of local people.</P>
      <P>An MOTC official was referring to the Taoyuan International Air City, which will
include a free trade zone (FTZ) . The ministry is hoping to ease current
regulations governing the FTZ to make it more attractive to foreign investors.</P>
      <P>The ministry hoped that existing labor regulations in local free trade zones,
such as paying the minimum wage and requirements that foreign laborers be
limited to 40 percent of a company's workforce and that Indigenous Peoples make
up at least 5 percent of a company's workforce, not apply to the air city.</P>
      <P>The official said that the ministry has sent two versions of a draft statute
governing the development of Taoyuan International Airport Park to the Executive
Yuan for approval.</P>
      <P>The first one follows existing regulations and would enforce the 40 percent cap
on foreign workers and payment of a minimum wage.</P>
      <P>The second version states that in special cases, companies seeking to invest in
the air city could apply for exemptions from the 40 percent cap and minimum wage
standards, and their applications would be jointly screened by the MOTC and the
Council of Labor Affairs.</P>
      <P>The MOTC also hopes to lower the ratio of Indigenous employees the minimum 5
percent to 1 percent, the official said.</P>
      <P>The official acknowledged, however, that "no company in a free trade zone has a
workforce where 40 percent of its workers are foreign laborers. It is not
certain which sectors in the air city would need a lot of foreign laborers."</P>
      <P>He said the ministry only put forth the second version because it does not want
potential investors to have any misgivings about hiring foreign laborers if they
had the need.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CLA spokesman Pan Shih-wei stressed that industrial development will
not rely on opening Taiwan to foreign workers, saying that they should be
complementary in nature.</P>
      <P>"The premise of opening up to foreign workers is that it should not affect the
working rights of local people," Pan said, adding that those jobs that are made
available to foreign laborers should be ones in which local people are not
interested and where labor shortages exist.</P>
      <P>He said that the CLA currently allows foreign laborers to work in households and
in the manufacturing, construction, and social welfare sectors.</P>
      <P>The logistics industry has in recent years hoped to introduce foreign laborers,
but the CLA said logistics companies are part of the service sector, which is
not facing a labor shortage.</P>
      <P>CLA statistics showed that there are more than 370,000 foreign laborers in
Taiwan, and the ratio of foreign laborers employed in various sectors depends on
their respective conditions.</P>
      <P>In the construction sector, for example, only major construction projects are
allowed to introduce foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>Some sectors have in recent years asked the CLA to exempt them from paying
foreign laborers the minimum wage, but the requests have been rejected by the
CLA to protect the workers' human rights.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan-born New York Yankees starter Wang Chien-ming took a major step forward
Friday in his rehabilitation from a season-ending injury in mid-June.</P>
      <P>Wang, who suffered a right foot injury while rounding third base in an inter-
league game against the Houston Astros on June 15, entered the bullpen for the
first time since the injury to throw some warm up pitches in Tampa Bay, Florida.</P>
      <P>Known as "the pride of Taiwan" for his stellar 19-win seasons in 2006 and 2007,
Wang began the new season with an 8-2 record and an ERA of 4.07 before being
sidelined for the remainder of the year with a torn Lisfranc ligament of the
right foot.</P>
      <P>Although the injury did not require surgery, Wang was restricted to a foot cast
which was only removed on July 28.</P>
      <P>On Friday, Wang began cautiously by throwing some 20 pitches on a mound half the
height of a regular mound to warm up before entering the bullpen where he threw
about 25 pitches.</P>
      <P>"It's better. It's good," Wang told members of the U.S. media afterwards.</P>
      <P>Although Wang has not yet recovered 100 percent, the U.S. media already see him
as one of the five starters in the Yankees' rotation for next year, which is the
pride of Taiwan's ultimate goal after months of rigorous rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>The Yankees are also hoping that Wang will be back in top form for the start of
next season after they failed to make the post-season for the first time since
1993 because of a string of injuries to key players during the course of the
regular season.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan went on a shopping spree in Taipei City Saturday
afternoon in an attempt to encourage more consumer spending to help boost the
domestic economy.</P>
      <P>Liu spent more than NT$10,000 (US$307) on his shopping trip which took him to
the Pin-chiang Market and Sogo Department Store.</P>
      <P>The premier's move came on the heels of President Ma Ying-jeou's highly
publicized visit to a local market to purchase two pairs of sneakers Wednesday
with the express aim of setting an example for Taiwan consumers to head out and
shop.</P>
      <P>At the Pin-chiang Market, Liu bought a variety of locally grown fruits,
including papayas, grapefruit, persimmons and dragon fruit, saying that "Taiwan-
grown dragon fruit is the sweetest."</P>
      <P>Liu then headed to Sogo Department Store, where he purchased three shirts for
more than NT$6,000 as well as a new DVD player for NT$1,490. He said he decided
to make the purchase after his wife had told him earlier the same morning that
their old player was on the fritz.</P>
      <P>The premier also purchased a few CDs to round out his shopping trip, including
one by folk singer Kimbo, another by pianist Li Yun-di, and one by pop singer
Jay Chou, whom he called "a brilliant musician."</P>
      <P>Liu told reporters after his shopping spree that he randomly chose the market

made. He expressed the hope that his gesture would be helpful toward boosting

    <HEADLINE>DOH imposes ban on China-made leavening agent</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) imposed a ban Saturday on a leavening agent
imported from China, which it said is contaminated with the toxic chemical
melamine, adding another item to the list of banned Chinese food products.</P>
      <P>The leavening agent, ammonium bicarbonate, was found to contain between 70 and
300 ppm (parts per million) of melamine in a regular random examination
conducted by a local bureau of health, said Deputy DOH Minister Cheng Shou-hsia
at a press conference.</P>
      <P>Cheng announced a ban on all imports of ammonium bicarbonate from China, adding
it to list of food imports from China already banned -- milk powder, creamers
and vegetable-based proteins.</P>
      <P>Ammonium bicarbonate is a legal food additive used to lighten and soften bread
and biscuits.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that only one company in Taiwan, Sesoda Corp., has imported the
tainted leavening agent from two chemical companies in China.</P>
      <P>But volume of the import is still under investigation, he said, adding that the
tainted ingredient was shipped to 12 regions in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He however declined to name the 12 regions, saying only that local health
bureaus have begun to seize the tainted ingredient.</P>
      <P>"The leavening agent was tainted, but as the quantity added to food is usually
very small, products on store shelves are still safe to eat," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, the DOH has asked food companies in Taiwan to use other leavening
agents, such as baking soda and baking powder.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he did not know why the chemical had shown up in the leavening agent.</P>
      <P>"Melamine is not a food additive, so we have no way of knowing in what products
it will show up, " he said, adding that instituting controls at the food
production source is the most important food safety measure.</P>
      <P>An inter-agency meeting will be convened before next Monday to discuss measures
to deal with the issue of melamine contamination of food, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>He disclosed that the DOH has informed the International Food Safety Authorities
Network under the World Health Organization about the latest case of melamine
contamination.</P>
      <P>In the past weeks, melamine has been found in imports of dairy products,
creamers and vegetable-based proteins from China.</P>
      <P>Under the DOH's current regulations, foods testing positive for melamine  with
the  use  of the LC-MS/MS  technique  (liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry) are not allowed on the market.</P>
      <P>Melamine, a toxic industrial chemical, was added by Chinese food producers to
milk to produce a falsely high result in tests for protein levels that measure
nitrogen content. This was done in cases where water was added to raw milk to
increase its volume. The addition of melamine increases the nitrogen content of
milk and therefore its apparent protein level.</P>
      <P>Thousands of children in China who were fed baby formula contaminated with the
chemical were found to have kidney stones, while four infants have died as a
result of consuming the tainted milk products.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) forecast Saturday that one
million people will take part in its "safeguard Taiwan" demonstration to be held
Oct. 25 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>According to Lai Ching-te, a DPP legislative caucus whip, the event has spurred
the interest of "more people than any other demonstrations held in the past."</P>
      <P>For example, Lai said, in his Tainan constituency office alone 200 people have
signed up for the rally over the past two days.</P>
      <P>Lai said the widespread responses reflect the deep public resentment against the
Kuomintang (KMT) administration.</P>
      <P>"Everybody wants to take to the streets, regardless of political affiliation or
class," he said.</P>
      <P>Pan Meng-an, a deputy whip of the DPP legislative caucus, said crowds of
protesters are expected to converge on Taipei in at least 100 charter buses from
Pingtung County alone.</P>
      <P>According to DPP Legislator Chen Ting-fei, the rally will definitely  trigger
"an unprecedented  uproar" because the KMT administration's  "tilt  toward
China"  has  damaged  Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The main objective of the planned demonstration is to reject the "one China
market, the downgrading of Taiwan's sovereignty and an incompetent government, "
the DPP said.</P>
      <P>The protest is being organized in cooperation with the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union amid plans for a visit to Taiwan by Chen Yunlin, president of
China's semi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>Chen is expected to visit Taipei to hold talks with his Taiwanese counterpart,
Chiang Pin-kung of the Straits Exchange Foundation, to discuss issues that
include the launch of cross-strait cargo charter flights and direct shipping
links and the establishment of more direct cross-strait air routes.</P>
      <P>The opposition has accused President Ma Ying-jeou of sacrificing Taiwan's
sovereignty by adopting a "modus vivendi" approach that advocates a"diplomatic
truce" with China and introducing a series of cross-strait liberalization
measures since his May 20 inauguration.</P>
      <P>These measures include launching nonstop cross-strait charter flights on
weekends, opening up Taiwan to more Chinese tourists, allowing cross-strait
currency trading, and raising the cap on China-bound investment by local
enterprises from 40 percent to 60 percent of their net worth.</P>
      <P>The opposition is also unsatisfied with what it alleges is the Ma
administration's failure to take a tough stance toward China in dealing with the
scare over melamine-tainted food imported from China.</P>

      <P>The southeastern Taipei City district of Nangang celebrated the blossoming of
sweet olive flowers with a carnival-like festival Saturday that featured musical
performances and a fun fair.</P>
      <P>It was the sixth year that the Nangang District Office was holding the "Guihua
Festival, " which revolves around the blossoming of the sweet olive -- a plant
known for the special fragrance of its flowers, called guihua in Chinese.</P>
      <P>The 2008 Guihua Festival and Musical Carnival began at Jiuzhuang Elementary
School with a singing contest and a musical concert. Visitors to the one-day
festival also had the opportunity to sample traditional guihua cakes and guihua-
scented Chinese tea, according to the organizer.</P>
      <P>Sweet Olive, or osmanthus fragrans, is an evergreen shrub species of osmanthus
native to Asia. It is found in the Himalayas, eastward to southern China,
Taiwan, and southern Japan.</P>
      <P>The plantation of sweet olive trees began more than a century ago, when local
tea farmers came up with the idea of using guihua to improve the fragrance of
their original green tea, known as Paochung Tea.</P>
      <P>The Nangang District  Office began this year to encourage residents to grow more
guihua trees in an effort to promote the district's tourism.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 10,000 sweet olive trees in Nangang.</P>
      <P>District administrator Chiang Ching-hui said that the trees began blossoming
last week and the fragrance is growing increasingly stronger as more flowers
bloom.</P>
      <P>This year, it is expected that there will more blossoms than ever before,
creating the most magnificent sight in history, and the delightful fragrance
will last until the beginning of 2009, according to Chiang.</P>
      <P>Chiang particularly mentioned 12 guihua trees, about 50 years old, in the
Jiuzhuang Elementary School compound, saying they are in full bloom. He
encouraged people to visit Nangang to enjoy the natural autumn fragrance.</P>
      <P>Visitors can travel to Nangang via the Taipei metro to Kunyang station and then

      <P>Some 51.7 percent of the Japanese enterprises in Taiwan are satisfied with their
current operations in the country, according to the results of survey released
by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) late Thursday.</P>
      <P>The survey, commissioned by the MOEA and conducted by the Taipei branch of
Japan's Nomura Research Institute, was aimed at learning more about how Japanese
enterprises view the Taiwan market and their means of coping with the country's
changing investment environment.</P>
      <P>Japanese firms invest in Taiwan mainly because of the market, the respondents
indicated, with about 65 percent of those in research and development saying
that Taiwan was their target market for product development, and 68 percent of
those in production indicating that they wanted to be close to the market.</P>
      <P>About 32 percent of respondents think one of the advantages of operating in
Taiwan is that they are well positioned to develop products for other Asian
markets including China, and 25 percent of the respondents in the field of
marketing and selling think Taiwan functions as a test market before they look
at other countries, the poll showed.</P>
      <P>In terms of coping with the shrinking Taiwan market, 50 percent of the
respondents said they chose to invest in high value-added products and services,
while 47.3 percent said they will expand to other markets.</P>
      <P>Some 19.1 percent of the respondents that sell their products in Taiwan think
the Taiwan market will expand in the future, while 45.5 percent think the
situation will remain the same, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>Among the respondents, 78.1 percent have operated in Taiwan for more than 10
years, and 48.1 percent for longer than 20 years.</P>
      <P>The respondents were drawn from a wide range of business operations, with 68.9
percent in marketing and selling, 53.8 percent in purchasing, 51.8 in after-sale
service, and 32.7 percent in research and development, and product planning and

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several members of the Rotary Club's Taipei Yenping branch set off Saturday
morning on a round-Taiwan bicycle tour to raise funds for the treatment of rare
disorders.</P>
      <P>King Liu, chairman of Taiwan's flagship bicycle maker Giant, was one of the many
people on hand to see the 21 cyclists off at Dadaocheng Wharf in Taipei City at
just after 7 a.m.</P>
      <P>Liu, whose son-in-law is one of the group members, joined the cyclists on the
first stretch of their journey to give them encouragement.</P>
      <P>The cyclists hope to complete their 1,010-km journey in 11 days and raise at
least NT$5 million (US$153,500) for the cause as the Rotary Clob has promised to
donate NT$1 for every kilometer they ride.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Foundation  for Rare Disorders (TFRD)  and the Department of Health
have listed 171 rare disorders in Taiwan -- 80 percent of which are either
incurable or can only be treated with drugs that are costly and not readily
available.</P>
      <P>The cost of treating such diseases is extremely high and well beyond the means
of patients whose disorders are not covered by the national health insurance
system, according to the TFRD.</P>
      <P>The foundation expressed its appreciation to the Rotary Club for its show of
concern for people with rare disorders and expressed the hope that it can serve
as an example for all sectors of society in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Rotary Club cyclists plan to arrive in the southern port city of Kaohsiung
on Oct. 21, where they will visit a patient with a rare genetic skin disorder
called epidermolysis bullosa.</P>
      <P>The cyclists will solicit donations during stops along their journey which is
slated to conclude back at Dadaocheng Wharf on Oct. 28.</P>

      <P>A non-profit animal protection organization in Taipei called Saturday for an end
to the abuse and torture of domestic animals in Taiwan by providing them with a
safe and caring environment.</P>
      <P>The founder of AnimalsTaiwan (AT), Sean McCormack from the United Kingdom, said
at a press conference that neutering, rather than killing, of animals is a more
effective method of dealing with the stray pet problem in the country.</P>
      <P>"My hope is to achieve the goal of caring for and protecting domestic animals by
educating school children and the wider public on the issue, with the help of
media," he said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that "by protecting animals and showing love for them, Taiwan can
enhance its image in the international community.".</P>
      <P>AnimalsTaiwan was founded four years ago with the aim of helping to stop cruelty
to domestic animals, McCormack said.</P>
      <P>It started out by rescuing dogs on the street and has since grown into an
officially recognized charity organization that attracts volunteers and
advocates animal welfare through education, he added.</P>
      <P>Currently, AT, at its rescue center in Beitou District, Taipei, provides shelter
and care for around 60 dogs and more than 10 cats.</P>
      <P>Report of animals in distress may directed to the organization's hotline at
02-2833-8820, while more information about AnimalsTaiwan is available at its Web
site at www.animalstaiwan.org.</P>
      <P>The organization said it welcomes the adoption of animals and contributions to
help fund its work.</P>

      <P>Some main streets in Taipei were crowded with colorful floats and musical bands
Saturday afternoon, drawing throngs of people to participate in the cultural
event, the "Dream Parade."</P>
      <P>The parade, held by the Dream Community Foundation, is reportedly the largest
carnival  in Asia.  This year it attracted  the participation of more than 5,000
people from 150 groups, including schools, civic groups and community
associations, which used recycled materials to make the costumes and
decorations.</P>
      <P>The parade, featuring floats, musical bands, acrobats and folk dance groups,
started from Liberty Square and ended on Ketagalan Boulevard. A party was
scheduled to be held on the boulevard until 9 p.m., according to the foundation.</P>
      <P>The annual event usually attracts not only local people but also foreign
artists.</P>
      <P>Klaus, a German keyboarder who has been in Taiwan for five years, told the
Central News Agency that he has participated in the carnival for three
consecutive years and he really enjoyed it.</P>
      <P>He and his five-member music band, the Bopomofo Blues, made a float from
recycled paper, which depicted a New Orleans style jazz band with real music
instruments.</P>
      <P>Describing the cultural atmosphere in Taipei as "nice", Klaus, however, said he
expected much more diversity.</P>
      <P>"(Taipei) could be more open to international things and not just concentrate on
Taiwan or Japan," he said.</P>
      <P>A young Brazilian woman, who has been learning Chinese and teaching samba in
Taiwan for a year and a half, said while Taiwan has a rich culture, its people
sometimes have a conservative attitude toward other cultures.</P>
      <P>"For example, Taiwanese girls would hesitate to wear this kind of costume, " she
said in standing in front of an orange and yellow colors float on which
characteristic samba costumes were displayed.</P>
      <P>The first Dream Carnival was organized in 2002 by the foundation in order to
"reignite people's passion for life."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Illegal radio stations mushrooming despite clampdown</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 18 (CNA)

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Communication Commission (NCC) has recently stepped up clampdown on
unlicensed radio stations around the country, but admitted this would only serve
to temporarily reduce the number of such stations.</P>
      <P>Chen Chuan-ping, director of the NCC Northern Regional Regulatory Department,
said Saturday that the crackdown has resulted in halving the number of illegal
radio stations in Taiwan to around 50. However, based on past experience, the
number would soon bounce back to 100, he added.</P>
      <P>Unlicensed radio has existed in Taiwan for years, with many stations being
accused of disrupting frequency assignment, airing exaggerated commercials for
so-called medical cures and making false claims about a cure-all drug.</P>
      <P>According to NCC statistics, the government has cracked down on 330 underground
radio stations over the past two years. However, some of them have set up again
in other locations, therefore, the number has remained at around 100, NCC
officials said.</P>
      <P>Chen said it takes two to three weeks to prepare for a raid on an underground
radio station. First, the transmitter must be located, then it must be
determined what the station is broadcasting, before a search warrant can be
sought, he explained. The whole process takes even longer if the station is in a
remote area, he said.</P>
      <P>Under the Telecommunications  Act,  persons found operating unlicensed radio
stations that cause interference may be subject to fines of up to NT$600,000
(US$18,400) and imprisonment of up to two years.</P>
      <P>In a raid, the equipment and devices used by an underground station are also
confiscated, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He added that increased raids on such stations are only part of efforts to root
out underground radio broadcasting, and that the measures include assisting
illegal operators to become legal.</P>
      <P>In order to address this problem, the NCC has decided to open a new bandwidth to
accommodate more than 40 private stations.</P>

      <P>The central Taiwan city of Taichung tried Saturday to set a new Guinness World
Record by gathering 918 saxophone players to give a grand musical performance.</P>
      <P>The challenge was part of the 2008 Taichung Jazz Festival, being held from Oct.
18-26 under the sponsorship of the city government.</P>
      <P>According to the organizers, the number of saxophone players they gathered for
the challenge surpassed the current world record of 900 maintained by the
Canadian city of Toronto. As a result, Taichung City will register the new
record with the Guinness World Records management group and ask for its
certification, the city government said.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said he believes the city will be more famous thanks to
the potential new world record.</P>
      <P>The 918 saxophone players performed three songs -- "Spring Breeze, " "The Moon

Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum before the end of the October.</P>
      <P>Noting that Peru which is to host the summit at its capital Lima on Nov. 22 has

      <P>Taiwan's leader has been prevented from the APEC summit ever since it was

      <P>The country has to name an economics official or a business leader to attend the

      <P>Local political analysts said Ou urged Ma to name the envoy before Chen's visit

Beijing approval on his choice.</P>
      <P>Ou said his ministry has already provided a list of candidates to President Ma
to choose the envoy. Given the fact that leading powers in the world are
concerned about the development between Taiwan and China, Ou said Taipei will
have its representatives to the United States, Japan and European Union to brief

      <P>A group of Chinese academics, including Zhang Mingqing, vice president of
China's intermediary body, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS) , are scheduled to take part in an academic symposium slated to
open in the southern county of Tainan Monday.</P>
      <P>Zhang, who was a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's State
Council before becoming the deputy head of the ARATS in 2006, is leading a
21-member Chinese academic group to attend the 2008 Cross-Strait Academic
Symposium on Mass Communications and Image Arts to be held Monday at Tainan
National University of the Arts (TNUA) located in Guantian township, Tainan
County.</P>
      <P>Zhang is taking part in the academic symposium in his capacity as dean of Xiamen
University's School of Journalism and Communication.</P>
      <P>"The symposium, which is titled Globalization and Reflection on Values, is aimed
at examining the cultural assets and unique values in Taiwan and China,
respectively, in the face of increasing globalization  and  the development  of
homogeneity  in modern societies," said Chen Ling-hui, director of the TNUA
College of Sound and Image Arts, one of the sponsors of the symposium.</P>
      <P>Zhang and other Chinese scholars will deliver speeches and share their research
papers with their Taiwanese counterparts during the one-day symposium, which is
the seventh of its kind, Chen said.</P>
      <P>They are also scheduled to make field trips to other universities in southern
Taiwan Tuesday to "hear in person more local voices from Taiwan," Chen added.</P>
      <P>On reports  that  some supporters  of the pro-independence opposition Democratic
Progressive Party will launch protest against Zhang at TNUA as ARATS President
Chen Yunlin is due to visit Taiwan at the end of this month or in early
November, Chen Ling-hui said Zhang's visit is for purely academic purposes and
has nothing to do with politics.</P>
      <P>"TNUA respects the freedom of speech of all members of Taiwan society,  but the
school hopes that the protesters will look rationally at the reality and not
interrupt the symposium, " the director said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>American expatriates in Taiwan keep close tabs on U.S.election</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/19/08  16:45:31</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As the U.S. presidential election campaign enters the final stretch, American
expatriates in Taiwan are paying close attention to the race between the
Democratic candidate Senator Barack Obama and the Republican candidate Senator
John McCain, as the outcome could change the future course of the U.S.</P>
      <P>Many Americans living outside their country plan to have their say in the
election by casting absentee ballots.</P>
      <P>In the U.S., an absentee ballot is defined as a ballot marked and mailed by the
voter in advance of the election, away from the place where he or she is
registered.</P>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) spokesman Thomas Hodges told the CNA that
although the AIT is not directly involved in the voting process, it thinks that
the estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Americans in Taiwan are keeping their fingers on
the pulse of the Nov. 4 presidential election.</P>
      <P>"Indeed, the AIT has received many inquiries recently from (U.S.) citizens in
Taiwan, and from this communication we can say that interest here in the
upcoming election is very high," Hodges said.</P>
      <P>Hodges noted that elections in the U.S. are fully conducted by the country's 50
states and its territories -- the Federal Government does not print ballots or
count votes. Therefore, Americans wishing to vote must register with the local
officials in the U.S. jurisdiction -- usually a county -- where they most
recently resided, he explained.</P>
      <P>Even if overseas Americans are already registered in a particular locality, they
still need to periodically let the county know where to mail the absentee ballot
and there is no requirement that they have to go through the AIT, according to
Hodges.</P>
      <P>"However, the AIT takes seriously its responsibility to assist," he said.</P>
      <P>In a press release on Sept. 10, the AIT stated that it "strongly encourages all
U.S.citizens on Taiwan to vote in all U.S.elections in which they are eligible.
Advanced planning is crucial for overseas voters and now is the time to act."</P>
      <P>The overseas voting process is completed in four steps -- registering,
requesting a ballot, receiving a ballot, and mailing the marked ballot, the AIT
added.</P>
      <P>It also outlined various options for mailing the completed ballots from Taiwan,
directing American expatriates to the Web site http:
//www.ait.org.tw/en/uscitizens/MailingOptions.asp.  It said Americans in Taiwan
may also submit specific questions to the AIT via the email address
VoteTaipei@state.gov.</P>
      <P>Eligible voters can also find all the relevant information on absentee voting at
www.FVAP.GOV, the official Web site of the Federal Voters Assistance Program, a
Federal organization that is charged with assisting overseas and military U.S.
voters, the AIT said.</P>
      <P>Mainly because of the Internet, it is now very easy for overseas citizens to get
the information they need and to obtain their ballots without the AIT's
involvement," Hodges said.</P>
      <P>Under U.S. regulations, a voter must request an absentee ballot at least a week
before the election. Each state's secretary of state or director of elections is
in charge of the election process, including voter registration and absentee
ballot requests.</P>
      <P>After completing the registration and absentee ballot request form, the voter is
required to return it to the election official in his or her county, who will
approve the registration and request and then mail the ballot to the voter.
After completion, the ballot has to be returned to the election official to be
counted.</P>
      <P>The regulations on absentee voting vary in different states. For example, in
Hawaii, the deadline for registration of absentee voters was Oct. 6, and for
ballot requests it is Oct. 28.</P>
      <P>Most states count absentee ballots on Election Day, although the process can
continue for several days after. In Washington D.C. and Florida the counting of
absentee ballots must be completed within 10 days after Election Day.</P>
      <P>The AIT functions as the de facto U.S.embassy in Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic relations between Taipei and Washington. 971019</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lawmakers have mixed responses to president's peace accord plan</HEADLINE>

      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and its counterpart of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) reacted differently Sunday to
comments in an Indian quarterly by President Ma Ying-jeou on the subject of a
cross-Taiwan Strait peace accord.</P>
      <P>While KMT lawmakers keenly supported Ma's initiative to ink a peace accord with
China during his term in office, DPP lawmakers were highly skeptical of such an
agreement, expressing fears that it would undermine Taiwan's independent status.</P>
      <P>In an interview published in the Oct. 18 issue of the India and Global Affairs
quarterly, Ma said he hoped to pursue a peace pact with China during his term in
office, in response to a question on whether he would see the more than 1,000
missiles targeted by Beijing on Taiwan removed during his presidency.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lu Hsueh-chang endorsed the president's efforts to make peace
with China, saying that signing a cross-strait peace agreement is the right
thing to do. But he cautioned that Ma still needs to overcome many challenges
ahead.</P>
      <P>Lu called for the legislation of a cross-strait bill and improved understanding
with China to pave the way for the clinching of the proposed peace accord.</P>
      <P>Another  KMT lawmaker,  Lin Yu-fang,  said that signing a cross-strait peace
agreement would mean a normalization of bilateral relations. If that happens,
Taiwan would enjoy greater international space and the prospects of peace in the
strait and the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world would be better
guaranteed, he added.</P>
      <P>Lin highly praised Ma for putting forward what he called a politically far-
reaching proposal.</P>
      <P>But DPP lawmaker Kuan Bi-ling opposed the idea of a cross-strait peace pact on
grounds that it would make Taiwan into an appendage of China and push Taiwan to
embark on a path of unification with China.</P>
      <P>Kuan suggested that a referendum must be held to decide whether the president
should sign such a peace accord with China, if Ma insists on doing so.</P>
      <P>Kuan's DPP fellow lawmaker, Huang Wei-cher, painted Ma's proposal as pandering
to China, at a time when Chen Yunlin, China's top negotiator  with Taiwan in his
capacity as president  of the quasi-official Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits, is slated to visit Taiwan later this year.</P>
      <P>Huang accused Ma of preparing a big gift for Chen at the cost of Taiwan people's
interests by raising the proposal without setting any pre-conditions. "This
would put the Taiwan people at great risk, " he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen is projected to visit Taiwan in late October or early November.</P>
      <P>He will hold talks with his Taiwanese counterpart, Straits Exchange Foundation
Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, on issues that include the establishment of cross-
strait regular air and sea links, crime fighting and financial supervisory
cooperation.</P>
      <P>The Chiang-Chen meeting in Taiwan would be a follow-up to their historical
meeting in Beijing in June this year, in which two accords on weekend passenger
charter flights and Taiwan's broader opening to Chinese tourists were signed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
said Sunday that the DPP is still considering whether to let ex-president Chen
Shui-bian participate in its Oct. 25 anti-government rally.</P>
      <P>Before attending a promotion news conference for the scheduled "safeguard
Taiwan" march, Tsai said that the DPP will accommodate all the different
opinions on the issue, which she said is still under discussion.</P>
      <P>Chen and his family have been under investigation on allegations of corruption
and money laundering during his presidency.</P>
      <P>"The question is not whether he should attend or not, but rather how we can make
the best arrangements," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>"I believe that all the parties concerned would be willing to sit down and
discuss this matter," she added, avoiding a direct answer to reporters'
questions on whether the DPP planned to send its pro-independence party
heavyweights to talk Chen out of attending the event.</P>
      <P>Asked whether she would personally communicate with Chen on the matter, Tsai
said "it depends on the situation."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Chih-chia, secretary-general of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) , said that "the TSU cannot walk with Chen and I hope the DPP will
communicate with him properly so that the focus of the event will not be
diverted."</P>
      <P>As to whether former President Lee Teng-hui will take part in the demonstration,
Lin said the TSU has invited Lee and he is considering the invitation but no
decision has yet been made, as Lee is scheduled to give a keynote speech at a
forum organized by the non-government Taiwan Advocates.</P>
      <P>The Oct. 25 protest is being organized by the DPP in cooperation with the TSU
and pro-independence groups such as Taiwan Society and Taiwan Professors
Association, amid plans for a visit to Taiwan by Chen Yunlin, president of
China's semi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>The main objective of the planned demonstration is to reject the "one-China
market, the downgrading of Taiwan's sovereignty and an incompetent government,"
according to the organizers.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the enormous insecurity of Taiwan's people comes from Ma's handling of
issues such as sovereignty, the economy, the public's livelihood and food
safety.</P>
      <P>It is time for the general public to take to the streets and express their deep
discontent and resentment over the government's policies, as the DPPs warnings
have all fallen on deaf ears, she added.</P>
      <P>The opposition has been accusing Ma of sacrificing Taiwan's sovereignty by
adopting a "modus vivendi" approach that advocates a "diplomatic  truce"  with
China and introducing  a series  of cross-strait liberalization measures such as
direct weekend air links and raising the cap on China-bound investment.</P>

      <P>There will be huge controversy in the country if President Ma Ying-jeou proceeds
with talks on a peace accord with China, given that people in Taiwan have very
little confidence in him, opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen warned Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Many people in Taiwan have little confidence in Ma's handling of cross-Taiwan
Strait affairs, and if he is takes the lead to sign a peace accord with China, I
believe there will be great controversy in the society," Tsai said, as she
prepared to attend a promotion event for the DPP's planned Oct. 25 anti-
government march.</P>
      <P>In an interview published in the Oct. 18 edition of the Indian quarterly India
and Global Affairs, Ma said that he hoped to ink a cross-Taiwan Strait peace
accord with China during his term of office.</P>
      <P>He stressed, however, that there is no timetable for setting up a mechanism  on
military confidence-building  or signing a peace agreement between Taipei and
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Ma, who took office May 20, said in the August interview that weekend chartered
flight services and allowing more Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan were the top
priorities for his administration and that they were achieved in July.</P>
      <P>The next step is to push for direct air and sea links, comprehensive
normalization of cross-strait economic relations and then Taiwan's international
participation and a peace agreement, he added.</P>
      <P>Tsai contended that a peace accord between Taiwan and China should be dealt with
by someone who has the people's trust.</P>
      <P>Negotiating or signing any peace accord will definitely involve the questions of
sovereignty and national security, Tsai said. "If these two questions cannot be
properly addressed, a peace accord will harm the country."</P>
      <P>Tsai  said the government's  handling  of issues  such as sovereignty, the
economy, the public's livelihood and food safety indicates that Ma's
administration "is not resolute and lacks ability."</P>
      <P>She urged the general public to participate in the Oct. 25 rally to express
their discontent with the government.</P>
      <P>The opposition has accused Ma of sacrificing Taiwan's sovereignty by adopting a
"modus vivendi" approach that advocates a "diplomatic truce"  with China and
introducing  a series  of cross-strait liberalization measures.</P>
      <P>These measures include launching nonstop cross-strait charter flights on
weekends, opening up Taiwan to more Chinese tourists, allowing cross-strait
currency trading, and raising the cap on China-bound investment by local
enterprises from 40 percent to 60 percent of their net worth.</P>
      <P>The opposition is also unsatisfied with what it alleges is the Ma
administration's failure to take a tough stance toward China in dealing with the
issue of melamine-tainted food imported from China.</P>

      <P>A Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official ruled out Sunday the possibility of
top negotiators from across the Taiwan Strait talking about the prospects of
signing a peace accord between Taiwan and China, during their upcoming meeting
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"It has been decided that no political issues will be raised during the upcoming
meeting between Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taipei-based  quasi-official
intermediary body Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Chen Yunlin, president
of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS), or among members of their respective organizations," said Fu Don-cheng,
a MAC vice chairman.</P>
      <P>Fu made the statement to the media after speaking at a workshop organized by
Minchuan University in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The workshop, held at the National Taiwan University Alumni Association
building, focused on the development of cross-strait relations and the
implications of Chen Yunlin's planned visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin and his group are expected to visit Taiwan at the end of this month

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said recently during an interview with India and Global

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior citizens center built with a fund of US$200,000 provided by Simply
Help, a foundation formed by Taiwanese expatriates in the United States, opened
in Panama Saturday with a grand ceremony.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening ceremony, Panamanian first lady Vivian Fernandez de
Torrijos expressed her gratitude to the foundation and the Embassy of the
Republic of China in Panama for their help with the construction of the center,
which has been named Hogar de San Antonio.</P>
      <P>Tina Bow, founder of the California-based foundation, said the construction
project was initiated last January after the foundation discovered during a
visit to Panama that there was a severe shortage of senior nursing homes in the
country.</P>
      <P>Almost at the same time, Panamanian Archbishop Jose Dimas Cedeno expressed the
wish to donate to the government a plot of land belonging to his church in Los
Santos City in Las Tablas Province and asked that the land be used for the well-
being of the public, Bow related.</P>
      <P>Bow attributed the completion of the project partly to the donation of
US$200,000 by Lee Chin-fu, a member of the Simply Help foundation.</P>
      <P>The senior center, occupying an area of 9,000 square meters, is equipped with a
kitchen, fitness rooms and suites. It currently has the capacity to accommodate
30 elderly people and so far there are five already in place.</P>
      <P>Bow said only the first stage of the project has been completed and she called
for Taiwanese expatriates and businessmen in the Central American country to
continue making donations to help with the next phase of the work so that the
center would be able to accommodate more senior citizens.</P>
      <P>The archbishop described the accomplishment as a "miracle," while the first lady
echoed his view saying that the inauguration of the center helped to realize the
dream of many elderly people to have a place to live for the rest of their
lives.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Torrijios said that the then-ROC ambassador to Panama, Hou Ping-fu, told
her that the foundation had originally planned to donate the US$200,000 to
purchase computers for impoverished people in Panama or to build homes for the
elderly.</P>
      <P>The Panamanian government later decided to use the money to build asenior
citizens home, in view of the inadequate care of the elderly in the country's
remote and impoverished areas.</P>
      <P>During the ceremony, the Simply Help foundation also donated an additional
US$65,000 to the senior citizens center, which was accepted by Domingo
Dominguez, head of the center, to help fund its expansion.</P>

      <P>Building on the success of its previous performances at an international

      <P>The Hebei Province-based chemical company that exported a melamine-tainted
baking ingredient to Taiwan said Sunday that it has begun investigating how the
leavening agent came to be contaminated with the toxic industrial chemical.</P>
      <P>A sales manager of the Xinji Huaer Chemical Co. in Xinji township of Hebei
Province's Shijiazhuang City, identified as Ding Qinyan, was summoned to the
Xinji town hall Sunday afternoon to brief "the people upstairs" on the matter,
according to a Huaer staff member.</P>
      <P>The shock  wave  reached  Huaer  Saturday  after  Taiwan's Cabinet-level
Department of Health (DOH) convened a news conference earlier in the day, saying
that ammonium bicarbonate imported by Taiwan's Sesoda Corp. from Xinji Huaer
Chemical Co. and the Fuzhou City-based Yaolong Chemical Industry Group, was
found to be tainted with melamine.</P>
      <P>Deputy DOH Minister Cheng Shou-hsia said at the news conference that the
melamine content in the ammonium bicarbonate, used as leavening agent in the
food industry, was as high as 70 parts per million (ppm) to 300 ppm.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the DOH has halted the distribution of the tainted product around
Taiwan and will soon seize all ammonium bicarbonate imported from the Chinese
company.</P>
      <P>The DOH has also passed this information on to the World Health Organization's
International Food Safety Authorities Network, Cheng added.</P>
      <P>The DOH announced Friday night a ban on all imports of ammonium bicarbonate from
China, adding it to the list of food imports from China already banned -- milk
powder, creamers and vegetable-based proteins.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DOH also alerted the local health and food safety authorities in
the 12 Taiwanese cities and counties where the tainted leavening agent had been
distributed,  and ordered a thorough investigation and seizure of the product.</P>
      <P>Ammonium bicarbonate is listed as a legal food additive in the Standard
Regulating Scope and Application of Food Additives, Cheng said, adding that it
is commonly used to lighten and soften bread, cookies, biscuits, cream puffs and
Chinese fried bread sticks.</P>
      <P>"Although it is allowed as an additive in food products, adding harmful
substances to it is prohibited," Cheng stressed.</P>
      <P>"Melamine is not a food additive, so we have no way of knowing in what products
it will show up," he said, adding that instituting controls at the food
production source is the most important food safety measure.</P>

      <P>The second round of negotiations between the intermediary bodies on the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait will proceed on an equal footing and with no
compromise of Taiwan's sovereignty, a senior official of the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Fu Don-cheng, a MAC vice chairman, made the remarks at a workshop held by
Minchuan University to discuss the implications of an upcoming meeting in Taipei
between Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , and his Taiwan counterpart, Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin- kung.</P>
      <P>Fu said that the meeting symbolizes the equal status of the two sides, with
Taiwan and China both facing up to the political reality that the other exists
and adopting a non-negating attitude on the issue.</P>
      <P>On this basis, he emphasized, Taiwan's national dignity and security "will not
be damaged" during the meeting.</P>
      <P>The meeting will also mark a new era of pragmatic cross-strait negotiations, Fu
added.</P>
      <P>The talks  will  ensure  the functioning  of institutional negotiation
mechanisms between the both sides, which is important in light of the enhanced
two-way exchanges in many spheres, he said.</P>
      <P>Any disputes that occur during cross-strait exchanges can be better addressed
within such a framework, Fu said.</P>
      <P>He further expressed the view that the normalization of relations between the
two sides will enhance the prospects of cross-strait peace, which in turn would
contribute to regional security and stability.</P>
      <P>In their scheduled talks in Taipei in late October or early November, Chiang and
Chen are expected to discuss issues that would include the establishment of
direct cargo charter flights and shipping links, expansion of weekend passenger

      <P>However, Chen's visit has given rise to concerns in some quarters, with the main

      <P>Responding to the controversy over his planned appearance at an anti-China
protest march to be held by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , former
President Chen Shui-bian promised Sunday that he will not give any speeches at
the rally and will fully adhere to DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen's directives on
the matter.</P>
      <P>Although his plan to take part in the DPP-sponsored demonstration Oct. 25 in
Taipei has drawn objections from some participants, Chen gave the organizers the
assurance that he will not steal the show or try to shift the focus of the
protest by making any speeches at the event.</P>
      <P>Chen made the comments while addressing a meeting in Taipei with his supporters
from his home county of Tainan in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Two opposition parties -- the DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) as well
as several pro-Taiwan independence groups have decided to jointly organize the
protest to demonstrate their anger over harmful substandard  food imports from
China and President Ma Ying-jeou's China-leaning policies, ahead of a visit to
Taiwan in a few weeks by China's top negotiator with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The former president's decision to join the Oct. 25 anti-China protest march has
met with opposition because he and his family members are being investigated on
suspicion of corruption and money-laundering while he was in office.</P>
      <P>Tsai said earlier the same day that all opinions will be considered before a
decision is made on whether Chen should attend the protest.</P>
      <P>"Chen's attendance is still being arranged and the opinions of the party's
senior members and supporters will be taken into account, " Tsai told a news
conference that was also attended by several senior DPP members such as former
Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen and TSU Secretary-General Lin Jih-jia.</P>
      <P>Lin was opposed to Chen's appearance in the protest march, while Yao argued that

prices' daily drop limit -- from 7 percent to 3.5 percent -- for one week

nomination of candidates for next year's local government elections, from late
October to November, to deal with the impact of an imminent visit to Taiwan by a
Beijing official, a DPP official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Su Jia-chyuan, a former DPP lawmaker and former interior minister in the
previous DPP administration, made the remarks in his capacity as head of the
party's strategic task force responsible for the city and county chief elections
slated for late next year.</P>
      <P>"The DPP has decided to postpone the nomination of the first batch of its
candidates for the elections in view of the upcoming visit by Chen Yunlin, and
will set a date, depending on the consequences of Chen's visit," Su said.</P>
      <P>Chen is president of the quasi-official Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits and serves as China's top liaison with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He is expected to visit Taiwan in late October or early November for talks with
his Taiwanese counterpart --  Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-
kung --  in a second round of negotiations on two-way exchanges as a follow-up
to their historic first meeting in June in Beijing.</P>
      <P>This time around, the DPP will field its candidates for the 2009 local
government chief elections through internal consultations instead of a primary
vote within the party, in a bid to maximize its chances of victory in the polls.</P>
      <P>The main opposition party is trying hard to regain it footing at the local
government level as a first step toward recapturing the central government,
after its humiliating defeat in the presidential election in March this year.</P>
      <P>The DPP and several pro-independence groups will stage a protest march Oct. 25
in Taipei in a concerted move to voice their anger against China and what they
called pro-China policies adopted by the administration of President Ma Ying-
jeou.</P>

      <P>Shin Kong Mitsukoshi,  the largest department store chain in Taiwan, announced
Sunday that four of its stores have established a breastfeeding area for mothers
who wish to nurse their babies.</P>
      <P>The announcement was made at a news conference organized by the Breastfeeding
Association of Taiwan as part of efforts to promote breastfeeding in public
places.</P>
      <P>In support of the drive, Shin Kong Mitsukoshi said that mothers are welcome to
breastfeed their babies at public areas inside the designated four stores. It
has also instructed its employees to render any necessary assistance and avoid
disturbing women who are breastfeeding their babies in its stores.</P>
      <P>During the news conference, ruling Kuomintang Legislator Hsu Shao-ping urged the
Department of Health (DOH) to draft a bill that would give mothers the legal
right to breastfeed their babies in public places, and submit the draft to the
Legislative Yuan for review.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tien Chiu-chin also called on
the government to formulate a policy to prevent dismissal of and discrimination
against breastfeeding women in the workplace. Currently, it is very difficult
for many women to return to work while they are still breastfeeding, Tien added.</P>
      <P>Citing an incident that occurred three years ago when a woman who was
breastfeeing her baby was expelled from the Taipei Story House, an arts
exhibition hall in the city, Chen Yi-chun, director of the association, said
that since then the group has been pushing for the passage of legislation to
protect the right of women to breastfeed in public.</P>
      <P>In central and southern Taiwan, it is more common to see women breastfeeding
their babies in public, as people in these areas generally take that right for
granted, compared with those in northern Taiwan, a DOH official, Huang Wei-kang,
said, citing a recent survey.</P>
      <P>A breastfeeding mother, Pan Juo-lin, said that it is normal for a mother to feed
her baby whenever he is hungry, adding that the government  should  create  a
more  friendly  environment  for breastfeeding mothers and babies.</P>

      <P>More than 200 tons of a melamine-tainted leavening agent imported from China had
been sold in the domestic market, a Department of Health (DOH) official said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>DOH spokesman Wang Je-chau told a news conference that Taiwan's Sesoda Corp.
imported a total of 469 tons of ammonium bicarbonate from two Chinese companies
which were found to contain melamine, an industrial chemical banned from being
used as a food additive, and more than 200 tons of the baking ingredient had
been sold to local distributors.</P>
      <P>According to information provided by Sesoda Corp., only a small portion of the
melamine-tainted leavening agent had been sold to food processors. But Wang said
the DOH is still checking the verity of Sesoda's information.</P>
      <P>One of the food processors who had purchased ammonium bicarbonate from Sesoda
was identified as Hunya Foods Co.. Wang said Hunya was known to have bought 700
kilograms of the tainted leavening agent and 670 kg. had been used and the
remaining 30 kg had been sealed off.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Wang went on, it has become clear that the melamine Kaohsiung health
officials found in two flavors of Hunya-made biscuits last week could be traced
to the tainted baking ingredient supplied by Sesoda Corp. All of those
substandard baked products have since been pulled from store shelves, Wang
added.</P>
      <P>Ammonium bicarbonate is listed as a legal food additive in the Standard
Regulating Scope and Application of Food Additives. It is commonly used to
lighten and soften bread, cookies, biscuits, cream puffs and Chinese fried bread
sticks.</P>
      <P>The DOH has banned imports of ammonium bicarbonate from China after laboratory
tests showed that the leavening agent imported by Sesoda from China contained 70
to 300 parts per million (ppm) of melamine, a chemical used to make plastics or
fertilizers that should never be used as a food additive.</P>
      <P>Taiwan already banned milk powder,  non-dairy creamers and vegetable-based

    <HEADLINE>FSC defends decision to continue restricting share prices decline</HEADLINE>

      <P>The measure to restrict share prices from falling more than 3.5 percent during a
single trading session on the local stock exchange has proved to be effective to
stabilize investor confidence amid the global financial turmoil, a senior
official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Finance Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman Gordon Chen made the remarks after
the Executive Yuan decided earlier in the day that the temporary limit-down
trimming measure for share prices will remain in place until Oct. 24.</P>
      <P>In an effort to mitigate volatility on the local bourse amid the global
financial crisis, the FSC announced a decision last Sunday to halve local share
prices' daily drop limit -- from 7 percent to 3.5 percent -- for one week
starting Oct. 13.</P>
      <P>The measure was to have expired Oct. 17. As the global stock markets remained
highly volatile over the past week, the FSC said Friday it would decide Sunday
whether to extend the 3.5 percent floor limit for another week.</P>
      <P>Over the past week, Chen said, the weighted Taiwan stock index dropped only 3.3
percent, far smaller than declines in neighboring Asian countries.</P>
      <P>For instance, Singapore stocks plunged 10.6 percent between Oct.10 and Oct.17,
compared to South Korea's 8.82 percent decline, Hong Kong's 8.7 percent fall,
Shanghai's 6.9 percent slide and Japan's 5.06 percent dive.</P>
      <P>"The figures indicated that our limit-down trimming measure has helped stabilize
investor confidence and maintain market stability," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>As the U.S. stock exchanges remained highly volatile last Friday, Chen said the
Executive Yuan decided to extend the trimming measures for another week.</P>
      <P>When the one-week extension expires Oct. 24, Chen said, the FSC has been
authorized to decide on its own whether to stop or continue such a discretionary
measure.</P>
      <P>As to whether the measure had adversely affected stock trading volume or market
fluidity, Chen said the FSC will keep a close watch on market developments.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee Chi-hsien, director-general of the Securities and Futures Bureau
under the FSC, told CNA Sunday that if no major events occur in the coming week
and if the New York Stock Exchange stops fluctuating drastically and gradually
stabilizes, the temporary limit-down trimming measure will not be extended
again.</P>
      <P>Local shares normally are not allowed to rise or fall by more than 7 percent in
any trading session. The 7 percent limit up has remained unchanged amid the
current financial volatility.</P>

      <P>The deputy head of China's quasi-official intermediary body with Taiwan arrived
in the southern Taiwanese city of Tainan Sunday to attend a symposium on mass
communications aimed at promoting bilateral academic exchanges.</P>
      <P>Zhang Mingqing, vice chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) , maintained a low profile and refrained from answering
sensitive issues posed by local journalists after his arrival at Kaohsiung
International Airport in southern Taiwan. He just said this is his third visit
to the island.</P>
      <P>Zhang, accompanied by more than 20 Chinese media experts and scholars, will
attend the 2008 Cross-Strait Academic Symposium on Mass Communications and Image
Arts to be held Monday at Tainan National University of the Arts (TNUA) located
in Guantian township, Tainan County.</P>
      <P>According to TNUA sources, Zhang is visiting Taiwan in his capacity as dean of
Xiamen University's School of Journalism and Communication in the southeastern
Chinese province of Fujian which lies close to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Zhang and his delegation were greeted only by representatives of TNUA and a
local travel association. No Taiwanese officials showed up to greet them at the
airport.</P>
      <P>Airport security was tight as pro-independence activists had threatened to
demonstrate against China's exports of substandard dairy products and food
ingredients to Taiwan and its relentless suppression of Taiwan in the
international community.</P>
      <P>But pro-independence activists didn't show up at the airport. They instead
gathered in front of a hotel in Tainan City where Zhang and other Chinese
visitors will stay during their visit.</P>
      <P>To shield the Chinese guests from encountering the protesters, organizers of the
symposium arranged for them to change their itinerary several times after their
arrival. The protesters, led by Wang Ting-yu, a Tainan city councilor, suspended
their demonstration after failing to see their protest target at several of the
delegation's originally picked stopover venues.</P>
      <P>Wang said they will not be daunted by Sunday's failure to meet Zhang and that
they will continue to try to let Zhang understand during his stay that Taiwan is
not part of China and that the Beijing leadership should apologize for Chinese
companies' sales of tainted or substandard foodstuffs, such as melamine-tainted
milk powder, to Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The Taipei Zoo said Monday that it will hold a "panda conservation" postcard
design competition as part of activities to mark the upcoming arrival of two
giant pandas presented by Beijing as a gift to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Entries,  which will be accepted between Nov. 1-14,  should encompass the theme
of conservation of pandas and Taiwan's indigenous animals, according to the zoo.</P>
      <P>Jason Yeh, director of the zoo, said that the competition is being held with the
aim of helping the Taiwan public better understand "the significance of
conservation" which underlies the pandas' arrival.</P>

students, high school students, and members of the general public -- with
contestants restricted to one entry, the zoo said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Manila envoy seeks clemency for Filipina sentenced to death in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO) in Taipei has appealed to Taiwan
judicial authorities clemency for a Philippine woman who was sentenced to death
by the Kaohsiung District Court Oct. 1.</P>
      <P>The court sentenced Nemencia Armia to death for the stabbing her job broker to
death in September last year. Armia was caught on closed circuit television
disposing of the broker's body in a garbage bag. She also made several
withdrawals to the tune of over NT$660,000 (US$20,200) using the broker's ATM
card.</P>
      <P>Antonio Basilio, managing director of the MECO, the Philippines' de facto
embassy in Taiwan, in a statement expressed his regret over the ruling and the
hope that the courts would overturn the ruling or reduce the sentence.</P>
      <P>The Philippine representative said that his office has regularly dispatched
personnel to visit Armia in jail to comfort her and has cooperated closely with
her lawyers to ensure that her legal rights are protected.</P>
      <P>Armia's lawyers have filed an appeal with the Taiwan High Court.</P>
      <P>The MECO is also helping Armia's family members to obtain visas to visit Taiwan,
and her brother and sister-in-law are slated to arrive sometime this week,
according tothe statement.</P>
      <P>The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs had said in Manila earlier that
because of the government's one-China policy, it had no way of assisting in the
case.</P>
      <P>The Philippines, a predominantly Catholic country, abolished the death penalty
in 2006. Its representative offices have actively assisted Philippine nationals
on death row in countries around the world, with President Gloria Arroyo even
stepping in on several occasions to appeal for clemency.</P>
      <P>The efforts have born fruit, with many Philippine citizens on death row having
their sentences reduced.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Food company recalls products containing China-made leavening agent</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
10/20/08  16:12:47

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hunya Foods Co. announced Friday that it has recalled all its products
containing the leavening agent ammonium bicarbonate imported by Sesoda Corp.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after the Department of Health (DOH) revealed at a news
conference Saturday that ammonium bicarbonate imported by Sesoda from the Hebei
Province-based Huaer Chemical Co. was found to be tainted with melamine.</P>
      <P>The department said that it had stopped the distribution of the contaminated
product around Taiwan and would soon seize all ammonium bicarbonate imported
from the mainland Chinese company.</P>
      <P>Kuo Cheng-er, a spokesman for Hunya, one of Taiwan's leading food manufacturers,
said that the products have been removed from store shelves and will be
destroyed in line with the DOH's decision.</P>
      <P>Noting that ammonium bicarbonate has been used in the baked goods industry in
Taiwan for years with the DOH's consent, Kuo said that this case is "not a
problem related to the ingredient itself, but instead the source of the
ingredient."</P>
      <P>Kuo said that as melamine -- an industrial chemical used in the manufacture of
plastic products -- is much more expensive than ammonium bicarbonate, it would
not make sense for food manufacturers to add it as a way of illicitly cutting
costs.</P>
      <P>The ammonium bicarbonate in question was therefore probably inadvertently
contaminated during the production process, he said, adding that the Chinese
company is now investigating the source of the contamination.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that following the recall, Hunya will revise the formula for making the
products in question before restocking store shelves, in order to allay people's
concerns. This is expected to cost the company between NT$20 million
(US$615,000) and NT$30 million (per year), he added.</P>
      <P>The spokesman stressed that the company views food safety as being of the
highest importance, noting that it has received FGMP, HACCP, ISO9001 and
ISO14001 certifications from the government.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo,  the unfolding melamine scandal has led regulators, businesses
and the general public to re-evaluate food safety testing and standards, and he
expressed the hope that this will be a positive development for the industry.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The visiting deputy head of China's quasi-official  negotiating  body with
Taiwan described  angry, banner-waving protesters who told him to "get lost" and
"go back to China on Monday as greeting him in an "especially warm way."</P>
      <P>Zhang  Mingqing,  vice  president  of  the  Beijing-based quasi-official
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), has been followed
and heckled by pro-independence activists since his arrival at Kaohsiung
International Airport Sunday evening.</P>
      <P>Zhang, attending an academic seminar at the Guantian, Tainan County-based Tainan
National University of the Arts (TNUA) , was met with protests in front of the
university Monday morning.</P>
      <P>He also faced two National Cheng Kung University students at the seminar, who
shouted at him, "Taiwan is independent and not a part of China" and displayed a
related banner.</P>
      <P>The two were then removed from the seminar by security personnel.</P>
      <P>Before delivering his speech to the seminar in his capacity as dean of the
School of Journalism and Communication of Xiamen University in the southeastern
Chinese province of Fujian, Zhang described the protesters as "especially warm
people" who "greeted me in an especially warm way."</P>
      <P>"I learned a lot from these people, " Zhang said of the protesters, who were led
by Tainan City Councilor Wang Ting-yu from the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party.</P>
      <P>Asked by the Central  News Agency how he felt about the demonstrators "following
him like a shadow and protesting" wherever he goes during his stay in Taiwan,
Zhang replied, "Tagore once said, 'I may disagree with your views, but I will
lay down my life to defend your right to express your views, " referring to
early 20th century Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the protests, university authorities decided Monday to cancel all
the public appearances by Zhang in Taiwan over the next two days.</P>
      <P>Although Zhang was in Taiwan for the seminar, he was inevitably asked about the
planned and much-talked about visit to Taiwan by ARATS President Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>Zhang said negotiations are still needed between ARATS and its Taiwan
counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , to work out a concrete
timetable for the visit.</P>
      <P>Pundits and opposition politicians have opposed Chen's planned visit or expanded
contacts with China in part because of a recent food safety scare over melamine-
contaminated milk powder and other ingredients imported from China.</P>
      <P>They have also strongly criticized President Ma Ying-jeou's overtures to China
as not being reciprocated by Beijing and as compromising Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Zhang spoke at Monday's seminar on the development of the media and
mass communications industry across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He said that after the two sides relaxed restrictions on cross-strait exchanges,
it has become easier for Taiwan journalists to cover news in China, but the
Chinese reporters have faced "restrictions after restrictions" to do so.</P>
      <P>"There was an absence of equality across the strait in terms of journalism
environment of the two sides," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Zhang is heading a delegation of 20 Chinese media experts and academics in
Tainan to attend the 2008 Cross-Strait  Academic Symposium on Mass
Communications and Image Arts organized by TNUA slated for Monday and Tuesday.</P>

      <P>An international tourist hotel will be built at Fishermen's Wharf in Danshuei to
further enhance the appeal of the port, which is already one of the top tourist
attractions in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei signed a contract with Lih Pao
Construction Co., Ltd. Chairman Wu Pao-tien Monday under which the conglomerate
will construct and manage the hotel on a BOT (build-operate-transfer) basis.</P>
      <P>Lih Pao will invest some NT$2 billion (US$61.54 million) in the property, to be
called the Danshuei Fishermen's Wharf Hotel, which will feature 169 rooms, a
banquet hall, several restaurants, a 100-meter tall tower and a street of arts
shops, Wu said.</P>
      <P>"If the group gets the building licenses next year, the Danshuei Fishermen's
Wharf Hotel is expected to be completed by 2012 at the earliest," Wu said.</P>

which carries a price tag of NT$100 million on its own, will provide tourists
with a 360-degree panorama view of the Danshuei Port and the nearby sea and
mountains.</P>
      <P>The Danshuei Fishermen's Wharf Hotel will likely be the highest end property
operated by Lih Pao, with room prices starting from NT$7,000 per night, Chen

      <P>The government will help those who have suffered health problems because of
tainted food imports from China request compensation from Beijing through the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung pledged
Monday.</P>
      <P>Chiu said at a committee meeting in the Legislative Yuan that the Cabinet-level
Consumer Protection Commission (CPC) will make the appeals for compensation
through the SEF and its Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>"At present, the Consumer Protection Commission has received 80 inquiries and is
handling three cases of people with kidney stones (caused by China-made tainted
dairy products) for compensation from China, " Chiu noted.</P>
      <P>He said the SEF may address the issue of compensation with ARATS President Chen
Yunlin, during his upcoming visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks, the toxic chemical melamine has been found in imported dairy
products, creamers and vegetable-based proteins from China, causing a general
panic among consumers.</P>
      <P>Over the weekend, the DOH announced that leavening agent ammonium bicarbonate
imported from China, used to soften and lighten doughs, was also found to
contain 70 to 300 ppm (parts per million) of melamine.</P>
      <P>The agency indicated that a local company had imported a total of 469 tons of
the contaminated ammonium bicarbonate since the beginning of the year, of which
local health authorities have seized about 210 tons.</P>
      <P>The DOH is still investigating the whereabouts of the remaining ammonium
bicarbonate, and didn't rule out the possibility that some of it has already
been consumed as part of processed foods, such as cookies and breads.</P>
      <P>Chiu tried to ease consumers' worries, however, saying, "ammonium bicarbonate is
a legal food additive, and the quantity added into foods is very small."</P>
      <P>According to DOH Deputy Minister Cheng Shou-hsia, a number of products examined
thus far that might contain the contaminated leavening agent, including 80 kinds
of cookies and 23 breads, have tested negative for melamine.</P>
      <P>Only two fried dough sticks examined by the Bureau of Food and Drug Analysis
under the DOH were found to contain a very small amount of the toxic chemical,
and Cheng said the sale of tainted fried dough sticks had been prohibited.</P>
      <P>Cheng added that his agency has demanded local health bureaus to help bakeries
and restaurants use other leavening agents, such as baking powder and baking
soda, instead of ammonium bicarbonate.</P>
      <P>"We still do not know how melamine came to be in the leavening agent. We have
demanded China to investigate, " said Cheng at a press conference.</P>
      <P>The DOH announced a ban on all imports of ammonium bicarbonate from China last
week, adding it to list of food imports from China already banned, including
milk powder, creamers and vegetable-based proteins.</P>
      <P>With the recent spate of imported Chinese food ingredients testing positive for
melamine, some legislators have advocated having the countries of origin of all
of a processed food's ingredients listed on its package.</P>
      <P>Chiu said he will refer the suggestion to the Ministry of Economic  Affairs,
but noted that under current  world trade regulations, most products are only
required to label the country where the finished product was made.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Monday that former
President Chen Shui-bien is welcome to join its protest march on Oct. 25, after
Chen promised not to make any public speeches, according to DPP sources.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, in a meeting with DPP Legislator Ker Chien-ming and
Huang Ching-lin, chief of the DPP Taipei City chapter office, reportedly did not
object to Chen taking part in the demonstration.</P>
      <P>According to sources who were also present at the meeting, Tsai said that she
welcomes everyone's participation in the upcoming protest, whether they are from
the "pan-blue alliance" of the ruling Kuomintang and its ally the People's First
Party, or from any other party.</P>
      <P>The meeting was held after Ker and Huang paid a call on Chen earlier in the day
amid concerns among some party members that the former president,  who is being

distraction from the main purpose of the protest.</P>
      <P>Ker, the chief convener of the DPP legislative caucus, said he and Huang talked
with Chen about the upcoming demonstration, which will be held under the theme
"Anti-Black Heart; Protecting Taiwan's Sovereignty."</P>
      <P>Chen, who is embroiled in a money-laundering scandal, said publicly the previous
day that he wants to join the protest against China's shipment of substandard
goods to Taiwan and its suppression of Taiwan in the international community.</P>
      <P>Ker said Chen will join the demonstration at the Dinghao commercial circle on
the Zhongxiao East Road, from where he will walk toward Ketagalan Boulevard in
front of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chen assured Ker and Huang that he will not stray from the parade, neither will
he give any public addresses or talk about his current problems. Chen said he
will follow the organizers' guidelines and will protest against President Ma
Ying-jeou and China, Ker related.</P>
      <P>Ker said he believes Chen's participation may serve to encourage more people to
join the protest march.</P>
      <P>The Oct. 25 protest was jointly organized by the opposition parties,  including
the Taiwan Solidarity  Union,  and several pro-Taiwan independence groups to
demonstrate their anger over harmful substandard food imports from China and
what they called President Ma's China-leaning policies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Almost 90 percent of office workers in Taiwan have lost money in financial
markets over the last six months due to the collapse of global share prices, the
results of a recent survey indicated.</P>
      <P>According to a survey released Monday by 1111 Job Bank, an online employment
broker, 60 percent of the respondents held various types of financial investment
assets in the past six months, with roughly 89 percent of that number reporting
losses.</P>
      <P>An average loss of NT$262,000 (US$7,900) was incurred during the period, which
amounted to 31 percent of their total investment, the survey found.</P>
      <P>Among the types of investments, mutual funds and stocks accounted for the
biggest shares,  at 42.83 percent and 30.26 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>The poll also showed that some 45 percent of those who suffered losses have
shifted to a more conservative investment strategy.</P>
      <P>The shrinking of assets among investors is due to the volatile global investment
environment aggravated by the recent bankruptcy of major American financial
institutions, said Ryan Wu, the operating chief of the job bank.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 84 percent of office workers said they feel dejected in the face of
the financial storm and fear that the business climate might worsen, according
to the survey.</P>
      <P>Adding to employees' financial woes, salary or bonus cuts were recorded among 26
percent of the respondents, while another 19 percent face possible layoffs and
dismissals or have already lost their jobs, the poll showed.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,577 valid responses were collected in the Oct. 3-16 survey, which
had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Monday that the first death from
influenza this year was reported last week in southern Taiwan, and it urged
people at high risk to get free flu vaccines before the end of Nov.</P>
      <P>According to CDC Deputy Minister Lin Ting, the patient was a 75-year-old woman
who fell ill on Oct. 13 and died three days later of influenza with the
complication of pneumonia.</P>
      <P>"It is a pity that the woman did not get a free flu shot, " said Lin, noting
that the first influenza death occurred this year much earlier than in previous
years.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the flu epidemic generally begins in October, and peaks around the
Christmas holidays, before receding in February.</P>
      <P>"Vaccination  is still the most efficient  way to prevent influenza," said Lin
in a telephone interview. He urged people to get inoculated as soon as possible,
as it takes two weeks for the vaccine to become effective.</P>
      <P>The CDC this year provided 3.2 million free doses of flu vaccine for citizens
over the age of 65 years, children between six months and three years old, and
first to fourth grade elementary school students.</P>
      <P>In addition, residents and workers at nursing homes, patients suffering from
rare diseases or injuries, disease prevention and control personnel, workers in
the poultry and livestock industries, and animal disease control and prevention
personnel are also entitled to receive the vaccine free of cost.</P>
      <P>Since Oct. 1 when the free inoculation program began, 1.21 million people have
been vaccinated, Lin said.</P>
      <P>If there are any doses left over after Nov. 30 when the program expires, they
will be made available to other citizens, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's ability to hold on to at least two of its 23 diplomatic allies before
and after President Ma Ying-jeou's inauguration could serve as an indication
that hisdiplomatic truce" approach is effective, a ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
official said Monday.</P>
      <P>"As far as we know, the 'diplomatic truce' has been effective, " Chang Jung-kung
said.If we continued the old (scorched-earth) diplomatic measure, we would have
immediately lost two allies or had to put in more resources (to keep them).</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks in a consultation meeting on the effect of the
'diplomatic truceon promoting international diplomacy from the cross-Taiwan
Strait relations prospective, held by Control Yuan members Ger Yeong-kuang and
Hung Chao-nan.</P>
      <P>Chang contended that based on past experience, with Taiwan's diplomatic and
international  space continuing to shrink,  the diplomatic truce was an approach
that needed to be adopted.</P>
      <P>Chang would not identify, however, the two allies that he felt were successfully
prevented from switching diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China by Ma's
government.</P>
      <P>It has been widely speculated that Paraguay, Taiwan's only ally in South
America, called off its plan to establish formal relations with China, in large
part due to Ma's diplomatic truce approach.</P>
      <P>Although our highest goals might not be achieved through the results of our
negotiations with China, it will still be better than the current situation and
win Taiwan more international support, " Chang said.</P>
      <P>He cited as examples U.S. President George W. Bush's open praise on July 30,
Aug. 7 and Aug. 10 for the improved cross-Taiwan Strait relations between Taiwan
and China since Ma took office.</P>
      <P>Since assuming the presidency May 20, Ma has pursued amodus vivendidiplomatic
strategy, which is trying to set aside Taipei's differences with Beijing to find
a mutually beneficial equilibrium.</P>
      <P>He has also sought adiplomatic truceto end a longstanding tug-of-war with China
over each other's allies and carve out a greater international presence for
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The lack of a tangible response to the strategy from Beijing, however, has
sparked criticism and suspicions that Ma's diplomatic approach is merely wishful
thinking.</P>
      <P>Lai I-chung, former director of the Democratic Progressive Party's Department of
Chinese Affairs, argued that other than the number of diplomatic allies,
relations with countries without diplomatic relations,  the level and
designation of Taiwan in international  organizations,  and security cooperation
are all important indicators for whether a "diplomatic truce" will work.</P>
      <P>He said he was uncertain whether the diplomatic truce was a means to push ahead
with cross-strait reconciliation or a result that would emerge only after the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait reconcile?</P>
      <P>If the importance of cross-strait relations were magnified to the extreme, it
would greatly hinder the cooperation between Taiwan and other countries in areas
that do not involve the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,Lai believed.</P>
      <P>In that case, he said, Taiwan would be encouraging countries to evaluate their
relations with Taiwan through Taipei's relations with Beijing rather than from a
parallel point of view.</P>
      <P>Chang  Ling-chen,  professor  emeritus  in National  Taiwan University's
Department of Political Science, said the diplomatic truce was a practical
approach that needed to be taken in view of the situation in the real world.</P>
      <P>A diplomatic truce can prevent Taiwan's plight from getting worse, Chang said,
adding that continuing scorched-earth diplomacy would not serve Taiwan's
interests given that Taiwan and China's relative economic and political strength
have greatly changed over the years.</P>
      <P>This is a strategy that Taiwan has no choice but to take, " she added,
suggesting that the country could only negotiate from a relatively weak
position.</P>

      <P>Debris from an Air Force jet fighter that apparently crashed on a training
mission over the island county of Penghu has been collected from waters near an
uninhabited islet of the county Monday afternoon, a spokesman for the
Chingchuankang Airbase in Taichung said.</P>
      <P>The debris, including a safety jacket, a flight helmet and fragments of cockpit
seats, were fished out of the sea near Maoyu, or "Cat Islet, " Col. Chang Chao-
kui said.</P>
      <P>These items have been identified by Air Force personnel as originating from the
missing indigenous defense fighter (IDF).</P>
      <P>The Air Force said earlier Monday that IDF No. 1615, stationed at Chingchuankang
Airbase in Taichung County, disappeared from radar screens while on a training
mission over Penghu in the Taiwan Strait Monday morning.</P>
      <P>The jet fighter took off from Chingchuangkang at 9: 15 a.m. for a bombing
training mission over Penghu and disappeared 30 minutes later near Huayu island
in Penghu County, according to an Air Force statement.</P>
      <P>The two officers onboard the plane, pilot Capt. Ku Chih-bin and co-pilot Capt.
Chen Jian-ting, have not been unaccounted for, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>An extensive air and sea search conducted by Air Force planes and boats from the
Penghu Coast Guard office began immediately after the plane went missing, the
statement said.</P>
      <P>The IDF, developed by Taiwan in the 1980s with assistance from the U.S., is one
of four types of second generation Air Force jet fighters.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has 130 IDFs, which are stationed mainly on airbases in the western areas
of the country, across the Taiwan Strait from China, because of their quick
takeoff time.</P>
      <P>Monday's apparent accident was the fifth mishap to befell an IDF fighter since
the model was introduced to Taiwan's Air Force in 1988.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Monday that it is investigating
whether Taiwan's representative in the Miss International  beauty pageant  was
belittled  by the competition's Japanese organizer.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry's representative office in Japan is trying to figure out
what happened, MOFA spokesman Henry Chen told the Central News Agency. "If there
is any unreasonable arrangement or downgrading of Taiwan, the representative
office will protest to the organizer and ask for a correction.</P>
      <P>According to local daily Liberty Times, Taiwan's representative in the 2008 Miss
International Ting Yen-yu was given two sashes, reading "Taiwan" and "Chinese
Taipei" by the Japanese organizer and was toldto wear either of them depending
on where you are.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese contestant apparently interpreted the move to mean that  she
could  wear  the "Taiwan"  sash  while  performing competition-related duties in
Japan but would have to wear the "Chinese Taipei" sash during the actual
competition being held in Macau.</P>
      <P>The candidates from 68 countries are in Tokyo to conduct a series of charity
events before competing in the final of Miss International Beauty Pageant 2008
slated to be held in Macau on Nov. 8.</P>
      <P>Ting's instructor Chang Ming-chu criticized the organizer for disrespecting the
candidate.</P>
      <P>The judges will be confused by different sashes as they do not know which
country she (Ting) represents,Chang was quoted as saying by the news report.</P>
      <P>Also, questioning our candidate this and that is not only discrimination but
also a blow to her confidence,she added.</P>
      <P>Ting was cited as saying that she will wear the "Taiwan" sash in Macau and see
what happens.</P>
      <P>The MOFA's Chen said Taiwan's representatives usually use the designation
"Chinese Taipei, " "Taiwan" or "Republic of China, " depending on which name
Taiwan uses to join the related international organizing body for the event.</P>
      <P>Since the Japanese organizer gave Ting the "Taiwan" sash, it means that the
organizer agrees to the candidate using "Taiwan," Chen said, adding that the
MOFA will fight for the rights of Taiwan's representative in the competition.</P>
      <P>The contest organizers do not seem to have a standard used for the country's
name.</P>
      <P>On their Web site, the 2006 Taiwan representative Liu Tzu-hsuan was listed under
the name "Taiwan,  " while the 2007 Taiwan representative, Hung Tzu-wei, was
listed under the name "Chinese Taipei."</P>
      <P>Created in Long Beach, California in 1960, Miss International is the largest
beauty pageant in the world next to Miss Universe and Miss World. Since 1972, it
has been held in Japan and from that time, Miss International has attained the
status of a quasi-national event garnering a reputation as theOlympics of

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
on Monday demanded the government seek compensation from China for Taiwanese
consumers and companies who fell victim to melamine-tainted Chinese milk
products.</P>
      <P>The government should ask Chen Yunlin, China's top liaison with Taiwan, to
apologize over the issue and pay compensation to Taiwanese victims, on behalf of
the Chinese government, during his imminent visit to Taiwan, DPP legislators
said.</P>
      <P>Chen, president of the quasi-official Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , is expected to visit Taiwan in late October or early
November. He will be the highest ranking Chinese envoy to visit the island since
the two sides began a dialogue in 1992.</P>
      <P>Legislators argued that if Chen refuses to apologize or agree to pay
compensation, President Ma Ying-jeou should raise the demand directly to the
Chinese authorities, now that Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has reportedly
acknowledged in a recent interview with an international  media outlet that the
Chinese government has a responsibility to deal with the negative effects of
melamine-tainted milk powder, which has been sold overseas, including to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The group of DPP lawmakers, led by the party's caucus whip Lai Ching-te, issued
the request at a Legislative Yuan news conference.</P>
      <P>According to DPP lawmaker Yeh Yi-jin, more than 200 brands of questionable
foodstuff and other products containing melamine were removed from local store
shelves after the Chinese toxic milk powder scandal broke out in mid-September
in Taiwan. The incident has caused a combined loss of more than NT$ 4 billion
(US$123 million) to Taiwanese companies and consumers, she said.</P>
      <P>"The large amounts of harmful Chinese food imports really make Taiwan's
consumers gravely concerned over their health," she added.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Chen Chi-yu contended that the government should put stronger
pressure on the Chinese government to force it to take responsibility for
compensation.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-yu asked the DPP central to consider launching a larger protest if Chen
Yunlin fails to issue a public apology while in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DPP, in conjunction with the Taiwan Solidarity Union and several pro-
independence groups, have decided to stage a protest march in Taipei on Oct. 25,
ahead of Chen Yunlin's visit. They have vowed to gather 1 million protesters.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin is slated to hold talks to further two-way exchanges with his
Taiwanese counterpart -- Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-
kung -- as a follow-up to their landmark meeting in June in Beijing.</P>
      <P>In response to implications arising from China's toxic milk powder and Chen
Yunlin's visit to Taiwan,  Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung  said while giving a
report earlier Monday at a legislative committee that the SEF is authorized to
ask China for compensation through negotiations with the ARATS during Chen's
visit.</P>
      <P>Chiu,  who doubles as Consumer Protection Commission (CPC) chairman, said the
CPC has so far received three complaints filed by Taiwanese people who appeared
to have suffered kidney stones after they drank melamine-tainted Chinese milk
powder.</P>
      <P>The CPC's hotline "1950" has to date received a total of 1,639 inquiries about
melamine-tainted food, CPC officials said.</P>

      <P>Lee said the former president's endorsement would split party opinion and result
in chaos in its fielding of a candidate, and he urged party chairwoman, Tsai
Ing-wen, to address the matter to quell the shockwaves created inside the party
by the former president's announcement.</P>
      <P>Lee wondered if the party really wanted new blood or if it wanted Tan Sun Chen,
who served as Tainan County magistrate from 1993-2001, and he said Tsai needed
to move quickly and bring the party together to unify support and prevent it
from disintegrating.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another DPP legislator, Yeh Yi-jin, who is also likely to seek the
party's nomination, said that everyone is entitled to support their ideal
candidate, and that Tainan County voters would ultimately decide the issue.</P>
      <P>She said the party should only take into consideration who has the best chance
for electoral success in the process and should have its own methods of
determining the final nominee.</P>
      <P>The former president threw his backing behind Tan Sun Chen at a Tainan County
association meeting Saturday, saying that his former aide was leading in a
private poll conducted by the DPP.</P>
      <P>DPP officials denied, however, that the party had conducted such a poll.</P>
      <P>Tainan County, where Chen Shui-bian is from, has long been considered a DPP
stronghold.</P>
      <P>Five people have currently expressed their interest in running for county
magistrate,  including  the incumbent  vice county magistrate, and one former
lawmaker as well as Lee, Yeh, and Tan Sun Chen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Fubon pays US$600 million to buy life insurance unit of ING</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Fubon Financial Holding Co. announced Monday it will buy ING Group's Taiwan life
insurance unit in a deal worth NT$19.5 billion (US$600 million), the biggest
merger in the local life insurance industry in five years.</P>
      <P>The acquisition, expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2009, will
increase Fubon's customer base by 2.2 million customers, or more than a third,
to 8.7 million and boost its total life insurance assets to NT$1 trillion,
propelling the group's ranking in the local insurance market to fourth.</P>
      <P>The purchase will also vault Fubon Financial past Mega Financial Holdings to
make it Taiwan's second-largest financial holding company in terms of assets,
trailing only Cathay Financial Holdings.</P>
      <P>ING said it will hold a 5 percent Fubon stake and the company's bonds once the
deal is concluded.</P>
      <P>The merger will also solidify the total premium and first-year premium market
share of Fubon's life insurance unit.</P>
      <P>Fubon's total premium market share will nearly double to 13.9 percent from the 7
percent it held at the end of September to rise to second from fourth.</P>
      <P>Its share of first-year premium will grow to 17.8 percent from the current 13
percent, solidifying its hold on second place in the category.</P>
      <P>Cathay Life Insurance topped the industry with 23.3 percent of Taiwan's total
premium market and 25.2 percent of the first-year premium market.</P>
      <P>Fubon Financial Vice Chairman Richard Tsai said Fubon and ING's sales channels
and product structure complement each other. Fubon's line, he said, is more
weighted toward interest-sensitive products while ING's line favors traditional
and investment-sensitive policies.</P>
      <P>The deal, subject to the approval from Fubon shareholders and regulators, is
expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2009.</P>
      <P>Fubon Financial President Victor Kung said Fubon had talked to ING about a
possible deal for two years before signing the accord Saturday. The length of
the discussions, he said, was a key factor in the "very reasonable" price.</P>
      <P>On a day when most other financial  and insurance stocks nosedived, Fubon
Financial shares rose Monday, finishing 5.7 percent higher to close at NT$19.05
per share.</P>
      <P>Financial analysts said that in addition to Fubon Financial, ING also contacted
Chinatrust Financial Holding Co. and Mega Holdings in a bid to strike a deal.
They said Fubon was able to clinch the deal at a bargain price because of its
abundant cash reserves.</P>

      <P>The signing of a joint statement between a Taipei business organization and the
state government of Idaho of the United States not only signify but also renew
the close relations between the two countries, Foreign Minister Francisco H.L.
Ou said Monday.</P>
      <P>The joint statement just signed serves as a milestone in the mutually beneficial
relations between Idaho and Taiwan and sets the course of our future bilateral
cooperation, Ou said at a dinner reception he hosted for the Idaho Governor C.
L. "Butch" Otter.</P>
      <P>Otter led a 28-member economic and trade delegation consisting of Idaho state
government officials and representatives from Idaho businesses and academic
institutions to Taiwan from Oct. 19-22.</P>
      <P>Ou added that the passage this year by Idaho's Senate and House of
Representatives of a resolution in support of a U.S.-Taiwan free trade
agreementdemonstrated the deep friendship between the two of us.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the same occasion, Otter said he was honored to revisit Taiwan and
witness the progress of a partnership that he helped bring about a decade ago.</P>
      <P>Ten years ago, I sat at the desk and had the opportunity to sign thebirth
certificateof  a great friendship  and great relations that continue yet
today,Otter said.</P>
      <P>We should remember that all that's happened in the past is only the promise for
tomorrow, he said. "You are all witnesses to the renewal of the vows,
partnership and trade agreements and continuing success.</P>
      <P>Signed by Huang Chun-kuo, secretary-general of the Importers and Exporters
Association of Taipei and representatives from Idaho's Department of Agriculture
and Commerce, the joint statement aims to strengthen mutual understanding and
bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, culture and education between
Taiwan and the western state.</P>
      <P>While close relations have existed between Idaho and Taiwan since 1984, Idaho's
exports to Taiwan totaled US$304 million in 2007, an increase of 76.8 percent
over the previous year, making Taiwan Idaho's sixth largest export market.</P>
      <P>Whereas  Taiwan has become the primary market for Idaho's high-tech goods,
foods, wheat, wood and building materials, Idaho has become a top export
destination for Taiwan's electronic equipment and machinery.</P>

      <P>Chiayi County's chief promoted on Monday a unique festival prepared by the
indigenous Tsou tribe from Alishan that marks the spirit of "fona, " meaning
"bean of life" in their language.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-wen, serving as the spokesman for the festival, invited people to join
the two-week event -- to begin on Nov. 1 -- in which they will have chance to
witness the Tsou's cultural essence by attending a traditional wedding ceremony.</P>
      <P>Introducing the fona bean, Chen said the vine normally blossoms and bears bean
pods every November.</P>
      <P>While serving as one of tribe's traditional food ingredients, the fona bean is
also regarded as a symbol of vitality and fertility because it can grow well on
barren soil and in adverse conditions.</P>
      <P>Thus, the plant has served as an important offering during the Tsou's
traditional wedding ceremonies to help the younger generation grow up with the
same strong vitality as that of the bean, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Fona Festival will take place on Nov. 1-16 at the Leyie Tsou tribe cultural
park, which is located at the 61.5-kilometer mark on the Alishan Highway.</P>

      <P>A research team led by the head of Taiwan's top research  institute  has
received  a cash award from the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) for
its innovation in the development of a defense against the disease, academic
sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>The IAVI,  a global organization working to speed up the development of a
vaccine against HIV/AIDS, will offer more than NT$19.92 million (US$612,923) in
financial aid over three years beginning in 2008 for the AIDS vaccine research
team headed by Academia Sinica President Chi-Huey Wong, the sources said.</P>
      <P>"This is very practical and morale-boosting encouragement, " Wong said, adding
that the aid from the prominent organization is expected to inspire more
attention and engagement in the development of an AIDS vaccine.</P>
      <P>Wang, a world-renowned biochemist, said he is convinced that over the next few
years substantial progress will be made in AIDS vaccine research and
development.</P>
      <P>According to Wong, the IAVI funding will be paid in six installments or once
every six months. "The installment for the second half of 2008, totaling NT$3.32
million has been received," he added.</P>
      <P>Wong's team has devised a new compound proven effective in stopping HIV-
infection in animals at an early stage, raising hopes it can also be used to
develop effective anti HIV-medications and the long-awaited HIV vaccine for
humans.</P>
      <P>HIV or human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, is capable of evading
the body's virus detection system by locking itself to the virus detecting
dendritic cell. The goal of Wong's project was to inhibit the HIV from doing so.</P>
      <P>Wong's team has created a new substance called "glycodendron" in accordance with
the chemical characteristics of the HIV-oligomannose glycan combination.</P>
      <P>The new substance has been proven effective in preventing HIV from latching onto
dentritic cells and prompted the immune system to produce antibodies destructive
to the virus during experiments on rodents, Wong said.</P>

      <P>An anti-corruption unit is investigating whether the US$180,000 in cash given by
two board directors of Yuanta Financial Holding Co. to former first lady Wu Shu-
jen in 2005 as a gift for her son's wedding was in fact a bribe, a spokesman for
the unit said Monday.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Chen Yun-nan, director of the Special Investigation Division under
the Supreme Prosecutors Office, said members of the division were still trying
to find out whether the money, given by Yuanta President Victor Ma and Vice
President Michael Ma in the form of traveler's checks in June 2005, was related
to the Yuanta Group's being allowed to take over the management of Fuhwa
Financial Holding Co. at about the same time.</P>
      <P>Fuhwa Financial subsequently merged with the Yuanta Group and became Yuanta
Financial Holdings.</P>
      <P>A day earlier,  prosecutors from the Special Investigation Division raided
Yuanta Financial Holdings and summoned the Ma brothers and their financial
adviser Lin Ming-yi for questioning in connection with the money-laundering case
involving former President Chen Shui-bian and his family.</P>
      <P>The trio were asked to explain why the US$180,000 had been remitted to several
overseas accounts of Tsai Ming-tse, Wu Shu-jen's special assistant. They were
released after more than four hours of interrogation.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who has been held in custody as a potential defendant in the money
laundering case, had apparently admitted to prosecutors earlier that the
US$180,000 from Yuanta was for Wu.</P>
      <P>Yen Ching-chang, chairman of Yuanta Financial Holdings, told reporters Monday
that the money came from the Ma brothers' personal accounts and had nothing to
do with the Yuanta Group.</P>
      <P>According to Yen, although the former president claimed publicly in June 2005
that his family would not accept any cash gifts from well-wishers for their
son's wedding,  the Ma brothers, after consulting with "well-acquainted people,"
still decided to send US$180,000 as a gift.</P>
      <P>In addition to Yuanta Group, the prosecutors have also searched other financial
institutions in the past few days,  including Chinatrust Financial Holding Co.
and Mega Financial Holding Co. in connection with their investigation of the
former first family's money laundering case.</P>

      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Minister Chen Wu-hsiung said Monday that local urea
prices might be reduced thanks to steep falls in oil prices in the world market.</P>
      <P>"Although the government promised that fertilizer prices would be maintained
through the end of the year after it imposed a price hike in late May, the COA
will study the possibility of adjusting prices downward as a result of continued
declines in international oil prices, " Chen said at a hearing of the
Legislative Yuan's Economics Committee.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, a COA fertilizer price screening panel and the state-run
Taiwan Fertilizer  Co.,  will jointly  work on the feasibilities of a price
reduction based on future oil price trends.</P>
      <P>"The panel might devise a 'long-term pricing mechanism' to transparently reflect
fertilizer production costs and take better care of farmers," he added.</P>
      <P>Urea is being targeted because it is the only chemical fertilizer derived from
petroleum, he noted.</P>
      <P>The COA minister announced on May 28 a price hike for a 40-kilogram bag of urea,
lifting its price from NT$360-NT$370 per bag to over NT$800 a bag from May 30 to
reflect the soaring costs of raw materials.</P>
      <P>As part of the government's efforts to help minimize the financial burden of the
hike on farmers, it pushed Taiwan Fertilizer to absorb nearly 70 percent of the
price increase, leaving farmers to pay NT$520-NT$530 per bag.</P>
      <P>The price hike stirred up widespread discontent among farmers.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-teh, director-general of the COA's Agriculture and Food Agency,
confirmed later the same day that the COA panel will assess a possible cut in
fertilizer prices in conjunction  with Taiwan Fertilizer officials, although it
will take some time for the declining prices of crude oil to have an impact on
petrochemical products.</P>

      <P>The locally developed Ching-kuo indigenous defense fighters (IDFs) will undergo
special inspections after one of them apparently crashed on a training mission
over the island county of Penghu Monday, Air Force authorities said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>The special inspections will be completed in the shortest period of time, said
the statement, issued by Chingchuankang Airbase in the central county of
Taichung.</P>
      <P>Debris from IDF jet fighter No. 1615, including a safety jacket, a flight
helmet, a seat and a piece of the fighter's fuselage, was recovered from waters
near Maoyu, or Cat Islet -- an uninhabited isle of the Penghu island group, the
statement said.</P>
      <P>Air Force  Commanding  General  Peng Sheng-chu  rushed  to Chingchuankang
Airbase Monday afternoon to console the family of the two pilots aboard the
plane, the statement said, adding that Peng assured their family members that
the military will make every possible effort to search for the pilots.</P>
      <P>"We'll never give up so long as there is a glimmer of hope," Peng was quoted as
having said.</P>
      <P>The airbase has set up a special project control  center responsible for the
search and rescue mission, the statement said, addign that many naval and coast
guard ships and aerial rescue forces have been mobilized for the mission. The
all-out search was still going on as of press time.</P>
      <P>The IDF fighter disappeared from radar screens while on a training mission over
Penghu in the Taiwan Strait Monday morning.</P>
      <P>The jet fighter took off from Chingchuangkang at 9: 15 a.m. for a bombing
training mission and disappeared 30 minutes later near Huayu island in Penghu
County, Air Force authorities said.</P>
      <P>The two officers onboard the plane, pilot Capt. Ku Chih-bin and co-pilot Capt.
Chen Jian-ting, have since remained unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>IDFs, developed by Taiwan in the 1980s with assistance from the U.S., together
with U.S.-built F-16s and French-made Mirage 2000-5s, form the mainstay of
Taiwan's second generation Air Force fleet.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has 130 IDFs, which are stationed mainly on airbases in the western areas
of the country, across the Taiwan Strait from China, because of their quick
takeoff time.</P>
      <P>Monday's apparent accident was the fifth mishap to befall an IDF fighter since
the model was introduced to Taiwan's Air Force in 1988. According to military
authorities, IDFs have the best availability in the country's air force fleet.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Fubon Financial Holding Co. announced Monday it will buy ING Group's Taiwan life
insurance unit in a deal worth NT$19.5 billion (US$600 million), the biggest
merger in the local life insurance industry in five years.</P>
      <P>The acquisition, expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2009, will
increase Fubon's customer base by 2.2 million customers, or more than a third,
to 8.7 million and boost its total life insurance assets to NT$1 trillion,
propelling the group's ranking in the local insurance market to fourth.</P>
      <P>The purchase will also vault Fubon Financial past Mega Financial Holdings to
make it Taiwan's second-largest financial holding company in terms of assets,
trailing only Cathay Financial Holdings.</P>
      <P>ING said it will hold a 5 percent Fubon stake and the company's bonds once the
deal is concluded.</P>
      <P>The merger will also solidify the total premium and first-year premium market
share of Fubon's life insurance unit.</P>
      <P>Fubon's total premium market share will nearly double to 13.9 percent from the 7
percent it held at the end of September to rise to second from fourth.</P>
      <P>Its share of first-year premium will grow to 17.8 percent from the current 13
percent, solidifying its hold on second place in the category.</P>
      <P>Cathay Life Insurance topped the industry with 23.3 percent of Taiwan's total
premium market and 25.2 percent of the first-year premium market.</P>
      <P>Fubon Financial Vice Chairman Richard Tsai said Fubon and ING's sales channels
and product structure complement each other. Fubon's line, he said, is more
weighted toward interest-sensitive products while ING's line favors traditional
and investment-sensitive policies.</P>
      <P>The deal, subject to the approval from Fubon shareholders and regulators, is
expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2009.</P>
      <P>Fubon Financial President Victor Kung said Fubon had talked to ING about a
possible deal for two years before signing the accord Saturday. The length of
the discussions, he said, was a key factor in the "very reasonable" price.</P>
      <P>On a day when most other financial  and insurance stocks nosedived, Fubon
Financial shares rose Monday, finishing 5.7 percent higher to close at NT$19.05
per share.</P>
      <P>Financial analysts said that in addition to Fubon Financial, ING also contacted
Chinatrust Financial Holding Co. and Mega Holdings in a bid to strike a deal.
They said Fubon was able to clinch the deal at a bargain price because of its
abundant cash reserves.</P>

      <P>The locally developed Ching-kuo indigenous defense fighters (IDFs) will undergo
special inspections after one of them apparently crashed on a training mission
over the island county of Penghu Monday, Air Force authorities said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>The special inspections will be completed in the shortest period of time, said
the statement, issued by Chingchuankang Airbase in the central county of
Taichung.</P>
      <P>Debris from IDF jet fighter No. 1615, including a safety jacket, a flight
helmet, a seat and a piece of the fighter's fuselage, was recovered from waters
near Maoyu, or Cat Islet -- an uninhabited isle of the Penghu island group, the
statement said.</P>
      <P>Air Force  Commanding  General  Peng Sheng-chu  rushed  to Chingchuankang
Airbase Monday afternoon to console the family of the two pilots aboard the
plane, the statement said, adding that Peng assured their family members that
the military will make every possible effort to search for the pilots.</P>
      <P>"We'll never give up so long as there is a glimmer of hope," Peng was quoted as
having said.</P>
      <P>The airbase has set up a special project control  center responsible for the
search and rescue mission, the statement said, addign that many naval and coast
guard ships and aerial rescue forces have been mobilized for the mission. The
all-out search was still going on as of press time.</P>
      <P>The IDF fighter disappeared from radar screens while on a training mission over
Penghu in the Taiwan Strait Monday morning.</P>
      <P>The jet fighter took off from Chingchuangkang at 9: 15 a.m. for a bombing
training mission and disappeared 30 minutes later near Huayu island in Penghu
County, Air Force authorities said.</P>
      <P>The two officers onboard the plane, pilot Capt. Ku Chih-bin and co-pilot Capt.
Chen Jian-ting, have since remained unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>IDFs, developed by Taiwan in the 1980s with assistance from the U.S., together
with U.S.-built F-16s and French-made Mirage 2000-5s, form the mainstay of
Taiwan's second generation Air Force fleet.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has 130 IDFs, which are stationed mainly on airbases in the western areas
of the country, across the Taiwan Strait from China, because of their quick
takeoff time.</P>
      <P>Monday's apparent accident was the fifth mishap to befall an IDF fighter since
the model was introduced to Taiwan's Air Force in 1988. According to military
authorities, IDFs have the best availability in the country's air force fleet.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Minister Chen Wu-hsiung said Monday that local urea
prices might be reduced thanks to steep falls in oil prices in the world market.</P>
      <P>"Although the government promised that fertilizer prices would be maintained
through the end of the year after it imposed a price hike in late May, the COA
will study the possibility of adjusting prices downward as a result of continued
declines in international oil prices, " Chen said at a hearing of the
Legislative Yuan's Economics Committee.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, a COA fertilizer price screening panel and the state-run
Taiwan Fertilizer  Co.,  will jointly  work on the feasibilities of a price
reduction based on future oil price trends.</P>
      <P>"The panel might devise a 'long-term pricing mechanism' to transparently reflect
fertilizer production costs and take better care of farmers," he added.</P>
      <P>Urea is being targeted because it is the only chemical fertilizer derived from
petroleum, he noted.</P>
      <P>The COA minister announced on May 28 a price hike for a 40-kilogram bag of urea,
lifting its price from NT$360-NT$370 per bag to over NT$800 a bag from May 30 to
reflect the soaring costs of raw materials.</P>
      <P>As part of the government's efforts to help minimize the financial burden of the
hike on farmers, it pushed Taiwan Fertilizer to absorb nearly 70 percent of the
price increase, leaving farmers to pay NT$520-NT$530 per bag.</P>
      <P>The price hike stirred up widespread discontent among farmers.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-teh, director-general of the COA's Agriculture and Food Agency,
confirmed later the same day that the COA panel will assess a possible cut in
fertilizer prices in conjunction  with Taiwan Fertilizer officials, although it
will take some time for the declining prices of crude oil to have an impact on
petrochemical products.</P>

      <P>An anti-corruption unit is investigating whether the US$180,000 in cash given by
two board directors of Yuanta Financial Holding Co. to former first lady Wu Shu-
jen in 2005 as a gift for her son's wedding was in fact a bribe, a spokesman for
the unit said Monday.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Chen Yun-nan, director of the Special Investigation Division under
the Supreme Prosecutors Office, said members of the division were still trying
to find out whether the money, given by Yuanta President Victor Ma and Vice
President Michael Ma in the form of traveler's checks in June 2005, was related
to the Yuanta Group's being allowed to take over the management of Fuhwa
Financial Holding Co. at about the same time.</P>
      <P>Fuhwa Financial subsequently merged with the Yuanta Group and became Yuanta
Financial Holdings.</P>
      <P>A day earlier,  prosecutors from the Special Investigation Division raided
Yuanta Financial Holdings and summoned the Ma brothers and their financial
adviser Lin Ming-yi for questioning in connection with the money-laundering case
involving former President Chen Shui-bian and his family.</P>
      <P>The trio were asked to explain why the US$180,000 had been remitted to several
overseas accounts of Tsai Ming-tse, Wu Shu-jen's special assistant. They were
released after more than four hours of interrogation.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who has been held in custody as a potential defendant in the money
laundering case, had apparently admitted to prosecutors earlier that the
US$180,000 from Yuanta was for Wu.</P>
      <P>Yen Ching-chang, chairman of Yuanta Financial Holdings, told reporters Monday
that the money came from the Ma brothers' personal accounts and had nothing to
do with the Yuanta Group.</P>
      <P>According to Yen, although the former president claimed publicly in June 2005
that his family would not accept any cash gifts from well-wishers for their
son's wedding,  the Ma brothers, after consulting with "well-acquainted people,"
still decided to send US$180,000 as a gift.</P>
      <P>In addition to Yuanta Group, the prosecutors have also searched other financial
institutions in the past few days,  including Chinatrust Financial Holding Co.
and Mega Financial Holding Co. in connection with their investigation of the
former first family's money laundering case.</P>

      <P>A research team led by the head of Taiwan's top research  institute  has
received  a cash award from the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) for
its innovation in the development of a defense against the disease, academic
sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>The IAVI,  a global organization working to speed up the development of a
vaccine against HIV/AIDS, will offer more than NT$19.92 million (US$612,923) in
financial aid over three years beginning in 2008 for the AIDS vaccine research
team headed by Academia Sinica President Chi-Huey Wong, the sources said.</P>
      <P>"This is very practical and morale-boosting encouragement, " Wong said, adding
that the aid from the prominent organization is expected to inspire more
attention and engagement in the development of an AIDS vaccine.</P>
      <P>Wang, a world-renowned biochemist, said he is convinced that over the next few
years substantial progress will be made in AIDS vaccine research and
development.</P>
      <P>According to Wong, the IAVI funding will be paid in six installments or once
every six months. "The installment for the second half of 2008, totaling NT$3.32
million has been received," he added.</P>
      <P>Wong's team has devised a new compound proven effective in stopping HIV-
infection in animals at an early stage, raising hopes it can also be used to
develop effective anti HIV-medications and the long-awaited HIV vaccine for
humans.</P>
      <P>HIV or human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, is capable of evading
the body's virus detection system by locking itself to the virus detecting
dendritic cell. The goal of Wong's project was to inhibit the HIV from doing so.</P>
      <P>Wong's team has created a new substance called "glycodendron" in accordance with
the chemical characteristics of the HIV-oligomannose glycan combination.</P>
      <P>The new substance has been proven effective in preventing HIV from latching onto
dentritic cells and prompted the immune system to produce antibodies destructive
to the virus during experiments on rodents, Wong said.</P>

      <P>Nearly 60 percent of respondents to a recent government opinion survey said they
oppose the opposition parties' plan to take to the streets during a top Chinese
liaison officer's visit to Taiwan, a Cabinet-level agency said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Research, Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) said it conducted the
telephone poll Oct. 14-15 to explore local people's views on an upcoming visit
to Taiwan by Chen Yunlin, China's top negotiator  with Taiwan in his capacity as
president  of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>According to the poll results, 73 percent of the respondents were aware that
Chen will visit Taiwan in late October or early November.</P>
      <P>Up to 54 percent said they did not think that Chen should defer his travel plans
because of the recent controversy over melamine contaminated food products from
China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 67 percent said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should sign a
cooperative agreement during Chen's visit to ensure quality and safety of food
imports from China.</P>
      <P>Asked about their opinions on the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP's) plan to stage a large-scale march and mass rallies during Chen's stay to
protest China's exports of melamine-tainted milk powder and food ingredients to
Taiwan, 59 percent said they disagreed with such a plan, while 26 percent gave a
thumbs-up to the proposal.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 49 percent of the respondents believe Chen's visit
would bring about more benefits than detriments, but 22 percent said they think
otherwise.</P>
      <P>In addition, 50 percent said they believe Chen's visit would contribute to
further development of cross-strait trade and economic cooperation; 50 percent
said Chen's visit would help Chinese people better understand Taiwan's
democratic experience; and nearly 47 percent said Chen's visit could help ease
cross-strait confrontation on diplomatic and military fronts.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,085 valid replies were collected in the survey among randomly
chosen adults residing in various parts of the country, with a margin of error
of 2.9 percentage points.</P>
      <P>Although Chen's itinerary has yet to be announced, the DPP and major pro-
independence groups have decided to mount a march in downtown Taipei this
Saturday to voice their anger at China's shipment of substandard and even toxic
foodstuffs to Taiwan and what they call the current Kuomintang government's
China-leaning policy and its inability to revitalize the bearish stock market
and slumping economy.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reassured the nation Tuesday of his strong commitment to
preserving peace across the Taiwan Strait during his term, even as he pledged to
beef up the country's defenses against mainland China's military threats.</P>
      <P>"There will be no war between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in the next
four years.  I put forth this vision during my presidential campaign and am more
confident about it now," Ma said in an address to a group of top military
leaders at National Defense University in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>Ma, however, stressed that Taiwan must maintain a strong defense even if the
country has no desire to go to war with the mainland.</P>
      <P>He noted that developments taking place across the strait over the past several
decades, such as the removal of a ban on China visits by Taiwanese, the inflows
of Taiwanese investment into China, and the economic boom in China, have led to
a structural change in relations between the two sides, while China's rapid
military buildup and modernization has also posed a serious threat to Taiwan's
security.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, to Taiwan, China is both an opportunity and a threat. As the
president, it is his responsibility to maximize the opportunity and minimize the
threat, he said.</P>
      <P>"And the military's responsibility is to deter any risky actions across the
strait through strong preparedness," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Renewing his promise to maintain Taiwan's status quo under the framework of the
Republic of China Constitution, Ma said his administration is working toward
that goal by following the strategy of "no unification, no independence and no
use of force" to try to create a peaceful cross-strait environment.</P>
      <P>The president said the work of the military is to protect the ROC Constitution,
safeguard the ROC sovereignty and maintain the dignity and peaceful life of the
country's 23 million people. In order to preserve cross-strait and regional
peace, Taiwan needs to maintain a strong defense capability, he added.</P>
      <P>Citing the famous quote "Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never
fear to negotiate" by the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy, Ma argued that
the stronger Taiwan becomes the more leverage it will enjoy in cross-strait
negotiations, because maintaining a military balance is necessary to achieve
peace.</P>
      <P>The president  pledged  that  to attain  that  goal,  his administration will
earmark sufficient funds over the next few years to meet the country's defense
needs.</P>
      <P>Ma has put forth a "modus vivendi" approach for dealing with China, which
advocates a cross-strait "truce" in the diplomatic arena and the opening of
cross-strait negotiations for the establishment of a peace accord.</P>
      <P>Ma, however, has requested that China remove its more than 1,000 missiles
targeting Taiwan as the precondition to such peace talks.</P>

      <P>An upcoming visit to Taiwan by a top Chinese liaison official Chen Yunlin will
greatly harm Taiwan, the chairperson of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party said Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at press conference, Tsai Ing-wen stressed that by agreeing to the
visit,  President  Ma Ying-jeou  was severely undermining the rights of the
Taiwan people and greatly damaging Taiwan's status as a sovereign nation.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is president of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS), is slated to make a historic visit to Taiwan late this month or
early next month to meet with his Taiwan counterpart Straits Exchange Foundation
Chairman Chiang Pin-kung. It will be the second meeting between ARATS and SEF
heads since Ma took office in May. The two will discuss a wide range of issues,
including direct cross-strait flights, shipping and trade.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the official stance of the Democratic Progressive Party on the
issue of cross-strait relations is that Taiwan is a sovereign state. She
stressed that the rights of the Taiwan people should be protected at all costs
and should not be undermined in any way by Ma, nor should the country's
sovereignty be compromised for economic gains.</P>
      <P>Tsai also disparaged Ma's statement that there will be no war across the Taiwan
Strait in the next four year, saying that the president "would surrender Taiwan
to Beijing without a fight."</P>
      <P>At second press conference, Tsai also took Ma to task over his comment that
Taiwan is a region rather than a sovereign nation, calling it a ridiculous
statement that indicates Ma is an incompetent president.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party has organized a rally to be held on Oct. 25 in
protest against Ma administration's handling of cross strait affairs.</P>
      <P>The DPP said it is not ruling out the possibility of camping out overnight to
prolong the rally, but did not give any details on how long the camp could last.</P>
      <P>Tsai and other DPP members did not disclose what form of a protest they planned
for the arrival of Chen in the country.</P>

      <P>Visiting Vice President Zhang Mingqing of China's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , was allegedly knocked over by pro-Taiwan
independence supporters while on a private tour to the Confucius Temple in
Tainan City Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Zhang was chased and pushed by a group of protesters mobilized by a Tainan city
councilor of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , and was
allegedly knocked over by some emotional demonstrators while he was at the
temple.</P>
      <P>Dozens of pro-Taiwan independence supporters chanted anti-China slogans, shouted
at Zhang and asked him to "get lost and roll back to China" when they saw Zhang
walking alone.</P>
      <P>One protester jumped onto the top of Zhang's car and fiercely stamped on it as
Zhang was being escorted from the site by a local official and a tour guide.
Zhang was later taken to a hotel in Tainan City to rest.</P>
      <P>The Tainan area is a stronghold of pro-independence forces.</P>
      <P>None of the protesters were detained by local police authorities, but Tainan
City Police Bureau Commissioner Chen Fu-hsiang has ordered an investigation into
the case.</P>
      <P>The incident might have a negative impact on a planned visit to Taiwan by ARATS
President Chen Yunlin, China's top negotiator with Taiwan, slated for late
October or early November, analysts said</P>
      <P>Zhang arrived in Taiwan Sunday at the head of a 22-member delegation to take

opposition  Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Chairman Huang Kun-huei said Tuesday.</P>

      <P>Even if Taiwan signs a peace pact with China amid easing of tensions across the
Taiwan Strait, the country should still maintain a strong national defense
force, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liu made  the comment  while  answering  questions  at an interpellation session
at the Legislative Yuan on President Ma Ying-jeou's statement a few days ago
that he will seek to forge a peace accord with China during his term in office.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsueh Ling of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) asked
why the Ministry of National Defense (MND) had budgeted over NT$300 billion
(US$9.18 billion) for arms procurement, if a peace pact would ensure that there
would be no war in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"Why not just dismantle all Taiwan's military and defense forces?" Hsueh asked.</P>
      <P>In response, Liu said that currently the two sides are moving toward peace.
However, Taiwan must still have defense budgets and a certain degree of self-
defense capability, which means maintaining an adequate defense force, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in response to an incident in which Zhang Mingqing, vice president of
the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS),
was allegedly knocked over by anti-China protesters in Tainan earlier in the

    <HEADLINE>Obama did not object to selling Taiwan F-16s: campaign adviser</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama never said he objects to
selling Taiwan F-16 C/D fighter jets, an Obama campaign adviser said Tuesday as
he tried to negate a previous statement by the campaign that said it made no
sense to sell the fighters to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It is incorrect that Senator Obama opposes the sale of F-16s. We are not closing
the door on any U.S. military sales to Taiwan, " said Evan Medeiros, a member of
the Obama campaign's Asia policy team, at a video conference on the 2008 U.S.
presidential candidates' policies related to Asia.</P>
      <P>The Obama campaign team was not asked to comment and therefore did not comment
on the F-16 issue simply because the fighters were not on the table, Medeiros
contended.</P>
      <P>He added that if Obama were elected president, he would take appropriate
measures if China started to use military force or threats and coercion to try
to force or intimidate Taiwan into changing the status quo against its will.</P>
      <P>Obama's diplomatic adviser David Lampton reportedly said in a policy debate in
Washington last week that it made no sense to sell the most advanced fighter
jets to Taiwan, given that Taipei and Beijing just recently reopened long-
stalled dialogue.</P>
      <P>The selling of F-16s to Taiwan did not meet the strategic interests of the U.S.
or the interests of regional security and certainly not the interests of Taiwan,
Lampton was cited as saying.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Defense Department notified Congress Oct. 3 that it had approved the
sale of a US$6.46 billion package of weapons to Taiwan, which President Ma Ying-
jeou lauded assignaling an end to the turmoil of the past eight years and
marking the beginning of a new era of safety and peace, as well as of mutual
trust between Taiwan and the U.S.</P>
      <P>The arms package includes 30 Apache attack helicopters, 330 Patriot PAC-3
missiles, 182 Javelin middle-range anti-tank missiles, 32 sea-launched Harpoon
missiles, four E-2T aircraft system upgrades and assorted spare parts.</P>
      <P>The sales were made under the auspices of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), which
authorizes the U.S. to sell defensive weapons needed by Taiwan to maintain a
sound defense.</P>
      <P>The U.S. did not, however, approve diesel-electric submarines and Black  Hawk
helicopters  that  Taiwan  had sought.</P>
      <P>The Bush administration has also declined to process a separate request from
Taiwan for F-16 C/D fighter jets.</P>
      <P>While both Obama and McCain said they welcomed the arms package, only McCain
urged the Bush administration to reconsider its decision not to approve the sale
of the submarines or entertain the F-16 request.</P>
      <P>Representing Republican presidential candidate John McCain at the forum, which
was held by the American Institute in Taiwan's (AIT's) American Cultural Center,
Randall Schriver said McCain values the promises outlined in the TRA and will
sell more defensive weapons to Taiwan if elected.</P>
      <P>A deal is a deal, " Schriver said. "We will be judged by others if we made
commitments and don't follow through with them."</P>
      <P>If the military  balance  across the Taiwan Strait became unfavorable to Taiwan,
it would raise the possibility that Beijing could coerce a settlement, even
without the use of a military strike but through intimidation and coercion, the
former deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs
said.</P>
      <P>People of Taiwan would then feel they have no other choice but to accept some
sort of accommodation with Beijing, he added.</P>
      <P>This is really about preserving Taiwan's latitude for maneuver, preserving the
ability of the people of Taiwan to make choices about their future,Schriver
said.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou urged local residents and overseas Chinese Tuesday to
increase their personal spending in Taiwan to boost the country's economy, which
is feeling the pinch of the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Addressing a celebration marking Overseas Chinese Day, Ma noted that while
foreign trade contributed greatly to Taiwan's economic growth in the past, the
country now needed to turn to domestic investment and consumption for support in
the face of a global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>On its part, the government will increase its investment in public works in 2009
by NT$100 billion, Ma said.</P>
      <P>People with purchasing power were also encouraged to spend as much as possible,
he added.</P>
      <P>"The best way for overseas expatriates to help the government is to increase
your investment in the country and shop and spend more during your stay in
Taiwan," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The president said that although Taiwan has experienced a period of sluggishness
over the past several months, the country's economic fundamentals remain sound.</P>
      <P>For example, Taiwan has the world's fifth highest level of foreign exchange
reserves, and its foreign reserves per capita of US$12,000 is the third highest
worldwide, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan's high saving rate is rare for a country with per capita
income of US$19,000, he continued.</P>
      <P>Standing at 29 percent this year, the country's saving rate is likely to top 30
percent in 2009, with approximately 9 percent representing excess savings, he
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's inflation rate is the second lowest after Japan among Asian
countries, indicating that the government has effectively brought the inflation
situation under control through efforts made by Taiwan's central bank, he said.</P>
      <P>The global financial crisis that has toppled banks in the United States and
Europe has not spared Taiwan, but the country's banking system has so far
remained sound, according to the president.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President of China's Association Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) Chen Yunlin
expressed concern Tuesday that the mobbing of his deputy Zhang Mingqing in
Tainan City may have a negative effect on future cross-strait relations,
according to Chen's counterpart in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Chiang Pin-Kung, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF),
stressed that this will not affect the plans for a visit to Taiwan in the next
few weeks by Chen.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that he called Chen immediately after the incident in which Zhang
fell amid a crush of anti-China protesters during a visit to Confucius Temple in
Tainan City, southern Taiwan Tuesday. It was not clear whether Zhang tripped or
was pushed.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen expressed concern that the incident may put a dent in future
cross-strait relations and he reiterated that Zhang's visit was purely for
academic purposes -- not for cross strait negotiations, according to Chiang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan strongly condemned
incident, saying it was no way to treat a guest to Taiwan. Lai also called for
tighter security for Chen when he visits Taiwan later this month or next month
for talks with Chiang on a range of cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan  and the Presidential  Office also condemned the mobbing
of Zhang, with Liu agreeing that security should be enhanced for Chen's visit.</P>

      <P>Republican presidential candidate John McCain is not concerned that relations
between Taiwan and China are moving too fast, a senior advisor in the McCain
campaign on Asia policy said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan is moving too fast or going too far in improving relations
with China, Randall Schriver, a member of the McCain campaign team and former
deputy assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said
"Senator McCain and certainly the campaign have great confidence in the people
of Taiwan. If this is going too quickly, it will come from the 23 million people
of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"At the end of the day, the administration is pursuing a course that is popular
in Taiwan, that is supported in Taiwan, and the U.S. will support those
endeavors," he added.</P>
      <P>Schriver made the remarks in Washington D.C. at a digital video conference on
Asia policies among policy advisors of the 2008 U.S. presidential candidates and
scholars, which was held by the American Institute in Taiwan's (AIT's) American
Cultural Center. The event was joined by Evan Medeiros, member of the Democrat
presidential candidate Barack Obama campaign team, Schriver, and scholars from
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since assuming the presidency on May 20, President Ma Ying-jeou has been touting
a "modus vivendi" diplomatic strategy, which attempts to set aside Taipei's
differences with Beijing to find a mutually beneficial equilibrium. He is also
seeking a "diplomatic truce" to end a longstanding tug-of-war with China over
each other's allies and carve out a greater international presence for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In  addition,  Ma  introduced  a  series  of  cross-strait liberalization
measures, including the launch of nonstop direct weekend charter flights,
opening up Taiwan to more Chinese tourists, allowing cross-strait currency
trading, and raising the cap on China-bound investment by local enterprises from
40 percent to 60 percent of their net worth.</P>
      <P>The opposition, however, accuses Ma of sacrificing Taiwan's sovereignty by
leaning too much toward China, which they claimed displeased the U.S. to the
point that Washington dragged its feet on the approval of a US$6.46 billion arms
sale to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Both campaign teams agree that the U.S. should continue to provide the necessary
defensive weapons to Taiwan to give the island additional bargaining chips and
confidence in its negotiations with China.</P>
      <P>Noting that one of the prime foreign policy goals in an Obama administration
would be to re-orient and re-energize U.S. engagement with East Asia, Medeiros
said "we believe that the logic of providing for Taiwan legitimate defense
needs, as outlined in the Taiwan Relations Act, gives Taiwan the confidence to
approach cross-strait dynamics with greater confidence. It is with that logic
that we support the recent package."</P>
      <P>Schriver said McCain believes that diplomacy can be most effective tool and can
have the best chance to succeed if Taiwan can negotiate with China from a
position of strength and confidence.</P>
      <P>"This is really about preserving Taiwan's latitude for maneuver -- preserving
the ability of the people of Taiwan to make choices about their future,"
Schriver said.</P>

      <P>National  Police  Agency  (NPA) Director-General Wang Cho-chiun on Tuesday
promised to ensure the safety of a visiting Chinese official and condemned
violence against him in Tainan City, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang ordered police authorities nationwide to reinforce security measures to
protect the personal safety of Zhang Mingqing, vice president of China's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), during the reminder
of his stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang said that anyone caught illegally using violence and injuring others or
damaging public property will be dealt with according to the law, regardless of
his or her political affiliation.</P>
      <P>NPA Deputy Director-General Yi Yung-jen acknowledged that Tainan City police had
failed to adopt adequate security measures to protect Zhang and that the agency
will investigate the incident and hold those in charge accountable.</P>
      <P>Zhang fell to the ground after being chased and punched by a group of protesters
mobilized by a Tainan City councilor of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) during a private tour of the Confucius Temple in Tainan City earlier
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It was not immediately clear if Zhang fell because he lost his balance after
being besieged by the protesters or if he was actually shoved to the ground.</P>
      <P>Dozens of pro-Taiwan independence supporters chanted anti-China slogans to
protest Zhang's appearance at the temple, and shouted at him to "get lost" and
"go back to China" when they saw him walking alone.</P>
      <P>One protester also jumped onto the hood of Zhang's car as he was being escorted
from the site by a local official and a tour guide. The Chinese official was
later taken to a hotel in Tainan City to rest.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Long-term care law should consider patients' family members: experts</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   21  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Scholars  and representatives  of non-governmental  organizations  demanded
Tuesday  that  future legislation on Taiwan's Long-term Care Law take into
consideration the needs of patients' family members, many of whom sacrifice
their jobs to take care of the patients.</P>
      <P>Chang Chin-fen,  professor  of National Taipei University's Department of Social
Work, said at a public hearing that some people prefer looking after their ill
family members instead of hiring caretakers, but they might have to give up
their job as well as their labor insurance annuity, which is similar to social
security for them when they grow old.</P>
      <P>She said the future Long-term Care Law should not neglect these people, noting
that they need professional training courses and a salary, like professional
caretakers.</P>
      <P>"If the law cannot guarantee the life and welfare of these people,  it would be
like the law punishes  those  who take responsibility for taking care of their
family members, " said Chen Ying-rui, secretary-general of an alliance of family
caretakers, adding that people who take care of ill family members also need
respite care services.</P>
      <P>They were speaking at a pubic hearing held by legislator Yang Li-huan of the
ruling Kuomintang as preparation  for drafting legislation for the Long-term
Care Law.</P>
      <P>In  addition,  scholars  and  non-governmental  organization representatives
noted that a gap in resources between cities and the countryside must be
addressed before the law is enacted.</P>
      <P>"Service stations should be established as a priority in remote areas of the
countryside; otherwise, even if the law is enacted, people in need (in these
regions) will not be able to benefit from it, " said Wu Yu-chin, secretary-
general of the Alliance for Old People's Welfare Promotion, adding that
capacities for community care services vary widely in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response, government officials who also attended to the hearing agreed that
it is necessary to set up a long-term care network before enacting the law,
saying that it was the target of the Executive Yuan's 10-year plan.</P>
      <P>Last year, the Executive Yuan approved a 10-year long-term care plan, in which
it will invest a total of 81.7 billion NT dollars in 10 years to cope with
problems of Taiwan's aging society. The plan is considered Taiwan's largest
social welfare program for the elderly apart from the National Pension system,
according to the Government Information Office.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has also promised to implement long-term care insurance,
enact the Long-term Care Law in four years, and integrate  long-term  care
services  and medical resources  in communities to help elderly people "aging in
place."</P>
      <P>According to estimates by the Council for Economic Planning and Development,
people over 65 in Taiwan, numbering currently 2.34 million, or 10.2 percent of
the total population, will increase to 4.76 million in 2025, accounting for 20
percent of the population.</P>

      <P>The Consumers' Foundation urged the government Monday to locate and make public
the whereabouts of the full shipment of the melamine-tainted leavening agent
ammonium bicarbonate imported from China.</P>
      <P>After the discovery in Taiwan last month of melamine-contaminated milk powder
and non-dairy creamer, it was also found that a total of 469 tons of ammonium
bicarbonate imported by Taiwan's Sesoda Corp. from China was contaminated with
the toxic chemical melamine.</P>
      <P>The melamine content in a small portion of the imported ammonium bicarbonate was
as high as 2,470 parts per million (ppm) -- more than 987 times the maximum
permissible level, according to the foundation.</P>
      <P>The  foundation  confirmed  that  some  384  tons  of the melamine-tainted
leavening agent had been distributed in domestic markets. It is believed to have
been used in many baked products, such as Chinese deep-fried bread sticks,
creamy custard buns (polo buns) , barbecue pork buns, puff, Chinese sticky rice
crackers and Chinese wedding cakes, and as an additive to seaweed and squid, the
foundation said.</P>
      <P>About 3,055 of the 3,479 bags of the melamine tainted ammonium bicarbonate
distributed in Taichung City have been seized by the city's Health Bureau, and
the other 424 bags were used in paper production, according to a report released
by the central city government Monday.</P>
      <P>In light of the conflicting information provided by the media and the Department
of Health on the volume of melamine-tainted ammonium bicarbonate that was sold,
used and seized, the foundation urged that the government update the figures and
make them available to the public.</P>
      <P>The foundation also asked health agencies to immediately make clear information
related to the whereabouts of the melamine-tainted baking ingredient, to
provide, for example, a clearer picture on what products may contain the
contaminated agent.</P>
      <P>It added that the government should not try to hide the truth in an attepmt to
avoid causing panic among consumers, but rather it should emulate King Car Food
company's successfully handling of its melamine crisis. King Car removed all its
melamine-tainted products from the market and made all information public
shortly after eight of its products tested positive for melamine.</P>
      <P>The foundation also suggested that the government work to gain an understanding
of the manufacturing process of ammonium bicarbonate and figure out why the
shipment to Taiwan was contaminated with melamine, a chemical used to make
plastics or fertilizers that should never be used as a food additive.</P>

      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Vice Chairman Chang Chun-hung strongly
condemned Tuesday the violent treatment of visiting Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)  Vice President  Zhang Mingqing  by pro-Taiwan
independence supporters in Tainan City earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>The Chinese official, visiting in his private capacity as a scholar to attend a
seminar at Tainan National University of the Arts, was chased and knocked to the
ground by the protestors while he was touring the Confucius Temple in the
southern city.</P>
      <P>The dozens of protestors chanted anti-China slogans and shouted abuses at Zhang,
telling him to "get lost" and "go back to China."</P>
      <P>Chang condemned the protestors' actions, saying that it displayed the
"barbarization of Taiwan's democracy."</P>
      <P>"Democracy is Taiwan's biggest weapon, and if we lose that weapon, then all that
is left to do is to travel down the road of surrender," he added.</P>
      <P>Chang said that protests are a natural part of democratic societies, adding that
it is acceptable for citizens to voice their opposition to China's military
buildup.</P>
      <P>"But the use of violence is cowardly and is tantamount to saying to the world
that the result of Taiwan's democratization  is barbarity," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Noting that cross-Taiwan Strait relations have been on friendlier terms
recently, Chang added that such "barbaric treatment" of a visiting academic can
only undermine the nation's interests.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese paper company is expected to receive the country's first "global
validation" for its performance on carbon footprint management, in keeping with
the government's efforts to comply with international standards on reducing
carbon emission.</P>
      <P>The company, Cheng Loong Corp., made the announcement Tuesday at a seminar held
by the British Trade and Cultural Office in Taiwan on the United Kingdom 's
experiences in carbon management and emission trading.</P>
      <P>The company, with the assistance of a British consulting firm, is projected to
attain the Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS) certification for meeting criteria
for carbon emission  reduction  and fuel efficiency by the end of October, said
the company's president, Tsai Tong-ho.</P>
      <P>It will become the first corporation in Taiwan entitled to exchange trade deals
on the carbon market starting next year, he noted.</P>
      <P>Tsai estimated that 200,000 tons of carbon assets can be accumulated within the
validity length of the VCS on a market turnover of around US$1 million.</P>
      <P>According to a report by the British research institute Ecosystem Marketplace,
the trade volume of carbon assets is expected to surpass 150 million tons in
2008, which is 10 times higher than 2006.</P>
      <P>VCS is a special project which provides the alternative for businesses of non-
signatories to the Kyoto Protocol to voluntarily adhere to the regulations on
carbon emission.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is not a party to the protocol because it is not recognized as a
sovereign state, due to opposition from mainland China, which considers the
island one of its provinces.</P>

      <P>The government's plan to replace Tongyong Pinyin with Hanyu Pinyin as the
country's  standard  Mandarin romanization system will cost a maximum of NT$1
billion (US$30.69 million), Minister of Education Cheng Jei-cheng said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Asked about the issue during an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan,
Cheng dismissed as "incorrect" reports that the country would need to spend
between NT$7 billion and NT$8 billion to fully implement the switch.</P>
      <P>The Tongyong Pinyin system, used only in Taiwan, was adopted by the previous
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration.</P>
      <P>Some believe that the DPP preferred Tongyong Pinyin to the widely used Hanyu
Pinyin system because Hanyu Pinyin originated in China, but the DPP also
justified Tongyong Pinyin by saying it was more adaptable to some of the other
languages spoken in Taiwan, such as Hoklo and Hakka.</P>
      <P>The new Kuomintang administration recently decided to change the romanization
system to Hanyu Pinyin to bring Taiwan in line with international standards.</P>
      <P>The plan was immediately opposed by the seven cities and counties ruled by the
DPP, which claimed that the conversion would cost them NT$500 million.</P>
      <P>Also during the hearing, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan explained that the romanization
system is designed for people who are unfamiliar with Mandarin, and the main
consideration in choosing a system should be the convenience of foreigners.</P>
      <P>Since the United Nations has also adopted Hanyu Pinyin, Taiwan will have a
problem bridging its gap with the world if it continues using Tongyong Pinyin,
Liu contended.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou praised small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for
their longstanding efforts in helping boost the country's economy by investing
in Taiwan over the past few years.</P>
      <P>Ma lauded these engines of Taiwan's economy during a ceremony held in Taipei
City Monday to honor 18 Taiwanese SME entrepreneurs from home and abroad in
recognition of their significant contribution to the country.</P>
      <P>The president also commended the entrepreneurs for helping stabilize the
country's economy, as Taiwan's 1.24 million SMEs account for 98 percent of all
enterprises and 77 percent of the total job openings in the country.</P>
      <P>Ma said that to improve Taiwan's economic environment, the Kuomintang (KMT)
government has earmarked NT$50 billion (US$1.53 billion) since it was
inaugurated May 20 this year to expand domestic demand.</P>
      <P>Expressing confidence in the country's economy, the president said that the
government also intends to earmark more than NT$100 billion next year for public
works, Ma added.</P>
      <P>The president reaffirmed that the government has worked out a plan to inject
funds into the local stock market, whose benchmark index has plunged more than
4,100 points as of Monday since the government took office.</P>
      <P>Ma acknowledged that the global financial crisis that has battered the local
bourse has also negatively impacted the economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that Taiwan's financial sector is still functioning normally,
and that government authorities will do their utmost to map out measures to
prevent the sectors from incurring losses as a result of the crisis.</P>
      <P>As long as Taiwan steps up its risk control  and crisis management, it will ride
out the crisis, he added.</P>
      <P>The 12 SMEs based in Taiwan which won the 17th National Outstanding SMEs Awards
include Sheh Fung Screws Co. and Silicon Power Computer &amp; Communication Inc.
in the northern city of Taipei; FINETEK Co., System &amp; Technology Corp. and
Thermaltake Technology Co. in the northern county of Taipei; Longtek Scientific

      <P>Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation said the fax, received from its Chinese

      <P>Taiwan's criminal investigation police turned a Japanese murder suspect over to
three police officers from Japan Tuesday after detaining him at a sushi bar in
Taipei Oct. 9 in response to a request sent through Interpol.</P>
      <P>Keiichi Noda, 58, was escorted by the three Japanese police officers back to
Japan aboard a Japan Airlines flight to face charges of murder and robbery.</P>
      <P>The man, who sports a shaved head, allegedly intruded into a private home in
Japan's Kochi Prefecture on Sept. 19 and killed 70-year-old Toshiko Yano, the
vice president of a financial company, and ran away with 10 million yen.</P>
      <P>Japanese police believed that Noda was probably hiding in Taiwan because he left
Osaka's Kansai International Airport on a Northwest Airlines flight bound for

      <P>Taiwan's Department of Health (DOH) has asked the Malaysian government to
correct a statement over the source of Malaysia-imported biscuits' cheese
filling that was found with the industrial chemical melamine in late September,
according to DOH spokesman Wang Je-chau late Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang was referring to the issue involved with the recall of Regimen House Milk
Sandwich Biscuits by Costco Wholesale Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The biscuits were imported by Taiwan's Golden Kestrel Co. from Malaysia's Kee
Wee Hup Kee Food Manufacture, Wang said.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, a report by Malaysia's Sin Chew Daily cited Malaysia's Health
Minister Liow Tiong Lai on Oct. 4 saying that the problematic biscuits were
produced with Taiwan-made ingredients.</P>
      <P>Liow also pointed out that the Malaysian food manufacturer Kee Wee Hup Kee was
only responsible for packing and exporting the products, Wang said, citing the
report.</P>
      <P>However, Wang said investigations made by the DOH's Bureau of Food Sanitation,
and Taipei Economic and Cultural Offices in Malaysia and Singapore showed that
the biscuits did not contain ingredients from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang said that Hong Kong's Joinfair Enterprises Co. purchased cheese powder for
the biscuits' fillings from China-based Zengcheng Handyware Seasoning Co., and
mailed or hand carried the ingredients to Malaysia's Kee Wee Hup Kee, which
produced the biscuits with the cheese powder from China and other ingredients
bought in Malaysia, and exported the product to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Malaysian official's statement and Sin Chew Daily's report without

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Panamanian ambassador to Taiwan, Julio Mock, on Tuesday encouraged Taiwanese
entrepreneurs to increase their investments in Panama to reinforce the economic
and comercial cooperation between the two nations.</P>
      <P>During his "Panama: Yesterday and Today" speech given at the Institute of Latin
American Studies in the University of Tamkang, Mock reiterated that economic,
political and cultural ties between Taiwan and Panama have benefited both
countries.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan relies on Panama to distribute its merchandise to Latin America...
thanks to the newly signed free trade agreement, the exportation of Panamanian
beef to Taiwan has increased from 30 tons per year to 2,000  tons per year after
the signing  of the Taiwan-Panama Free Trade Agreement. This relationship is
clearly one of mutual benefit", said Mock.</P>
      <P>Mock noted that Panama is twice the size of Taiwan but yet it only has a
population of 3.2 million compared to Taiwan's 23 million.</P>
      <P>"The land is cheap and fertile for agricultural production. Considering Taiwan's
successful experience in agriculture, we welcome Taiwanese investments in our
country's agricultural sector. It would be a highly lucrative business",
emphasized Mock.</P>
      <P>Other investment opportunities mentioned by the ambassador were in the areas of
energy, bio-energy and oil refineries, which are closely related to the
country's future plans of expanding the Panama Canal.</P>
      <P>When asked by a student about the possible threats of a newly built  Nicaraguan
trans-oceanic  canal  to  Panama's  economic development, Mock said: "Nicaragua
is the poorest country in Central America, I seriously doubt they have the
technological and monetary capacity to sustain such a massive project."</P>
      <P>Mock reassured Taiwan that the diplomatic ties between Taiwan and Panama have
been strengthened by the signing of the Taiwan-Panama FTA, adding that the
friendship between the two nations surpasses any political interests.</P>
      <P>Despite the seemingly close diplomatic and economical ties between Taiwan and
Panama, in the past two decades, the Panamanian government has also welcomed a
variety of Chinese investments directed at the development of the ports of
Cristobal and Balboa, located accordingly in the Caribbean side and Pacific side
of the Panama Canal.</P>
      <P>It is the opinion of many scholars that the rapid increase of Chinese
investments in Panama and the new leftist movement in Latin America might
seriously damage Taiwan's ties with its Latin allies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)  lawmakers  expressed  concern
Tuesday over President Ma Ying-jeou's assurance that there will be "no war
across the Taiwan Strait in the next four years, " saying China has never shown
its good will toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stating his vision for the country's defense before top military leaders earlier
in the day, Ma declared, "there will be no war between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait in the next four years."</P>
      <P>Ma also stressed, however, that Taiwan has to maintain a strong defense even if
the country has no desire to go to war with the mainland.</P>
      <P>DPP caucus whip Lai Ching-te and Legislator Yeh Yi-jin criticized the statement
at a press conference at the Legislative Yuan, wondering what the basis was for
it.</P>
      <P>China's deployment of missiles targeting Taiwan has increased from 400 in 2000
to 1,328 in 2008, the lawmakers said, a sign of China's lack of good will toward
Taiwan over the past decade that led them to question Ma's declaration.</P>
      <P>They asked whether Chen Yunlin, president of China's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits, would be willing to display good will toward Taiwan
on behalf of China during his upcoming visit to Taiwan and promise to dismantle
the missiles.</P>
      <P>They also wondered if President Ma would be willing to ask Chen to convey to
Beijing a request to dismantle the missiles.</P>
      <P>Speculating that Ma might have signed a "secret" agreement with China to back
his peace pledge, the DPP legislative caucus demanded that any agreement signed
by Taiwan and China affecting Taiwan's future would be required to be screened
by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>They also insisted that no cross-strait agreement could take effect without a
public referendum.</P>
      <P>Among the pacts that would be subject to such a requirement would be a peace
agreement forged with China, a deal Ma has said he hopes to complete during his
term in office.</P>
      <P>Echoing the fears of his DPP colleagues that such a peace deal would be signed
in secret, DPP lawmaker Gao Jyh-peng proposed to draft a bill of regulations on
managing agreements signed by Taiwan and China that would formalize the
legislature's role in approving such accords.</P>
      <P>Gao was skeptical that Ma's so-called "peace accord" could really bring peace,
saying that China had signed a "peace accord" with Tibet but still sent troops
to crack down on democratic movements there.</P>

      <P>Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi apologized Tuesday for an incident in which a
Chinese official was shoveled to the ground by a group of protesters in Tainan
City earlier the same day, saying he would take full responsibility for the
incident.</P>
      <P>Liao said his ministry would launch an investigation into the incident to check
whether law enforcement authorities had failed in their duties.</P>
      <P>The interior minister also promised that police authorities nationwide will step
up security measures to protect Zhang's personal safety and strictly  hold those
responsible  for the incident accountable.</P>
      <P>Earlier Tuesday, Zhang Mingqing, vice president of China's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , was chased and pushed to the
ground by dozens of anti-China protesters while on a private tour to the
Confucius Temple in the southern Taiwan city.</P>
      <P>Three plainclothes policemen were present when Zhang was harassed and grabbed by
emotional demonstrators, but they did not try to stop the violence and none of
the protesters were detained at the scene.</P>
      <P>Zhang, who suffered only a slight bruise, was sent back to a hotel in Tainan
City to rest. Officials from the Interior Ministry, the quasi-official  Straits
Exchange Foundation and the ruling Kuomintang all sent officials to show concern
for Zhang.</P>
      <P>According to Justice Minister Wang Ching-feng, Zhang has filed a formal
complaint against the instigators of the incident with relevant authorities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tainan prosecutors have taken the initiative to investigate the case,
and those caught illegally using force against Zhang are likely to face charges
of hampering freedom, assault and damaging property.</P>

      <P>Fragmented human remains that may be from one of two missing pilots of a
military fighter that disappeared off Taiwan's southwestern coast were found
Tuesday, along with more debris from the aircraft, a high-ranking Air Force
officer said in Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Chang Chao-kuei, the political warfare chief of the Air Force's 427 Wing, added
that DNA tests would be required to identify the collected remains, which were
found in shallow reefs northeast of Nanwen islet in the Penghu Island chain.</P>
      <P>Chang said family members of the missing officers were extremely disturbed
emotionally when learning of the discovery. A mother couldn't stop crying and
hoped that her son would return home alive, he said.</P>
      <P>Chang further said that despite indications that fragments of the body of one of
the pilots may have been found, the military still hoped that one of the two
missing pilots had survived.</P>
      <P>The IDF (indigenous defense fighter) disappeared from radar screens while on a
bombing training mission over Penghu in the Taiwan Strait Monday morning.</P>
      <P>It took off from Chingchuangkang Airbase in Taichung County at 9: 15 a.m. and
disappeared 30 minutes later near Huayu island in Penghu County, according to
Air Force authorities.</P>
      <P>The two officers aboard the plane, pilot Capt. Ku Chih-bin and co-pilot Capt.
Chen Jian-ting, have since remained unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>IDFs, developed by Taiwan in the 1980s with assistance from the Unites States,

      <P>The cross-Taiwan Strait roundtable forum on communications and imaging arts to
be held Wednesday on the campus of National Chung Cheng University in Chiayi
County will be closed to the public, the university announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The university originally welcomed all those interested to attend the forum, but
the school authorities apparently changed their minds after seeing the head of
the Chinese delegation being bullied in Tainan by pro-independence protesters,
including a Tainan City councilor from the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>"Zhang Mingqing, vice president of China's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits, will be attending the forum in his capacity as dean of Xiamen
University's school of journalism. The forum is a purely academic discussion and
has nothing to do with politics," the university said.</P>
      <P>Chung Cheng University officials said that a top-level meeting decided that to
prevent protesters and hecklers from interrupting the forum, outsiders will not
be allowed to attend the meeting, nor will they be permitted on the university's
campus Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Zhang arrived in Taiwan Sunday at the head of a 22-member delegation to take
part in three academic seminars on Oct. 20, Oct. 22 and Oct. 24, respectively.</P>
      <P>Since his arrival, he has been constantly followed by anti-China protesters.</P>
      <P>During a visit to the Confucius Temple in Tainan Tuesday, he was besieged by a
mob that jostled him to the ground and then later chased after him, with one
protester striking a blow to the back of his head.</P>
      <P>Another protester even jumped on the roof of his car as he was about to be
driven away from the scene.</P>
      <P>Nearly all sectors of Taiwan, including The Presidential Office, the Straits
Exchange Foundation, the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , KMT legislators, business
leaders, and local chiefs of both the KMT and DPP, severely condemned the
violence.</P>

      <P>A visiting Chinese official said Tuesday that he has filed a formal complaint

the day during a visit to the Confucius Temple in Tainan City, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Zhang Mingqing,  vice president of China's Association for Relations Across the

action following the incident.</P>
      <P>"As a victim, I strongly condemn this act of violence and I have filed a

      <P>Later the same day, Tainan City Police Bureau Commissioner Chen Fu-hsiang and
Lin Chi-feng, an acting spokesman for the Tainan Prosecutors Office, both
confirmed that Zhang had filed a complaint charging that he had been assaulted.</P>
      <P>Zhang was besieged  by dozens  of pro-Taiwan  independence supporters who
shouted in his face and shoveled him to the ground as he was walking on the
temple's grounds.</P>
      <P>One protester even jumped onto the hood of Zhang's car and stamped on it with
his feet as Zhang was being escorted from the site by a local official and a
tour guide. The Chinese official was later taken to a hotel in Tainan City to
rest.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators  may have been mobilized  by Wang,  and prosecutors later
summoned Wang for questioning related to the incident.</P>
      <P>Although three plainclothes policemen were on duty at the site, they did not
stop the harassment and did not detain any of the aggressors at the scene.</P>
      <P>With police authorities tightening security measures to protect his personal

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's transportation minister said his ministry plans to present a new
environmental impact assessment report for an alternative to the existing Suhua
Highway next year, in the hope of solving eastern Taiwan's transportation
bottleneck.</P>
      <P>"(The MOTC) will present the required environmental impact assessment report in
May or June next year, " said Minister of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) Mao Chi-kuo Tuesday, when questioned by ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
Legislator Fu Kun-chi, a strong advocate of the construction of an expressway in
eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan also stressed at the legislature that his administration
had no reason to postpone the road plan, but stressed environmental assessments
needed to be conducted.</P>
      <P>He said that eastern Taiwan's transportation problems could not be solved with a
single means of transport, such as by increasing the frequency of scheduled
train service.</P>
      <P>When pressed on the new project's timetable, Mao also stressed that work on the
roadway could not begin until completion of the environmental impact assessment
panel's review process.</P>
      <P>He noted however that if the environmental assessment went smoothly,
construction on the roadway might start by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>Legislator Fu echoed the premier's view that expanding train service could not
solve eastern Taiwan's transportation bottlenecks, asserting that the railway
system could only handle 20 percent of the traffic volume on the current
roadway.</P>
      <P>Fu said that a lack of convenient transportation to eastern Taiwan has led to
high divorce and unemployment rates, as well as stagnation of trade in a region
that is already among the poorest areas in the country.</P>
      <P>The government originally designed an expressway connecting Suao in Yilan County
and Hualien in Hualien County to replace the existing windy roadway that cuts
through coastal mountains and is often blocked by landslides during heavy rains.</P>
      <P>But the project, which would have required extensive drilling of tunnels, was
highly controversial due to its potential impact on the surrounding ecosystem
and was strongly opposed by environmentalists.</P>
      <P>It was ultimately rejected last April by the environmental impact assessment
panel under the Environmental Protection Administration, and environmentalists
have described the new alternative road plan as "old wine in a new bottle."</P>

      <P>An Air Force official said Tuesday that judging by the debris it left behind, an
indigenous defense fighter (IDF) that disappeared Monday near the Penghu Island
chain may have stalled before crashing into the sea.</P>
      <P>The possible explanation of the crash was given by Shen Yi-feng, chief of staff
of the Air Force's 427th Tactical Fighter Wing, who has coordinated the search
mission for the jet fighter.</P>
      <P>But Shen said Air Force Headquarters has formed an investigation task force to
delve more deeply into the cause of the accident.</P>
      <P>A search team consisting of Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard Administration (CGA)
workers on Tuesday discovered 14 pieces of wreckage from the IDF that crashed in
waters southwest of two islets in the Taiwan-held Penghu Island chain, some of
them found on the islets themselves.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, the search team also found three pieces of human flesh while
scouring the area. The Armed Forces General Hospital in Penghu was trying to
establish whether the fragmented remains belonged to either of the two Air Force
pilots.</P>
      <P>Two Navy ships and five CGA cutters were continuing to comb the waters where the
plane is believed to have gone down.</P>
      <P>The plane, operated by pilot Capt. Ku Chih-bin and co-pilot Capt. Chen Jian-

mission over Penghu in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The IDF was developed in the 1980s by Taiwan's state-owned Aerospace Industry
Development Corp. in cooperation with General Dynamics Corp. of the United

      <P>A Chinese official who was besieged and shoved to the ground by protestors in
Tainan City Tuesday has decided to cut short his visit to Taiwan by a day and
return home from Kaohsiung Wednesday.</P>
      <P>An official of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation said Zhang Mingqing, the
vice president of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) , made the decision Tuesday afternoon, hours after he was heckled and
chased around by a group of pro-independence protesters in Tainan City.</P>
      <P>The official said SEF staff will see Zhang off at Hsiaokang International
Airport in Kaohsiung Wednesday morning.</P>
      <P>The Chinese official, who had been followed by anti-China protesters since
arriving in Taiwan Oct. 19, was shoved to the ground amid a chaotic scene while
visiting the Confucius Temple in the southern Taiwan city.</P>
      <P>He suffered a bruise to his legs and was escorted to a hotel for a brief rest.</P>
      <P>He condemned the instigators and pepetrators of the attack against him at a news
conference later in the day.</P>
      <P>"A civilized society which is ruled by law won't tolerate violence, " Zhang
said, adding that he didn't believe the group of people who went after him
represented the majority of Tainan City's people.</P>
      <P>Branding himself a victim of violence, Zhang said this incident underlines the
danger any Chinese tourist to Taiwan could face while visiting the island.</P>
      <P>"I hope what I encountered in Taiwan will pave the way for better treatment of
Chinese tourists as well as ARATS President Chen Yunlin," Zhang said.</P>
      <P>He was referring to Chen's scheduled visit to Taiwan at the end of October or in
early November.</P>
      <P>Noting that the protesters were trying to spoil the thawing ties between Taiwan
and China, Zhang said they were shooting their own feet by resorting to
violence.</P>
      <P>"They won't achieve  their goal of stopping  the peaceful development across the
strait," Zhang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taoyuan District Court ruled Tuesday to annul the election of lawmaker Liao
Cheng-ching of the ruling Kuomintang for his involvement  in bribery in the
legislative elections early this year.</P>
      <P>Right after Liao won the Jan. 12 vote in his constituency, his rival, Kuo Jung-
chung of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, filed a complaint against
him with prosecutors for alleged bribery, saying that his election should be
annulled.</P>
      <P>The court ruled that Liao bribed members of his clan and the heads of local
borough, the smallest administrative units in Taiwan, in his Taoyuan County
constituency.</P>
      <P>A borough chief known only by his surname Liao admitted in court that he
received three separate payments of NT$100,000 (US$3,077) from Liao Cheng-ching,
in exchange for wielding his influence in the borough to vote in favor of Liao
Cheng-ching.</P>
      <P>In addition, several witnesses of the Liao clan also admitted that they took
money from Liao Cheng-ching and that they were willing to accept the ruling of
deferred prosecution.</P>
      <P>The court also said in its ruling  that Liao Cheng-ching commissioned a borough
chief surnamed Chen to pass NT$30,000 to his counterparts to subsidize their
phone and gasoline expenses in mobilizing voters.</P>
      <P>Although other borough chiefs did not agree to cast their votes for Liao Cheng-
ching, the court said that this did not change the fact that he was engaged in
bribery.</P>
      <P>Upon hearing the verdict, Liao said that he would appeal and that justice will
vindicate him, adding that he has served in public office for four decades and
has always abided by the law.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Central Election Commission (CEC) said that Liao's fate is not
yet final.</P>
      <P>CEC Secretary-General Teng Tien-yu said that only if the Taiwan High Court
upholds the annulment of Liao's election on appeal, will the election body
organize a by-election if needed.</P>
      <P>He said that in line with Public Officials Election and Recall Law, regulations,
if the election of a regional lawmaker is annulled, the election commission will
have to conduct a by-election within three months after receiving the verdict.</P>
      <P>For those whose remaining tenure is less than one year, however, no by-election
is necessary.</P>

      <P>Tainan City Police Bureau Commissioner Chen Fu-hsiang was transferred by the
National Police Agency (NPA) to take responsibility for an incident in which a
Chinese official was shoved to the ground by protesters in the city Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen was transferred to the post of deputy director-general of the National
Highway Police Bureau, according to a statement released by the NPA.</P>
      <P>NPA Director-General Wang Cho-chiun has submitted an application for his own
punishment over the incident to the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>Earlier Tuesday, Zhang Mingqing, vice president of China's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , was besieged by dozens of anti-
China protesters and shoved to the ground while on a private tour to the
Confucius Temple in the southern Taiwan city.</P>
      <P>Three plainclothes policemen were present when the incident took place, but they
apparently did not try to stop the violence and none of the protesters were
detained at the scene.</P>
      <P>Zhang, who suffered only a slight bruise, was sent back to a hotel in Tainan
City to rest.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Interior Ministry, the quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation and the ruling Kuomintang all sent officials to express their concern
for Zhang.</P>
      <P>Chen's transfer and disciplinary action against other policemen came after
Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi apologized over the incident and vowed that his
ministry would launch an investigation to determine if law enforcement
authorities had failed in their duties.</P>
      <P>The investigation showed that the Tainan City Police Bureau failed to respond
quickly to Zhang's change of itinerary to prevent the incident, the statement
said.</P>
      <P>The NPA has asked police forces of five cities and counties in southern Taiwan
to step up protection of Zhang's personal safety, the statement said.</P>
      <P>According to Justice Minister Wang Ching-feng, Zhang has filed a formal
complaint against the instigators of the incident with relevant authorities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tainan prosecutors have decided to investigate the case, and those
found to have illegally bullied Zhang are likely to face charges of hampering
freedom, assault and damaging property.</P>

      <P>The incident that saw a visiting Chinese official jostled to the ground by anti-
China protesters will not affect the scheduled visit to Taiwan of Chen Yunlin,
China's top negotiator with Taiwan, the Executive Yuan spokeswoman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Soon after the incident, speculation arose that it might possibly affect Chen's
planned visit at the end of October or early November, but Government
Information Office Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih said the trip would not be
affected.</P>
      <P>Shih said that despite the lapse in security Tuesday, there would be tight
security measures in place to ensure Chen's safety during his visit</P>
      <P>The spokeswoman said the government denounced Tuesday's act of violence against
Zhang Mingqing, vice president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Zhang was besieged by a group of emotional protesters during a visit earlier in
the day to the Confucius Temple in Tainan City, a stronghold of the pro-
independence opposition Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Television footage showed Zhang being grabbed and shouted at by the protestors
and then falling to the ground after being shoved, possibly inadvertently, by
two of the protesters.</P>
      <P>Shih said the Executive Yuan has dispatched Vice Minister of the Interior Chien
Tai-lang to visit Zhang after the incident.</P>
      <P>Saying that the Taiwanese  are a polite,  hospitable  and peace-loving people,
Shih said the "irrational behavior was not in line with the expectations of
Taiwan's people."</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan believes that no matter the circumstances, people should
express their opinions in a peaceful and rational manner.</P>
      <P>Shih admitted that the measures to provide security for Zhang, who is visiting
Taiwan in his capacity as a scholar and not as vice president of ARATS, were not
very tight.</P>

      <P>A visiting Chinese official said Tuesday that he has filed a formal complaint

the day during a visit to the Confucius Temple in Tainan City, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Zhang Mingqing,  vice president of China's Association for Relations Across the

action following the incident.</P>
      <P>"As a victim, I strongly condemn this act of violence and I have filed a

      <P>Later the same day, Tainan City Police Bureau Commissioner Chen Fu-hsiang and

confirmed that Zhang had filed a complaint charging that he had been assaulted.</P>
      <P>Zhang was besieged  by dozens  of pro-Taiwan  independence supporters who
shouted in his face and shoveled him to the ground as he was walking on the
temple's grounds.</P>
      <P>One protester even jumped onto the hood of Zhang's car and stamped on it with
his feet as Zhang was being escorted from the site by a local official and a
tour guide. The Chinese official was later taken to a hotel in Tainan City to
rest.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators  may have been mobilized  by Wang,  and prosecutors later
summoned Wang for questioning related to the incident.</P>

      <P>A visiting Chinese official who was jostled to the ground by protesters in the
southern city of Tainan a day earlier cut short his stay and left Taiwan
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Zhang Mingqing, vice president of the Beijing-based semi-official Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , was escorted under tight
security by police at Kaohsiung International Airport, where he was again
followed by a group of protesters.</P>
      <P>Seeing Zhang off at the airport, Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman
Chiang Pin-kung apologized to Zhang over the incident and expressed the hope
that it would not affect ARATS President Chen Yunlin's visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Zhang told reporters shortly before his departure that he decided to return to
China a day early because he was sore from a leg injury he suffered when he hit
the ground during Tuesday's incident.</P>
      <P>Also, Zhang said he would feel bad if his stay were to require the protection of
a large police force, which would incur high social costs.</P>
      <P>Zhang said he believes the protesters represented only a small minority of
people in Taiwan and that they will not succeed in their attempt to sabotage
cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges and hamper the development of cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Zhang said his stay in Tainan over the last three days has given him an
unforgettable impression, not because of the violent incident, but because of
the warmth extended to him by various sectors in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At the head of a 22-member delegation, Zhang arrived in Taiwan Sunday to take

      <P>Taiwan has grounded all military aircraft, except for those on search and
routine patrol missions, for safety checks after a jet fighter and anti-
submarine helicopter crashed on consecutive days, the Defense Minister Chen
Chao-min said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen told lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan Foreign Affairs and National Defense
Committee that all military aircraft not on search and patrol missions have been
grounded for three days and will not be allowed back in the air until they pass
a new round of safety checks.</P>
      <P>Chen said he felt "sorry, upset and extremely sad" over the crash of an anti-
submarine helicopter off Taiwan's east coast Tuesday evening -- the second
military tragedy in two days.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese-made indigenous defense fighter (IDF) went missing near the Taiwan-
held Penghu Islands chain Monday morning.</P>
      <P>"I offer my utmost apology to the country for the loss of the two military
aircraft and the lives of the people aboard," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The S-70C anti-submarine helicopter, carrying five officers, crashed in waters
62 nautical miles off Hualien County in eastern Taiwan around 6: 44 p.m.
Tuesday, leaving one dead, two injured, and another two missing.</P>
      <P>Helicopter captain Liu Shih-chen, who sustained serious but not life-threatening
injuries, and head mechanic Tang Chih-hsun, who suffered cuts on his right leg,
were airlifted from Hualien Armed Forces General  Hospital  by helicopter

treatment.</P>
      <P>As of press time, the Navy as well as the Coast Guard were still searching for

      <P>The fifth crew member, surveillance petty officer Chu Chun-teh, was killed in
the crash, and his body has been retrieved from the sea.</P>

      <P>The British Council Taipei has invited a well-known creative industries
consultant and trainer, David Parish, to share the secrets of starting up new
businesses with potential creative industry entrepreneurs in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's creative industries have become a "hot" sector, British
Council Director Christine Skinner said it is time to consider the next step for
Taiwan's creative industries and bring together creative passion and top
business practices.</P>
      <P>Creative industries are worth investing in, Skinner said at a news conference
held Tuesday to promote a book by Parish and a series of events in which he will
participate at the upcoming Taiwan International Creative and Industries
Exhibition.</P>
      <P>Architecture, design, music, films, literature, all of that adds to the quality
of people's lives and adds to people's sense of pride,she added.</P>
      <P>It is based on that belief that the British Council decided to translate
Parish's book, titledT-Shirts and Suits: A Guide to The Business of Creativity,
into a traditional-Chinese e-book that is free to download.</P>
      <P>Describing the relationship between people who work in the creative industries
and businessmen asrock stars versus their managers, Skinner said the book is not
about taming artists into becoming business people.</P>
      <P>It just demonstrates that actually developing business skills is just not that
hard. It's fast and simple and artists can do it, Skinner said, calling the book
practical and straightforward without stifling creativity.</P>
      <P>Noting that the British Council has done lots of work in the area of creative
industries and still wants to do more, Skinner said the sector can be absolutely
beneficial for a place like Taiwan which is full of fabulous cultural industries
and creative industries with a real interest in the arts, culture, design, and
architecture.</P>
      <P>We think this is the right kind of thing for Taiwan,she said.</P>
      <P>Parish is a business adviser, trainer and management consultant who works with
creative businesses. Over the past few years, he has also been working with the
United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization as the
director of theSharing Best Practices in the Creative Industriesproject.</P>
      <P>Parish will visit Taiwan from Oct. 23-28 to give a series of lectures on how to
integrate creativity and business.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1934 and operating in 109 countries and territories, the British
Council is the U.K.s international cultural relations organization.</P>
      <P>The British Council Taipei was established in 1996 to build a mutually
beneficial relationship between people in the U.K. and Taiwan and to increase
the appreciation among Taiwan's people of the U.K.'s creative ideas and
achievements.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Speaker welcomes handling incident through legal channels</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng lauded the decision by a Chinese official
who was harassed and jostled to the ground by a group of protesters to file a
complaint over the incident through legal channels.</P>
      <P>Zhang Mingqing, the vice president of Beijing's Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) , filed a complaint with law enforcement authorities
in the southern city of Tainan Tuesday after he was besieged by pro-independence
protesters.</P>
      <P>The group shouted in his face and shoved him to the ground during a visit to the
Confucius Temple in Tainan City.</P>
      <P>"Turning the incident into a legal case is a good way to handle the matter,"
Wang said.</P>
      <P>Some opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators defended the
protesters' action, with one calling it "a relatively lenient way of treating
Zhang by the Taiwanese people."</P>
      <P>But Wang said meeting the ARATS deputy head in a violent way was not conducive
to creating a peaceful atmosphere across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"People from the two sides should show respect and courtesy to each other for
the purposes of creating peace, prosperity and a bright future," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang called on local citizens to reflect on their behavior and adjust it
accordingly, saying that "it is the responsibility of the citizens of a
democratic nation to treat every visitor from outside the country with
courtesy."</P>
      <P>On criticism of the abrupt removal of the Tainan City Police Department chief
from his post Tuesday in the wake of the incident, Wang said Taiwan is a
multicultural society where differing voices are tolerated.</P>
      <P>"Some people may think that the National Police Agency was doing the right thing
by stripping the Tainan police chief of his post quickly, " Wang said, adding
that everybody should respect the decisions made by the executive authorities.</P>
      <P>DPP supporters have argued that the NPA's decision to remove the Tainan police

      <P>A government-run agricultural research center in the eastern county of Taitung
has decided to promote the planting and use of Chinese soapberries, a common
cleaning agent in pre-industrial times, researchers said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Taitung District Agricultural Research and Extension Station,
an affiliate of the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture,  explained that before
soaps and other artificial cleaning agents were mass produced, people in rural
areas in Taiwan tended to made "do-it-yourself" soaps from the fruit of the
Chinese soapberry tree, or sapindus mukorossii gaerm.</P>
      <P>Recent research indicates, however, that the fruit's shell, which contains the
natural cleaning agent saponin, also has anti-viral and antibiotic properties,
leading the station to encourage the wider planting of the Chinese soapberry as
a new cash crop and promote its use as an ingredient in lotions, soaps,
cosmetics, and biomedical products.</P>
      <P>Staffers said the station will hold a public presentation on Oct. 25 to further
explain the use of Chinese soapberry and present the applications developed at
the station.</P>
      <P>Many advocates of natural living in the West are already touting the soapberry
as a natural replacement for chemical detergents, especially since it can be
grown in sufficient quantities to satisfy strong demand.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Majority supports planned visit by China's top negotiator: survey</HEADLINE>

      <P>A majority of people responding to a recent survey are in favor of the planned
visit of a high-ranking Chinese official to Taiwan, despite strong opposition to
the visit by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,  pollsters said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the survey conducted by Global Views Monthly, 50.3
percent of the respondents supported the upcoming visit by Chen Yunlin,
president of China's semi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) , while 31.2 percent of respondents opposed it.</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out Oct. 14-16 via telephone among 1,005 adults around
Taiwan. It had a margin of error of plus/minus 3.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen is expected to arrive in Taiwan in late October or early November for a
second round of talks with his Taiwanese counterpart, Chiang Pin-kung from the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>Chen and Chiang last held talks in June in Beijing, during which they signed
agreements on the launch of cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights on weekends and
the arrival of Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Items on the agenda for the upcoming encounter are expected to include the
launch of cross-strait cargo charter flights and direct shipping links and the
establishment of more direct cross-strait air routes.</P>
      <P>When respondents were asked about their opinions on the upcoming talks and which
agreements would benefit Taiwan, the most popular choice favored by 64.3 percent
of respondents was an agreement on a cross-strait reporting system on food
safety issues.</P>
      <P>Some 62.8 percent cited the launch of cross-strait cargo charter services as
being helpful, 61.9 percent thought the opening of direct shipping links would
provide a boost, and 58.2 percent felt extending the weekend cross-strait
charter services to all days of the week would be beneficial.</P>
      <P>Another 57 percent of respondents thought an increase in the number of routes
and flights included in the charter services would be helpful, 56.2 percent felt
the opening of more direct cross-strait air routes would be beneficial, and 51.3
percent said the expansion of Chinese tourist arrivals to Taiwan would help.</P>
      <P>When respondents were asked which of the potential agreements would benefit
themselves or their families or relatives, only an agreement on a cross-strait
reporting system on food safety issues received majority support -- 56.9
percent.</P>
      <P>None of the other choices were selected by a majority of respondents.</P>
      <P>The DPP is scheduled to hold a demonstration in Taipei Oct. 25 ahead of Chen's
visit to express its opposition to the "one China market, the downgrading of
Taiwan's sovereignty and an incompetent government."</P>
      <P>The DPP has accused President Ma Ying-jeou of sacrificing Taiwan's sovereignty
by adopting a "modus vivendi" approach that advocates a "diplomatic truce" with
China and introducing a series of cross-strait liberalization measures since his
May 20 inauguration.</P>
      <P>The party is also dissatisfied with what it contends is the Ma administration's
failure to take a tough stance toward China in dealing with the scare over
melamine-tainted processed food and ingredients imported from China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH to take action to narrow health insurance deficit next year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said Wednesday that measures
such as raising the health charge on cigarettes and the insurance premiums of
the wealthy will be needed next year to reduce the national health insurance
program's growing deficit.</P>
      <P>At a committee hearing in the Legislative Yuan, legislators expressed concern
over the health insurance system's serious deficit as they reviewed the DOH's
budget.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that the DOH needed to find ways to plug the gap, Yeh said he
expected to increase the compulsory "health donation" imposed on each pack of
cigarettes to NT$20 (US$0.60) from the current NT$10, and raise the premiums of
high-income earners by the end of this year or early next year.</P>
      <P>"Preparations are underway, but we will present the plan (to the Legislative
Yuan) at an appropriate moment," Yeh said, adding that he preferred waiting
until the domestic economic situation was less tense.</P>
      <P>By increasing the so-called health tax, the Bureau of National Health Insurance
would receive an estimated NT$16-18 billion in added revenues per year, Yeh
said.</P>
      <P>At present, an NT$11.8 tobacco tax is also levied on each pack of cigarettes,
but while most of the health charge goes to the health insurance bureau,
revenues from the tobacco tax are allocated to general government expenditures.</P>
      <P>Yeh also said he plans to raise premiums paid by the wealthy while lowering
those paid by underprivileged members of society, but did not provide any
further details on the income levels at which such adjustments would kick in.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of National Health Insurance warned Wednesday that with the insurance
premium rate having been maintained at 4.55 percent in 2008, the bureau would
run an accumulated deficit of about NT$32.6 billion for the year.</P>
      <P>It had proposed raising the rate to 5.18 percent in April to keep the deficit
from growing, but most legislators opposed the idea.</P>
      <P>In addition, President Ma Ying-jeou promised during his campaign that premiums
would not be raised before the country's economic growth rate increased.</P>
      <P>Premiums have only been raised once --from 4.25 percent to 4.55 percent in 2002
-- since the system was put into effect in 1995.</P>

      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung called for continued
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait Wednesday, and apologized for an assault
against a visiting Chinese official.</P>
      <P>"I hope that normal cross-strait exchanges and a planned visit by ARATS
President Chen Yunlin would not be affected by the isolated incident involving
ARATS Vice President Zhang Mingqing in Taiwan, " Chiang told reporters following
a nearly 30-minute meeting with Zhang at the Kaohsiung International Airport in
southern Taiwan before Zhang's departure.</P>
      <P>Zhang, who was pulled and pushed to the ground Tuesday by a group of anti-China
protesters in Taiwan's southern Tainan City, cut short his visit by two days and
flew back to Beijing Wednesday morning, saying he felt sore from the assault and
did not want to cause local police any additional inconvenience  and expenses in
terms of providing extra protection for him.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, Zhang told him during the meeting that he was confident
cross-strait relations would not be hobbled by the incident and added that he
would handle two-way exchanges in a "business as usual" manner.</P>
      <P>Zhang was besieged by dozens of pro-independence supporters led by a Tainan City
councilor who shouted in his face and jostled him to the ground while he was
touring the Confucius Temple in Tainan City, accompanied only by a local
official and tour guide.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators were mobilized by Tainan City Councilor Wang Ting-yu of the
main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , and prosecutors later
summoned Wang for questioning regarding the incident.</P>
      <P>Wang told a news conference later that day that the incident mainly resulted
from Zhang's remarks shortly before his visit to the temple that "without Taiwan
independence, there will not be war."</P>
      <P>Zhang suffered minor injuries in his right leg and waist and had his injuries
x-rayed at a hospital in Tainan. The Chinese official filed a charge of assault
against his attackers with local law enforcement authorities Tuesday.</P>
      <P>SEF and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) are
quasi-official organizations representing Taipei and Beijing, respectively, in
handling bilateral activities in the absence of government-to-government contact
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The attack against Zhang came ahead of what will be a landmark visit to Taiwan
by ARATS President Chen Yunlin later this month or early next month.</P>
      <P>Chen serves as China's top negotiator with Taiwan and will be the highest
ranking Chinese official to visit the island since the two sides began a
dialogue in 1992.</P>
      <P>He is slated to hold talks with Chiang on expanding regular direct flights and
other two-way exchanges.</P>
      <P>At a news conference Wednesday, members of the legislative caucus of the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) asked DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ying-wen to harshly punish the
culprits and demanded that the law enforcement authorities investigate the case
in depth and hold those responsible accountable.</P>
      <P>They raised concerns that foreign tourists would be afraid to come to Taiwan in
the face of the DPP supporters' rude behavior against Zhang, who visited Taiwan
for an academic seminar.</P>
      <P>As the head of a 22-member delegation, Zhang arrived in Taiwan Sunday for a
four-day visit. He took part in a seminar Monday at Tainan National University
of the Arts in Tainan County, in his capacity as dean of the school of
journalism at Xiamen University.</P>
      <P>A group of about 200 anti-China protesters demonstrated outside the university,
with one protester heckling him while he made a speech.</P>

      <P>In an effort to raise the employment rate amid the global economic downturn, the
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) will invest NT$3.7 billion to implement a series
of measures to help people find jobs, said CLA Minister Wang Ju-hsuan Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"These short-term measures to boost employment are expected to help 30,000
jobless people," said Wang at a press conference, adding that the CLA will
assess the economic situation to decide whether to expand the program.</P>
      <P>Under the program, enterprises will be offered incentives to hire jobless
Taiwanese workers. Enterprises that provide a job for an unemployed person who
was without a job for three or more consecutive months will be eligible to
apply, before March 2009, for a monthly subsidy of NT$10,000 over a six-month
period.</P>
      <P>In addition, local authorities that offer temporary jobs to underprivileged
workers, in areas such as outdoor cleaning, tour guide services and community
care services, will be eligible to a daily subvention of NT$800, or NT$17,600
per month, according to the CLA.</P>
      <P>Enterprises approved by the CLA may also apply for a six-month subvention if
they hire young first-time job seekers who have been unemployed for a long
period of time, Wang said.</P>
      <P>She urged non-governmental organizations to come up with plans to help jobless
people find employment, saying that the CLA will offer subsidies to
organizations that do so.  Due to the current financial crisis in the United
States, the stock market slump and other economic factors, the number of jobless
people has increased to more than 464,000, according to CLA estimates.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate also reached 4.27 percent in September, marking the

      <P>Twenty-two naval officers, including the commander of the Republic of China
Navy, have been disciplined over the grounding of the Kuang Hua No. 6 Missile
Speedboat off the coast of southern Taiwan in late September, Minister of
National Defense Chen Chao-min disclosed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Answering questions before the Legislative Yuan's Foreign and National Defense
Committee, Chen said that in a review report on the accident, the Ministry of
National Defense concluded that human error was the direct cause of the boat's
grounding off the coast of Chiayi County while it was taking part in the Han
Kuang No. 24 Military Exercise.</P>
      <P>As a result, the ministry penalized the 22 naval officers responsible for the
accident in accordance with its penal code, he said.</P>
      <P>The fast-attack missile boat ran aground Sept. 25 in bad weather. The 14 crewmen
on board were rescued shortly after the mishap.</P>
      <P>In the following days, rescue workers from the Navy removed the four Hsiung Feng
anti-ship missiles, the navigation system and other important equipment from the
vessel.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 10, a salvage team of the Navy used two giant cranes to pull the 150-ton
boat out of shallow waters and towed it to Chiayi County's Budai harbor for a
preliminary welding job to repair the vessel before moving it to Kaohsiung
harbor in southern Taiwan for an overhaul.</P>
      <P>Although the hull of the boat appeared in a satisfactory condition, Navy frogmen
who inspected the damage below water said they discovered five holes in the
bottom of the vessel.</P>
      <P>The missile boat is a prototype designed by the Navy under its Kuang Hua No. 6
Missile Speedboat Plan to phase out the 50-ton Seagull-Class missile boats. It
is 34 meters long and 7.6 meters wide, with a top speed of 34 knots.</P>
      <P>Under the Kuang Hua No. 6 plan, 30 boats will be built at a cost of about NT$400
million (US$12.29 million) each. The state-run Kaohsiung-based CSBC Corp. Taiwan
-- the nation's largest shipbuilder -- began building the boats in November
2007.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that he hopes relations between Taiwan and
France will be enhanced with the help of Patrick Bonneville, the new director-
general of the French Institute in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in a meeting at the Presidential Office with Bonneville, who
assumed his post in September.</P>
      <P>Ma said Bonneville, who is very familiar with Asian affairs and speaks good
Mandarin, will help facilitate the continued growth of the bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that the two countries have developed close trade
relations and enjoy an annual bilateral trade volume of US$6 billion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and France also have close cultural interactions, he noted. Citing the
popularity of the exhibition of French artist Jean-Francois Millet's works that
ended in early September in Taiwan, Ma said French fine art is appreciated by
many Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>The two countries have also cooperated in the area of technology for many years,
Ma said, noting that the French-made Mirage aircraft is the mainstay of Taiwan's
air defense.</P>
      <P>Bonneville said he viewed his posting to Taiwan as a great honor. The French
government highly values its relations with Taiwan, as French businesses have
invested substantially in Taiwan, which is the world's 15th largest economy, he
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP calls for participation in Saturday's mass protest rally</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 22 (CNA)
10/22/08  22:40:39

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen on
Wednesday called on the public to join an upcoming mass protest, which is being
sponsored by the DPP, to make their views known to the government.</P>
      <P>Tsai, at a news conference to promote the Oct. 25 demonstration, said the party
has three questions for President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>The first question is "whether his promise that the future of Taiwan will be
decided by Taiwan's 23 million people still counts, " she said.</P>
      <P>The second is whether he defines Taiwan as an area or a sovereign independent
country, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>She was referring to Ma's remarks in a recent interview with a foreign media
service that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have special  relations,  but
not  a  state-to-state  relationship. Presidential  Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi
later described the relations between Taiwan and the mainland as relations
between the Taiwan area and the mainland area.</P>
      <P>Finally, Tsai said, the party wants to know if the Ma administration intends to
ask China to apologize and compensate Taiwan for exporting toxic foods,
including melamine-contaminated dairy products, to the island, which caused a
scare among the local people.</P>
      <P>She noted that after the August 30 "People's Outcry" march against Ma
administration's tilt towards China and the economic woes, the president
commented that only 50,000 had joined the protest. This shows that the president
has only "numbers" on his mind, she added.</P>
      <P>The August march, sponsored by pro-independence civic group Taiwan Society, drew
a far greater number of protesters than 50,000, according to the DPP estimate.</P>
      <P>Although Ma said he hoped his performance would live up to the expectations of
the people, the discrepancy between his actions and his promises has widened,
Tsai claimed.</P>
      <P>Also attending the news conference were former DPP chairmen Yao Chia-wen, Yu
Shyi-kun, Su Cheng-chang and all the DPP central standing committee members. Two
other former chairmen, Hsu Hsin-liang and Frank Hsieh, were absent.</P>
      <P>The Ma administration should not allow China's top liaison official to come to
Taiwan, otherwise the Taiwan people would "take substantial action to express
their views on safeguarding Taiwan's sovereignty," Su said.</P>
      <P>Su was referring to a planned visit later this month or next month by Chen
Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DPP decided after its central standing committee meeting
Wednesday that Saturday's rally will not be extended to a night vigil.</P>
      <P>The party will postpone the date for the vigil until Chen arrives in order to
drive home its appeal, Cheng Wen-tsang, director of the DPP's Department of
Culture and Information, said.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that the party will set a new date to hold the vigil, originally
scheduled for Oct. 28-30, and the "safeguarding Taiwan" night rally that was
slated for Oct. 31 in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairwoman Wang Ju-hsuan announced  several
employment  stimulus  measures Wednesday to help people in need and she urged
companies to hire more jobless people.</P>
      <P>In a letter sent to enterprises, Wang asked business owners to join the CLA's
employment stimulus program to provide the jobless with employment opportunities
at a time when the whole world is experiencing a financial squeeze and an
economic downturn.</P>
      <P>One of the measures is to increase the number of temporary jobs for unemployed
members of underprivileged families, Wang said, disclosing that some 2,500
temporary jobs offered by the CAL in September had all been snapped up.</P>
      <P>Wang said the CLA plans to provide an additional 6,000 temporary jobs in the
public sector for a period of six months to one year. The measure is aimed at
helping to provide some income to members of underprivileged families who have
been unemployed for a long time, she explained.</P>
      <P>Such short-term jobs will include street cleaning and tour guide and community
services, and will offer a daily subsidy of NT$800 for 22 days in each month
during the period from November this year to April next year, Wang said.</P>
      <P>About 452,000 people were jobless in August,  marking  an unemployment rate of
4.1 percent, according to statistics compiled by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS). The jobless rate for September rose
further 4.27 percent.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Wang said, the CLA will earmark NT$3.7 billion (US$113
million) to help at least 30,000 jobless people find employment. This project
will go into effect immediately and will run until the end of June next year,
she said.</P>
      <P>Under another "Get to Work" plan by the CLA, companies that hire a Taiwanese
worker who has been jobless for three or more consecutive months will be
entitled to a CLA subsidy of NT$10,000 per month for a maximum period of six
months, according to Wang. Some 10,000 people are expected to find placements in
the initial stages of the plan, she said.</P>

      <P>The deputy head of Taiwan's quasi-official intermediary body for engagement with
China is currently in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen to work on an agenda
for a second round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks, a senior official confirmed
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman and secretary-general of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), traveled to Shenzhen earlier in the day to negotiate the
agenda for a second round of talks with the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)," said Liu Te-shun, vice chairman of
the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>As the topics to be discussed in the second round of the SEF-ARATS talks will
include transportation and health issues, Liu said, both the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) and the Department of Health (DOH) have
sent staff members to accompany Kao on his current visit.</P>
      <P>Liu, however, would not reveal the level of the ARATS official with whom Kao is
dealing, saying only the ARATS representative is at a level parallel to Kao's.</P>
      <P>As to whether Kao will touch on the issue of the itinerary for the ARATS chief's
planned visit to Taiwan to meet a second time since June with his SEF
counterpart Chiang Pin-kung, Liu said Kao's talks will focus on the agenda for
the Chiang-Chen meeting and will not touch on the schedule for Chen's visit.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, Chen's Taiwan itinerary will be addressed during a preliminary
round of consultations and the dates for the preliminary round of talks will be
announced later.</P>
      <P>Liu said Kao will return to Taipei in the next couple of days.</P>
      <P>Despite an incident in which an ARATS deputy chief, Zhang Mingqing, was besieged
and jostled to the ground by pro-independence activists during a visit to the
southern Taiwan city of Tainan Tuesday, Chen Yunlin, China's top liaison with
Taiwan, will visit Taiwan later this year as originally scheduled, officials
from both sides of the Taiwan Strait confirmed Wednesday.</P>

      <P>A human resource consultant company said Wednesday that given the global credit
crisis, many enterprises in Taiwan may lay off staff after the Lunar New Year
and that the government should focus its efforts on supporting small and medium
enterprises.</P>
      <P>Wu Rey-yin, CEO of 1111 Human Resource Bank, said that many enterprises are
planning to cut staff to lower their operating costs. If the economic slowdown
continues, layoffs may increase after the Lunar New Year, he added.</P>
      <P>Unemployment for September reached 4.27 percent, and enterprises are cutting
costs by slashing employee salaries, Wu said, adding that all this points to an
economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>Wu said that according to government statistics, small and medium business
enterprises employed 77.12 percent of the workforce in Taiwan at the end of
2007.</P>
      <P>Given this figure, he recommended that the government should focus its efforts
on supporting these enterprises as a means of rescuing the economy.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, many employees tend to switch jobs and employers make staff changes
during the Lunar New Year, which is when most enterprises give year-end bonuses.</P>

been unemployed for a long time, she explained.</P>
      <P>Such short-term jobs will include street cleaning and tour guide and community
services, and will offer a daily subsidy of NT$800 for 22 days in each month
during the period from November this year to April next year, Wang said.</P>
      <P>About 452,000 people were jobless in August,  marking  an unemployment rate of
4.1 percent, according to statistics compiled by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS). The jobless rate for September rose
further 4.27 percent.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Wang said, the CLA will earmark NT$3.7 billion (US$113
million) to help at least 30,000 jobless people find employment. This project
will go into effect immediately and will run until the end of June next year,
she said.</P>
      <P>Under another "Get to Work" plan by the CLA, companies that hire a Taiwanese
worker who has been jobless for three or more consecutive months will be
entitled to a CLA subsidy of NT$10,000 per month for a maximum period of six
months, according to Wang. Some 10,000 people are expected to find placements in
the initial stages of the plan, she said.</P>

      <P>The deputy head of Taiwan's quasi-official intermediary body for engagement with
China is currently in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen to work on an agenda
for a second round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks, a senior official confirmed
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman and secretary-general of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), traveled to Shenzhen earlier in the day to negotiate the
agenda for a second round of talks with the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)," said Liu Te-shun, vice chairman of
the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>As the topics to be discussed in the second round of the SEF-ARATS talks will
include transportation and health issues, Liu said, both the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) and the Department of Health (DOH) have
sent staff members to accompany Kao on his current visit.</P>
      <P>Liu, however, would not reveal the level of the ARATS official with whom Kao is
dealing, saying only the ARATS representative is at a level parallel to Kao's.</P>
      <P>As to whether Kao will touch on the issue of the itinerary for the ARATS chief's
planned visit to Taiwan to meet a second time since June with his SEF
counterpart Chiang Pin-kung, Liu said Kao's talks will focus on the agenda for
the Chiang-Chen meeting and will not touch on the schedule for Chen's visit.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, Chen's Taiwan itinerary will be addressed during a preliminary
round of consultations and the dates for the preliminary round of talks will be
announced later.</P>
      <P>Liu said Kao will return to Taipei in the next couple of days.</P>
      <P>Despite an incident in which an ARATS deputy chief, Zhang Mingqing, was besieged
and jostled to the ground by pro-independence activists during a visit to the
southern Taiwan city of Tainan Tuesday, Chen Yunlin, China's top liaison with
Taiwan, will visit Taiwan later this year as originally scheduled, officials
from both sides of the Taiwan Strait confirmed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Zhang, who was visiting Taiwan as a journalism scholar, cut short his visit and

ended in early September in Taiwan, Ma said French fine art is appreciated by
many Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>The two countries have also cooperated in the area of technology for many years,
Ma said, noting that the French-made Mirage aircraft is the mainstay of Taiwan's
air defense.</P>
      <P>Bonneville said he viewed his posting to Taiwan as a great honor. The French
government highly values its relations with Taiwan, as French businesses have

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday  that exchanges  between
Taiwan's  and Japan's  local governments are very close, noting that the number
of Japanese governors visiting Taiwan so far this year has already reached a
record high.</P>
      <P>"To date, 12 Japanese local governors have visited or are scheduled to visit
Taiwan this year, which is a record, " said Hsu Juei-hu, deputy secretary-
general of the MOFA's Association of East Asian Relations, at a regular press
briefing.</P>
      <P>He added that several mayors and magistrates from Taipei, Kaohsiung, Tainan,
Chiayi, Hualien and other cities and counties in Taiwan have also visited Japan
this year.</P>
      <P>Masanori Tanimoto, governor of Japan's Ishikawa Prefecture, and Wataru Aso,
governor of Fukuoka, are slated to visit Taiwan Nov. 5-7 and Nov. 10-12,

      <P>Since 1976, the annual meeting has been held alternately in Tokyo and Taipei

Japan's Interchange Association -- the two quasi-official organizations in
charge of bilateral relations since Japan switched diplomatic recognition from
Taipei to Beijing in 1972.</P>
      <P>Asked about other aspects of exchanges between Taiwan and Japan, Hsu said the
two countries have been discussing launching a working holiday visa program that
would allow young people to supplement their travel through incidental

      <P>"We've been engaged in talks with our Japanese counterparts on the issue and

      <P>Ridership on the Kaohsiung MRT on Wednesday -- the first day of service at
regular fares -- was down by 12,000 over the level for the previous day, the
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Fares on the southern port city's MRT had been reduced to NT$15 (US$0.45) for

114,000, according to KRTC stats.</P>
      <P>With the launch of regular fares Wednesday, the KRTC also began offering
15-percent discounts for passengers using I-Pass cards.</P>
      <P>Huang Yi-chung, director of the KRTC's Public Affairs Department, said that the

both costs and ridership  numbers  into consideration.</P>
      <P>He added that the KRTC will be looking particularly closely at what effect the
discounted fare has on weekend passenger numbers following the launch of regular
fare rates.</P>
      <P>Huang also confirmed that although ridership was down by 12,000 on Wednesday,
the KRTC's total revenue from ticket sales for the day was higher than during
the period of discounted fares of NT$15.</P>

      <P>The Taipei-based Chinese National Federation of Industries (CNFI) announced
Thursday that it will try its best to provide 5,000 openings for the country's
jobless to work for a maximum period of six months.</P>
      <P>The commitment, announced by CNFI Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung, represented a
favorable and immediate response to a package of employment stimulus measures
put forward by Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Minister Wang Ju-hsuan the day
before.</P>
      <P>One CLA program, dubbed "Get to work immediately, " invites privately run
companies to hire Taiwanese workers who have been jobless for three or more
consecutive months to work at their companies for a maximum period of six
months.</P>
      <P>These companies would then be entitled to a CLA subsidy of NT$10,000 per month
for each newly hired worker.</P>
      <P>The CLA is planning to help some 10,000 people find jobs under this program,
according to Wang.</P>
      <P>The CNFI chairman made the commitment during a luncheon with Wang and other CLA
officials Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the luncheon, the CLA minister quoted statistics compiled by the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, indicating that some
464,000 people were jobless in September, marking an unemployment rate of 4.27
percent -- the highest for the past four years.</P>
      <P>"The figures are alarmingly high and I appeal to all members of the public and
private sectors -- management and workers alike -- to make concerted efforts to
help the country survive the economic volatility triggered by the recent global
economic storm," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the luncheon, Chen said that the offer of a subsidy of
NT$10,000 per worker per month was a sincere bid by the CLA to rev up
employment, but it would not be the best policy to tackle the root of the
country's economic woes.</P>
      <P>"This trying time could also be an opportune time for the government to review
its existing economic and labor policies and revise them accordingly," Chen
suggested.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou expressed the hope Thursday  that the Republic of China
on Taiwan can become a contracting party to The Convention on Wetlands of
International Importance.</P>
      <P>The wetlands convention, also known as the Ramsar Convention, is an
intergovernmental treaty signed in Iran in 1971 which provides a framework for
national action and international cooperation for the conservation and wise use
of wetlands and their resources. There are currently 158 signatory countries and
areas to the convention.</P>
      <P>In a written statement addressed to the opening of the Society of Wetland
Scientists (SWS) Asia Chapter's 1st Asian Wetland Convention and Workshop being
held in Taipei Oct. 23-26, Ma said that the ROC wants to join the convention in
order to make a contribution to global ecological conservation efforts.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is surrounded on all sides by water, has diverse topography,
enjoys a rich ecology, and is home to extensive wetlands, Ma said that through
the efforts of the Construction and Planning Agency under the Minister of the
Interior, the government plans to set aside 75 areas as protected wetlands.</P>
      <P>Besides promoting concrete conservation and management measures for the wetland
areas, the government will also work to raise the general public's awareness of
the importance of protecting these areas as well as increase the people's
environmental consciousness.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is not a signatory to the Ramsar Convention, it has strongly
supported its principles and regulations and is seeking to become a member, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Liao Liao-yi said in a speech at the opening of the SWS
conference that the 75 wetland areas to be set aside as protected areas together
make up 1.23 percent of Taiwan's total land area.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Construction and Planning Agency and related local government
agencies have extensive experience in the management of wetlands, Liao said he
hopes that Taiwan can share some of this experience and knowledge with the rest
of the world during the conference.</P>
      <P>The 1st Asian Wetland Convention and Workshop is being held at the National
Taiwan University Hospital International Convention Center. The conference,
whose theme is Asian Wetlands: Global Position,  will cover four major topics,
including ecological, economic and cultural significance of Asian wetlands;
wetland technology and restoration; operation and management of wetlands; and
global and local community participation and education.</P>

      <P>The man who jumped onto the hood of a visiting Chinese official's car and
fiercely stamped on it earlier in the week made a public apology Thursday for
his rough behavior and asked the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to punish
him.</P>
      <P>The DPP member, identified as Lin Chin-shun, apologized for the problems and the
damage to the public and party image caused by his behavior, and asked the DPP's
Tainan city committee to penalize him.</P>
      <P>Lin, however, declined to apologize to Zhang Mingqing, vice president of China's
quasi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), who
was visiting Tainan City in southern Taiwan that day. Lin insisted that Zhang
was "an enemy."</P>
      <P>Lin asserted that he will never give in to pressure and apologize to Zhang,
saying that he was safeguarding Taiwan's independent sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The case will be referred to and handled by the DPP's central authorities, said
officials of the party's Tainan city branch.</P>
      <P>Lin and Tainan City Councilor Wang Ting-yu were questioned by prosecutors
Tuesday after the incident.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators were mobilized by Wang, who argued that they were angered  by
Zhang's  remarks earlier  Tuesday  on Taiwan independence. Wang also rejected to
apologize to Zhang.</P>
      <P>Zhang filed a formal complaint with police against those who harassed him
Tuesday during a private visit to the Confucius Temple in Tainan City. He was

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan says it respects French court's ruling on Tahiti land dispute</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government respects a recent ruling by a French court recognizing Taiwan's
judicial role in a land dispute with China on the French Polynesian island of
Tahiti, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The government will continue pushing its plea for the return of the land to its
original donor, MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said.</P>
      <P>At issue is a plot of land in Papeete, capital of Tahiti, which was donated by
an overseas Chinese group to the Republic of China government before World War
II for the purpose of building a consulate.</P>
      <P>After France switched diplomatic recognition from the ROC to the People's
Republic of China (PRC) in 1964, the ROC government, in an attempt to prevent
Beijing from taking over the property, had the pro-Taipei donor file a lawsuit
in Tahiti in 1978 to confirm its ownership of the property.</P>
      <P>The PRC, which did not legally claim ownership of the piece of land until 2003,
won the case in 2004.</P>
      <P>Both the land's original donor and the ROC government appealed against the
ruling in 2005, but Tahitian judicial authorities in 2006 challenged Taiwan's
eligibility as an appellant on the grounds that the ROC's statehood is not
recognized internationally.</P>
      <P>The case, however, was later moved by the French supreme court to the appeals
court in Paris after it became known that Beijing had tried to influence the
case's proceedings in Tahiti.</P>
      <P>According to a report filed by AFP from Paris Wednesday, the appeals court in
Paris ruled last week that Taiwan's case could be heard "independent of the
diplomatic situation" even given Taipei's status as a "Chinese state not
recognized by the international community."</P>
      <P>Guillaume Selnet, the lawyer representing the ROC government in the case, was
quoted in the report as saying that the decision "formalizes  the recognition of
Taiwan by the French judicial authorities."</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan can play a judicial role, it follows that the Republic of China must
exist," Selnet said.</P>
      <P>The ROC government  has been struggling  for international recognition since it
lost a civil war in 1949 to the Chinese communists, which founded the PRC that
year.</P>
      <P>Over the past decades, the ROC government has lost most of its diplomatic allies
to the PRC. Twenty-three countries now maintain diplomatic relations with the
ROC, almost half of which are in Central America and the Caribbean region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Rivers contribute to natural carbon sequestration mechanism: study</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23 (CNA)
10/23/08  18:10:13

    <TEXT>
      <P>A collaborative research project between Taiwan and Britain has found that
rivers in the western Pacific region play a vital role in the land-to-sea
transfer of organic carbon, with the rivers accounting for more than one-third
of the total carbon transferred from land to sea, academic sources said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Moreover, researchers said, the carbon-transferring efficacy may be amplified by
the periodical onset of typhoons, as evidence indicates that over the past
several decades, 77 percent to 92 percent of the organic carbon transferred to
sea by riverine waters was done so during typhoon-induced floods.</P>
      <P>In addition, the research also indirectly supports the hypothesis that forests
contribute greatly to the capture of air-borne carbon particulates, as the
results show that when trees and tree parts were washed  down to the river  by
torrential  rains,  the carbon concentrations in the rivers would jump to much
higher levels.</P>
      <P>The project, co-led by Robert G. Hilton of University of Cambridge and Chen Hon-
gey of National Taiwan University, surveyed the Li-wu River in eastern Taiwan in
2004 to determine the effect of typhoons on the fluctuations in the river's
carbon concentrations.</P>
      <P>By comparing the river sediments collected on typhoon days and on normal days,
Chen said the researchers discovered that during the two typhoons in 2004,
namely Mindulle in June and Aere in August, the concentrations of organic carbon
originating from fossils and rocks remained at roughly the same levels, while
concentrations of organic carbon originating from vegetation and soil increased
tremendously.</P>
      <P>The ratio of vegetation/soil-originating  organic carbon to fossil/rock-
originating organic carbon rose from 10:90 on normal days to 43:57 on days
during typhoons, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, during torrential rains and floods, the carbon particles in the
river may be sent directly to the ocean floors, where great amounts of carbon
can be stored, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>"The mechanism may help cut the amount of carbon in the air, and eventually
reduce the global greenhouse effect," he added.</P>
      <P>The results of the research project have been published in the Oct. 19 issue of
Nature Geoscience.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Councilor Lin Kuo-cheng urged the city government in southern
Taiwan at a council session Thursday to provide more after-school tutoring to
children of new immigrants.</P>
      <P>Lin said more attention should be paid to this group of children as their
population is growing and the children generally do not get sufficient help from
their parents, who tend to have lower education and income levels compared to
the general public.</P>
      <P>In 2007, the city had 5,123 elementary and junior high school students who were
born from marriages between Taiwanese citizens and foreign spouses, most of whom
came from China and Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>The number of such students in the city was up by over 30 percent from the
figure registered in 2005, Lin said.</P>
      <P>He noted that 31 percent of children of new immigrants lived in the city's
Chienchen and Hsiaokang districts, two industrial areas where most residents are
wage laborers.</P>
      <P>While new immigrants and their Taiwanese spouses tend to have lower education
levels and income, they have a higher number of children, and it is common that
their children do not receive proper learning assistance from their parents, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Lin expressed  his worries that without enough support in education, these
children may suffer many setbacks in learning and may step on the wrong track in
life.</P>
      <P>Yen Chi-ping, a section chief of the city's Education Bureau, on Thursday
promised to strengthen after-school education programs for new immigrants'
children who appeared to be falling behind in their academic performance.</P>

      <P>A man convicted of being an accomplice in a diplomatic fraud case in which
Taiwan was duped out of nearly US$30 million, was given a jail sentence of two
years and four months Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taipei District Court judges sentenced Wu Shih-Tsai, an ethnic Chinese man from
Singapore, on convictions of forgery and making false accusations.</P>
      <P>Wu was indicted on Sept. 5 on the charges by the Taipei District Prosecutors
Office after it discovered that Wu provided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) with false bank statement regarding the money, which was intended to help
Taiwan build diplomatic ties with Papua New Guinea.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors said that Wu, after the exposure of the scandal in May this
year, also falsely claimed that he had been threatened at gunpoint.</P>
      <P>Wu and his partner Ching Chi Ju, who was commissioned by the MOFA in 2006 to
help broker a deal for the establishment of diplomatic ties with Papua New
Guinea, allegedly embezzled the US$29.8 million intended as aid funds for the
Pacific nation.</P>
      <P>Wu could be convicted of embezzling the money after further overseas
investigations are carried out, the judges said.</P>
      <P>Wu was taken into custody by prosecutors in May and had been prohibited from
leaving Taiwan, but Ching remains on the run.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said they are still investigating whether any former government
officials, including former Vice Premier Chiou I-jen, were culpable in the case.</P>
      <P>The scandal had resulted in the resignations of three senior government
officials of the previous Democratic Progressive Party administration, including
Chiou; former Foreign Minister James Huang; and former Deputy Defense Minister

      <P>The price of a type of fertilizer derived from petroleum will be cut by NT$50
(US$1.52) per 40-kg bag, effective Nov. 1, due to declining oil prices, Council
of Agriculture (COA) Minister Chen Wu-hsiung announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen had indicated on Monday that local urea prices might be reduced due to
continued declines in oil prices in the world market, although the government
promised that present fertilizer prices would be maintained through the end of
the year when it imposed a price hike on May 30.</P>
      <P>The prices of other kinds of fertilizers, however, will not be adjusted down for
the time being, as international raw material prices have shown no sings of
abating, Chen told reporters following a weekly Executive Yuan meeting.</P>
      <P>Urea is the only chemical fertilizer derived from petroleum.</P>
      <P>Following the May 30 price adjustment, a 40-kg bag of urea was priced at
NT$520-NT$530, up from the previous level of about NT$360-NT$370.</P>
      <P>In line with the Executive Yuan's efforts to promote Taiwan-made products, the
COA will also sponsor a local farm products promotion fair in Taipei City on the

      <P>The chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) gave
the assurance Thursday that Taiwan's economy is not vulnerable to the recent
global shortage of U.S. dollar liquidity.</P>
      <P>During a press conference at the Executive Yuan, Chen Tain-jy reiterated that a
lack of U.S. dollar liquidity will not compromise the nation's economy because
Taiwan has large foreign exchange reserves and low external debts.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the depreciation of the Taiwan currency is caused by the
withdrawal of U.S. capital from the country, emphasizing that the Central Bank
of the Republic of China will intervene at the appropriate time to stabilize the
market if the situation gets worse.</P>
      <P>"A sharp fall of the U.S. stock market Wednesday and Argentina's foreign debt
crisis fueled the existing global shortage of U.S. greenbacks, which in turn
caused the Taiwan stock market to drop substantially," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the low U.S. dollar liquidity around the globe has hammered
economies with high external debts, such as Argentina.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC proposes Nov. 3 for start of 2nd top-level cross-strait meeting</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Minister Lai Shin-yuan said Thursday Taiwan
has proposed that a historic meeting between top negotiators of the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait commence on Nov. 3 in Taipei, under the principle of "equal
status and dignity."</P>
      <P>Lai said that the main issue of the second meeting between Chiang Pin-kung,
chairman of Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and Chen Yunlin, president of
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , will be cross-
strait transportation, which will include establishing direct shipping links and
increasing the number of weekend direct chartered flights between Taiwan and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Regular weekend flights were launched July 4, but the flights are considered not
frequent or convenient enough, and the flight paths still must go through Hong
Kong airspace, due to security concerns. Direct shipping links still do not
exist.</P>
      <P>"The commencement of direct shipping links and the increase in chartered flights
with mainland China will not compromise the security of Taiwan," Lai told
reporters at a press conference jointly held by the MAC and SEF Thursday. The
issue of food safety will also be discussed, Lai said. Taiwan's public has been
dismayed by imported melamine-adulterated milk products from China, which caused
fears among local consumers and hurt local retailers, even those who do not use
Chinese milk products.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who also attended the press conference, pointed out that a deputy
chairman level meeting will be held in Shenzhen, China on Oct. 27 to discuss the
details and agenda items for Chen's visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Details of Chen's trip will be finalized in the Shenzhen meeting, he said. In
addition, the MAC-proposed date of Nov. 3 for Chen's visit will need to be
confirmed by the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits during the
Shenzhen meeting, said Chiang.</P>
      <P>Lai and Chiang also both guaranteed Chen's security.  "Security will not be a
problem during Chen's visit because enhanced security will be provided by
Taiwan's National Security Bureau," Lai said.</P>
      <P>ARATS Deputy President Zhang Mingqing was mobbed by protesters in southern
Taiwan's Tainan City on Oct. 21, suffering minor injuries.</P>
      <P>Lai and Chiang both condemned the violence on Zhang. "Freedom of speech most
certainly should not include violent attacks," Lai said.</P>
      <P>Chen's visit will be the first of its kind for the head of ARATS and is a
reciprocal visit to the trip made by Chiang to Beijing in June in which the two
sides signed landmark agreements on launching regular weekend flights and on
allowing more Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen will be the highest ranking Chinese envoy to ever visit Taiwan since the
two sides split at the end of a long civil war in 1949.</P>
      <P>China, however, continues to see Taiwan as a province, not a separate country,
and has threatened to attack if the island declares formal  independence.
Relations  have improved  under the new administration of Taiwanese President Ma
Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>As for the sensitive issue of how Chen will address Ma - the title of
"president" might be unacceptable to China as it does not consider Taiwan a
country -, Lai would only say that Ma will meet Chen as the "president of the
Republic of China, " Taiwan's formal name.</P>
      <P>China does not deny the existence of the Republic of China, which once ruled
mainland China before the civil war ended, but Beijing insists there is only one
China, with Taiwan as a part of it.  The SEF and its counterpart ARATS are
quasi-official organizations that are responsible for handling cross-strait
affairs in the absence of government to government relations.</P>
      <P>SEF falls under the jurisdiction of MAC in Taiwan's Executive Yuan.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) received a letter containing a
death threat against former President Chen Shui-bian Thursday, warning Chen not
to attend an anti-China rally this weekend, according to DPP spokesman Cheng
Wen-tsang.</P>
      <P>The letter, addressed to DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, had a bullet enclosed with
it, was signed "Mr. Wang" and was sent from Wuku township in Taipei County,
Cheng told a news conference.</P>
      <P>In the letter, "Mr. Wang" warned Chen not to take part in the protest march
Saturday in Taipei City at the risk of losing his life, according to Cheng.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the letter was transferred to the National Police Agency Director-
General  Wang Cho-chiun  by DPP lawmaker  Chai Trong-Rong, who said police
authorities should track down who is behind the threat.</P>
      <P>Saturday's demonstration is being organized by the DPP and several pro-
independence groups to protest an upcoming visit by Chen Yunlin -- China's top
liaison with Taiwan in his capacity as president of the quasi-official
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits -- who is expected to visit
Taiwan in early November.</P>
      <P>The DPP has said it will try to gather 1 million protesters to demonstrate
against a host of issues, including China's tainted milk products, the
performance of President Ma Ying-jeou's administration so far, and Ma's steps to
build closer ties with China.</P>
      <P>Although some members of the DPP have openly objected to Chen Shui-bian's
participation in the protest, the former president, who is the former head of
the DPP, has insisted on taking part and promised to fully adhere to Tsai's
instructions for protesters.</P>
      <P>Some DPP leaders and members, however, are concerned that Chen Shui-bian's
participation could taint the image of the party and the protest. The former
president and his family members are deeply embroiled in a series of corruption
and money-laundering allegations being investigated by the prosecution.</P>

      <P>A doctor of emergency medicine said Thursday that he does not encourage eating
contests anywhere, as competitive eating is physically risky.</P>
      <P>Chien Ting-kuo,  an emergency medicine physician at Mackay Memorial Hospital,
spelled out the warning in the wake of an incident Wednesday in which a graduate
school student was believed to have choked to death in an eating contest.</P>
      <P>Chien said an airway obstruction, such as food in the trachea, could cause a
normal healthy person to fall unconscious in one minute. That person could die
of cardiopulmonary arrest if he or she remains  unconsciousness  for 10 minutes,
he added.</P>
      <P>If the cardiopulmonary arrest lasts for more than four minutes, the patient,
even if he or she recovers, is very likely to suffer permanent brain damage
caused by a lack of oxygen, he warned.</P>
      <P>A biotechnology graduate student at Dayeh University in the central county of
Changhua on Wednesday won the first prize of NT$2,000 in an eating contest at
his school by wolfing down two medium-sized steamed buns with layers of eggs and
cheese in a few minutes.</P>
      <P>The student, surnamed Chen, talked with his classmates briefly after winning the
contest, then headed for the toilet, according to Huang Teh-hsiang, dean of
student affairs at the university.</P>
      <P>When he got to the door of the toilet, Chen began vomiting heavily then
collapsed on the floor, Huang related. The student never recovered, he added.</P>
      <P>The 23-year-old Chen was rushed by an ambulance to Yuan Sheng Hospital in the
neighboring Yuanlin township, where he was given 20 doses of cardiotonic in an
emergency effort that lasted 90 minutes, though he had been pronounced dead on
arrival.</P>
      <P>Doctors at Yuan Sheng Hospital concluded preliminarily that Chen choked to death
because of an airway obstruction, although further examination, probably an
autopsy, would be needed before the cause of death could be determined,
according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Huang said Chen's institute did not register with the university authorities
before organizing the eating contest, adding that Dayeh University has already
decided to totally ban similar eating contests on its campus.</P>

      <P>The flight recorder of an Air Force indigenous defense fighter (IDF) that
crashed into the sea during a training mission Monday was recovered from waters
near an uninhabited islet of the Penghu island chain off southwestern Taiwan
Thursday after four days of intensive search.</P>
      <P>"The flight recorder, commonly known as the black box, of the ill-fated IDF/1615
fighter was fished out of waters near Nanyen islet at 2 p.m.," said Col. Shen
Yi-feng, chief of staff of the Air Force 427 Wing at the Chingchuankang air base
in central Taiwan, who has been tasked with overseeing the search mission.</P>
      <P>The black box will be sent back to Taiwan  for military authorities and the
original manufacturer of the plane -- Taiwan's state-run Aerospace Industry
Development Corp. (AIDC) -- to conduct an extensive analysis to determine the
cause of the crash, Shen said.</P>
      <P>Over the past four days, 75 fragments of the crashed aircraft have been
recovered, including a three-meter-long fragment of a tail fin of the fighter,
he disclosed.</P>
      <P>Also recovered were several pieces of human remains which have been sent to the
Armed Forces General Hospital in Penghu to establish whether they belonged to
either of the two Air Force pilots aboard the jet fighter, Shen added.</P>
      <P>The plane, operated by pilot Capt. Ku Chih-bin and co-pilot Capt. Chen Jian-
ting, disappeared from radar screens Monday morning while on a bombing training
mission over Penghu in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The IDFs, also known as Ching-kuo jet fighters in memory of the late President
Chiang Ching-kuo, was developed in the 1980s by the AIDC in cooperation with
General Dynamics Corp. of the United States. The IDFs, together with U.S.-built
F-16s and French-made Mirage 2000-5s, form the backbone of Taiwan's Air Force.</P>

      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) will come up with an
employment promotion program for 2009-2012 in the hope of keeping the country's
unemployment rate at 3.9 percent or lower, CEPD Deputy Chairman Shan Gee said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shan made the announcement after the Executive Yuan's Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Wednesday reported that September's
unemployment rate hit a four-year high of 4.27 percent for the same month and
the figure represented a 0.13 percentage point increase over the previous month.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate averaged 3.96 percent over the first nine months of this
year, marking a 0.04 percentage point increse over the same period of last year
and a three-year high for the same period, the reported revealed.</P>
      <P>"It is a grave problem we must tackle first, " Shan said.</P>
      <P>He added that funding for the 2009-2012 employment promotion program has been
allocated in the government's budget plan for next year and is expected to be
implemented on a long term and consistent basis.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the government's employment stimulation plan for the second
half of this year is expected to generate thousands of jobs, said Shan.</P>
      <P>The plan, which is aimed at expanding domestic demand, calls for launch of many
construction projects initiated by the government. Around NT$58.3 billion
earmarked for the projects eventually will be delivered to local governments.</P>
      <P>Shan added that some 14,000 job openings are expected to be created in November
and December after the local governments begin to award construction contracts.</P>
      <P>To boost short term employment, the government has also asked various government
agencies to come up with feasible programs, Shan said, adding that the Council
of Labor Affairs has raised an employment promotion proposal as a result.</P>
      <P>To implement those programs, however, the government will need to find funding
sources, according to Shan, who added that only the employment stimulus programs
initiated by the Council of Labor Affairs call for a budget of NT$3 billion.</P>
      <P>Shan added that government will commission the DGBAS to study budget issues.</P>
      <P>He said wage subsidies will be included in the planned short-term employment
promotion programs. He noted that when the jobless rate reached 5 percent in
2003 and 2004, the Ministry of Economic Affairs provided wage subsidies to small
and medium-sized enterprises so they can pay their employees.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Protected Formosan salmon survive September typhoons</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Shei-Pa National Park Administration Center's efforts to conserve the rare
Formosan Landlocked Salmon allowed most of the fish to survive two typhoons in
September, the center's deputy director-general Peng Mao-hsiung said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Peng said the number of the rare salmon species, which is designated as a
national treasure, dropped from 5,321 to 3,629 after Typhoon Sinlaku and Jiangmi
slammed Taiwan last month with strong winds and torrential rains.</P>
      <P>The rate of loss of the fish after the typhoons was registered at about 30
percent, lower than the minimum 50 percent registered after each typhoon in the
past, Peng said.</P>
      <P>The fish is also known as "cherry blossom hook salmon" because of its hooked
nose and cherry blossom-shaped spots. It is found mainly in Cijiawan River in
the national park in central Taiwan, the southernmost line for salmon of the
northern hemisphere.</P>
      <P>Peng said most of the salmon washed away in rivers swollen by rains in the two
typhoons were small ones less than 15 cm in length.</P>
      <P>"This was probably because they were not strong enough to swim against the pull
of the raging river, " Peng said, adding that they may have been flushed
downriver or injured by sand and stones in the water.</P>
      <P>According to Peng, the center has spent many years working to improve the
construction of 26 debris dams in the national park to ensure a smooth passage
for the salmon to swim upriver to breed.</P>
      <P>The debris dams were built decades ago to protect a reservoir in the national
park by trapping sand and gravel, but this has also hampered the salmon's
upstream movement.</P>
      <P>The center also planted trees along the river to improve the water quality in
the salmon's habitat, as trees help to prevent sand and soil from slipping into
the river.</P>
      <P>The endangered salmon was designated as a rare creature by the Taiwan government
in 1984.</P>
      <P>The administration center began its efforts to conserve the fish in 1992 when
the national park was established, and the number of salmon was recorded then at
about 600, according to Peng.</P>
      <P>Peng said the center will release nearly one thousand salmon fry, which were
spawned artificially, into the stream next March to test their adaptation to the
natural environment.</P>
      <P>He said he hoped that the conservation efforts would be expanded in the future
and that the species would be allowed to inhabit the national park permanently.</P>

      <P>The goal of transforming the current nonstop weekend cross-strait charter
flights into daily services will make the agenda of an upcoming high-level
meeting between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, a senior official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Significant progress will be made on increasing the number of flights and
destinations as well as on devising straighter flight routes in cross-strait
aviation services, in the wake of the upcoming talks, " said Minister of
Transportation and Communications Mao Chi-kuo.</P>
      <P>Mao made the remarks after Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan
announced earlier in the day that China's top liaison with Taiwan, Chen Yunlin,
is expected to arrive in Taiwan Nov. 3 for high-level consultations with his
Taiwanese counterpart, Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-
kung, on promotion of bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Chen, president of Beijing's quasi-official Association for Relations  Across
the Taiwan Straits  (ARATS) ,  will be the highest-ranking Chinese envoy ever to
visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Establishing direct sea and air links will be a priority topic in the Taipei
round of the Chiang-Chen talks, a follow-up to the first such meeting in Beijing
in mid-June during which two landmark accords were forged to pave the way for
the opening of direct weekend charter flights and an increase in Chinese tourist
arrivals to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mao said the second Chiang-Chen  meeting will discuss the possibility of turning
the weekend charter flights into daily services, with more flights, more
destinations and shorter flight routes.</P>
      <P>According to the agreement reached in the Beijing talks, Taiwan allows a maximum
of 3,000 Chinese tourist arrivals per day.</P>
      <P>Over the past three months, the actual tourist arrivals have fallen far short of
the targeted number.</P>
      <P>Mao said the government has adjusted downward its target to 1,000 Chinese
tourists per day before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Despite a decline in the load factor of the weekend charter flights at one
point, the rate rebounded to 94 percent last week, thanks to an increase in the
number of Chinese tourist arrivals, Mao said. A total of 3,400 Chinese tourists
visited Taiwan last week -- an average of roughly 500 a day.</P>
      <P>At present, only 36 direct cross-strait charter flights are available from
Friday through Monday. The limited number of such flights has discouraged
potential Chinese tourists, Mao said, adding that increasing the number of
charters is imperative to attracting more Chinese holidaymakers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) received a letter containing a
death threat against former President Chen Shui-bian Thursday, warning Chen not
to attend an anti-China rally this weekend, according to DPP spokesman Cheng
Wen-tsang.</P>
      <P>The letter, addressed to DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, had a bullet enclosed with
it, was signed "Mr. Wang" and was sent from Wuku township in Taipei County,
Cheng told a news conference.</P>
      <P>In the letter, "Mr. Wang" warned Chen not to take part in the protest march
Saturday in Taipei City at the risk of losing his life, according to Cheng.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the letter was transferred to the National Police Agency Director-
General  Wang Cho-chiun  by DPP lawmaker  Chai Trong-Rong, who said police
authorities should track down who is behind the threat.</P>
      <P>Saturday's demonstration is being organized by the DPP and several pro-
independence groups to protest an upcoming visit by Chen Yunlin -- China's top
liaison with Taiwan in his capacity as president of the quasi-official
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits -- who is expected to visit
Taiwan in early November.</P>
      <P>The DPP has said it will try to gather 1 million protesters to demonstrate
against a host of issues, including China's tainted milk products, the
performance of President Ma Ying-jeou's administration so far, and Ma's steps to
build closer ties with China.</P>
      <P>Although some members of the DPP have openly objected to Chen Shui-bian's
participation in the protest, the former president, who is the former head of
the DPP, has insisted on taking part and promised to fully adhere to Tsai's
instructions for protesters.</P>
      <P>Some DPP leaders and members, however, are concerned that Chen Shui-bian's
participation could taint the image of the party and the protest. The former
president and his family members are deeply embroiled in a series of corruption
and money-laundering allegations being investigated by the prosecution.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Doctor discourages eating contests</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A doctor of emergency medicine said Thursday that he does not encourage eating
contests anywhere, as competitive eating is physically risky.</P>
      <P>Chien Ting-kuo,  an emergency medicine physician at Mackay Memorial Hospital,
spelled out the warning in the wake of an incident Wednesday in which a graduate
school student was believed to have choked to death in an eating contest.</P>
      <P>Chien said an airway obstruction, such as food in the trachea, could cause a
normal healthy person to fall unconscious in one minute. That person could die
of cardiopulmonary arrest if he or she remains  unconsciousness  for 10 minutes,
he added.</P>
      <P>If the cardiopulmonary arrest lasts for more than four minutes, the patient,
even if he or she recovers, is very likely to suffer permanent brain damage
caused by a lack of oxygen, he warned.</P>
      <P>A biotechnology graduate student at Dayeh University in the central county of
Changhua on Wednesday won the first prize of NT$2,000 in an eating contest at
his school by wolfing down two medium-sized steamed buns with layers of eggs and
cheese in a few minutes.</P>
      <P>The student, surnamed Chen, talked with his classmates briefly after winning the
contest, then headed for the toilet, according to Huang Teh-hsiang, dean of
student affairs at the university.</P>
      <P>When he got to the door of the toilet, Chen began vomiting heavily then
collapsed on the floor, Huang related. The student never recovered, he added.</P>
      <P>The 23-year-old Chen was rushed by an ambulance to Yuan Sheng Hospital in the
neighboring Yuanlin township, where he was given 20 doses of cardiotonic in an
emergency effort that lasted 90 minutes, though he had been pronounced dead on
arrival.</P>
      <P>Doctors at Yuan Sheng Hospital concluded preliminarily that Chen choked to death
because of an airway obstruction, although further examination, probably an
autopsy, would be needed before the cause of death could be determined,
according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Huang said Chen's institute did not register with the university authorities
before organizing the eating contest, adding that Dayeh University has already
decided to totally ban similar eating contests on its campus.</P>

      <P>The flight recorder of an Air Force indigenous defense fighter (IDF) that
crashed into the sea during a training mission Monday was recovered from waters
near an uninhabited islet of the Penghu island chain off southwestern Taiwan
Thursday after four days of intensive search.</P>
      <P>"The flight recorder, commonly known as the black box, of the ill-fated IDF/1615
fighter was fished out of waters near Nanyen islet at 2 p.m.," said Col. Shen
Yi-feng, chief of staff of the Air Force 427 Wing at the Chingchuankang air base
in central Taiwan, who has been tasked with overseeing the search mission.</P>
      <P>The black box will be sent back to Taiwan  for military authorities and the
original manufacturer of the plane -- Taiwan's state-run Aerospace Industry
Development Corp. (AIDC) -- to conduct an extensive analysis to determine the
cause of the crash, Shen said.</P>
      <P>Over the past four days, 75 fragments of the crashed aircraft have been
recovered, including a three-meter-long fragment of a tail fin of the fighter,
he disclosed.</P>
      <P>Also recovered were several pieces of human remains which have been sent to the
Armed Forces General Hospital in Penghu to establish whether they belonged to
either of the two Air Force pilots aboard the jet fighter, Shen added.</P>
      <P>The plane, operated by pilot Capt. Ku Chih-bin and co-pilot Capt. Chen Jian-
ting, disappeared from radar screens Monday morning while on a bombing training
mission over Penghu in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The IDFs, also known as Ching-kuo jet fighters in memory of the late President
Chiang Ching-kuo, was developed in the 1980s by the AIDC in cooperation with
General Dynamics Corp. of the United States. The IDFs, together with U.S.-built
F-16s and French-made Mirage 2000-5s, form the backbone of Taiwan's Air Force.</P>
      <P>Monday's incident was the fifth mishap involving IDF jet fighters since the
model was commissioned into service in 1988.</P>

      <P>Export orders from China and Hong Kong continued to decline in September for a
second straight month, signaling a bad omen for the country's economic
prospects, officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to figures released by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), Taiwan
companies received US$31.79 billion worth of orders from around the world in
September, up 2.82 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>But orders from China and Hong Kong, which combine to form Taiwan's largest
export outlet, totaled only US$7.549 billion, marking a whopping 10.79 percent
plunge from the year-earlier level. The drop followed a 8.86 percent fall in
August. In July, the annual growth rate already narrowed to less than 2 percent.</P>
      <P>Export orders from Taiwan's second largest market-- the United States -- also
fell 2.29 percent year-on-year in September to US$7.389 billion, while orders
from its third biggest market -- Europe -- registered a 14.94 percent annual
increase to US$6.594 billion.</P>
      <P>As the results of an MOEA survey of local enterprises showed that respondents
foreseeing grimmer trade picture for October outnumber optimistic ones by nearly
14 percent, ministry officials said export orders may continue shrinking in

      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) will come up with an
employment promotion program for 2009-2012 in the hope of keeping the country's
unemployment rate at 3.9 percent or lower, CEPD Deputy Chairman Shan Gee said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shan made the announcement after the Executive Yuan's Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Wednesday reported that September's
unemployment rate hit a four-year high of 4.27 percent for the same month and
the figure represented a 0.13 percentage point increase over the previous month.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate averaged 3.96 percent over the first nine months of this
year, marking a 0.04 percentage point increse over the same period of last year
and a three-year high for the same period, the reported revealed.</P>
      <P>"It is a grave problem we must tackle first, " Shan said.</P>
      <P>He added that funding for the 2009-2012 employment promotion program has been
allocated in the government's budget plan for next year and is expected to be
implemented on a long term and consistent basis.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the government's employment stimulation plan for the second
half of this year is expected to generate thousands of jobs, said Shan.</P>
      <P>The plan, which is aimed at expanding domestic demand, calls for launch of many
construction projects initiated by the government. Around NT$58.3 billion
earmarked for the projects eventually will be delivered to local governments.</P>
      <P>Shan added that some 14,000 job openings are expected to be created in November
and December after the local governments begin to award construction contracts.</P>
      <P>To boost short term employment, the government has also asked various government
agencies to come up with feasible programs, Shan said, adding that the Council
of Labor Affairs has raised an employment promotion proposal as a result.</P>
      <P>To implement those programs, however, the government will need to find funding
sources, according to Shan, who added that only the employment stimulus programs
initiated by the Council of Labor Affairs call for a budget of NT$3 billion.</P>
      <P>Shan added that government will commission the DGBAS to study budget issues.</P>
      <P>He said wage subsidies will be included in the planned short-term employment
promotion programs. He noted that when the jobless rate reached 5 percent in
2003 and 2004, the Ministry of Economic Affairs provided wage subsidies to small
and medium-sized enterprises so they can pay their employees.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Protected Formosan salmon survive September typhoons</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23 (CNA)
10/24/08  10:49:22

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Shei-Pa National Park Administration Center's efforts to conserve the rare
Formosan Landlocked Salmon allowed most of the fish to survive two typhoons in
September, the center's deputy director-general Peng Mao-hsiung said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Peng said the number of the rare salmon species, which is designated as a
national treasure, dropped from 5,321 to 3,629 after Typhoon Sinlaku and Jiangmi
slammed Taiwan last month with strong winds and torrential rains.</P>
      <P>The rate of loss of the fish after the typhoons was registered at about 30
percent, lower than the minimum 50 percent registered after each typhoon in the
past, Peng said.</P>
      <P>The fish is also known as "cherry blossom hook salmon" because of its hooked
nose and cherry blossom-shaped spots. It is found mainly in Cijiawan River in
the national park in central Taiwan, the southernmost line for salmon of the
northern hemisphere.</P>
      <P>Peng said most of the salmon washed away in rivers swollen by rains in the two
typhoons were small ones less than 15 cm in length.</P>
      <P>"This was probably because they were not strong enough to swim against the pull
of the raging river, " Peng said, adding that they may have been flushed
downriver or injured by sand and stones in the water.</P>
      <P>According to Peng, the center has spent many years working to improve the
construction of 26 debris dams in the national park to ensure a smooth passage
for the salmon to swim upriver to breed.</P>
      <P>The debris dams were built decades ago to protect a reservoir in the national
park by trapping sand and gravel, but this has also hampered the salmon's
upstream movement.</P>
      <P>The center also planted trees along the river to improve the water quality in
the salmon's habitat, as trees help to prevent sand and soil from slipping into
the river.</P>
      <P>The endangered salmon was designated as a rare creature by the Taiwan government
in 1984.</P>
      <P>The administration center began its efforts to conserve the fish in 1992 when
the national park was established, and the number of salmon was recorded then at
about 600, according to Peng.</P>
      <P>Peng said the center will release nearly one thousand salmon fry, which were
spawned artificially, into the stream next March to test their adaptation to the
natural environment.</P>
      <P>He said he hoped that the conservation efforts would be expanded in the future
and that the species would be allowed to inhabit the national park permanently.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Weekend cross-strait charter flights to be expanded to daily service</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23 (CNA)
10/24/08  10:50:21
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The goal of transforming the current nonstop weekend cross-strait charter
flights into daily services will make the agenda of an upcoming high-level
meeting between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, a senior official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Significant progress will be made on increasing the number of flights and
destinations as well as on devising straighter flight routes in cross-strait
aviation services, in the wake of the upcoming talks, " said Minister of
Transportation and Communications Mao Chi-kuo.</P>
      <P>Mao made the remarks after Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan
announced earlier in the day that China's top liaison with Taiwan, Chen Yunlin,
is expected to arrive in Taiwan Nov. 3 for high-level consultations with his
Taiwanese counterpart, Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-
kung, on promotion of bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Chen, president of Beijing's quasi-official Association for Relations  Across
the Taiwan Straits  (ARATS) ,  will be the highest-ranking Chinese envoy ever to
visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Establishing direct sea and air links will be a priority topic in the Taipei
round of the Chiang-Chen talks, a follow-up to the first such meeting in Beijing
in mid-June during which two landmark accords were forged to pave the way for
the opening of direct weekend charter flights and an increase in Chinese tourist
arrivals to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mao said the second Chiang-Chen  meeting will discuss the possibility of turning
the weekend charter flights into daily services, with more flights, more
destinations and shorter flight routes.</P>
      <P>According to the agreement reached in the Beijing talks, Taiwan allows a maximum
of 3,000 Chinese tourist arrivals per day.</P>
      <P>Over the past three months, the actual tourist arrivals have fallen far short of
the targeted number.</P>
      <P>Mao said the government has adjusted downward its target to 1,000 Chinese
tourists per day before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Despite a decline in the load factor of the weekend charter flights at one
point, the rate rebounded to 94 percent last week, thanks to an increase in the
number of Chinese tourist arrivals, Mao said. A total of 3,400 Chinese tourists
visited Taiwan last week -- an average of roughly 500 a day.</P>
      <P>At present, only 36 direct cross-strait charter flights are available from
Friday through Monday. The limited number of such flights has discouraged
potential Chinese tourists, Mao said, adding that increasing the number of
charters is imperative to attracting more Chinese holidaymakers.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese-Brazilian orphan who was returned to his Brazilian grandmother in a
high-profile international custody battle four years ago has been sent to a
foster family, a Taiwanese charity organization that has maintained contact with
the boy said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Chinjen Austin Ou, director of the Taiwan Catholic Mission
Foundation, Iruan Wu Ergui has been in foster care since July this year because
of his elderly grandmother's poor financial situation.</P>
      <P>The foster family provides much better education and living conditions for the
boy, said Ou, who has visited Iruan twice a year over the past four years.</P>
      <P>Ou said he tried to contact Iruan's Taiwanese uncle, Wu Huo-yen, to inform him
of the boy's status but was unable to reach him.</P>
      <P>Iruan -- better known in Taiwan by his Chinese name Wu Yi-hua -- was born out of
wedlock to a Brazilian mother and a Taiwanese father, Wu Teng-shu, in 1995 in
Brazil.</P>
      <P>The mother died in 1998, and the child's grandmother -- Rosa Leocadia Silva
Ergui -- was named as the boy's guardian with Wu Teng-shu's approval.</P>
      <P>In 2001, the father took the boy back to Taiwan for a short visit to his
hometown of Chieting, Kaohsiung County but died unexpectedly during his stay
there.</P>
      <P>The boy's uncle then decided to take the boy and refused to let him go.</P>
      <P>The boy's grandmother filed a lawsuit to regain custody of the boy, and Taiwan's
supreme court ruled in 2003 that Iruan should return to his rightful guardian.
Iruan eventually returned to Brazil in February 2004.</P>

      <P>Nearly half of all stores recently inspected by the Consumers' Foundation were
found to be illegally selling cigarettes to minors, foundation officials said
Friday.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the inspection, teenagers under 18 dressed in senior high
school uniforms were sent by the foundation to 235 stores around Taiwan to try
to buy cigarettes, according to Hsieh Tien-jen, acting chairman of the
foundation.</P>
      <P>A total of 111, or 47.2 percent, of the stores sold cigarettes to the minors,
Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Among the 147 convenient stores inspected, 22.4 percent failed to comply with
the ban on the sale of cigarettes to minors, compared with 42.3 percent in a
similar inspection conducted last year, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>While 19 percent of 7-Eleven stores inspected broke the law, 22.6 percent of
FamilyMart stores violated the ban, and 31.5 percent of Ok Mart and Hi-Life
stores failed to comply, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that an amendment to the Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act set to come
into effect on Jan. 1, 2009 will raise the fine for sellers violating the ban
from NT$15,000 to NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>He urged sellers to strengthen the education of their workers in this regard.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yu Kai-hsiung, secretary-general of the foundation, called the
public's attention to the fact that one-third of young people who smoke are
likely to die of smoking-related diseases in the future.</P>
      <P>He added that 90 percent of adult smokers came into contact with cigarettes
before the age of 19.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, he continued, cigarettes are extremely inexpensive in Taiwan, being
sold for as little as NT$50 (US$1.50) a pack, which makes them much more easily
accessible to youth than in other countries where they are sold at NT$100-NT$200
per pack, Yu noted.</P>

      <P>A visiting Taiwan official said here Thursday that his film promotion department
will try to persuade Taiwan's Ministry of Education to include movie courses in
elementary and junior high school curriculums.</P>
      <P>Frank J. K. Chen, director of the Department of Motion Pictures under the
Cabinet-level Government Information Office, said that the initiative will raise
the Taiwan public's awareness of the importance of film education and foster a
greater interest in movies.</P>
      <P>"Movie culture requires cultivation at an early age, " Chen said, noting that
film classes begin at the elementary school level in France.</P>
      <P>Chen is currently heading a delegation  of Taiwan theater operators on a visit
to France to learn more about the European country's film industry development
as well as digital projection technology.</P>
      <P>He said that the French government's policy of support for its motion picture
industry can serve as a model for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the visit has helped theater operators in Chen's delegation better
understand the French attitude toward culture and re-think  their  own  social
responsibilities  and the social significance of movie theaters, said Shin Kong
Cineplex manager Luo Min-wen, one of the members of the delegation.</P>
      <P>She noted that Taiwan's theater operators only take box office revenue into
consideration and do not care about contributing to culture.</P>
      <P>The country's film venues are restricted in the selection of films available by
distributors as well, Kuo said, in contrast to France where a wide diversity of
movies are shown in cinemas.</P>
      <P>Members of the delegation expressed the view that digital projection will become
the trend of the future and that an upgrading of facilities in Taiwan theaters
will be needed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier gives assurances on visiting Chinese official's safety</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan gave assurances Friday that the personal safety of
China's top negotiator with Taiwan will be secured when he visits Taiwan next
month.</P>
      <P>The National Security Bureau, with the support of other police units, will be
mainly responsible for securing the safety of Chen Yunlin, president of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), during his stay,
Liu said at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>In response to concerns over the safety of Chen and his delegation raised by
People First Party Legislator Lin Cheng-er, Liu stressed that he has on many
occasions assured that there will be no safety and security loopholes during
Chen's visit in Taiwan, which is expected to take place between Nov. 3-7.</P>
      <P>Lin asked Minister of the Interior Liao Liou-yi whether the government is ready
to provide airtight personal protection for Chen and his group.</P>
      <P>"Absolutely," Liao answered.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ruling Kuomintang Legislator Tsao Er-chung asked whether and when
President Ma Ying-jeou will be meeting with Chen during the ARATS president's
forthcoming visit.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan responded that the time
for the meeting had yet to be decided but was expected to be worked out in the
coming days by officials from the two intermediary bodies representing Taiwan
and China in the negotiations -- Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and
Beijing's ARATS.</P>
      <P>The legislators expressed concern about Chen's safety while in Taiwan after
ARATS Deputy President Zhang Mingqing was mobbed by protesters in southern
Taiwan's Tainan City on Oct. 21, suffering minor injuries.</P>
      <P>MAC has proposed that the historic meeting between Chen and his counterpart, SEF
Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, take place in Taipei under the principle of "equal
status and dignity."</P>
      <P>Chen, Chiang and their respective delegations are expected to discuss a wide
range of topics, including food safety concerns related to China's tainted food
exports, the establishment of direct shipping and cargo charter links and
increasing the number of nonstop passenger charter flights on weekends between
Taiwan and China, according to Lai.</P>
      <P>The much talked about Chiang-Chen meeting will be a follow-up to a landmark
meeting in Beijing between the two in mid-June during which both sides reached
an agreement on weekend cross-strait charter flights and the expansion of the
number of Chinese tourists allowed to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Regular weekend flights were launched July 4, but some believe the flights are
not frequent enough and inconvenient because they still must pass through Hong
Kong airspace due to security concerns before heading to their final
destinations.</P>
      <P>Direct shipping links still do not exist.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several ruling Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers on Friday urged the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to cancel its planned protest rally against
the government slated for Saturday, describing the rally as "propping up the
corrupt (former President) Chen Shui-bian."</P>
      <P>The rally, being co-sponsored by the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union,
will target "the one China market, the downgrading of Taiwan's sovereignty, and
an incompetent government."</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Legislative Yuan, KMT caucus whip Kuo Su-chun pointed out that
the DPP has been unwilling to separate itself from the former president, who is
being investigated for money laundering and corruption, or to ask him not to
participate in the rally.</P>
      <P>Instead, the DPP "would rather walk hand-in-hand with this former president who
deprived Taiwan of its dignity, " she said, adding that the party nevertheless
still insists on calling itself the party of conscience and reform.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Legislator Tsao Erh-chang pointed to the irony of the DPP holding
a rally to protest incompetent government when "former President Chen is the
most incompetent of them all, " a fact over which DPP Chairman Tsai Ing-wen has
"feigned ignorance."</P>
      <P>The KMT legislators' calls for the rally to be canceled came in response to
remarks by DPP legislators, including Twu Shiing-jer and Su Cheng-ching, at the
same legislative session in which they urged citizens to take part in the rally
to voice their dissatisfaction with the current government.</P>
      <P>Twu accused the government of being aloof and caring more about whether China's
top negotiator will come to Taiwan than about the fact that three out of four
people have lost confidence in the Cabinet.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New mindset needed for competitive gaming industry: Taichung mayor</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu told Macau media that the views of Taiwan's people will
have to change drastically before the country can establish  a gaming industry
that is competitive.</P>
      <P>In an interview published Friday in the Macao Daily News which was seen here, Hu
said that leading gambing centers such as Las Vegas now focus on more than just
gambing, offering a wide variety of other leisure and entertainment options for
visitors that allow for more diversified development.</P>
      <P>As for whether Taiwan can become an international gaming center, Hu said that
although investors from Las Vegas and Macao have expressed interest in the Chen-
nan recreational area in Taichung County as a potential center, authorities have
no intention at the present time of establishing such an industry there.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Hu said, he has not actively sought investors, adding that he doesn't
think a gaming industry will be set up anywhere else in Taiwan in the near term.</P>
      <P>Hu also talked about the launch of direct charter flights between Taichung and
Xiamen, China, in July this year, expressing the hope that Taichung and Macau
can actively work together to expand flights between the two destinations to
increase their respective tourism industries.</P>
      <P>Noting that the four cities and counties of central Taiwan have a combined
population of more than 6 million as well as plenty of tourist attractions while
Macao continues to develop its own unique tourism resources, Hu said that there
is a lot of potential for expansion of flight services between the two
destinations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Expansion of cross-strait charters could keep businessmen at home</HEADLINE>

      <P>Most Taiwanese business owners with operations in China have little choice but
to live in China, but that could change if the cross-Taiwan Strait charter
flight services were more convenient, according to the results of a survey
released Friday by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>The results revealed that if the weekend cross-strait charter services,
currently operated between Friday and Monday, were extended to every day of the
week, 42.6 percent of China-based Taiwanese business owners would choose to live
in Taiwan, while 53.7 percent would still live in China.</P>
      <P>The survey results were based on 1,227 valid questionnaires received from
business class passengers on weekend cross-strait charter flights between Sept.
5-8.</P>
      <P>According to Minister of Transportation and Communications Mao Chi-kuo, the
results show that Taiwanese entrepreneurs doing business in China do not
necessarily have to live in China in the future.</P>
      <P>The change would help decrease the incidence of infidelity that is very
prevalent among Taiwanese businesspeople who live separately from their spouses,
Mao said.</P>
      <P>Asked if the extension of the cross-strait charter services would increase their
intention to invest in Taiwan, 74.8 percent of respondents gave a positive
answer.</P>
      <P>Another 18.3 percent of respondents said it would not help. Among the reasons
mentioned were Taiwan's high labor and land costs, the severe industrial exodus
from Taiwan and an unwillingness to change the status quo.</P>
      <P>As to whether the extension would raise their desire to invest in China, 56.2
percent of respondents believed it would help, while 20.8 percent did not think
it would lead to any changes.</P>
      <P>The weekend cross-strait charter flight services were launched on July 4 this
year.</P>
      <P>During upcoming  talks set for early November  in Taipei, representatives of
Taiwan and China are expected to discuss the possibilities of extending the
services to all days of the week, increasing the number of routes and flights
included in the charter services, and opening more direct nonstop cross-strait
air routes.</P>

      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) on Friday launched the Taiwan portion of
a worldwide contest aimed at enhancing the global dialogue on democracy.</P>
      <P>The competition, called "Democracy Video Challenge, " asks budding filmmakers,
democracy advocates, and the general public to create video clips that complete
the phrase, "Democracy is..."</P>
      <P>Scott Robinson, director of the AIT's American Culture Center, told a news
conference that the AIT will set up a panel of judges to choose three
semifinalists from the videos submitted in Taiwan to be judged in the United
States.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese entries will compete with others in the region.</P>
      <P>Seven winning videos will be chosen -- one each from Sub- Saharan Africa, East
Asia and the Pacific, Europe, the Near East and North Africa, South and Central
Asia, and the Western Hemisphere, as well as one anonymous video.</P>
      <P>Using YouTube as the video platform for the challenge, the winning videos will
be selected from 21 finalists by global online voting. The winners will be
granted an all-expenses paid trip to Washington D.C., New York and Hollywood,
where gala screenings of the winning videos will be held.</P>
      <P>Their work will also get exposure as filmmakers and people in the U.S. film and
television industry will be able to see it.</P>
      <P>"We expect this competition will be well received and lively in Taiwan, not only
because of Taiwan's vibrant democracy, but also because of Taiwan's creativity
in filmmaking, " Thomas Hodges, AIT's Chief of Public Affairs Section, said at
the news conference.</P>
      <P>Lin Wen-chen, president of the non-government Taiwan Foundation for Democracy,
said at the same occasion that he hopes this event will remind and encourage
more people in Taiwan to care about democracy.</P>
      <P>"Speaking of democracy and human rights, I find many of the young generation
take them for granted, " Lin said. "But it takes much effort to protect
democracy and human rights."</P>
      <P>The AIT will hold a screening in Taiwan next March to recognize the three videos
representing Taiwan, along with other video submissions, Robinson said.</P>
      <P>For guidelines, rules and more information about the video challenge, the AIT
advised people interested to visit the Web site

      <P>The exhibition, titled "Exploring Asia: Episode One of the National Palace
Museum's Southern Branch, " is being held in Chiayi Performing Arts Center in
Chiayi County's Minsyong township.</P>
      <P>The 117 items displayed encompass six different Asian art themes -- Buddhist
sculptures, religious scriptures, fabrics and textiles, blue and white
porcelains, tea cultures and traditions, and Western trends in Asian art,
according to National Palace Museum director Chou Kung-shin.</P>
      <P>Chou said most museums in Taiwan focus on Chinese-oriented art and cultures, but
this special exhibition will allow Taiwanese people to learn more about
treasured works from greater Asia, which will be the emphasis of the museum's
southern branch when it opens.</P>
      <P>Visitors will see the world's only Dragon Sutra manuscript written in Tibetan,
which was completed in 1669 under the reign of Qing Dynasty Emperor Kangxi, as
well as many precious Buddhist sculptures made in ancient India, an executive of
the museum said.</P>
      <P>They will also learn from many ancient artifacts about how western aesthetics
infiltrated Asian art and how Asian cultures were viewed by western eyes, the

      <P>Members of Taiwan's medical sector voiced firm and clear opposition Friday to
the government administration's plans to recognize Chinese academic credentials.</P>
      <P>In a public hearing on the impact of recognizing Chinese academic credentials on
Taiwan's medical sector, sponsored by three opposition Democratic  Progressive
Party  (DPP)  legislators,  delegates representing six medical professionals'
groups unanimously opposed President  Ma Ying-jeou's  plans to recognize Chinese
academic credentials and recruit Chinese students beginning next year.</P>
      <P>Shih Hsien-yen, chairman of the Taiwan Medical Association, said China's medical
education systems are notoriously chaotic and its medical school students
normally do not get much internship training before becoming a doctor.</P>
      <P>Such facts prove that Chinese medical practitioners, as well as Taiwanese
citizens who have received medical education in China and earned medical
credentials there, will not be able to provide quality medical services to
Taiwanese patients, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Tseng Hsiu-yi, a director with the National Union of Nurses' Associations, said
the influx of Chinese medical personnel into Taiwan and the return of Taiwanese
students who have earned medical credentials in China, would certainly lead to
the quality of Taiwan's medical and nursing care being compromised.</P>
      <P>In response to Shih and Tseng's remarks, Shih Mei-chun, an official with the
Bureau of Medical Affairs under Taiwan's Department of Health (DOH), reassured
the group that while the government plans to recognize Chinese academic
credentials, the DOH's stance is to keep Taiwan's doors closed to all Chinese
academic credentials issued by China's medical sector, based on consideration of
Taiwanese people's health and welfare.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the public hearing, Wang Ming-yuan, an official with the
Education Ministry's Department of Higher Education, said the ministry will
respect the opinions of the DOH and local medical professionals when planning to
hire medical professionals from China or Taiwanese people who have obtained
medical credentials issued by Chinese medical institutes.</P>
      <P>Lin Kuang-chi, a department chief of the Ministry of Examination, said although
according to the stipulations of the World Trade Organization's (WTO) General
Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) , Taiwan may not be able to recognize
Chinese academic credentials WITHOUT allowing Chinese citizens who have passed
examinations in Taiwan to obtain Taiwanese professional licenses, the WTO will
still respect the ways member countries deal with its own regulations applied
within the countries.</P>
      <P>Besides, Lin said, only Taiwanese citizens who are Republic of China ID card
holders are eligible to sit tests in Taiwan for professional licenses.</P>
      <P>His remarks indicate that even if Taiwan recognizes Chinese academic
credentials, mainland Chinese would still need to obtain professional licenses
in Taiwan in order to work in their profession.</P>
      <P>"Chinese people will not be able to apply to sit tests in Taiwan for
professional licenses because they are not ROC citizens, "Lin added.</P>
      <P>President Ma told a group of visiting Chinese scholars in September that Taiwan
will recognize Chinese academic credentials and recruit Chinese students from
next year.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that he will receive Chen Yunlin, president
of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), in his
capacity as president of the Republic of China when Chen visits Taiwan early
next month.</P>
      <P>During an exclusive interview with the Central News Agency, Ma said that he and
Chen "certainly will meet face-to-face," and that the issue of how both sides
will address each other will be handled according to the principles of
"reciprocity and dignity."</P>
      <P>Chen is tentatively scheduled to arrive in Taipei Nov. 3 for a five-day visit at
the invitation of Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) --
the counterpart of ARATS -- for a second round of talks with SEF Chairman Chiang
Pin-kung.</P>
      <P>They last met in Beijing in June.</P>
      <P>The president said that Chen's visit to Taiwan provides an important symbolism
of reciprocity and dignity, meaning that although both sides of the Taiwan
Strait do not recognize each other at this stage, they can at least refrain from
denying each other.</P>
      <P>"Both sides can use pragmatic and flexible ways to resolve our differences," Ma
said. "There is no need to create difficulties in certain areas to obstruct the
badly needed exchanges between the two sides."</P>
      <P>Citing an example, Ma said when the Red Cross societies of Taiwan and China were
to sign the Kinmen Agreement in 1990 to repatriate fugitives, criminals and
illegal migrants from each other's side, the two sides could not agree on
whether to use the ROC or Western calendar.</P>
      <P>The issue was finally resolved after both sides agreed to write down only the
month and date while leaving the space for the year blank.</P>
      <P>Another example, according to Ma, was that the direct weekend charter flights
between Taiwan and China began in July smoothly after both sides agreed to
define the air routes they served as "special routes," defusing the dispute as
to whether they were domestic or international air routes.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that the results of all local opinion surveys showed that the
people are supportive of Chen's visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I don't think the (opposition) Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) would object
to his visit either," he said, adding that Chen's second round of talks with
Chiang will result in greater convenience for DPP members who need to go to
China.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the Oct. 21 incident in which Chen's deputy, Zhang Mingqing, was
besieged and jostled to the ground by pro-independence protesters while visiting
the Confucian Temple in Tainan, southern Taiwan, the president said that the
government must severely condemn violence and not allow such incidents to happen
again.</P>
      <P>"We will especially not allow such things to occur while Chen Yunlin is visiting
Taiwan. We will absolutely see to that," he said.</P>
      <P>"Isn't it self-contradictory for (the activists in) Taiwan to urge China to
renounce the use force against Taiwan and repeatedly criticize China for being
unwilling to give up use the use of force, while they themselves apply violence
to a visitor from China?" Ma asked.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Taiwan has an obligation to protect the safety of all people
who enter its borders, whether they are from the Chinese mainland or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>At the end of the first meeting between Chiang and Chen in Beijing June 12-13,
they signed agreements to launch weekend charter flights between Taiwan and
China and expand Chinese tourists' access to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In their forthcoming second round of talks in Taipei, they are expected to
discuss direct air routes and the opening of more airports for the current
weekend charter flights, as well as direct cargo flights, direct maritime links,
and a framework for cooperation on food safety.</P>
      <P>Chen will become the highest-ranking official of the People's Republic of China
to have ever set foot in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan plans to help Pacific allies cope with waste disposal problem</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
10/24/08  20:11:41
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is working to broaden the scope of its aid to its Pacific allies, from
medical and agricultural technical assistance to environmental areas such as
garbage disposal, officials of the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Following a ministerial forum between Taiwan and its six Pacific allies in July
last year, the EPA assigned several teams of experts to make on-site assessments
of the environmental situation in the island countries, before drafting
cooperation plans.</P>
      <P>Wu Yi-lin, a senior environmental specialist at the Greenhouse Gas Office under
the EPA, told the Central News Agency that for the people of the Pacific
islands, the problem of garbage disposal seems to be more pressing than rising
sea levels.</P>
      <P>"The world is focused on the problem of rising sea levels as it is an index of
global climate change, but they (the people living on the Pacific islands) think
that waste disposal is a more urgent matter," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Most of the Pacific island countries are atolls and have little land for waste
dumps, he noted.</P>
      <P>"They fear that they might be submerged, not by the sea, but by trash," he
added.</P>
      <P>Liang Yeon-fong, director of the EPA International Affairs Office and one of the
experts who conducted on-site assessments in the Solomon Islands, Marshall
Islands, Palau and Nauru, told the CNA that garbage disposal is indeed a common
worry among Taiwan's Pacific allies.</P>
      <P>He said the problem can impact significantly on the economy of some countries,
particularly those that depend on tourism, as tourists are usually repelled by a
dirty, disorderly environment.</P>
      <P>These Pacific countries have only simple and crude waste dumps, and sometimes
garbage is piled up in the open, Liang said.</P>
      <P>To solve the waste disposal problem, Taiwan's Pacific allies need not only money
but also technical assistance and personnel training, he said.</P>
      <P>According  to Liang,  the Solomon  Islands wanted a waste incinerator, but
considering the technical expertise needed to maintain and operate such a
facility, the EPA thought this would not be a practical solution to the waste
disposal problem there.</P>
      <P>The evaluation teams reported that the Solomon Islands once obtained an
incinerator for medical waste, but within three months the equipment broke down
because it was not operated correctly, and it has not been in use since due to a
lack of funds and expertise to repair it.</P>
      <P>Noting that most of the waste in the Pacific island countries is biodegradable
material such as fruit skins and pits, Liang said that collection is the main
problem, as there are insufficient garbage trucks and public trash cans in those
countries.</P>
      <P>He suggested that degradable garbage can be used as organic fertilizers, a
practice that is already being observed by some Taiwanese agricultural missions
there.</P>
      <P>In a report presented to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) which controls
Taiwan's foreign aid budget, the EPA suggested donating garbage trucks to the
Pacific allies and helping them to establish recycling systems.</P>
      <P>The EPA has no budget for foreign aid, but can provide technical assistance and
manpower to Taiwan's allies.</P>
      <P>Liang urged that the MOFA integrate environmental protection into its foreign
assistance program, which so far has been focused on medical services and
agricultural technical aid.</P>
      <P>"After all,  Taiwan has expertise in waste reduction  and recycling," he said.</P>
      <P>EPA statistics show that Taiwan's recycling rate was 38.7 percent in 2007 --
thanks to a waste classification policy implemented in 2006 -- which compares
well with other developed countries.</P>
      <P>Among Taiwan's 23 diplomatic allies, six, namely Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall
Islands, Solomon Islands, Kiribati and Nauru, are located in the Asia-Pacifica
region.</P>
      <P>In Sep. 2006, the First Summit of Taiwan and Pacific Allies took place in Palau
and the Palau Declaration on coastal management was signed. The declaration
encouraged these countries to make a solid commitment to the protection and
sustainable management of coastal areas and the ocean. It was signed by former
President Chen Shui-bian and leaders of the six Pacific countries.</P>
      <P>In 2007, a Taiwan-Pacific Allies Environment Ministers Meeting was held in
Taipei, with representatives agreeing to develop cooperation plans and action
for environmental protection, intensify interactions between their countries,
and support plans for technology transfer.</P>
      <P>That same year, the Second Summit of Taiwan and Pacific Allies, which was held
in the Marshall Islands, focused on cooperation in the areas of medicine,
sanitation, and environmental protection.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gov't makes no concessions on diplomatic, defense fronts: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday his administration, while seeking to improve
relations with China, has not done anything harmful to the country's sovereignty
and dignity since its inauguration.</P>
      <P>"I have stood firm on both the diplomatic and defense fronts, " Ma said in an
exclusive interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Speaking a day before the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and
several pro-independence groups hold a protest rally against Ma's administration
and China in Taipei, Ma said he supports the expression of opinions in a legal
manner and even agreed with one of the rally's themes -- opposing substandard or
toxic foodstuffs from China.</P>
      <P>"The appeal against the substandard products from China is the government's
policy, " Ma said. "It is a national consensus to stave off imports of
contaminated foodstuffs or dangerous products into Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Ma noted that Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has condemned Chinese companies' shipments
of melamine-tainted milk products and food ingredients to Taiwan and demanded
that they apologize and compensate local victims.</P>
      <P>He also said the Strais Exchange Foundation -- a quasi-official intermediary
body authorized to handle exchanges with China in the absence of official ties
-- is working to establish a mechanism to seek compensation from China.</P>
      <P>The president took issue, however, with the rally's goal of "protecting Taiwan's
sovereign status, " which is based on opposition criticism that Ma's
administration is tilting excessively toward China.</P>
      <P>He described the slogan as empty rhetoric by a handful of people and stressed
that his administration has achieved things that the previous DPP administration
pursued but failed to accomplish.</P>
      <P>He insisted that his government had not made any concessions on Taiwan's
sovereignty to realize those goals, such as agreements to open nonstop direct
weekend cross-srait charter flights between Taiwan and China and expand
opportunities for Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The protest rally comes just two weeks before China's point man on Taiwan,
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits President Chen Yunlin, is to
arrive in Taiwan to negotiate further transportation links between the two sides
and discuss food safety issues and joint crime-fighting efforts.</P>
      <P>Although the protest may voice opposition to Chen's visit, Ma said the results
of all public opinion surveys show that a majority of local people are giving it
a thumbs-up.</P>
      <P>"I think even the DPP itself would not oppose his visit because the issues to be
addressed during his visit are related to DPP members and supporters," Ma said.</P>
      <P>When the DPP was in power, Ma recalled, the DPP also pushed for the
establishment of direct air links to facilitate the cross-strait travel of local
businessmen who have operations in China.</P>
      <P>On the DPP's criticism  that Taiwan's sovereign status is threatened under Ma's
administration, Ma asserted that to date, he has not seen a single thing the
government is doing that could be detrimental to the country's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, Ma said, his administration's consolidation of relations with
the country's diplomatic allies, completion of an arms procurement deal with the
United States, and reduction of tensions in the Taiwan Strait, all will
solidify, not weaken, Taiwan's sovereign status.</P>
      <P>"What I'm doing or have done is all based on the concept of contributing to
Taiwan and its people and has never flinched on diplomatic and national defense
stances," Ma said.</P>
      <P>With a conciliatory approach, Ma went on, his administration has succeeded in
purchasing weapons systems from the United States to beef up Taiwan's defense
capability while reviving the long-stalled cross-strait dialogue and reducing
cross-strait tensions.</P>
      <P>"All these developments are in the interest of the United States and Japan, two
of Taiwan's most important trading partners," Ma said, adding that the scenario
is also in the interests of Taiwan and China and meets international
expectations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Development fund expanded for long-term investment: economic planner</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
10/24/08  20:46:18

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet's plan to expand the National Development Fund (NDF) is aimed at
increasing the government's long-term investment in potentially successful local
enterprises to help them improve the quality of corporate management, in an
effort to stabilize the local economy, the country's top economic planner said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Tain-jy, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) , made the remarks to allay public concerns that the government's NDF
expansion plan was initiated for the purpose of bailing out trouble enterprises
and rescuing the stock market.</P>
      <P>Chen made the comment after announcing the Cabinet's decision earlier in the day
to expand the size of the fund from NT$200 billion (US$6.01 billion) to NT$1
trillion to give momentum to the economy.</P>
      <P>Chen said, however, that the additional funds will also be used to invest in
private enterprises that are facing liquidity problem because of global
financial crisis but still have sound fundamentals and promising future.</P>
      <P>He said that to his knowledge, a bailout occurs when a company that fails to pay
interest to its creditor banks eventually strikes a deal for a solution with the
help of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The National Development Fund has
nothing to do with this process, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the Cabinet plans to expand the fund's functions to include a
role in corporate capital increase, reconstructions, mergers and acquisitions.</P>
      <P>He said that the fund would continue to focus its investments primarily in the
manufacturing sector and the service industry. Although the banking system is
part of the service industry, the government prefers not to invest NDF money in
the banking industry, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>As the government has stakes in more than 50 percent of Taiwan's financial
institutions, most of the county's banks enjoy high liquidity, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>If financial institutions want to engage in corporate mergers, they have the
capability to do so on their own, Chen said, adding that it would be better if
the government did not step in.</P>
      <P>The top economic planner also said the government will establish a cross-agency
mechanism to govern the NDF assessment and decision-making process which will be
handled by the board of directors. The NDF board of directors will decide on the
eligibility of companies that apply for NDF funds for purposes such as corporate
recapitalization and reconstruction, he added.</P>
      <P>The board of directors will assess applications not only on the basis on
"venture capital" investment programs, but will also take into consideration
other plans for strategic industrial investment, he explained.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President clarifies 'two areas' concept, reaffirms mutual non-denial</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday the Republic of China is a sovereign state
and defined relations across the Taiwan Strait as a special relationship.</P>
      <P>He also stressed that conceptualizing Taiwan and mainland China as "two areas"
was not his invention, but believed the framework offered a way for the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait to sidestep sovereignty questions in pursuing closer
ties as long as each side did not deny the other's existence.</P>
      <P>Ma said consultations between the two sides' intermediary bodies have been
conducted under such a "mutual non-denial" framework.</P>
      <P>Elaborating on the issue during an exclusive interview with the Central News
Agency, Ma said although a total of 171 countries worldwide have recognized the
People's Republic of China as a state, Taiwan cannot do so, because if Taiwan
were to recognize the PRC, it would be "recognizing the existence of another
country on its own territory."</P>
      <P>Ma was referring to the fact that the territory of the Republic of China, as
defined in the country's Constitution, covers not only Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen
and Matsu where its jurisdiction reaches, but also the Chinese mainland,
overlapping with the territorial area claimed by the PRC.</P>
      <P>"It is impossible for the two sides to recognize each other, but they can
achieve mutual non-denial," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma first put forth in August the concept that ties between Taiwan and the
mainland are a type of "special relations" and ruled out the possibility that
they could be links "between two states."</P>
      <P>Such a concept, in which Taiwan and the mainland are referred to as  "areas,  "
drew  strong  protests  from  the  opposition pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party, which accused Ma of downgrading Taiwan's status from a
sovereign state to a "region" similar to Tibet and Xinjiang.</P>
      <P>Ma, however, asserted during the interview that the policy has not changed the
status of the Republic of China as a sovereign state or his status as the
president of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the "two areas" concept is not his own invention but could be
dated back to 1991, when then President Lee Teng-hui announced the termination
of the Period of National Mobilization for Suppression of the Communist
Rebellion to acknowledge the fact that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are
under separate rule.</P>
      <P>The move symbolized that the communist regime established on Oct. 1, 1949 in
China is no longer considered by the ROC as a "rebellious group, " but "a
governing authority that has de facto rule of the mainland," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Over the past 17 years, several other concepts have been put forth by the
country's leaders to try to define cross-strait relations, but none has been
proven feasible, he said.</P>
      <P>These include the "special state-to-state relations" proposed by Lee in 1999,
and the "one country on either side" theory raised by then President Chen Shui-
bian in 2002, Ma noted.</P>
      <P>In particular, Chen's statement sparked U.S. concerns that Taiwan was trying to
change the cross-strait status quo unilaterally, indicating that such a
statement was unhelpful to Taiwan's effort to assert its sovereignty, Ma said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Modularly-assembled' target drugs developed by medical researchers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Medical researchers at National Cheng Kung University Hospital have found a new
way to produce target drugs that allows physicians to build an optimal
combination of "targeting" and "curing" elements based on the characteristics of
the cancer under focus, the Tainan-based hospital announced Friday.</P>
      <P>Introducing the idea of "smart ammunition, " the researchers explained that a
"modularly-assembled" target drug is similar to a smart missile that is made of
a targeting unit that can best seek the target under given conditions -- whether
it should be heat- seeking, infra-red targeting,  or radar guidance --  and an
ammunition compartment that can deliver the greatest damage to the designated
target --  whether it should be standard,  armor-piercing  or incendiary.</P>
      <P>Shieh Dar-bin, an oral disease expert at the hospital, said that individual
patients may develop different variances of a cancer, which possess unique cell
surface antigens, and show specific conditions that require customized therapy
to induce the best curative effects.</P>
      <P>To target cancer cells, physicians have to select a targeting module, or
"moiety, " that recognizes the given type of antigen, Shieh said.</P>
      <P>To kill the tumorous cells, the physician should select a curing agent that can
most efficiently destroy them according to the patients' condition.</P>
      <P>"These factors may not be easily predetermined in the laboratory or the
production line," Shieh noted.</P>
      <P>"What we do is to allow greater flexibility for physicians in terms of selecting
and using the drugs that can best heal their patients," Shieh said.</P>
      <P>For example, Shieh said, if there are 10 existing targeting modules and 10
available curing agents, a facility capable of combining modularly-assembled
target drugs would be able to produce 100 different combinations of drugs.</P>
      <P>And the physicians who have placed the orders can then apply the tailor-made
drugs to their patient, added Shieh.</P>
      <P>According to the hospital, the new target drugs have passed animal testing, and
it has applied for permission to test the modular approach on humans. With luck,
the therapy could be available in hospitals in five years, Shieh said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that the establishment of direct shipping
links across the Taiwan Strait would facilitate Taiwan's fruit exports to China
because it would reduce delivery times considerably.</P>
      <P>Speaking in an exclusive interview with the Central News Agency, Ma said that
forging cross-strait maritime links will be one of the topics to be addressed
during a top-level cross-strait meeting to be held in Taipei early next month.</P>
      <P>Ma was referring to a much-anticipated meeting between Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart, Chen
Yunlin, president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS).</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the opening of direct cross-strait shipping services will
shorten transportation times to less than half of the eight days it currently
takes to navigate to China via indirect routes.</P>
      <P>"Once direct shipping services are available, Taiwan-grown fruit can reach the
Chinese mainland in just four days or even in 10 hours, " Ma said, adding that
the shortened delivery time will not only help cut transportation costs but will
also be conducive to preserving fruit freshness and prolonging its shelf life.</P>
      <P>Besides fruit growers, the local aquaculture industry will also benefit from the
establishment of direct cross-strait shipping links, he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that many locally farmed fish species have enjoyed growing popularity in
China, Ma said fishery exports to China could increase further with the opening
of direct shipping services.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, China's point man on Taiwan, is expected to arrive in Taiwan Nov. 3
to meet with SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung on a broad range of topics, from
maritime links and the expansion of the existing weekend direct charter flights
and Chinese tourist arrivals, to the opening of cargo charter flights, new
flight routes, and food safety issues.</P>
      <P>Ma said that following the Taipei round of the Chiang-Chen talks, cross-strait
travel may be further eased, with Taiwan allowing the minimum number of members
of each Chinese tour group to be cut from the current 10 to five or even fewer
to attract more Chinese tourist arrivals.</P>
      <P>Many Chinese citizens have expressed interest in backpacking in Taiwan,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Bakeries in Pingtung County, southern Taiwan, urged the government Friday to
grant them business tax exemptions or reductions because many of them are on the
brink of collapse.</P>
      <P>Wang Chia-jung,  president  of the Pingtung  County Bakery Association, told
reporters that 26 of the 220 bakery shops in Pingtung County had shut down,
while many others were struggling to survive after suffering two serious blows
as a result of contaminated material and ingredients imported from China.</P>
      <P>Wang said that reports about the melamine-tainted milk power supplied by Chinese
dairy product companies in mid-September had caused the bakeries to lose 50
percent of their business.</P>
      <P>To make the situation worse, it was reported last week that a bread raising
agent, ammonium bicarbonate, imported by Taiwan from China also was also found
to contain the toxic chemical melamine, he added.</P>
      <P>As a result, many of these bakeries that used to sell at least 200 pineapple
buns -- their mainstay product -- a day now cannot sell even one bun, although
they have given the public the assurance that they used yeast, not ammonium
bicarbonate, as the raising agent in the pineapple buns, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"These shops have lost 90 percent of their business and are unable to cope with
the hardship any more. Some of them do not even have the money to pay their
membership fees to the association. They need a helping hand from the
government," he urged.</P>
      <P>Pingtung County's Deputy Magistrate Chung Chia-pin and his wife tried to support
the bakeries at a bread-making demonstration by eating some of the pineapple
buns and puff pastries to drive home the point that the products were not made
with ammonium bicarbonate.</P>

      <P>Top-seeded Chan Yung-jan from Taiwan continued her rampage through the draw at
the 2008 OEC Taipei Ladies Open Friday, while the comeback of a former top-five
player from Japan hit a roadblock.</P>
      <P>Chan, who had expected a tough battle against seventh-seeded Jessica Moore of
Australia, relentlessly subdued her opponent 6-0, 6-0 in 40 minutes, yielding a
mere 16 points in the 12 games.</P>
      <P>With the victory, Chan advanced to the semifinals of the US$100,000 tournament
being played at the Taipei Arena, where she will face Corinna Dentoni of Italy.</P>
      <P>Chan admitted that she was surprised at the ease of her victory because Moore is
known for her tenacity and dangerous forehand, but the Taiwanese world No. 74
said she was able to neutralize the Australian's weapon by playing points at a
faster pace and forcing her opponent into making repeated errors.</P>
      <P>The 19-year-old, who has lost only five games in the first three matches of the
tournament, said she wasn't sure what to expect from the mercurial Dentoni, but
hoped to continue her winning ways and win her first singles trophy of the year.</P>
      <P>Dentoni reached the semifinals by edging past 38-year-old Kimiko Date-Krumm 5-7,
7-5, 7-6 (4).</P>
      <P>Date-Krumm reached a career-high singles ranking of fourth in the world in May
1995 but retired at the end of 1996 at the age of 26 while still playing at a
very high level.</P>
      <P>She later said she hated the game her lost two years on tour because she didn't
enjoy traveling the world and being alone.</P>
      <P>But married and with a different outlook, the Japanese veteran decided this year
to mount a comeback and her appearance in Taipei was her first outside of Japan
in her return to competitive tennis.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's other remaining hopeful in the tournment was eliminated Friday, as
Chang Kai-chen lost to sixth-seeded Jarmila Gajdosova of Slovakia 6-4, 6-2. The
Slovakian will play Japan's Kumiko Iijima in Saturday's other semifinal.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun reached the semifinal of the US$125,000
Challenger-level Samsung Securities Open in Seoul by winning two matches Friday.</P>
      <P>Forced to play twice after his scheduled match was rained out Thursday, Lu first
defeated Kristian Pless of Denmark 7-6 (11), 6-1 and then topped Bjorn Phau of
Germany 7-6 (6), 7-5.</P>
      <P>World No. 65 Lu, who climbed to the highest ranking of his career after winning
a US$125,000 challenger in Uzbekistan last week, will next face South Korea's
Lee Hyung-taik, a former top-50 player who has breezed through the first three
rounds of the Seoul event, losing only 10 games in three matches.</P>
      <P>Lu has a 1-2 record lifetime against the Korean.</P>

      <P>An agreement on cargo charter flights between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
will be among the four accords to be signed during the second round of cross-
Taiwan Strait talks, a senior official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman and secretary-general of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), said the other three agreements will be on direct shipping and
postal links as well as on food safety.</P>
      <P>Kao is scheduled to travel to Shenzhen in southern China next Monday for
apreparatory meeting with the SEF's counterpart, the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Asked whether ARATS President Chen Yunlin will arrive in Taiwan Nov.3 for the
meeting, Kao said that was the date proposed by the SEF, but that "Beijing has
yet to give a formal response."</P>
      <P>Kao, who held talks with the ARATS in Shenzhen Thursday on the agenda for the
meeting, said both sides are now "close to" setting up the agenda for the second
meeting.</P>
      <P>On the air links agreement, Kao said that the issue will include more charter
flights and flight destinations, straighter flight routes, and cargo charter
flights.</P>
      <P>He also said that at least two destinations in China -- Shanghai and Guangdong
-- will be designated for cargo charter flights.</P>
      <P>He said direct postal links between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been
limited in the past to ordinary or registered mail, and will be expanded to
include parcel post and express mail.</P>
      <P>In addition, both sides will strike an initial agreement on the issue of food
safety, though it was not included on the agenda until late, he said.</P>
      <P>The recent discovery of melamine-contaminated milk products and food ingredients
from China has given rise to problems in some sectors of Taiwan's food industry
and caused a scare among consumers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's (KMT's) securing the right to use Ketagalan Boulvard or
the plaza in front of the Presidential Office in downtown Taipei during a top
Chinese envoy's visit to Taiwan in early November is tantamount to restricting
local residents' freedom of speech, an opposition leader said Friday.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen was referring  to the
KMT's registration  with Taipei City police authorities for use of Ketagalan
Blvd. in the first week of November when Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-
based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), will visit
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We don't know the purpose of the KMT's registration for use of Ketagalan Blvd.,
but it seems to me that the KMT was trying to restrict freedom of speech during
Chen's visit, " Tsai told a news conference during which she also explained the
main goals of a mass rally to be staged by the party at Ketagalan Blvd.
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The DPP is collaborating with another opposition party -- the Taiwan Solidarity
Union -- and several pro-independence groups to organize mass marches through
five parts of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Participants in those parades will then gather at Ketagalan Blvd. in front of
the Presidential Office to voice their opposition to what they call the current
KMT government's China-leaning policy and China's shipments of toxic or
substandard foodstuffs to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai said it is clear that the DPP's mass rally at Ketagalan Blvd. is to express
its opinions on issues of public concern and voice its protest against the
government's pandering to China.</P>
      <P>In contrast, she said, the KMT's control of the site in early November is
apparently aimed at restricting fredom of speech and freedom of expression.</P>
      <P>With the right to use the plaza falling into the hands of the KMT, opposition
parties and supporters will be unable to stage anti-government or anti-China
activities there during Chen's visit.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said the party looks forward to atract
up to 500,000 people to join the marches whose main goals include pushing China
to apologize for shipping melamine-tainted milk products and food ingredients to
Taiwan and compensate local victims and pushing President Ma Ying-jeou's
administration to apologize for what he calls its many wrong policies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several ruling Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers on Friday urged the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to cancel its planned protest rally against
the government slated for Saturday, describing the rally as "propping up the
corrupt (former President) Chen Shui-bian."</P>
      <P>The rally, being co-sponsored by the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union,
will target "the one China market, the downgrading of Taiwan's sovereignty, and
an incompetent government."</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Legislative Yuan, KMT caucus whip Kuo Su-chun pointed out that
the DPP has been unwilling to separate itself from the former president, who is
being investigated for money laundering and corruption, or to ask him not to
participate in the rally.</P>
      <P>Instead, the DPP "would rather walk hand-in-hand with this former president who
deprived Taiwan of its dignity, " she said, adding that the party nevertheless
still insists on calling itself the party of conscience and reform.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Legislator Tsao Erh-chang pointed to the irony of the DPP holding
a rally to protest incompetent government when "former President Chen is the
most incompetent of them all, " a fact over which DPP Chairman Tsai Ing-wen has
"feigned ignorance."</P>
      <P>The KMT legislators' calls for the rally to be canceled came in response to
remarks by DPP legislators, including Twu Shiing-jer and Su Cheng-ching, at the
same legislative session in which they urged citizens to take part in the rally
to voice their dissatisfaction with the current government.</P>
      <P>Twu accused the government of being aloof and caring more about whether China's
top negotiator will come to Taiwan than about the fact that three out of four
people have lost confidence in the Cabinet.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New mindset needed for competitive gaming industry: Taichung mayor</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu told Macau media that the views of Taiwan's people will
have to change drastically before the country can establish  a gaming industry
that is competitive.</P>
      <P>In an interview published Friday in the Macao Daily News which was seen here, Hu
said that leading gambing centers such as Las Vegas now focus on more than just
gambing, offering a wide variety of other leisure and entertainment options for
visitors that allow for more diversified development.</P>
      <P>As for whether Taiwan can become an international gaming center, Hu said that
although investors from Las Vegas and Macao have expressed interest in the Chen-
nan recreational area in Taichung County as a potential center, authorities have
no intention at the present time of establishing such an industry there.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Hu said, he has not actively sought investors, adding that he doesn't
think a gaming industry will be set up anywhere else in Taiwan in the near term.</P>
      <P>Hu also talked about the launch of direct charter flights between Taichung and
Xiamen, China, in July this year, expressing the hope that Taichung and Macau
can actively work together to expand flights between the two destinations to
increase their respective tourism industries.</P>
      <P>Noting that the four cities and counties of central Taiwan have a combined
population of more than 6 million as well as plenty of tourist attractions while
Macao continues to develop its own unique tourism resources, Hu said that there
is a lot of potential for expansion of flight services between the two
destinations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Expansion of cross-strait charters could keep businessmen at home</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Most Taiwanese business owners with operations in China have little choice but
to live in China, but that could change if the cross-Taiwan Strait charter
flight services were more convenient, according to the results of a survey
released Friday by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>The results revealed that if the weekend cross-strait charter services,
currently operated between Friday and Monday, were extended to every day of the
week, 42.6 percent of China-based Taiwanese business owners would choose to live
in Taiwan, while 53.7 percent would still live in China.</P>
      <P>The survey results were based on 1,227 valid questionnaires received from
business class passengers on weekend cross-strait charter flights between Sept.
5-8.</P>
      <P>According to Minister of Transportation and Communications Mao Chi-kuo, the
results show that Taiwanese entrepreneurs doing business in China do not
necessarily have to live in China in the future.</P>
      <P>The change would help decrease the incidence of infidelity that is very
prevalent among Taiwanese businesspeople who live separately from their spouses,
Mao said.</P>
      <P>Asked if the extension of the cross-strait charter services would increase their
intention to invest in Taiwan, 74.8 percent of respondents gave a positive
answer.</P>
      <P>Another 18.3 percent of respondents said it would not help. Among the reasons
mentioned were Taiwan's high labor and land costs, the severe industrial exodus
from Taiwan and an unwillingness to change the status quo.</P>
      <P>As to whether the extension would raise their desire to invest in China, 56.2
percent of respondents believed it would help, while 20.8 percent did not think
it would lead to any changes.</P>
      <P>The weekend cross-strait charter flight services were launched on July 4 this
year.</P>
      <P>During upcoming  talks set for early November  in Taipei, representatives of
Taiwan and China are expected to discuss the possibilities of extending the
services to all days of the week, increasing the number of routes and flights
included in the charter services, and opening more direct nonstop cross-strait
air routes.</P>

      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) on Friday launched the Taiwan portion of
a worldwide contest aimed at enhancing the global dialogue on democracy.</P>
      <P>The competition, called "Democracy Video Challenge, " asks budding filmmakers,
democracy advocates, and the general public to create video clips that complete
the phrase, "Democracy is..."</P>
      <P>Scott Robinson, director of the AIT's American Culture Center, told a news
conference that the AIT will set up a panel of judges to choose three
semifinalists from the videos submitted in Taiwan to be judged in the United
States.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese entries will compete with others in the region.</P>
      <P>Seven winning videos will be chosen -- one each from Sub- Saharan Africa, East
Asia and the Pacific, Europe, the Near East and North Africa, South and Central
Asia, and the Western Hemisphere, as well as one anonymous video.</P>
      <P>Using YouTube as the video platform for the challenge, the winning videos will
be selected from 21 finalists by global online voting. The winners will be
granted an all-expenses paid trip to Washington D.C., New York and Hollywood,
where gala screenings of the winning videos will be held.</P>
      <P>Their work will also get exposure as filmmakers and people in the U.S. film and
television industry will be able to see it.</P>
      <P>"We expect this competition will be well received and lively in Taiwan, not only
because of Taiwan's vibrant democracy, but also because of Taiwan's creativity
in filmmaking, " Thomas Hodges, AIT's Chief of Public Affairs Section, said at
the news conference.</P>
      <P>Lin Wen-chen, president of the non-government Taiwan Foundation for Democracy,
said at the same occasion that he hopes this event will remind and encourage
more people in Taiwan to care about democracy.</P>
      <P>"Speaking of democracy and human rights, I find many of the young generation
take them for granted, " Lin said. "But it takes much effort to protect
democracy and human rights."</P>
      <P>The AIT will hold a screening in Taiwan next March to recognize the three videos
representing Taiwan, along with other video submissions, Robinson said.</P>
      <P>For guidelines, rules and more information about the video challenge, the AIT

      <P>The National Palace Museum in suburban Taipei has launched a special exhibition
in southern Taiwan on Asian art and culture to herald the establishment of the
museum's southern branch, scheduled for completion in 2011.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, titled "Exploring Asia: Episode One of the National Palace
Museum's Southern Branch, " is being held in Chiayi Performing Arts Center in
Chiayi County's Minsyong township.</P>
      <P>The 117 items displayed encompass six different Asian art themes -- Buddhist
sculptures, religious scriptures, fabrics and textiles, blue and white
porcelains, tea cultures and traditions, and Western trends in Asian art,
according to National Palace Museum director Chou Kung-shin.</P>
      <P>Chou said most museums in Taiwan focus on Chinese-oriented art and cultures, but
this special exhibition will allow Taiwanese people to learn more about
treasured works from greater Asia, which will be the emphasis of the museum's
southern branch when it opens.</P>
      <P>Visitors will see the world's only Dragon Sutra manuscript written in Tibetan,
which was completed in 1669 under the reign of Qing Dynasty Emperor Kangxi, as
well as many precious Buddhist sculptures made in ancient India, an executive of
the museum said.</P>
      <P>They will also learn from many ancient artifacts about how western aesthetics
infiltrated Asian art and how Asian cultures were viewed by western eyes, the

      <P>Members of Taiwan's medical sector voiced firm and clear opposition Friday to
the government administration's plans to recognize Chinese academic credentials.</P>
      <P>In a public hearing on the impact of recognizing Chinese academic credentials on
Taiwan's medical sector, sponsored by three opposition Democratic  Progressive
Party  (DPP)  legislators,  delegates representing six medical professionals'
groups unanimously opposed President  Ma Ying-jeou's  plans to recognize Chinese
academic credentials and recruit Chinese students beginning next year.</P>
      <P>Shih Hsien-yen, chairman of the Taiwan Medical Association, said China's medical
education systems are notoriously chaotic and its medical school students
normally do not get much internship training before becoming a doctor.</P>
      <P>Such facts prove that Chinese medical practitioners, as well as Taiwanese
citizens who have received medical education in China and earned medical
credentials there, will not be able to provide quality medical services to
Taiwanese patients, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Tseng Hsiu-yi, a director with the National Union of Nurses' Associations, said
the influx of Chinese medical personnel into Taiwan and the return of Taiwanese
students who have earned medical credentials in China, would certainly lead to
the quality of Taiwan's medical and nursing care being compromised.</P>
      <P>In response to Shih and Tseng's remarks, Shih Mei-chun, an official with the
Bureau of Medical Affairs under Taiwan's Department of Health (DOH), reassured
the group that while the government plans to recognize Chinese academic
credentials, the DOH's stance is to keep Taiwan's doors closed to all Chinese
academic credentials issued by China's medical sector, based on consideration of
Taiwanese people's health and welfare.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the public hearing, Wang Ming-yuan, an official with the
Education Ministry's Department of Higher Education, said the ministry will
respect the opinions of the DOH and local medical professionals when planning to
hire medical professionals from China or Taiwanese people who have obtained
medical credentials issued by Chinese medical institutes.</P>
      <P>Lin Kuang-chi, a department chief of the Ministry of Examination, said although
according to the stipulations of the World Trade Organization's (WTO) General
Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) , Taiwan may not be able to recognize
Chinese academic credentials WITHOUT allowing Chinese citizens who have passed
examinations in Taiwan to obtain Taiwanese professional licenses, the WTO will
still respect the ways member countries deal with its own regulations applied
within the countries.</P>
      <P>Besides, Lin said, only Taiwanese citizens who are Republic of China ID card
holders are eligible to sit tests in Taiwan for professional licenses.</P>
      <P>His remarks indicate that even if Taiwan recognizes Chinese academic
credentials, mainland Chinese would still need to obtain professional licenses
in Taiwan in order to work in their profession.</P>
      <P>"Chinese people will not be able to apply to sit tests in Taiwan for
professional licenses because they are not ROC citizens, "Lin added.</P>
      <P>President Ma told a group of visiting Chinese scholars in September that Taiwan
will recognize Chinese academic credentials and recruit Chinese students from
next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President to meet Chinese official based on 'reciprocity, dignity'</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that he will receive Chen Yunlin, president
of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), in his
capacity as president of the Republic of China when Chen visits Taiwan early
next month.</P>
      <P>During an exclusive interview with the Central News Agency, Ma said that he and
Chen "certainly will meet face-to-face," and that the issue of how both sides
will address each other will be handled according to the principles of
"reciprocity and dignity."</P>
      <P>Chen is tentatively scheduled to arrive in Taipei Nov. 3 for a five-day visit at
the invitation of Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) --
the counterpart of ARATS -- for a second round of talks with SEF Chairman Chiang
Pin-kung.</P>
      <P>They last met in Beijing in June.</P>
      <P>The president said that Chen's visit to Taiwan provides an important symbolism
of reciprocity and dignity, meaning that although both sides of the Taiwan
Strait do not recognize each other at this stage, they can at least refrain from
denying each other.</P>
      <P>"Both sides can use pragmatic and flexible ways to resolve our differences," Ma
said. "There is no need to create difficulties in certain areas to obstruct the
badly needed exchanges between the two sides."</P>
      <P>Citing an example, Ma said when the Red Cross societies of Taiwan and China were
to sign the Kinmen Agreement in 1990 to repatriate fugitives, criminals and
illegal migrants from each other's side, the two sides could not agree on
whether to use the ROC or Western calendar.</P>
      <P>The issue was finally resolved after both sides agreed to write down only the
month and date while leaving the space for the year blank.</P>
      <P>Another example, according to Ma, was that the direct weekend charter flights
between Taiwan and China began in July smoothly after both sides agreed to
define the air routes they served as "special routes," defusing the dispute as
to whether they were domestic or international air routes.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that the results of all local opinion surveys showed that the
people are supportive of Chen's visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I don't think the (opposition) Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) would object
to his visit either," he said, adding that Chen's second round of talks with
Chiang will result in greater convenience for DPP members who need to go to
China.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the Oct. 21 incident in which Chen's deputy, Zhang Mingqing, was
besieged and jostled to the ground by pro-independence protesters while visiting
the Confucian Temple in Tainan, southern Taiwan, the president said that the
government must severely condemn violence and not allow such incidents to happen
again.</P>
      <P>"We will especially not allow such things to occur while Chen Yunlin is visiting
Taiwan. We will absolutely see to that," he said.</P>
      <P>"Isn't it self-contradictory for (the activists in) Taiwan to urge China to
renounce the use force against Taiwan and repeatedly criticize China for being
unwilling to give up use the use of force, while they themselves apply violence
to a visitor from China?" Ma asked.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Taiwan has an obligation to protect the safety of all people
who enter its borders, whether they are from the Chinese mainland or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>At the end of the first meeting between Chiang and Chen in Beijing June 12-13,
they signed agreements to launch weekend charter flights between Taiwan and
China and expand Chinese tourists' access to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In their forthcoming second round of talks in Taipei, they are expected to
discuss direct air routes and the opening of more airports for the current
weekend charter flights, as well as direct cargo flights, direct maritime links,
and a framework for cooperation on food safety.</P>
      <P>Chen will become the highest-ranking official of the People's Republic of China
to have ever set foot in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan plans to help Pacific allies cope with waste disposal problem</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
10/24/08  20:11:41
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is working to broaden the scope of its aid to its Pacific allies, from
medical and agricultural technical assistance to environmental areas such as
garbage disposal, officials of the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Following a ministerial forum between Taiwan and its six Pacific allies in July
last year, the EPA assigned several teams of experts to make on-site assessments
of the environmental situation in the island countries, before drafting
cooperation plans.</P>
      <P>Wu Yi-lin, a senior environmental specialist at the Greenhouse Gas Office under
the EPA, told the Central News Agency that for the people of the Pacific
islands, the problem of garbage disposal seems to be more pressing than rising
sea levels.</P>
      <P>"The world is focused on the problem of rising sea levels as it is an index of
global climate change, but they (the people living on the Pacific islands) think
that waste disposal is a more urgent matter," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Most of the Pacific island countries are atolls and have little land for waste
dumps, he noted.</P>
      <P>"They fear that they might be submerged, not by the sea, but by trash," he
added.</P>
      <P>Liang Yeon-fong, director of the EPA International Affairs Office and one of the
experts who conducted on-site assessments in the Solomon Islands, Marshall
Islands, Palau and Nauru, told the CNA that garbage disposal is indeed a common
worry among Taiwan's Pacific allies.</P>
      <P>He said the problem can impact significantly on the economy of some countries,
particularly those that depend on tourism, as tourists are usually repelled by a
dirty, disorderly environment.</P>
      <P>These Pacific countries have only simple and crude waste dumps, and sometimes
garbage is piled up in the open, Liang said.</P>
      <P>To solve the waste disposal problem, Taiwan's Pacific allies need not only money
but also technical assistance and personnel training, he said.</P>
      <P>According  to Liang,  the Solomon  Islands wanted a waste incinerator, but
considering the technical expertise needed to maintain and operate such a
facility, the EPA thought this would not be a practical solution to the waste
disposal problem there.</P>
      <P>The evaluation teams reported that the Solomon Islands once obtained an
incinerator for medical waste, but within three months the equipment broke down
because it was not operated correctly, and it has not been in use since due to a
lack of funds and expertise to repair it.</P>
      <P>Noting that most of the waste in the Pacific island countries is biodegradable
material such as fruit skins and pits, Liang said that collection is the main
problem, as there are insufficient garbage trucks and public trash cans in those
countries.</P>
      <P>He suggested that degradable garbage can be used as organic fertilizers, a
practice that is already being observed by some Taiwanese agricultural missions
there.</P>
      <P>In a report presented to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) which controls
Taiwan's foreign aid budget, the EPA suggested donating garbage trucks to the
Pacific allies and helping them to establish recycling systems.</P>
      <P>The EPA has no budget for foreign aid, but can provide technical assistance and
manpower to Taiwan's allies.</P>
      <P>Liang urged that the MOFA integrate environmental protection into its foreign
assistance program, which so far has been focused on medical services and
agricultural technical aid.</P>
      <P>"After all,  Taiwan has expertise in waste reduction  and recycling," he said.</P>
      <P>EPA statistics show that Taiwan's recycling rate was 38.7 percent in 2007 --
thanks to a waste classification policy implemented in 2006 -- which compares
well with other developed countries.</P>
      <P>Among Taiwan's 23 diplomatic allies, six, namely Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall
Islands, Solomon Islands, Kiribati and Nauru, are located in the Asia-Pacifica
region.</P>
      <P>In Sep. 2006, the First Summit of Taiwan and Pacific Allies took place in Palau
and the Palau Declaration on coastal management was signed. The declaration
encouraged these countries to make a solid commitment to the protection and
sustainable management of coastal areas and the ocean. It was signed by former
President Chen Shui-bian and leaders of the six Pacific countries.</P>
      <P>In 2007, a Taiwan-Pacific Allies Environment Ministers Meeting was held in
Taipei, with representatives agreeing to develop cooperation plans and action
for environmental protection, intensify interactions between their countries,
and support plans for technology transfer.</P>
      <P>That same year, the Second Summit of Taiwan and Pacific Allies, which was held
in the Marshall Islands, focused on cooperation in the areas of medicine,
sanitation, and environmental protection.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday his administration, while seeking to improve
relations with China, has not done anything harmful to the country's sovereignty
and dignity since its inauguration.</P>
      <P>"I have stood firm on both the diplomatic and defense fronts, " Ma said in an
exclusive interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Speaking a day before the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and
several pro-independence groups hold a protest rally against Ma's administration
and China in Taipei, Ma said he supports the expression of opinions in a legal
manner and even agreed with one of the rally's themes -- opposing substandard or
toxic foodstuffs from China.</P>
      <P>"The appeal against the substandard products from China is the government's
policy, " Ma said. "It is a national consensus to stave off imports of
contaminated foodstuffs or dangerous products into Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Ma noted that Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has condemned Chinese companies' shipments
of melamine-tainted milk products and food ingredients to Taiwan and demanded
that they apologize and compensate local victims.</P>
      <P>He also said the Strais Exchange Foundation -- a quasi-official intermediary
body authorized to handle exchanges with China in the absence of official ties
-- is working to establish a mechanism to seek compensation from China.</P>
      <P>The president took issue, however, with the rally's goal of "protecting Taiwan's
sovereign status, " which is based on opposition criticism that Ma's
administration is tilting excessively toward China.</P>
      <P>He described the slogan as empty rhetoric by a handful of people and stressed
that his administration has achieved things that the previous DPP administration
pursued but failed to accomplish.</P>
      <P>He insisted that his government had not made any concessions on Taiwan's
sovereignty to realize those goals, such as agreements to open nonstop direct
weekend cross-srait charter flights between Taiwan and China and expand
opportunities for Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The protest rally comes just two weeks before China's point man on Taiwan,
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits President Chen Yunlin, is to
arrive in Taiwan to negotiate further transportation links between the two sides
and discuss food safety issues and joint crime-fighting efforts.</P>
      <P>Although the protest may voice opposition to Chen's visit, Ma said the results
of all public opinion surveys show that a majority of local people are giving it
a thumbs-up.</P>
      <P>"I think even the DPP itself would not oppose his visit because the issues to be
addressed during his visit are related to DPP members and supporters," Ma said.</P>
      <P>When the DPP was in power, Ma recalled, the DPP also pushed for the
establishment of direct air links to facilitate the cross-strait travel of local
businessmen who have operations in China.</P>
      <P>On the DPP's criticism  that Taiwan's sovereign status is threatened under Ma's
administration, Ma asserted that to date, he has not seen a single thing the
government is doing that could be detrimental to the country's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, Ma said, his administration's consolidation of relations with
the country's diplomatic allies, completion of an arms procurement deal with the
United States, and reduction of tensions in the Taiwan Strait, all will
solidify, not weaken, Taiwan's sovereign status.</P>
      <P>"What I'm doing or have done is all based on the concept of contributing to
Taiwan and its people and has never flinched on diplomatic and national defense
stances," Ma said.</P>
      <P>With a conciliatory approach, Ma went on, his administration has succeeded in
purchasing weapons systems from the United States to beef up Taiwan's defense
capability while reviving the long-stalled cross-strait dialogue and reducing
cross-strait tensions.</P>
      <P>"All these developments are in the interest of the United States and Japan, two
of Taiwan's most important trading partners," Ma said, adding that the scenario
is also in the interests of Taiwan and China and meets international
expectations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Development fund expanded for long-term investment: economic planner</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
10/24/08  20:46:18

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet's plan to expand the National Development Fund (NDF) is aimed at
increasing the government's long-term investment in potentially successful local
enterprises to help them improve the quality of corporate management, in an
effort to stabilize the local economy, the country's top economic planner said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Tain-jy, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) , made the remarks to allay public concerns that the government's NDF
expansion plan was initiated for the purpose of bailing out trouble enterprises
and rescuing the stock market.</P>
      <P>Chen made the comment after announcing the Cabinet's decision earlier in the day
to expand the size of the fund from NT$200 billion (US$6.01 billion) to NT$1
trillion to give momentum to the economy.</P>
      <P>Chen said, however, that the additional funds will also be used to invest in
private enterprises that are facing liquidity problem because of global
financial crisis but still have sound fundamentals and promising future.</P>
      <P>He said that to his knowledge, a bailout occurs when a company that fails to pay
interest to its creditor banks eventually strikes a deal for a solution with the
help of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The National Development Fund has
nothing to do with this process, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the Cabinet plans to expand the fund's functions to include a
role in corporate capital increase, reconstructions, mergers and acquisitions.</P>
      <P>He said that the fund would continue to focus its investments primarily in the
manufacturing sector and the service industry. Although the banking system is
part of the service industry, the government prefers not to invest NDF money in
the banking industry, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>As the government has stakes in more than 50 percent of Taiwan's financial
institutions, most of the county's banks enjoy high liquidity, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>If financial institutions want to engage in corporate mergers, they have the
capability to do so on their own, Chen said, adding that it would be better if
the government did not step in.</P>
      <P>The top economic planner also said the government will establish a cross-agency
mechanism to govern the NDF assessment and decision-making process which will be
handled by the board of directors. The NDF board of directors will decide on the
eligibility of companies that apply for NDF funds for purposes such as corporate
recapitalization and reconstruction, he added.</P>
      <P>The board of directors will assess applications not only on the basis on
"venture capital" investment programs, but will also take into consideration
other plans for strategic industrial investment, he explained.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President clarifies 'two areas' concept, reaffirms mutual non-denial</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday the Republic of China is a sovereign state
and defined relations across the Taiwan Strait as a special relationship.</P>
      <P>He also stressed that conceptualizing Taiwan and mainland China as "two areas"
was not his invention, but believed the framework offered a way for the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait to sidestep sovereignty questions in pursuing closer
ties as long as each side did not deny the other's existence.</P>
      <P>Ma said consultations between the two sides' intermediary bodies have been
conducted under such a "mutual non-denial" framework.</P>
      <P>Elaborating on the issue during an exclusive interview with the Central News
Agency, Ma said although a total of 171 countries worldwide have recognized the
People's Republic of China as a state, Taiwan cannot do so, because if Taiwan
were to recognize the PRC, it would be "recognizing the existence of another
country on its own territory."</P>
      <P>Ma was referring to the fact that the territory of the Republic of China, as
defined in the country's Constitution, covers not only Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen
and Matsu where its jurisdiction reaches, but also the Chinese mainland,
overlapping with the territorial area claimed by the PRC.</P>
      <P>"It is impossible for the two sides to recognize each other, but they can
achieve mutual non-denial," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma first put forth in August the concept that ties between Taiwan and the
mainland are a type of "special relations" and ruled out the possibility that
they could be links "between two states."</P>
      <P>Such a concept, in which Taiwan and the mainland are referred to as  "areas,  "
drew  strong  protests  from  the  opposition pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party, which accused Ma of downgrading Taiwan's status from a
sovereign state to a "region" similar to Tibet and Xinjiang.</P>
      <P>Ma, however, asserted during the interview that the policy has not changed the
status of the Republic of China as a sovereign state or his status as the
president of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the "two areas" concept is not his own invention but could be
dated back to 1991, when then President Lee Teng-hui announced the termination
of the Period of National Mobilization for Suppression of the Communist
Rebellion to acknowledge the fact that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are
under separate rule.</P>
      <P>The move symbolized that the communist regime established on Oct. 1, 1949 in
China is no longer considered by the ROC as a "rebellious group, " but "a
governing authority that has de facto rule of the mainland," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Over the past 17 years, several other concepts have been put forth by the
country's leaders to try to define cross-strait relations, but none has been
proven feasible, he said.</P>
      <P>These include the "special state-to-state relations" proposed by Lee in 1999,
and the "one country on either side" theory raised by then President Chen Shui-
bian in 2002, Ma noted.</P>
      <P>In particular, Chen's statement sparked U.S. concerns that Taiwan was trying to
change the cross-strait status quo unilaterally, indicating that such a
statement was unhelpful to Taiwan's effort to assert its sovereignty, Ma said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Medical researchers at National Cheng Kung University Hospital have found a new
way to produce target drugs that allows physicians to build an optimal
combination of "targeting" and "curing" elements based on the characteristics of
the cancer under focus, the Tainan-based hospital announced Friday.</P>
      <P>Introducing the idea of "smart ammunition, " the researchers explained that a
"modularly-assembled" target drug is similar to a smart missile that is made of
a targeting unit that can best seek the target under given conditions -- whether
it should be heat- seeking, infra-red targeting,  or radar guidance --  and an
ammunition compartment that can deliver the greatest damage to the designated
target --  whether it should be standard,  armor-piercing  or incendiary.</P>
      <P>Shieh Dar-bin, an oral disease expert at the hospital, said that individual
patients may develop different variances of a cancer, which possess unique cell
surface antigens, and show specific conditions that require customized therapy
to induce the best curative effects.</P>
      <P>To target cancer cells, physicians have to select a targeting module, or
"moiety, " that recognizes the given type of antigen, Shieh said.</P>
      <P>To kill the tumorous cells, the physician should select a curing agent that can
most efficiently destroy them according to the patients' condition.</P>
      <P>"These factors may not be easily predetermined in the laboratory or the
production line," Shieh noted.</P>
      <P>"What we do is to allow greater flexibility for physicians in terms of selecting
and using the drugs that can best heal their patients," Shieh said.</P>
      <P>For example, Shieh said, if there are 10 existing targeting modules and 10
available curing agents, a facility capable of combining modularly-assembled
target drugs would be able to produce 100 different combinations of drugs.</P>
      <P>And the physicians who have placed the orders can then apply the tailor-made
drugs to their patient, added Shieh.</P>
      <P>According to the hospital, the new target drugs have passed animal testing, and
it has applied for permission to test the modular approach on humans. With luck,
the therapy could be available in hospitals in five years, Shieh said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that the establishment of direct shipping
links across the Taiwan Strait would facilitate Taiwan's fruit exports to China
because it would reduce delivery times considerably.</P>
      <P>Speaking in an exclusive interview with the Central News Agency, Ma said that
forging cross-strait maritime links will be one of the topics to be addressed
during a top-level cross-strait meeting to be held in Taipei early next month.</P>
      <P>Ma was referring to a much-anticipated meeting between Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart, Chen
Yunlin, president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS).</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the opening of direct cross-strait shipping services will
shorten transportation times to less than half of the eight days it currently
takes to navigate to China via indirect routes.</P>
      <P>"Once direct shipping services are available, Taiwan-grown fruit can reach the
Chinese mainland in just four days or even in 10 hours, " Ma said, adding that
the shortened delivery time will not only help cut transportation costs but will
also be conducive to preserving fruit freshness and prolonging its shelf life.</P>
      <P>Besides fruit growers, the local aquaculture industry will also benefit from the
establishment of direct cross-strait shipping links, he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that many locally farmed fish species have enjoyed growing popularity in
China, Ma said fishery exports to China could increase further with the opening
of direct shipping services.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, China's point man on Taiwan, is expected to arrive in Taiwan Nov. 3
to meet with SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung on a broad range of topics, from
maritime links and the expansion of the existing weekend direct charter flights
and Chinese tourist arrivals, to the opening of cargo charter flights, new
flight routes, and food safety issues.</P>
      <P>Ma said that following the Taipei round of the Chiang-Chen talks, cross-strait
travel may be further eased, with Taiwan allowing the minimum number of members
of each Chinese tour group to be cut from the current 10 to five or even fewer
to attract more Chinese tourist arrivals.</P>
      <P>Many Chinese citizens have expressed interest in backpacking in Taiwan,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Bakeries in Pingtung County, southern Taiwan, urged the government Friday to
grant them business tax exemptions or reductions because many of them are on the
brink of collapse.</P>
      <P>Wang Chia-jung,  president  of the Pingtung  County Bakery Association, told
reporters that 26 of the 220 bakery shops in Pingtung County had shut down,
while many others were struggling to survive after suffering two serious blows
as a result of contaminated material and ingredients imported from China.</P>
      <P>Wang said that reports about the melamine-tainted milk power supplied by Chinese
dairy product companies in mid-September had caused the bakeries to lose 50
percent of their business.</P>
      <P>To make the situation worse, it was reported last week that a bread raising
agent, ammonium bicarbonate, imported by Taiwan from China also was also found
to contain the toxic chemical melamine, he added.</P>
      <P>As a result, many of these bakeries that used to sell at least 200 pineapple
buns -- their mainstay product -- a day now cannot sell even one bun, although
they have given the public the assurance that they used yeast, not ammonium
bicarbonate, as the raising agent in the pineapple buns, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"These shops have lost 90 percent of their business and are unable to cope with
the hardship any more. Some of them do not even have the money to pay their
membership fees to the association. They need a helping hand from the
government," he urged.</P>
      <P>Pingtung County's Deputy Magistrate Chung Chia-pin and his wife tried to support
the bakeries at a bread-making demonstration by eating some of the pineapple
buns and puff pastries to drive home the point that the products were not made
with ammonium bicarbonate.</P>

      <P>A professor from National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in the southern Taiwan
city of Tainan has been elected a fellow of the U.K.-based Royal Society of
Chemistry (RSC) , becoming the only fellow of the society whose expertise is not
in the field of chemistry, the university said Thursday in a statement.</P>
      <P>Professor Yu-cheng Lin has established a Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS)
laboratory dedicated to developing nanotechnology and MEMS in the areas of
biotechnology and medicine. The laboratory's research lies in the application of
micronano-particle synthesis, electricity, magnetism and thermodynamics in
molecular biology, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Lin graduated from NCKU's Department of Mechanical Engineering in 1985 and
earned a doctoral degree in 1996 in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial
Engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago.</P>
      <P>Established in 1841, the RSC -- an international association headquartered in
London -- is devoted to advancing the chemical sciences. As the largest academic
chemistry institution in Europe, the society now has 46,000 members from around
the world.</P>
      <P>NCKU, which is considered to be one of Taiwan's top five higher education

      <P>Top-seeded Chan Yung-jan from Taiwan continued her rampage through the draw at
the 2008 OEC Taipei Ladies Open Friday, while the comeback of a former top-five
player from Japan hit a roadblock.</P>
      <P>Chan, who had expected a tough battle against seventh-seeded Jessica Moore of
Australia, relentlessly subdued her opponent 6-0, 6-0 in 40 minutes, yielding a
mere 16 points in the 12 games.</P>
      <P>With the victory, Chan advanced to the semifinals of the US$100,000 tournament
being played at the Taipei Arena, where she will face Corinna Dentoni of Italy.</P>
      <P>Chan admitted that she was surprised at the ease of her victory because Moore is
known for her tenacity and dangerous forehand, but the Taiwanese world No. 74
said she was able to neutralize the Australian's weapon by playing points at a
faster pace and forcing her opponent into making repeated errors.</P>
      <P>The 19-year-old, who has lost only five games in the first three matches of the
tournament, said she wasn't sure what to expect from the mercurial Dentoni, but
hoped to continue her winning ways and win her first singles trophy of the year.</P>
      <P>Dentoni reached the semifinals by edging past 38-year-old Kimiko Date-Krumm 5-7,
7-5, 7-6 (4).</P>
      <P>Date-Krumm reached a career-high singles ranking of fourth in the world in May
1995 but retired at the end of 1996 at the age of 26 while still playing at a
very high level.</P>
      <P>She later said she hated the game her lost two years on tour because she didn't
enjoy traveling the world and being alone.</P>
      <P>But married and with a different outlook, the Japanese veteran decided this year
to mount a comeback and her appearance in Taipei was her first outside of Japan
in her return to competitive tennis.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's other remaining hopeful in the tournment was eliminated Friday, as
Chang Kai-chen lost to sixth-seeded Jarmila Gajdosova of Slovakia 6-4, 6-2. The
Slovakian will play Japan's Kumiko Iijima in Saturday's other semifinal.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun reached the semifinal of the US$125,000
Challenger-level Samsung Securities Open in Seoul by winning two matches Friday.</P>
      <P>Forced to play twice after his scheduled match was rained out Thursday, Lu first
defeated Kristian Pless of Denmark 7-6 (11), 6-1 and then topped Bjorn Phau of
Germany 7-6 (6), 7-5.</P>
      <P>World No. 65 Lu, who climbed to the highest ranking of his career after winning
a US$125,000 challenger in Uzbekistan last week, will next face South Korea's
Lee Hyung-taik, a former top-50 player who has breezed through the first three
rounds of the Seoul event, losing only 10 games in three matches.</P>
      <P>Lu has a 1-2 record lifetime against the Korean.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's (KMT's) securing the right to use Ketagalan Boulvard or
the plaza in front of the Presidential Office in downtown Taipei during a top
Chinese envoy's visit to Taiwan in early November is tantamount to restricting
local residents' freedom of speech, an opposition leader said Friday.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen was referring  to the
KMT's registration  with Taipei City police authorities for use of Ketagalan
Blvd. in the first week of November when Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-
based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), will visit
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We don't know the purpose of the KMT's registration for use of Ketagalan Blvd.,
but it seems to me that the KMT was trying to restrict freedom of speech during
Chen's visit, " Tsai told a news conference during which she also explained the
main goals of a mass rally to be staged by the party at Ketagalan Blvd.
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The DPP is collaborating with another opposition party -- the Taiwan Solidarity
Union -- and several pro-independence groups to organize mass marches through
five parts of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Participants in those parades will then gather at Ketagalan Blvd. in front of
the Presidential Office to voice their opposition to what they call the current
KMT government's China-leaning policy and China's shipments of toxic or
substandard foodstuffs to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai said it is clear that the DPP's mass rally at Ketagalan Blvd. is to express
its opinions on issues of public concern and voice its protest against the
government's pandering to China.</P>
      <P>In contrast, she said, the KMT's control of the site in early November is
apparently aimed at restricting fredom of speech and freedom of expression.</P>
      <P>With the right to use the plaza falling into the hands of the KMT, opposition
parties and supporters will be unable to stage anti-government or anti-China
activities there during Chen's visit.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said the party looks forward to atract
up to 500,000 people to join the marches whose main goals include pushing China
to apologize for shipping melamine-tainted milk products and food ingredients to
Taiwan and compensate local victims and pushing President Ma Ying-jeou's
administration to apologize for what he calls its many wrong policies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Modularly-assembled' target drugs developed by medical researchers</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
10/25/08  12:54:45
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Medical researchers at National Cheng Kung University Hospital have found a new
way to produce target drugs that allows physicians to build an optimal
combination of "targeting" and "curing" elements based on the characteristics of
the cancer under focus, the Tainan-based hospital announced Friday.</P>
      <P>Introducing the idea of "smart ammunition, " the researchers explained that a
"modularly-assembled" target drug is similar to a smart missile that is made of
a targeting unit that can best seek the target under given conditions -- whether
it should be heat- seeking, infra-red targeting,  or radar guidance --  and an
ammunition compartment that can deliver the greatest damage to the designated
target --  whether it should be standard,  armor-piercing  or incendiary.</P>
      <P>Shieh Dar-bin, an oral disease expert at the hospital, said that individual
patients may develop different variances of a cancer, which possess unique cell
surface antigens, and show specific conditions that require customized therapy
to induce the best curative effects.</P>
      <P>To target cancer cells, physicians have to select a targeting module, or
"moiety, " that recognizes the given type of antigen, Shieh said.</P>
      <P>To kill the tumorous cells, the physician should select a curing agent that can
most efficiently destroy them according to the patients' condition.</P>
      <P>"These factors may not be easily predetermined in the laboratory or the
production line," Shieh noted.</P>
      <P>"What we do is to allow greater flexibility for physicians in terms of selecting
and using the drugs that can best heal their patients," Shieh said.</P>
      <P>For example, Shieh said, if there are 10 existing targeting modules and 10
available curing agents, a facility capable of combining modularly-assembled
target drugs would be able to produce 100 different combinations of drugs.</P>
      <P>And the physicians who have placed the orders can then apply the tailor-made
drugs to their patient, added Shieh.</P>
      <P>According to the hospital, the new target drugs have passed animal testing, and
it has applied for permission to test the modular approach on humans. With luck,
the therapy could be available in hospitals in five years, Shieh said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Shipping links conducive to fruit exports to China: president</HEADLINE>

10/25/08  12:55:40
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that the establishment of direct shipping
links across the Taiwan Strait would facilitate Taiwan's fruit exports to China
because it would reduce delivery times considerably.</P>
      <P>Speaking in an exclusive interview with the Central News Agency, Ma said that
forging cross-strait maritime links will be one of the topics to be addressed
during a top-level cross-strait meeting to be held in Taipei early next month.</P>
      <P>Ma was referring to a much-anticipated meeting between Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart, Chen
Yunlin, president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS).</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the opening of direct cross-strait shipping services will
shorten transportation times to less than half of the eight days it currently
takes to navigate to China via indirect routes.</P>
      <P>"Once direct shipping services are available, Taiwan-grown fruit can reach the
Chinese mainland in just four days or even in 10 hours, " Ma said, adding that
the shortened delivery time will not only help cut transportation costs but will
also be conducive to preserving fruit freshness and prolonging its shelf life.</P>
      <P>Besides fruit growers, the local aquaculture industry will also benefit from the
establishment of direct cross-strait shipping links, he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that many locally farmed fish species have enjoyed growing popularity in
China, Ma said fishery exports to China could increase further with the opening
of direct shipping services.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, China's point man on Taiwan, is expected to arrive in Taiwan Nov. 3
to meet with SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung on a broad range of topics, from
maritime links and the expansion of the existing weekend direct charter flights
and Chinese tourist arrivals, to the opening of cargo charter flights, new
flight routes, and food safety issues.</P>
      <P>Ma said that following the Taipei round of the Chiang-Chen talks, cross-strait
travel may be further eased, with Taiwan allowing the minimum number of members
of each Chinese tour group to be cut from the current 10 to five or even fewer
to attract more Chinese tourist arrivals.</P>
      <P>Many Chinese citizens have expressed interest in backpacking in Taiwan,
according to travel sources.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Bakeries in Pingtung County, southern Taiwan, urged the government Friday to
grant them business tax exemptions or reductions because many of them are on the
brink of collapse.</P>
      <P>Wang Chia-jung,  president  of the Pingtung  County Bakery Association, told
reporters that 26 of the 220 bakery shops in Pingtung County had shut down,
while many others were struggling to survive after suffering two serious blows
as a result of contaminated material and ingredients imported from China.</P>
      <P>Wang said that reports about the melamine-tainted milk power supplied by Chinese
dairy product companies in mid-September had caused the bakeries to lose 50
percent of their business.</P>
      <P>To make the situation worse, it was reported last week that a bread raising
agent, ammonium bicarbonate, imported by Taiwan from China also was also found
to contain the toxic chemical melamine, he added.</P>
      <P>As a result, many of these bakeries that used to sell at least 200 pineapple
buns -- their mainstay product -- a day now cannot sell even one bun, although
they have given the public the assurance that they used yeast, not ammonium
bicarbonate, as the raising agent in the pineapple buns, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"These shops have lost 90 percent of their business and are unable to cope with
the hardship any more. Some of them do not even have the money to pay their
membership fees to the association. They need a helping hand from the
government," he urged.</P>
      <P>Pingtung County's Deputy Magistrate Chung Chia-pin and his wife tried to support
the bakeries at a bread-making demonstration by eating some of the pineapple
buns and puff pastries to drive home the point that the products were not made
with ammonium bicarbonate.</P>

      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen was referring  to the
KMT's registration  with Taipei City police authorities for use of Ketagalan
Blvd. in the first week of November when Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-
based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), will visit
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We don't know the purpose of the KMT's registration for use of Ketagalan Blvd.,
but it seems to me that the KMT was trying to restrict freedom of speech during
Chen's visit, " Tsai told a news conference during which she also explained the
main goals of a mass rally to be staged by the party at Ketagalan Blvd.
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The DPP is collaborating with another opposition party -- the Taiwan Solidarity
Union -- and several pro-independence groups to organize mass marches through
five parts of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Participants in those parades will then gather at Ketagalan Blvd. in front of
the Presidential Office to voice their opposition to what they call the current
KMT government's China-leaning policy and China's shipments of toxic or
substandard foodstuffs to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai said it is clear that the DPP's mass rally at Ketagalan Blvd. is to express
its opinions on issues of public concern and voice its protest against the
government's pandering to China.</P>
      <P>In contrast, she said, the KMT's control of the site in early November is
apparently aimed at restricting fredom of speech and freedom of expression.</P>
      <P>With the right to use the plaza falling into the hands of the KMT, opposition
parties and supporters will be unable to stage anti-government or anti-China
activities there during Chen's visit.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said the party looks forward to atract
up to 500,000 people to join the marches whose main goals include pushing China
to apologize for shipping melamine-tainted milk products and food ingredients to
Taiwan and compensate local victims and pushing President Ma Ying-jeou's
administration to apologize for what he calls its many wrong policies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ex-president calls for cross-strait government-to-government talks</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25 (CNA)
10/25/08  14:42:54

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui proposed Saturday that Taiwan abandon the model in
which dialogue with China is conducted through a civic intermediary and seek to
enter official government-to-government talks with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lee criticized the Kuomintang (KMT)  administration led by President Ma Ying-
jeou as "losing touch with political reality" for sticking to this model,
arguing that the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , with its limited authority,
is incapable of handling the complex political, economic, social and security
issues across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Established as a civic organization  in 1991 during Lee's presidency, the SEF
was authorized by the government to handle cross-strait affairs in the absence
of official ties with China and to negotiate various technical matters with its
Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS).</P>
      <P>While the functions of the SEF and ARATS almost came to a standstill during the
eight-year leadership of former President Chen Shui-bian from the pro-
independence Democratic Progressive Party, the groups have restored their roles
in cross-strait relations since Ma's inauguration on May 20 this year.</P>
      <P>Following talks in June in Beijing -- the first encounter after a hiatus of
almost 10 years -- SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen Yunlin
are expected to meet again in early November in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lee, however, said the SEF's role in cross-strait relations "should now come to
an end."</P>
      <P>"The SEF's existence is not only redundant but also exposes the government's
ignorance of the structural change in cross-strait exchanges and fails to
highlight the state-to-state relations between Taiwan and China, " Lee said
while addressing a forum on Taiwan's sovereignty and security held by Taiwan
Advocates, a think tank that Lee established in 2001.</P>
      <P>Lee insisted that Taiwan and China should be placed on an equal footing before
entering negotiations, and that Taiwan must not downgrade its own status as a
sovereign state.</P>
      <P>Lee  accused  the  Ma administration  of adopting  various "de-sovereignization"
moves over the past five months, one of which has been reopening talks with
China based on what Lee said was the "non-existent" "1992 consensus," which Ma
claims allows the two sides to agree to disagree on the meaning of "one China."</P>
      <P>On Ma's move to define the relations between Taiwan and China as those between
"two areas, " Lee described it as a "mistaken policy" that will revert cross-
strait ties to a kind of "domestic relations," tantamount to the past "civil war
state" between the KMT and the Chinese communists.</P>
      <P>During a time when Beijing is widely recognized internationally as the rightful
government representing China, Ma's "two areas" concept will only justify
Beijing's sovereignty claim over Taiwan, and lead to the downfall of the
Republic of China, Lee said.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, after the constitutional reforms of 1991, the jurisdiction of
the ROC Constitution was restricted to the Taiwan area, and the ROC has also
recognized the legitimacy of the People's Republic of China government in China.</P>
      <P>In addition, the introduction of popular presidential elections in Taiwan
through 1992 constitutional reforms has allowed the ROC government to obtain the
mandate of Taiwan's people, meaning the government in Taiwan has nothing to do
with the people in mainland China, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He stressed cross-strait ties have been defined as a kind of "state-to-state
relations" since 1991 and that the "Republic of China on Taiwan" is an
independent sovereign state, not the "Taiwan area" as Ma has called it.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung City government will hold a news conference in Hong Kong Saturday
afternoon to promote the 2009 World Games, scheduled for next July, and a warm-
up event that will start Oct. 28, a local official said late Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Ming-chun, director-general of the city's Information Office, said Games
representatives will introduce the event to Hong Kong's people at the news
conference, which will take place at the New World Center in Hong Kong's Kowloon
area.</P>
      <P>Athletes from different sports will also display their skills in rhythmic
gymnastics, tug-of-war and dancesport, to give people in Hong Kong a taste of
what the World Games will be like, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Well-known Taiwanese pop singer Jolin Tsai will also join the promotional event,
she added.</P>
      <P>To be held in the southern port city from July 16-26 next year, the World Games
will feature 36 sports not featured in the Olympic Games, divided into six
categories: artistic and dance sports, ball sports, martial arts, precision
sports, strength sports, and trend sports.</P>
      <P>The event is expected to draw 5,200 athletes from more than 90 countries and
many additional visitors to the city to boost local tourism.</P>
      <P>A warm-up competition to be held in Kaohsiung from Oct. 28 to Nov. 8 will see
athletes compete in four sports -- boules, korfball, water skiing, and
gymnastics.</P>
      <P>The World Games gymnastics events focus on different apparatus and skills than
those featured in Olympic competition, spanning aerobic, acrobatic and rhythmic
gymnastics as well as tumbling and trampoline events.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who is also an executive of the Kaohsiung Organizing Committee (KOC) in
charge of the event, said the promotion, following Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu's
previous trip to Hong Kong Oct. 19, is part of efforts of the KOC and the
Kaohsiung City government to increase the event's international profile.</P>
      <P>Another promotional delegation will visit Japan to introduce the Games there.</P>
      <P>Toyo Ito, the Japanese architect who designed the the main stadium for the World
Games, will join next month's public relations event, Hsu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's office workers burned by global financial meltdown: survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The impact of the global financial meltdown has been increasingly visible in
Taiwan, with a recent survey suggesting that nearly two-thirds (65.7 percent) of
local office employees have sustained losses in stock market or mutual fund
investments.</P>
      <P>The online poll released Saturday by the 104 Job Bank showed that among the
money-losing workers, 12 percent sustained losses of several hundreds of
thousands of Taiwan dollars while 2.2 percent reported losses of over NT$1
million.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 24.1 percent of those who lost more than NT$100,000
(US$2,990) due to the financial storm work in the investment, financial
consulting services and insurance sectors, 18.3 percent work in the electronics
and information sectors, and 14.9 percent are in construction.</P>
      <P>Those losses may be impacting consumer spending. The survey found that
respondents budgeted an average of NT$2,112 to spend during this year's
department store anniversary sales, down from last year, although some retailers
have reported brisk sales during their sale periods.</P>
      <P>Over 46 percent of respondents said they would spend less during the anniversary
sales than last year, while 33 percent said they would spend the same amount,
while 20.6 percent said they planned to spend more this year.</P>
      <P>104 Job Bank researchers concluded that people were restraining their spending
urges because of the rising prices of commodities and a global economic
recession.</P>
      <P>As to the 20.6 percent of respondents who intended to spend more during the
department store sales this year, the researchers said they were "trying to save
money by taking advantage of preferential discounts" offered by the retailers.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between Sept. 30 and Oct. 4 among 104 Job Bank members.
A total of 3,919 valid samples were collected, and the survey's margin of error
was plus or minus 1.57 percent.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, the government released statistics showing the unemployment rate
was 4.27 percent in September, 0.13 percentage points higher than a month
earlier. Some 12,000 more people were without jobs.</P>
      <P>The average monthly unemployment rate over the first nine months of 2008 was
3.96 percent, 0.04 percentage points higher than the same period last year, the
government figures showed.</P>
      <P>Ryan Wu, chief operating officer of Internet-based 1111 Job Bank, said the
rising jobless rate reflected the spread of the global financial crisis and
credit crunch to industrial and commercial sectors around the country.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou touted the positive impact direct shipping links with
China will have on agricultural exports at an agriculture product promotion
event Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are tentatively scheduled to hold a second round of talks in
early November, with the establishment of direct shipping links one of the items
on the agenda.</P>
      <P>The president suggested that opening direct shipping links with China would
benefit agricultural exports by reducing their delivery time to well below the
current eight days.</P>
      <P>"Once direct shipping services are available, Taiwan-grown fruit can reach the
Chinese mainland in just four days or even in 10 hours," he said.</P>
      <P>The shortened delivery time will not only help cut transportation costs but will
also be conducive to preserving fruit freshness and prolonging its shelf life,
the president indicated.</P>
      <P>At Saturday's event, Ma also showed his own appreciation for local produce,
buying bananas, oranges, and flowers to show his support for local farmers. He
said he "loves Taiwan farm products, " and always eats a banana after each meal.</P>
      <P>Direct shipping links will be just one of the topics on the agenda when Chiang
Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and Chen
Yunlin, president of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) , meet in early November.</P>
      <P>Food safety issues and the creation of direct cargo charter flights will also be
discussed.</P>
      <P>The two secured agreements on direct weekend charter flights and expanding the
number of Chinese nationals allowed to visit Taiwan during their first round of

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan headed to the Songshan Tobacco Plant Culture Park in
Taipei City Saturday morning to attend an event held by the Council of
Agriculture (COA) to promote locally-grown produce.</P>
      <P>At the event, Liu spent nearly NT$80,000 (US$2,400) purchasing a variety of
Taiwan-grown agricultural products, including NT$30,000 on 50 boxes of dragon
fruit and NT$17,500 on 50 bottles of Malasun millet wine produced in Sinyi
Township in the southern county of Nantou.</P>
      <P>The premier said he bought so much to share the wonderful Taiwan- made products
with his friends.</P>
      <P>He urged citizens around Taiwan to purchase more locally-grown produce to help
the country's agricultural sector thrive.</P>
      <P>Also accompanying Liu on his visit were Government Information Office Minister
Vanessa Yea-ping Shih and COA Minister  Chen Wu-hsiung, who each also spent
thousands of New Taiwan dollars purchasing a variety of local fruits and
vegetables and other produce.</P>
      <P>Earlier the same morning, President Ma Ying-jeou also visited the COA-sponsored
activity to tout Taiwan agricultural goods and make some purchases, including
bananas, oranges and flowers, to encourage the country's citizens to purchase
Taiwan-grown produce.</P>
      <P>Ma said at the event that establishing direct cross-Taiwan Strait shipping links
-- one of the items to be discussed when Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits President Chen Yunlin visits Taiwan early next month to meet with
Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung -- will benefit Taiwan's
agricultural exports by reducing the shipping time to China to as little as ten
hours from the current eight days.</P>

      <P>The Presidential Office has rejected former President  Lee  Teng-hui's  proposal
for  Taiwan  to  start government-to-government talks with China rather than
negotiating through quasi-official bodies.</P>
      <P>Spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Saturday the office respects Lee's opinion but thinks
the existing model in which talks are conducted through Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) is "the best arrangement at the current stage."</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered to a forum held by Taiwan Advocates earlier the same day,
Lee said such a model should be scrapped because the SEF, with its limited

      <P>Instead,  Lee  said,  Taipei  should  seek  to  enter government-to-government

      <P>On Lee's denial of the existence of the "1992 consensus" between Taiwan and

Jintao during a conversation with U.S. President George W. Bush on March 26.</P>
      <P>Also, the existence of such a consensus, which allows the two sides to agree to
disagree on the definition of "one China," was what made possible a series of

Saturday.</P>
      <P>The new strategy has been developed as part of the government's push for closer

industries in which Taiwan is currently lagging and make it easier for them to
gain an international presence.</P>

year, and open cross-strait cooperation plans in the third year, Lee said in an

    <TEXT>
      <P>In sizing up Italian Corinna Dentoni a day before their semifinal match,
Taiwan's Chan Yung-jan said her opponent was unpredictable and could play at a
very high or very low level.</P>
      <P>Much to her regret, the world No. 74 faced Dentoni at her best Saturday in the
semifinal of the US$100,000 2008 OEC Taipei Ladies Open, and aside from an early
break, could never find a formula to rattle her much-lower ranked foe, falling
6-4, 6-1.</P>
      <P>"She was very consistent and she never had a letdown that allowed me to put
pressure on her," a disappointed Chan said after the match. "I also couldn't
take advantage of the break point opportunities I had."</P>
      <P>Chan jumped to a 2-0 lead in the first set, seemingly on her way to another
convincing win over a lower ranked foe, after having lost only five games in her
first three matches in the tournament.</P>
      <P>But Dentoni fought back to break Chan in the fourth game and broke her again in
the 10th game to clinch the set, helped by a bit of luck when her shot on set
point clipped the net and fell over for a winner.</P>
      <P>Chan had three break points in the opening game of the second set as she
appeared set to reverse the Italian's momentum. Dentoni ran off the next five
points to win the game, however, and the 19-year-old Taiwanese was never really
in the match after that.</P>
      <P>Winning only her second match against a top 100 opponent this year, the unseeded
Dentoni performed well above her ranking of 171 in eliminating the tournament's
top seed.</P>
      <P>Full of confidence after knocking off former world No. 4 Kimiko Date-Krumm on
Friday, even if Date was 12 years past her prime, Dentoni was consistently able
to keep the ball in play during long rallies.</P>
      <P>She varied her pace and shot selection, mixing an occasional drop shot with deep
forehands to frustate Chan, who grew impatient in the second set and made a
flurry of errors going for quick winners.</P>
      <P>"She was really hard to predict because she hit flat balls and balls with spin.
I tried to change the rhythm, but it didn't work, " Chan said.</P>
      <P>Dentoni said she was thrilled to reach the final in defeating Chan, the second
highest ranked opponent the Italian had beaten in her career.</P>
      <P>She attributed her excellent showing this week to playing outside of Europe,
where she can become easily distracted, and finally getting used to a new grip
that her coach suggested that she try about a year ago.</P>
      <P>In Sunday's final, Dentoni will face sixth-seed Jarmila Gajdosova of Slovakia,
who topped Japan's Kumiko Iijima in the day's other semifinal, 6-2, 6-2.</P>

things, the Ma administration's conciliatory policy toward China and Beijing's
shipments of toxic or substandard foodstuffs to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The weak economy was also on the minds of the protesters.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's economy is facing harsh times and the government could not do
anything, " said Liu Tse-jun, a pregnant mother, who brought her three children
with her to join the protest.</P>
      <P>"I am doing what I can for Taiwan by joining this rally. The government had done
nothing about the tainted milk from China," added Pai Fu-tang, a 40-year-old man
from southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The protest comes less than two weeks before China's top negotiator with Taiwan,
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits President Chen Yun-lin,
arrives in Taiwan for talks on food safety issues and expanded cross-strait
transportation and air cargo links.</P>
      <P>Banners reading "we are anti-communist, we object to Chen Yunlin's visit"
reflected protesters' views that the trip was not in Taiwan's interest,
especially at a time when the country is struggling with a sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>The DPP called on Ma to apologize for what it described as the president's
incorrect cross-strait policy, accusing him of leaning toward China, and also
called on Premier Liu Chao-shiuan to take responsibility for "government
incompetence" by resigning.</P>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian, who has put the DPP in an awkward position with
his outspoken counterattacks against suspicions that he and his family were
engaged in corruption and money-laundering, joined the march and was cheered on
by a crowd of protesters.</P>
      <P>Chen, however, did not make any public remarks.</P>
      <P>No immediate estimates of turnout at the rally were available, but the DPP,
opposition party the Taiwan Solidarity Union, and other pro-Taiwan independence
groups that joined together in organizing the mass rally hoped to attract
500,000 participants.</P>

      <P>Changhua County in central Taiwan opened a milk cow festival Saturday as part of
efforts to show support for the local dairy industry, an official of the
county's Department of Agriculture said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The two-day  annual  event was expected  to help increase consumption of milk
and other dairy products in the winter, which is usually the peak season for
milk production but the low season for milk consumption.</P>
      <P>The festival, held in a cereal barn in the county's Fusing township,  was
organized  by the department  and the farmers' association of the township,
where most of the county's milk cows are raised.</P>
      <P>The festival displayed photos and video clips on the milk production process and
development of the county's dairy industry to show how milk is produced and how
milk cows are raised.</P>
      <P>There was also a series of events giving children the chance to roll up milk
rice balls or paint cutouts shaped like cows.</P>
      <P>The farm also provided children with empty milk cartons to draw on and compete
to see who could come up with the most creative design.</P>
      <P>The first day's activities also included a milk drinking contest, which, instead
of asking participants to drink as much milk as they could, invited them to make
funny faces after downing the beverage, the official said.</P>
      <P>Changhua County is one of Taiwan's most important milk production centers. It
has a total of 102 milk farmers who raise 21,700 milk cows that produce about
65,000 tons of milk every year, about one-fifth of Taiwan's total production..</P>
      <P>Milk farms can be found in each of the county's 26 townships, and many of them
have existed for more than 30 years.</P>

      <P>Many foreigners joined Saturday's protest march held by the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to show support for the demonstration's
positions and experience the atmosphere of a local political rally.</P>
      <P>Maddalena, an Italian who has been in Taiwan for the last four years studying
Chinese philosophy, told the Central News Agency that demonstrations in Taiwan
are quite different from those in her native land, where protests against
educational reform took place recently.</P>
      <P>"Most of the protesters in Italy are young and intellectual, while here we can
see many middle-aged and elderly people, " she said in fluent Mandarin, noting
that the rallies generally have peaceful atmospheres.</P>
      <P>Some foreigners who participated in the protest march were sympathetic to its
positions and demands.</P>
      <P>A Japanese who works in Taiwan said he joined the rally to express opposition
against China, as Japan and Taiwan both have had to deal with unsafe food
imports from their giant neighbor and the economic threat posed by China,  which
has drawn considerable investment from Japanese enterprises.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that in Japan, protest marches are generally organized  by
nongovernmental  associations,  and people  rally spontaneously, while most
marchers in Taiwan seem to be mobilized by political parties.</P>
      <P>Kathryn, an Australian who has studied in Taipei for two months, said it would
be best for Taiwan to remain independent from China to safeguard its precious
democracy.</P>
      <P>The DPP organized the "oppose China, protect Taiwan" rally to oppose substandard
Chinese products, the one-China market, and the recognition of Chinese diplomas
and criticize what it describes as the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) government's
incompetence.</P>
      <P>The rally is the second to have been organized against the KMT administration
since it took office May 20, following an Aug. 30 march that demanded that the
government defend Taiwan's sovereignty and the people's livelihood. The Aug.30
protest was organized by several pro-independence groups.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) chairwoman said Saturday she
was willing to conduct a public debate and dialogue with President  Ma Ying-jeou
on national sovereignty issues and the country's cross-Taiwan Strait policy.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Central News Agency, Tsai Ing-wen criticized Ma for his
"opaque" handling of cross-Taiwan Strait issues in response to the president's
accusation the previous day that the DPP was deliberately manipulating the
sovereignty issue as part of the Oct. 25 protest march.</P>
      <P>"If the people did not actually feel it, it would not be possible to manipulate
the sovereignty issue, " Tsai responded.</P>
      <P>Speaking to CNA Friday, Ma questioned why the DPP was denouncing the Kuomintang
government,  which  took  power  May 20,  for "surrendering" and "selling
Taiwan" to China after it managed to achieve the long-awaited  goal of opening
the doors wider to transportation, commercial and postal cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>He noted that Tsai failed to accomplish the opening of the so-called "three-
links" across the strait during her tenure as the chairwoman of the Cabinet-
level Mainland Affairs Council from 2000 to 2004.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began exchanges with China on a small scale in 2001 when the DPP
government opened two outlying islands -- Kinmen and Matsu -- to direct
transportation links to China after the two sides had closed their doors to each
other for nearly 40 years.</P>
      <P>But it only stuck deals on nonstop flights between Taiwan proper and China on
specific holidays.</P>
      <P>Tsai rebutted Ma's criticism by saying the DPP had done nothing to harm Taiwan's
sovereignty during its rule.</P>
      <P>She said the DPP never accepted the "one-China" principle and the so-called
"1992 Consensus" -- an understanding reached in 1992 between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait that there is only one China, but with both sides free to
provide their own interpretation of what "one China" actually represents.</P>
      <P>Tsai argued that the DPP managed to stabilize cross-strait relations during its
eight-year rule based on the condition that Taiwan's sovereignty was not harmed
and that Taiwan did not give its sovereignty away.</P>
      <P>The DPP chairwoman charged that Ma's approach to the sovereignty issue was even
worse than the "one China, respective interpretations" consensus the KMT had
upheld because it was closer to Beijing's "one-China" principle.</P>
      <P>Tsai  also  suggested  that when cross-strait  policy  has implications for the
country's sovereignty, it should be approved by a national referendum before it
can take effect.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gov't urged to help with orphan drugs research</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government and local charities should help with research and development of
orphan drugs that are needed to treat rare diseases, also known as orphan
diseases, an Academia Sinica academinician urged Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, an epidemiologist who served as Department of Health minister
from 2003-2005, made the pitch in a speech delivered at a ceremony marking the
80th founding anniversary of Academia Sinica, the country's top academic
institution.</P>
      <P>Noting  that the development  of orphan  drugs is usually prohibitively
expensive and unprofitable, Chen said only a few pharmaceutical companies are
willing to develop them.</P>
      <P>To encourage private sector investment, Chen said, relevant government agencies
and local charitable organizations should play active supporting roles in
promoting research and development in the field.</P>
      <P>In his speech titled "environment, gene and human diseases," Chen said that
genes are decisive factors in human diseases. But good health habits and
avoidance of exposure to harmful substances in the environment can help reduce
the incidence of disease.</P>
      <P>Equally important in disease prevention and control is to step up scientific
research on the causes of diseases, diagnostic methods and treatments, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's medical research, Chen said that as modern medical research
emphasizes  human rights and research ethics, researchers need to spend more
energy on communicating with patients involved in experiments and protecting
their privacy as well as the health and safety of those who are assigned to the
control team in the new drug or treatment research project.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the competence of local research teams and active participation by
patients and ordinary citizens, Chen said many of Taiwan's medical or
epidemiological research projects have proceeded smoothly.</P>
      <P>As to the recent controversy  over melamine  contamination standards, Chen said
Taiwan should set its own test standards rather than following those adopted by
the World Health Organization or the European Union because major Western
countries, such as the United States and EU countries, are unlikely to import
milk or milk products from China.</P>
      <P>Since the amounts of Chinese-made dairy products consumed by local people are
different from those by Americans or Europeans, Chen said Taiwan should craft
its own melamine contamination standards.</P>
      <P>"The government is obligated to protect public health and impose strict food
safety monitoring and control regulations," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Presidential Office promises reforms in response to DPP protest</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will review its operations and make necessary reform to resolve
public grievances, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks after tens of thousands of opposition supporters marched
through downtown Taipei earlier that day to protest the Kuomintang
administration's growing ties with China, where a tainted milk powder scandal
has fueled fresh distrust toward Beijing among local citizens.</P>
      <P>In the strongest display of opposition to President Ma Ying-jeou since his
inauguration May 20, demonstrators also demanded that Ma reshuffle the Cabinet
immediately and apologize for his failure to deliver on his campaign promise to
improve the economy.</P>
      <P>The street protest  was organized  by the main opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and its ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity Union -- and major pro-
independence groups.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging  that  the  demonstrators'  appeals  are  the government's policy
goals, Wang said that probably, insufficient government efforts,  coupled with
the ongoing global financial turmoil, have added to people's hardships and thus
fueled public discontent.</P>
      <P>"The government will make a thorough review and do whatever it can to meet the
public's demand and expectations," Wang said, adding that the administration is
more than willing to make all necessary reforms.</P>
      <P>Responding to DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen's call for a debate with Ma on
sovereignty issue, Wang said Ma hopes to meet Tsai to discuss issues regarding
prevention of violence and corruption and major economic topics.</P>
      <P>Despite its previous  failed attempts  to invite Tsai for face-to-face talks
with Ma, Wang said the Presidential Office will continue its efforts to arrange
for a Ma-Tsai meeting.</P>
      <P>As protesting China's shipments of melamine-tainted milk products and other food
ingredients was also a major appeal of the protest march, Wang said food safety
is a priority item on the agenda for an upcoming meeting between the top leaders
of the quasi-official intermediary bodies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wang was referring to a meeting in Taipei early next month between Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart,
Chen Yunlin,  president  of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Wang said the SEF and ARATS have forged a direct communication mechanism for
food safety concerns.</P>

      <P>Since the amounts of Chinese-made dairy products consumed by local people are
different from those by Americans or Europeans, Chen said Taiwan should craft
its own melamine contamination standards.</P>
      <P>"The government is obligated to protect public health and impose strict food
safety monitoring and control regulations," he added.</P>

      <P>The government will review its operations and make necessary reform to resolve
public grievances, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks after tens of thousands of opposition supporters marched
through downtown Taipei earlier that day to protest the Kuomintang
administration's growing ties with China, where a tainted milk powder scandal
has fueled fresh distrust toward Beijing among local citizens.</P>
      <P>In the strongest display of opposition to President Ma Ying-jeou since his
inauguration May 20, demonstrators also demanded that Ma reshuffle the Cabinet
immediately and apologize for his failure to deliver on his campaign promise to
improve the economy.</P>
      <P>The street protest  was organized  by the main opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and its ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity Union -- and major pro-
independence groups.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging  that  the  demonstrators'  appeals  are  the government's policy
goals, Wang said that probably, insufficient government efforts,  coupled with
the ongoing global financial turmoil, have added to people's hardships and thus
fueled public discontent.</P>
      <P>"The government will make a thorough review and do whatever it can to meet the
public's demand and expectations," Wang said, adding that the administration is
more than willing to make all necessary reforms.</P>
      <P>Responding to DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen's call for a debate with Ma on
sovereignty issue, Wang said Ma hopes to meet Tsai to discuss issues regarding
prevention of violence and corruption and major economic topics.</P>
      <P>Despite its previous  failed attempts  to invite Tsai for face-to-face talks
with Ma, Wang said the Presidential Office will continue its efforts to arrange
for a Ma-Tsai meeting.</P>
      <P>As protesting China's shipments of melamine-tainted milk products and other food
ingredients was also a major appeal of the protest march, Wang said food safety
is a priority item on the agenda for an upcoming meeting between the top leaders
of the quasi-official intermediary bodies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wang was referring to a meeting in Taipei early next month between Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart,
Chen Yunlin,  president  of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Wang said the SEF and ARATS have forged a direct communication mechanism for
food safety concerns.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Local airline to fly Kaohsiung-Seoul route</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Mandarin Airlines is expected to launch its first Kaohsiung-Seoul
direct charter flight at the end of October and begin regularly scheduled
service on the route starting in December.</P>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines, which will become the only airline currently flying the
route,  said its new flight service  will provide convenience and save time for
passengers traveling between the southern city and the Korean capital.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Uni Air had offered regularly scheduled service between the two
destinations, but canceled the route Aug. 15.</P>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines' first charter flight is scheduled to depart from Kaohsiung
International Airport Oct. 29, while the returning flight will take off from
Seoul's Incheon International Airport the next day.</P>
      <P>The company said that it will fly two charters a week serving only tour groups
between Oct. 29 and Nov. 30, but will expand that to four regularly scheduled
flights a week, beginning Dec. 1, that will be open to all travelers.</P>
      <P>Several domestic travel agencies will collaborate with the airline in organizing
group tours to Seoul during the charter period, the carrier said.</P>
      <P>China Airlines, Mandarin Airlines' parent company, also noted that it will craft
short-term theme tours in Korea to coincide with the new link.</P>
      <P>China Airlines said the new route reflects its emphasis on the southern Taiwan
market, following an increase in flights between Kaohsiung and Manila Oct. 1.</P>

    <HEADLINE>To many, Taiwan's 'King Midas' more than just a business tycoon</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/26/08  17:40:49</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>The captains of local industry all lined up to pay their respects to late
Formosa Plastics Group founder Wang Yung-ching last week as the country mourned
the passing Oct. 15 of its second wealthiest citizen and leading industrialist.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Gou, Evergreen Group Chairman Chang Yung-fa, Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Chairman Morris Chang and others paid tribute to
Wang for his pioneering role in Taiwan's industrial development.</P>
      <P>But to many other faceless individuals who lined up to bid farewell to Wang,
including an Indigenous nurse, students and teachers from a Yunlin County school
and a hearing-impaired girl, the Formosa  Plastics  tycoon  was remembered  much
more  for his philanthropic activities than his business exploits.</P>
      <P>In fact, while they were not widely reported, Wang's charitable enterprises had
a considerable impact on Taiwan, especially among generally less wealthy
Indigenous groups, who called Wang their "vuvu," meaning "grandpa."</P>
      <P>Former Chang Gung University President Chang Chao-hsiung recalled that Wang once
summoned him to his office in the early 1990s to tell him that the government's
social welfare campaigns to heighten awareness against teenage prostitution were
"useless" in addressing the problem that was plaguing Taiwan's Aboriginal
communities.</P>
      <P>"We should give the Indigenous People fishing poles, " Wang suggested, leading
to the birth of the "fishing pole project," one of the tycoon's lasting
achievements.</P>
      <P>The project was aimed at helping  Aboriginal  youths gain vocational skills to
be able to pull their own weight after reaching adulthood.</P>
      <P>Wang first instructed Chang to allow indigenous girls -- many of whom had fallen
into socially disreputable professions because of poverty -- to be admitted into
Wang's Chang Gung Nursing School free of charge.</P>
      <P>The nursing school, established by Wang in 1988 in Taoyuan County, is now known
as Chang Gung University.</P>
      <P>After operating the "fishing pole project" for several years, Wang paid a visit
to the nursing school, where he saw many female Indigenous students not only
showing confidence and self-esteem, but also natural beauty.</P>
      <P>A concerned Wang summoned Chang again, saying, "I am worried that young
Indigenous men will end up wifeless with the Indigenous young women receiving
good educations and growing more beautiful. We have to do something for the
boys."</P>
      <P>And with that, Ming Chi College of Technology, now a university, began to accept
aboriginal young men and provide them with free vocational education.</P>
      <P>Ming Chi,  established  in 1963 and the first educational institution founded by
Wang, aimed at nurturing technicians for his plastics and petrochemical empire.</P>
      <P>Today, nearly 5,000 Indigenous young men and women have graduated from Chang
Gung Nursing School or Chang Gung University's Nursing Department and Ming Chi
College or University.</P>
      <P>Some of the women have become head nurses at one of the many branches of Chang
Gung Memorial Hospital -- the largest hospital chain in Taiwan, which treats an
average of 30,000 people a day.</P>
      <P>Most of the men became engineers working in the Formosa Plastics Group, which
Wang started in 1954 and which now has interests ranging from plastics and
petrochemicals to electronics, thermal power stations, and biotechnology.</P>
      <P>After the 91-year-old Wang died in his sleep Oct. 15 in New Jersey during a
business trip, many of those who benefited from the program appeared at a
mourning hall set up for the tycoon at Chang Gung University in Taoyuan County's
Gueishan township to offer a word of thanks.</P>
      <P>One of them, Liu Yi-ching, an orthopedic surgery nurse at Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital's Linkou branch, said the tiring and stressful nature of her job had
not prevented her from working at the hospital, "because I wanted to return the
benevolence of founder Wang, who changed my life and the welfare of my maternal
family."</P>
      <P>Perhaps Wang's empathy for society's underdogs grew from his own rags-to-riches
story, that saw him parlay an NT$200 loan to an estimated net worth of US$5.5
billion, according to a 2008 Forbes survey that ranked him as the 178th richest
person in the world.</P>
      <P>Wang came to represent core Taiwanese values as someone who was hardworking,
persevering, flexible, skilled at negotiating, and willing to take risks.</P>
      <P>Born as the oldest boy to a poor family when Taiwan was under Japanese rule,
Wang began to work at the age of 5, picking bits of coal and tea leaves in the
hilly areas of his hometown, Sindian, in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Never receiving any formal schooling beyond elementary school, he began
apprenticing in a rice shop at 12, where he learned his trade. At 16, Wang
opened his own rice shop in Chiayi City, southern Taiwan, with NT$200 his father
had managed to borrow from several friends.</P>
      <P>His father's death when he was a teenager planted the seed that compelled Wang
to build hospitals, particularly hospitals for the middle class and
underprivileged who did not have access to good, affordable medical attention in
Taiwan prior to the 1970s.</P>
      <P>The Chang Gung hospital franchise, now has seven branches around Taiwan and one
in China's Xiamen, have continued to provide free diagnoses and treatment for
patients from low-income families.</P>
      <P>Firmly believing in the Chinese proverb that says, "It takes 10 years to grow
trees, but a hundred to rear and educate people," Wang also began to establish
schools 45 years ago -- a practice that would continue over four decades.</P>
      <P>Wang's concern for education was especially apparent after a deadly earthquake
struck central Taiwan on Sept. 21, 1999, a natural disaster that flattened many
elementary schools in the stricken area.</P>
      <P>One of the schools he helped was Chiu Chiung Elementary School in the south-
central county of Yunlin, which received NT$38 million from Wang to rebuild its
campus, and school principal Cheng Mei-nu led 50 teachers and students to
Taoyuan to pay their last respects to the man who gave their school new life.</P>
      <P>Cheng also brought with her hundreds of cards drawn and written by students,
wishing "Grandpa Wang" a happy landing in his next world.</P>
      <P>Hsing Hua Elementary School in Mailiao, Yunlin, another school that was rebuilt
with Wang's donations, observed a one-minute moment of silence Oct. 26 to
commemorate the man who was a household name in the country and who personified
its economic development history.</P>
      <P>The mother of a child who was hearing-impaired from birth, also brought her
daughter, Huang Chia-yu, to pay tribute to Wang at the mourning hall.</P>
      <P>"Grandpa Wang was a living Buddha for us, " the mother said. "We could not
afford the cost of implanting electronic ears for Chia-yu as our family was
never economically prepared," Huang's mother said.</P>
      <P>"Because of Wang's philanthrophy, Chia-yu has been able to attend school as a
normal child since the age of 6, " the grateful parent said.</P>
      <P>Acting at Wang's will, Formosa Plastics' management will donate all the assets
held under his name, estimated to be worth roughly NT$46 billion,  to the Wang
Chang-gung Foundation,  a charity foundation named after his father dedicated to
medical care and education.</P>
      <P>While many of Taiwan's underprivileged paid emotional farewells to their
benefactor, even the rich and powerful were moved by the tycoon's passing.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai's Gou was on his hands and knees to pay tribute to Wang.</P>
      <P>"I respect him as my own father and Taiwan's father of industrial development as
well," a teary Gou said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Australia lauds President Ma's end to "checkbook diplomacy"</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/26/08  18:01:56</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia has welcomed President Ma Ying-jeou's new diplomatic initiative to
avoid competing with China for allies, openly lauding for the first time Ma's
attempts  to end so-calledcheckbook diplomacyin the South Pacific.</P>
      <P>We are very encouraged by statements by Taiwan officials, including the
president, that Taiwan intends to provide aid that is transparent and
accountable and has humanitarian and practical focus, " Alice Cawte,
representative of the Australian Commerce and Industry Office (ACIO) in Taiwan,
said in an interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>A senior career officer with Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
(DFAT) , Cawte is familiar with China-Taiwan relations as she was the assistant
secretary of DFAT's East Asia branch from 2005 to 2008 and has served overseas
in Beijing and studied Chinese in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It will benefit the region as a whole because without the previous tug-of-war
for recognition in the Pacific ... (Taiwan) will be able to focus more on
government systems that support good governance in the region and are
transparent and accountable, Cawte added.</P>
      <P>Since assuming the presidency on May 20, President Ma has followed a "modus
vivendi, " or flexible, diplomatic strategy, which attempts to set aside
Taipei's differences with Beijing to find a mutually beneficial equilibrium.</P>
      <P>He is also seeking a "diplomatic truce" to end a longstanding tug-of-war with
China in which both countries try to lure each other's allies to switch
diplomatic allegiance by offering large sums of foreign aid.</P>
      <P>Such attempts by Taiwan were aimed at carving out a greater international
presence for the island,  which due to China's opposition, is not recognized by
the U.N. or other international groups whose members are countries.</P>
      <P>China considers Taiwan one of its provinces, even though the island has been
self-ruled since 1949.</P>
      <P>In a visit to Taiwan's International Cooperation and Development Fund on Sept.
18, Ma affirmed that the government's approach to foreign aid is strictly based
on three key principles: the purpose must be legitimate, the process must be
legal, and the assistance must be effective and efficient.</P>
      <P>Being the biggest benefactor of countries in the South Pacific, Australia has
significant influence in the area.</P>
      <P>It has long criticized Taiwan and China for conducting "checkbook diplomacy" in
the South Pacific region, saying that such a hostile competition for influence
fuels corruption and political divisions.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 25 in a report to the Legislative Yuan, Foreign Minister Francisco H.L.
Ou said that under themodus vivendidiplomatic strategy, both Australia and New
Zealand expressed their intention to work with Taiwan on foreign aid programs in
the South Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Cawte said, however, that there are no specific projects on which the two
countries are working together, but noted Australia is committed to consulting
with Taiwan and sharing its experiences.</P>
      <P>"We are very happy to share these experiences with donors who share our values
of providing dual assistance that leads to good governance and long-term
sustainable development, " the senior diplomat said.</P>
      <P>"We certainly can consult with Taiwan to ensure that we both understand what we
are intended to achieve and through consultation to ensure that we are both
doing the best we can for the foreign assistance in the region," she added.</P>
      <P>Cawte said the signs are encouraging regarding relations between Canberra and
Taipei, as they welcomed new leaders in Dec. 2007 and May 2008, respectively.
She agreed that bilateral ties seem to have entered a new stage as the battle
between Taiwan and China for diplomatic recognition seems to be abating.</P>
      <P>I think relations are very good and they are evolving, Cawte said.We are
tracking well and we are very optimistic and positive about the future.</P>
      <P>She added that Australia was alsoencouragedby efforts by President Ma's
administration to improve Taiwan-China relations.</P>
      <P>"We believe this will improve regional security and regional stability," she
said.</P>
      <P>Speaking about Taiwan's international space, Cawte said that Australia's
position is very clear and that is to support Taiwan's participation in regional
and international organizations where that participation and consensus is
possible.</P>
      <P>"We certainly understand Taiwan's desire to participate in international
organizations  and believe  Taiwan  has much to contribute," Cawte said.</P>
      <P>She added that while the precise formulation for Taiwan's participation in the
World Health Organization is yet to be worked out, "Taiwan should play the key
role in determining the consensus."</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP should oppose corruption, violence too: KMT lawmakers</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA)
10/26/08  18:31:25
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which staged a mass rally
Saturday to protest the government's policy of peace with China among other
issues, should also pay attention to opposing corruption and violence,
legislators of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lo Shu-lei, a deputy whip of the KMT legislative caucus, said at a press
conference that some of the appeals made by the DPP protesters had already been
carried out by the government of President Ma Ying-jeou, such as safeguarding
Taiwan -- an issue she described as "something that the government has never
hesitated to do."</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP protesters also opposed the import of toxic and substandard
food products into Taiwan from China, Lo said the government had already taken a
series of measures to prevent such products from entering the country.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chu Fong-chi added that many of the substandard products allowed
into Taiwan were granted import permits while the DPP was in power.</P>
      <P>Lo also noted that former President Chen Shui-bian, who also took part in the
protest rally, was cheered by DPP supporters, even though he and his family are
under investigation on charges of embezzlement, corruption and money laundering.</P>
      <P>"While the DPP protestors shout 'oppose toxic products, safeguard Taiwan,'
shouldn't they also talk about opposing corruption and violence?" she asked.</P>
      <P>Lo raised the issue of violence in an apparent allusion to the Oct. 21 incident
in which Zhang Mingqing, vice president of China's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), was besieged and jostled to the ground by
pro-independence protesters while visiting the Confucian Temple in Tainan,
southern Taiwan,</P>
      <P>As to DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen's call for a debate with Ma on national
sovereignty issues and the country's China policy before Beijing's chief
negotiator with Taiwan, Chen Yunlin, arrives here Nov. 3, Lo said such a debate
was unnecessary since it was not a presidential election year.</P>
      <P>The two KMT legislators said Chen was invited by his Taiwanese counterpart
Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation, for
talks on economic issues, and that the majority of the people in Taiwan support
Chen's forthcoming visit.</P>
      <P>"If Tsai wants to debate the sovereignty issue, she should begin by accepting
the president's invitation for a dialogue between the ruling and the opposition
parties," Chu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan can use Australia as ASEAN participation model: diplomat</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/26/08  19:02:55</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As a long-termdialogue partnerwith member countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) , Australia can serve as a model for Taiwan in
participating in the regional group, a senior Australian official said.</P>
      <P>Alice Cawte, representative of the Australian Commerce and Industry Office
(ACIO) in Taiwan, said in a recent interview with the Central News Agency that
Australia has been a dialogue partner with ASEAN for a long time and concluded
free trade agreement negotiations with ASEAN on Aug. 28.</P>
      <P>In that sense, we might serve as a model for others, but not so much as a
platform, because it's really a matter for the members of the ASEAN to
determine,Cawte said.</P>
      <P>Certainly the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is a good platform, where
we are both members, to work together on economic issues, as we do in the World
Trade Organization, more so than ASEAN,she added.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's administration, which took office on May 20, has been
stepping up efforts for Taiwan to actively participate in the integration of the
Asia Pacific region and ASEAN.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Foreign Ministry decided on Oct. 17 to establish a think tank to
provide strategies to promote relations with ASEAN countries, a decision made
after a two-day coordination  meeting of the ministry's newly formed task force
on relations with ASEAN.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fears its trade-dependent economy could be marginalized if it is not
included in a regional free trade zone under negotiation that would include the
ASEAN countries and China, South Korea and Japan.</P>
      <P>Speaking about bilateral relations between Taiwan and Australia, Cawte said the
relations arevery goodand that there exist long-standing people-to-people links.</P>
      <P>Noting that mutual trade last year amounted to 10.6 billion Australian dollars
and describing the relations ascomplementary, Cawte said exchanges are also
expanding in tourism and education.</P>
      <P>This is a very robust and healthy trade not just economically, but for improving
our understanding, the understanding between Australia and Taiwan,she added.</P>
      <P>The highest ranking Australian diplomat in Taiwan, who assumed her post two
months ago, said that although the Australia-Taiwan trade and investment
relations are generally mature and operate very well, there are specific
differences that crop up occasionally being addressed by the two sides.</P>
      <P>She said differences over quarantine regulations is an issue requiring progress
to achieve amutual understanding.</P>
      <P>According  to Taiwan's quarantine  regulations  on imports, Australia is
classified as an area infected by the Queensland fruit fly and as a result, many
fruit items are strictly restricted from being imported to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response to a question on whether the recent melamine-tainted milk products
from China will provide an opportunity for Australian dairy products to gain a
bigger share of Taiwan's market, Cawte said that while many Australian dairy
products are already available in Taiwan, the country wants to export more.</P>
      <P>Australia is Taiwan's second largest source of dairy products, behind to New
Zealand and followed by China.</P>
      <P>In other areas of bilateral exchanges, Cawte said the working holiday visa
program launched in 2004 has been a very successful program in increasing
people-to-people contacts.</P>
      <P>It's a fantastic  program  for young people to gain an understanding, not just
getting an understanding for each other's countries, but to build foundations
for better links in the long term,she said.</P>
      <P>According to Cawte, the program has been growing in popularity in Taiwan, given
that last year alone there were 6,000 people who participated in the program
while the total number of working holiday program participants since 2004
reached 8,000.</P>
      <P>Australia's Working Holiday Program provides opportunities for people aged
between 18 and 30 to holiday in Australia and to supplement their travel through
incidental employment.</P>
      <P>The working holiday visa, available to eligible candidates once in a lifetime,
allows a stay of up to 12 months from the date of first entry to Australia,
regardless of whether the holder spends the entire time there.</P>
      <P>Working holiday visa holders are permitted to do temporary jobs for up to six
months with any one employer and are entitled to study or take a training course
for a maximum of four months.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Next Chiang-Chen meeting crucial moment for Taiwan: SEF head</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should try to achieve the normalization of bilateral economic and trade
links in upcoming talks with China so that it can benefit from China's rise and
see its economy continue to develop, the head of the quasi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The continuing development of Taiwan's economy will require a stable framework
between Taiwan and China. Bilateral economic and trade systems have to be
normalized through negotiations, SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at a forum held by Tamkang University's Graduate Institute
of China Studies on the challenges Taiwan faces in its relations with China
ahead of the meeting between Chiang and Chen Yunlin, president of China's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), slated for early
November.</P>
      <P>Arguing that the past eight years of confrontation between China and the
previous Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government harmed Taiwan's economy,
Chiang said that only by strengthening relations with China could Taiwan avoid
being marginalized as the rest of the region integrates and benefit from China's
rise as an economic power.</P>
      <P>The most important goal of cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations is to fight for
Taiwan's interests, Chiang said, adding that doing so not only creates a win-win
situation for Taiwan and China, but also allows Taiwan to "still take its place
in the region."</P>
      <P>Echoing Chiang, other participants at the forum agreed that the Chiang-Chen
meeting came at a crucial moment for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>SEF adviser Pang Chien-kuo argued that the upcoming talks will herald the
arrival of the systematic negotiations between Taiwan and China that were
outlined theAgreement on the Establishment of Systematic Liaison and
Communication Channels Between the SEF and the ARATS,signed in 1993.</P>
      <P>Only through a systematic framework can we have credible and reliablerules of
the game, and through the compliance of which we can guarantee the sovereignty
of Taiwan,Pang said.</P>
      <P>Such stable and sound rules of the game will also benefit Asia Pacific regional
security and even international security, he added.</P>
      <P>Answering questions at the seminar, Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Liu
Teh-hsun said politics will be off the agenda of Chiang's meeting with Chen.</P>
      <P>Some participants in the seminar expressed concern that the second Chiang-Chen
meeting might undermine Taiwan's sovereignty and hurt the interests of the
people on the island.</P>
      <P>In reply, Liu assured them that the forthcoming talks will only deal with
economic issues and matters related to the livelihood of the people on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait and will not touch on the sovereignty issue.</P>
      <P>Liu said the government's position is that economic issues should be dealt with
first, because only after both sides have established a good foundation for
economic cooperation, will there be mutual trust for them to move on to the next
phase to discuss political issues.</P>
      <P>Issues to be discussed at the Chiang-Chen meeting include establishing direct
shipping links and increasing the number of weekend direct charter flights, as
well as promoting food safety following China's melamine-tainted milk powder
scandal.</P>
      <P>The two first met in Beijing in June and reached landmark agreements on
launching regular weekend flights and on allowing more Chinese tourists to visit
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen will be the highest ranking official from the People's Republic of China to
visit Taiwan since it was established in 1949.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), Taiwan's main liaison
body with China, said Sunday that its function as an intermediary is essential
and irreplaceable in facilitating the development of Taiwan-China relations.</P>
      <P>Disagreeing with former President Lee Teng-hui's contention Saturday that the
SEF had outlived its usefullness, SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said that with
exchanges between Taiwan and China steadily increasing over the past decade,
issues requiring the government's attention had grown increasingly diverse.</P>
      <P>"The SEF has been serving as a bridge across the Taiwan Strait to allow
officials from the two sides to meet face-to-face to deal with many issues and
problems," Chiang said. "It must continue to exist."</P>
      <P>Lee said Saturday that the SEF should now be ushered into history since its
mission as an intermediary has ended.</P>
      <P>"Government-to-government dialogues should be in place now to replace the old
formula of negotiations between Taiwan and China via private, intermediary
bodies," Lee suggested.</P>
      <P>In response to Lee's remarks, Chiang said a quasi-official organization has not
only been used in dealing with China, but has also been applied to talks with
Japan and the United States.</P>
      <P>"These organizations have actually served as quasi-official bodies to help get
Taiwan's opinions across," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Taking the high-level talks between Taiwan and China to be held in Taipei in
early November as an example, Chiang said his meeting with his Chinese
counterpart,  Chen Yunlin,  president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), would tackle a wide range of
issues, including food safety problems and the opening of direct shipping links,
direct cargo charter flights, and direct postal exchanges.</P>
      <P>"Officials from the two sides are expected to be among the negotiators," Chiang
said.</P>

      <P>The maximum allowed fall in share prices on Taiwan's stock exchange will be
restored to the standard 7 percent limit Monday after being halved to 3.5
percent since Oct. 13, the Financial Supervisory Commission said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The commission said it felt the revised cap on the lower limit was no longer
needed because downward spirals in international markets have eased.</P>
      <P>The commission also noted that its ban on short selling of stocks will remain in
place until the end of this year to prevent speculative sales of stocks from
leading to further plunges in share prices.</P>
      <P>Restrictions on loans on securities will be eased, however, to give investors
who need to sell their stocks to raise cash easier access to credit, the
commission said.</P>
      <P>The announcement came amid reports that the 3.5 percent cap had seriously curbed
stock market liquidity as investors were reluctant to buy shares before they had
fallen to what were considered attractive prices.</P>
      <P>Turnover averaged a drop of nearly 20 percent during the past two weeks while
the measure was in place.</P>
      <P>The commission said the local bourse declined by 7.68 percent last week, lower
than the more than 10 percent losses suffered in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong
and Singapore, but will still larger than the 3 percent to 5 percent declines
seen in markets in the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and China.</P>
      <P>Contending that the measure had achieved its goal of mitigating the impact of
the financial meltdown that began with the subprime mortgage crisis in the
United States, the commission said it had decided to do away with it given that
the financial situation has turned the corner.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>One child died an unnatural death every two days in Taiwan in 2007, and the
numbers of children abused or killed when their parents committed suicide
increased at an alarming rate, a child welfare group reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Child Welfare League Foundation said in a study of abused children in Taiwan
that 24 children died from abuse, 19 were killed as part of their parents'
suicides, and 205 died in accidents in 2007.</P>
      <P>The total of 248 children dying from unnatural causes represented more than one
every two days, and the situation is worsening, the foundation warned.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics released by the Ministry of the Interior, the report said
there were 31 cases in the first 10 months of the year in which a parent or both
parents committed suicide along with their children, a four-year high.</P>
      <P>About 90 percent of the 45 children involved in those cases were sacrificed by
their biological parents who "murdered" their children under the pretext of
"sparing them the misery of living, " the foundation said.</P>
      <P>Some 8,200 children were abused in the first half of this year, an average of 45
children per day, or twice as many as the 21 children per day averaged in 2004.</P>
      <P>The report attributed a lack of knowledge on how to act as a parent as the main
cause of the abuse and said the increasing number of abused children highlights
the fact that more and more people are raising children before they understand
their responsibilities as parents.</P>
      <P>Death by accident has always been the top cause of death among children, and the
foundation said that 12 children have fallen from high-rise buildings and five
others were involved in domestic accidents triggered by negligence so far this
year.</P>
      <P>Noting that these accidents have killed 11 children and seriously injured six,
the foundation said that the parents' recklessness or leaving their young
children unattended might put their children in extreme danger and saddle them
with irreversible injuries.</P>
      <P>The foundation released the report to highlight the launch of its campaign to
seek 100 proposals from the public on ways to love children. People interested
in the campaign are invited to visit Web site http://blog.yam.com/lovekids2008

    <HEADLINE>Regulations on insider trading criticized as 'unclear'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA)
10/26/08  20:21:51

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's regulations on insider trading are "unclear" and the Cabinet-level
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC)  should  be held responsible  for
neglecting  its duty, participants in a forum in Taipei Sunday complained.</P>
      <P>At the forum on how to revitalize the financial market and uphold social
justice, Robert Tsao, honorary chairman of Taiwan's chipmaker giant United
Microelectronics Corp., said many of Taiwan's businesses are apt to become
insider trading offenders because of the unclear nature of the regulations.</P>
      <P>Tsao said the regulations have not defined insider trading clearly, nor is it
clear what constitutes a violation that should be referred to public
prosecutors.</P>
      <P>"The Financial Supervisory Commission has seriously neglected its duty and
should be impeached," he said.</P>
      <P>Former Minister of Finance Yen Ching-chang said the insider trading regulations,
in their present form, should not be enforced rigorously because doing so would
hurt the interests of many enterprises and their shareholders.</P>
      <P>Yen added that before referring an insider trading case to public prosecutors
for investigation, the Ministry of Finance should allow a business operator to
defend himself by giving him the opportunity to explain the process of the
transaction.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao agreed that the regulations governing the nature and
scope of "material, non-public information" for insider trading  and the
definition  of the moment when that information becomes material are not clear.
He suggested that a review is needed to examine how to revise the regulations.</P>
      <P>The current regulations rely on the point at which information becomes material
to determine whether an accused party is guilty of insider trading.</P>
      <P>The regulations stipulate that insiders -- including company directors, managers
and their close relatives -- are not allowed to buy or sell stocks of their
company within 12 hours of the release of important information.</P>
      <P>The controversy  is over how to determine  at what point information should be
judged as being in the public domain.</P>
      <P>Officials at the FSC declined to comment on the criticism leveled against the
independent financial governing body.</P>

      <P>Thirty-five passengers returning to Kaohsiung County from the "oppose toxic
products, protect Taiwan" protest rally were injured when four southbound
coaches carrying them collided late Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the Kaohsiung County headquarters of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) which co-organized the rally, most people were asleep
when the crash took place and suffered minor abrasions and contusions.</P>
      <P>They returned home after receiving treatment.</P>
      <P>Two people remain hospitalized and were visited Sunday by the party's
chairwoman, Tsai Ing-wen.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung County headquarters quoted witnesses and coach drivers as saying
that the accident was caused by a lack of clear signs warning that the No. 1 Sun
Yat-Sen Freeway would narrow from three lanes to one due to ongoing construction
in the roadway's Sinying section, leaving drivers without enough time to react.</P>
      <P>The police said, however, that the drivers were partially to blame for the crash
for not keeping an appropriate distance between the vehicles.</P>
      <P>Party headquarters chief Chen Chi-yu, who is also a DPP lawmaker, said he would
inquire into the negligence of the National Freeway Bureau on behalf of the
injured passengers and assist them with follow-up procedures such as gaining
insurance compensation.</P>
      <P>During her visit with the patients, Tsai expressed her sadness over the incident
but also noted that she was glad the injured supporters received prompt medical
attention.</P>
      <P>She said that accidents are sometimes unavoidable in large-scale social
movements, but that the crisis management of local party offices was efficient.</P>

      <P>Five months after taking office, President Ma Ying-jeou and his wife Chow Mei-

Sunday.</P>
      <P>The move began early Sunday and it took one big lorry and two medium vans to

to his new residence in ZhongZheng District, both in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>A crew member of the moving company told a local TV station that he was really

opened the door and handed him a carton full of the first family's belongings.</P>
      <P>The first lady who packed all the cartons was waiting at the new residence which
has been given a new code-name of ZhongXing Apartment deriving from the name of
the ZhongZheng District where the residence located and the name of the XingLong
Road on which the president's private house is located.</P>
      <P>Ma who resumed his post as head of state on May 20 had to wait for five months

residence's sewage system, an aide to the president said.</P>
      <P>Unlike its predecessors in the residence, the first family which consists of the
president, his wife and a dog would not hire any cook. The aide explained that

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will review its operations and make necessary reform to resolve
public grievances, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks after tens of thousands of opposition supporters marched
through downtown Taipei earlier that day to protest the Kuomintang
administration's growing ties with China, where a tainted milk powder scandal
has fueled fresh distrust toward Beijing among local citizens.</P>
      <P>In the strongest display of opposition to President Ma Ying-jeou since his
inauguration May 20, demonstrators also demanded that Ma reshuffle the Cabinet
immediately and apologize for his failure to deliver on his campaign promise to
improve the economy.</P>
      <P>The street protest  was organized  by the main opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and its ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity Union -- and major pro-
independence groups.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging  that  the  demonstrators'  appeals  are  the government's policy
goals, Wang said that probably, insufficient government efforts,  coupled with
the ongoing global financial turmoil, have added to people's hardships and thus
fueled public discontent.</P>
      <P>"The government will make a thorough review and do whatever it can to meet the
public's demand and expectations," Wang said, adding that the administration is
more than willing to make all necessary reforms.</P>
      <P>Responding to DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen's call for a debate with Ma on
sovereignty issue, Wang said Ma hopes to meet Tsai to discuss issues regarding
prevention of violence and corruption and major economic topics.</P>
      <P>Despite its previous  failed attempts  to invite Tsai for face-to-face talks
with Ma, Wang said the Presidential Office will continue its efforts to arrange
for a Ma-Tsai meeting.</P>
      <P>As protesting China's shipments of melamine-tainted milk products and other food
ingredients was also a major appeal of the protest march, Wang said food safety
is a priority item on the agenda for an upcoming meeting between the top leaders
of the quasi-official intermediary bodies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wang was referring to a meeting in Taipei early next month between Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart,
Chen Yunlin,  president  of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Wang said the SEF and ARATS have forged a direct communication mechanism for
food safety concerns.</P>

passengers traveling between the southern city and the Korean capital.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Uni Air had offered regularly scheduled service between the two
destinations, but canceled the route Aug. 15.</P>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines' first charter flight is scheduled to depart from Kaohsiung
International Airport Oct. 29, while the returning flight will take off from
Seoul's Incheon International Airport the next day.</P>
      <P>The company said that it will fly two charters a week serving only tour groups
between Oct. 29 and Nov. 30, but will expand that to four regularly scheduled
flights a week, beginning Dec. 1, that will be open to all travelers.</P>
      <P>Several domestic travel agencies will collaborate with the airline in organizing
group tours to Seoul during the charter period, the carrier said.</P>
      <P>China Airlines, Mandarin Airlines' parent company, also noted that it will craft
short-term theme tours in Korea to coincide with the new link.</P>
      <P>China Airlines said the new route reflects its emphasis on the southern Taiwan
market, following an increase in flights between Kaohsiung and Manila Oct. 1.</P>

    <HEADLINE>To many, Taiwan's 'King Midas' more than just a business tycoon</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/26/08  17:40:49</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>The captains of local industry all lined up to pay their respects to late
Formosa Plastics Group founder Wang Yung-ching last week as the country mourned
the passing Oct. 15 of its second wealthiest citizen and leading industrialist.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Gou, Evergreen Group Chairman Chang Yung-fa, Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Chairman Morris Chang and others paid tribute to
Wang for his pioneering role in Taiwan's industrial development.</P>
      <P>But to many other faceless individuals who lined up to bid farewell to Wang,
including an Indigenous nurse, students and teachers from a Yunlin County school
and a hearing-impaired girl, the Formosa  Plastics  tycoon  was remembered  much
more  for his philanthropic activities than his business exploits.</P>
      <P>In fact, while they were not widely reported, Wang's charitable enterprises had
a considerable impact on Taiwan, especially among generally less wealthy
Indigenous groups, who called Wang their "vuvu," meaning "grandpa."</P>
      <P>Former Chang Gung University President Chang Chao-hsiung recalled that Wang once
summoned him to his office in the early 1990s to tell him that the government's
social welfare campaigns to heighten awareness against teenage prostitution were
"useless" in addressing the problem that was plaguing Taiwan's Aboriginal
communities.</P>
      <P>"We should give the Indigenous People fishing poles, " Wang suggested, leading
to the birth of the "fishing pole project," one of the tycoon's lasting
achievements.</P>
      <P>The project was aimed at helping  Aboriginal  youths gain vocational skills to
be able to pull their own weight after reaching adulthood.</P>
      <P>Wang first instructed Chang to allow indigenous girls -- many of whom had fallen
into socially disreputable professions because of poverty -- to be admitted into
Wang's Chang Gung Nursing School free of charge.</P>
      <P>The nursing school, established by Wang in 1988 in Taoyuan County, is now known
as Chang Gung University.</P>
      <P>After operating the "fishing pole project" for several years, Wang paid a visit
to the nursing school, where he saw many female Indigenous students not only
showing confidence and self-esteem, but also natural beauty.</P>
      <P>A concerned Wang summoned Chang again, saying, "I am worried that young
Indigenous men will end up wifeless with the Indigenous young women receiving
good educations and growing more beautiful. We have to do something for the
boys."</P>
      <P>And with that, Ming Chi College of Technology, now a university, began to accept
aboriginal young men and provide them with free vocational education.</P>
      <P>Ming Chi,  established  in 1963 and the first educational institution founded by
Wang, aimed at nurturing technicians for his plastics and petrochemical empire.</P>
      <P>Today, nearly 5,000 Indigenous young men and women have graduated from Chang
Gung Nursing School or Chang Gung University's Nursing Department and Ming Chi
College or University.</P>
      <P>Some of the women have become head nurses at one of the many branches of Chang
Gung Memorial Hospital -- the largest hospital chain in Taiwan, which treats an
average of 30,000 people a day.</P>
      <P>Most of the men became engineers working in the Formosa Plastics Group, which
Wang started in 1954 and which now has interests ranging from plastics and
petrochemicals to electronics, thermal power stations, and biotechnology.</P>
      <P>After the 91-year-old Wang died in his sleep Oct. 15 in New Jersey during a
business trip, many of those who benefited from the program appeared at a
mourning hall set up for the tycoon at Chang Gung University in Taoyuan County's
Gueishan township to offer a word of thanks.</P>
      <P>One of them, Liu Yi-ching, an orthopedic surgery nurse at Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital's Linkou branch, said the tiring and stressful nature of her job had
not prevented her from working at the hospital, "because I wanted to return the
benevolence of founder Wang, who changed my life and the welfare of my maternal
family."</P>
      <P>Perhaps Wang's empathy for society's underdogs grew from his own rags-to-riches
story, that saw him parlay an NT$200 loan to an estimated net worth of US$5.5
billion, according to a 2008 Forbes survey that ranked him as the 178th richest
person in the world.</P>
      <P>Wang came to represent core Taiwanese values as someone who was hardworking,
persevering, flexible, skilled at negotiating, and willing to take risks.</P>
      <P>Born as the oldest boy to a poor family when Taiwan was under Japanese rule,
Wang began to work at the age of 5, picking bits of coal and tea leaves in the
hilly areas of his hometown, Sindian, in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Never receiving any formal schooling beyond elementary school, he began
apprenticing in a rice shop at 12, where he learned his trade. At 16, Wang
opened his own rice shop in Chiayi City, southern Taiwan, with NT$200 his father
had managed to borrow from several friends.</P>
      <P>His father's death when he was a teenager planted the seed that compelled Wang
to build hospitals, particularly hospitals for the middle class and
underprivileged who did not have access to good, affordable medical attention in
Taiwan prior to the 1970s.</P>
      <P>The Chang Gung hospital franchise, now has seven branches around Taiwan and one
in China's Xiamen, have continued to provide free diagnoses and treatment for
patients from low-income families.</P>
      <P>Firmly believing in the Chinese proverb that says, "It takes 10 years to grow
trees, but a hundred to rear and educate people," Wang also began to establish
schools 45 years ago -- a practice that would continue over four decades.</P>
      <P>Wang's concern for education was especially apparent after a deadly earthquake
struck central Taiwan on Sept. 21, 1999, a natural disaster that flattened many
elementary schools in the stricken area.</P>
      <P>One of the schools he helped was Chiu Chiung Elementary School in the south-
central county of Yunlin, which received NT$38 million from Wang to rebuild its
campus, and school principal Cheng Mei-nu led 50 teachers and students to
Taoyuan to pay their last respects to the man who gave their school new life.</P>
      <P>Cheng also brought with her hundreds of cards drawn and written by students,
wishing "Grandpa Wang" a happy landing in his next world.</P>
      <P>Hsing Hua Elementary School in Mailiao, Yunlin, another school that was rebuilt
with Wang's donations, observed a one-minute moment of silence Oct. 26 to
commemorate the man who was a household name in the country and who personified
its economic development history.</P>
      <P>The mother of a child who was hearing-impaired from birth, also brought her
daughter, Huang Chia-yu, to pay tribute to Wang at the mourning hall.</P>
      <P>"Grandpa Wang was a living Buddha for us, " the mother said. "We could not
afford the cost of implanting electronic ears for Chia-yu as our family was
never economically prepared," Huang's mother said.</P>
      <P>"Because of Wang's philanthrophy, Chia-yu has been able to attend school as a
normal child since the age of 6, " the grateful parent said.</P>
      <P>Acting at Wang's will, Formosa Plastics' management will donate all the assets
held under his name, estimated to be worth roughly NT$46 billion,  to the Wang
Chang-gung Foundation,  a charity foundation named after his father dedicated to
medical care and education.</P>
      <P>While many of Taiwan's underprivileged paid emotional farewells to their
benefactor, even the rich and powerful were moved by the tycoon's passing.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai's Gou was on his hands and knees to pay tribute to Wang.</P>
      <P>"I respect him as my own father and Taiwan's father of industrial development as
well," a teary Gou said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Australia lauds President Ma's end to "checkbook diplomacy"</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/26/08  18:01:56</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia has welcomed President Ma Ying-jeou's new diplomatic initiative to
avoid competing with China for allies, openly lauding for the first time Ma's
attempts  to end so-calledcheckbook diplomacyin the South Pacific.</P>
      <P>We are very encouraged by statements by Taiwan officials, including the
president, that Taiwan intends to provide aid that is transparent and
accountable and has humanitarian and practical focus, " Alice Cawte,
representative of the Australian Commerce and Industry Office (ACIO) in Taiwan,
said in an interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>A senior career officer with Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
(DFAT) , Cawte is familiar with China-Taiwan relations as she was the assistant
secretary of DFAT's East Asia branch from 2005 to 2008 and has served overseas
in Beijing and studied Chinese in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It will benefit the region as a whole because without the previous tug-of-war
for recognition in the Pacific ... (Taiwan) will be able to focus more on
government systems that support good governance in the region and are
transparent and accountable, Cawte added.</P>
      <P>Since assuming the presidency on May 20, President Ma has followed a "modus
vivendi, " or flexible, diplomatic strategy, which attempts to set aside
Taipei's differences with Beijing to find a mutually beneficial equilibrium.</P>
      <P>He is also seeking a "diplomatic truce" to end a longstanding tug-of-war with
China in which both countries try to lure each other's allies to switch
diplomatic allegiance by offering large sums of foreign aid.</P>
      <P>Such attempts by Taiwan were aimed at carving out a greater international
presence for the island,  which due to China's opposition, is not recognized by
the U.N. or other international groups whose members are countries.</P>
      <P>China considers Taiwan one of its provinces, even though the island has been
self-ruled since 1949.</P>
      <P>In a visit to Taiwan's International Cooperation and Development Fund on Sept.
18, Ma affirmed that the government's approach to foreign aid is strictly based
on three key principles: the purpose must be legitimate, the process must be
legal, and the assistance must be effective and efficient.</P>
      <P>Being the biggest benefactor of countries in the South Pacific, Australia has
significant influence in the area.</P>
      <P>It has long criticized Taiwan and China for conducting "checkbook diplomacy" in
the South Pacific region, saying that such a hostile competition for influence
fuels corruption and political divisions.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 25 in a report to the Legislative Yuan, Foreign Minister Francisco H.L.
Ou said that under themodus vivendidiplomatic strategy, both Australia and New
Zealand expressed their intention to work with Taiwan on foreign aid programs in
the South Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Cawte said, however, that there are no specific projects on which the two
countries are working together, but noted Australia is committed to consulting
with Taiwan and sharing its experiences.</P>
      <P>"We are very happy to share these experiences with donors who share our values
of providing dual assistance that leads to good governance and long-term
sustainable development, " the senior diplomat said.</P>
      <P>"We certainly can consult with Taiwan to ensure that we both understand what we
are intended to achieve and through consultation to ensure that we are both
doing the best we can for the foreign assistance in the region," she added.</P>
      <P>Cawte said the signs are encouraging regarding relations between Canberra and
Taipei, as they welcomed new leaders in Dec. 2007 and May 2008, respectively.
She agreed that bilateral ties seem to have entered a new stage as the battle
between Taiwan and China for diplomatic recognition seems to be abating.</P>
      <P>I think relations are very good and they are evolving, Cawte said.We are
tracking well and we are very optimistic and positive about the future.</P>
      <P>She added that Australia was alsoencouragedby efforts by President Ma's
administration to improve Taiwan-China relations.</P>
      <P>"We believe this will improve regional security and regional stability," she
said.</P>
      <P>Speaking about Taiwan's international space, Cawte said that Australia's
position is very clear and that is to support Taiwan's participation in regional
and international organizations where that participation and consensus is
possible.</P>
      <P>"We certainly understand Taiwan's desire to participate in international
organizations  and believe  Taiwan  has much to contribute," Cawte said.</P>
      <P>She added that while the precise formulation for Taiwan's participation in the
World Health Organization is yet to be worked out, "Taiwan should play the key
role in determining the consensus."</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP should oppose corruption, violence too: KMT lawmakers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which staged a mass rally
Saturday to protest the government's policy of peace with China among other
issues, should also pay attention to opposing corruption and violence,
legislators of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lo Shu-lei, a deputy whip of the KMT legislative caucus, said at a press
conference that some of the appeals made by the DPP protesters had already been
carried out by the government of President Ma Ying-jeou, such as safeguarding
Taiwan -- an issue she described as "something that the government has never
hesitated to do."</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP protesters also opposed the import of toxic and substandard
food products into Taiwan from China, Lo said the government had already taken a
series of measures to prevent such products from entering the country.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chu Fong-chi added that many of the substandard products allowed
into Taiwan were granted import permits while the DPP was in power.</P>
      <P>Lo also noted that former President Chen Shui-bian, who also took part in the
protest rally, was cheered by DPP supporters, even though he and his family are
under investigation on charges of embezzlement, corruption and money laundering.</P>
      <P>"While the DPP protestors shout 'oppose toxic products, safeguard Taiwan,'
shouldn't they also talk about opposing corruption and violence?" she asked.</P>
      <P>Lo raised the issue of violence in an apparent allusion to the Oct. 21 incident
in which Zhang Mingqing, vice president of China's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), was besieged and jostled to the ground by
pro-independence protesters while visiting the Confucian Temple in Tainan,
southern Taiwan,</P>
      <P>As to DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen's call for a debate with Ma on national
sovereignty issues and the country's China policy before Beijing's chief
negotiator with Taiwan, Chen Yunlin, arrives here Nov. 3, Lo said such a debate
was unnecessary since it was not a presidential election year.</P>
      <P>The two KMT legislators said Chen was invited by his Taiwanese counterpart
Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation, for
talks on economic issues, and that the majority of the people in Taiwan support
Chen's forthcoming visit.</P>
      <P>"If Tsai wants to debate the sovereignty issue, she should begin by accepting
the president's invitation for a dialogue between the ruling and the opposition
parties," Chu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan can use Australia as ASEAN participation model: diplomat</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/26/08  19:02:55</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As a long-termdialogue partnerwith member countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) , Australia can serve as a model for Taiwan in
participating in the regional group, a senior Australian official said.</P>
      <P>Alice Cawte, representative of the Australian Commerce and Industry Office
(ACIO) in Taiwan, said in a recent interview with the Central News Agency that
Australia has been a dialogue partner with ASEAN for a long time and concluded
free trade agreement negotiations with ASEAN on Aug. 28.</P>
      <P>In that sense, we might serve as a model for others, but not so much as a
platform, because it's really a matter for the members of the ASEAN to
determine,Cawte said.</P>
      <P>Certainly the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is a good platform, where
we are both members, to work together on economic issues, as we do in the World
Trade Organization, more so than ASEAN,she added.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's administration, which took office on May 20, has been
stepping up efforts for Taiwan to actively participate in the integration of the
Asia Pacific region and ASEAN.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Foreign Ministry decided on Oct. 17 to establish a think tank to
provide strategies to promote relations with ASEAN countries, a decision made
after a two-day coordination  meeting of the ministry's newly formed task force
on relations with ASEAN.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fears its trade-dependent economy could be marginalized if it is not
included in a regional free trade zone under negotiation that would include the
ASEAN countries and China, South Korea and Japan.</P>
      <P>Speaking about bilateral relations between Taiwan and Australia, Cawte said the
relations arevery goodand that there exist long-standing people-to-people links.</P>
      <P>Noting that mutual trade last year amounted to 10.6 billion Australian dollars
and describing the relations ascomplementary, Cawte said exchanges are also
expanding in tourism and education.</P>
      <P>This is a very robust and healthy trade not just economically, but for improving
our understanding, the understanding between Australia and Taiwan,she added.</P>
      <P>The highest ranking Australian diplomat in Taiwan, who assumed her post two
months ago, said that although the Australia-Taiwan trade and investment
relations are generally mature and operate very well, there are specific
differences that crop up occasionally being addressed by the two sides.</P>
      <P>She said differences over quarantine regulations is an issue requiring progress
to achieve amutual understanding.</P>
      <P>According  to Taiwan's quarantine  regulations  on imports, Australia is
classified as an area infected by the Queensland fruit fly and as a result, many
fruit items are strictly restricted from being imported to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response to a question on whether the recent melamine-tainted milk products
from China will provide an opportunity for Australian dairy products to gain a
bigger share of Taiwan's market, Cawte said that while many Australian dairy
products are already available in Taiwan, the country wants to export more.</P>
      <P>Australia is Taiwan's second largest source of dairy products, behind to New
Zealand and followed by China.</P>
      <P>In other areas of bilateral exchanges, Cawte said the working holiday visa
program launched in 2004 has been a very successful program in increasing
people-to-people contacts.</P>
      <P>It's a fantastic  program  for young people to gain an understanding, not just
getting an understanding for each other's countries, but to build foundations
for better links in the long term,she said.</P>
      <P>According to Cawte, the program has been growing in popularity in Taiwan, given
that last year alone there were 6,000 people who participated in the program
while the total number of working holiday program participants since 2004
reached 8,000.</P>
      <P>Australia's Working Holiday Program provides opportunities for people aged
between 18 and 30 to holiday in Australia and to supplement their travel through
incidental employment.</P>
      <P>The working holiday visa, available to eligible candidates once in a lifetime,
allows a stay of up to 12 months from the date of first entry to Australia,
regardless of whether the holder spends the entire time there.</P>
      <P>Working holiday visa holders are permitted to do temporary jobs for up to six
months with any one employer and are entitled to study or take a training course
for a maximum of four months.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Next Chiang-Chen meeting crucial moment for Taiwan: SEF head</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan should try to achieve the normalization of bilateral economic and trade
links in upcoming talks with China so that it can benefit from China's rise and
see its economy continue to develop, the head of the quasi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The continuing development of Taiwan's economy will require a stable framework
between Taiwan and China. Bilateral economic and trade systems have to be
normalized through negotiations, SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at a forum held by Tamkang University's Graduate Institute
of China Studies on the challenges Taiwan faces in its relations with China
ahead of the meeting between Chiang and Chen Yunlin, president of China's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), slated for early
November.</P>
      <P>Arguing that the past eight years of confrontation between China and the
previous Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government harmed Taiwan's economy,
Chiang said that only by strengthening relations with China could Taiwan avoid
being marginalized as the rest of the region integrates and benefit from China's
rise as an economic power.</P>
      <P>The most important goal of cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations is to fight for
Taiwan's interests, Chiang said, adding that doing so not only creates a win-win
situation for Taiwan and China, but also allows Taiwan to "still take its place
in the region."</P>
      <P>Echoing Chiang, other participants at the forum agreed that the Chiang-Chen
meeting came at a crucial moment for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>SEF adviser Pang Chien-kuo argued that the upcoming talks will herald the
arrival of the systematic negotiations between Taiwan and China that were
outlined theAgreement on the Establishment of Systematic Liaison and
Communication Channels Between the SEF and the ARATS,signed in 1993.</P>
      <P>Only through a systematic framework can we have credible and reliablerules of
the game, and through the compliance of which we can guarantee the sovereignty
of Taiwan,Pang said.</P>
      <P>Such stable and sound rules of the game will also benefit Asia Pacific regional
security and even international security, he added.</P>
      <P>Answering questions at the seminar, Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Liu
Teh-hsun said politics will be off the agenda of Chiang's meeting with Chen.</P>
      <P>Some participants in the seminar expressed concern that the second Chiang-Chen
meeting might undermine Taiwan's sovereignty and hurt the interests of the
people on the island.</P>
      <P>In reply, Liu assured them that the forthcoming talks will only deal with
economic issues and matters related to the livelihood of the people on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait and will not touch on the sovereignty issue.</P>
      <P>Liu said the government's position is that economic issues should be dealt with
first, because only after both sides have established a good foundation for
economic cooperation, will there be mutual trust for them to move on to the next
phase to discuss political issues.</P>
      <P>Issues to be discussed at the Chiang-Chen meeting include establishing direct
shipping links and increasing the number of weekend direct charter flights, as
well as promoting food safety following China's melamine-tainted milk powder
scandal.</P>
      <P>The two first met in Beijing in June and reached landmark agreements on
launching regular weekend flights and on allowing more Chinese tourists to visit
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen will be the highest ranking official from the People's Republic of China to
visit Taiwan since it was established in 1949.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF's intermediary function essential: foundation chair</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), Taiwan's main liaison
body with China, said Sunday that its function as an intermediary is essential
and irreplaceable in facilitating the development of Taiwan-China relations.</P>
      <P>Disagreeing with former President Lee Teng-hui's contention Saturday that the
SEF had outlived its usefullness, SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said that with
exchanges between Taiwan and China steadily increasing over the past decade,
issues requiring the government's attention had grown increasingly diverse.</P>
      <P>"The SEF has been serving as a bridge across the Taiwan Strait to allow
officials from the two sides to meet face-to-face to deal with many issues and
problems," Chiang said. "It must continue to exist."</P>
      <P>Lee said Saturday that the SEF should now be ushered into history since its
mission as an intermediary has ended.</P>
      <P>"Government-to-government dialogues should be in place now to replace the old
formula of negotiations between Taiwan and China via private, intermediary
bodies," Lee suggested.</P>
      <P>In response to Lee's remarks, Chiang said a quasi-official organization has not
only been used in dealing with China, but has also been applied to talks with
Japan and the United States.</P>
      <P>"These organizations have actually served as quasi-official bodies to help get
Taiwan's opinions across," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Taking the high-level talks between Taiwan and China to be held in Taipei in
early November as an example, Chiang said his meeting with his Chinese
counterpart,  Chen Yunlin,  president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), would tackle a wide range of
issues, including food safety problems and the opening of direct shipping links,
direct cargo charter flights, and direct postal exchanges.</P>
      <P>"Officials from the two sides are expected to be among the negotiators," Chiang
said.</P>

      <P>The maximum allowed fall in share prices on Taiwan's stock exchange will be
restored to the standard 7 percent limit Monday after being halved to 3.5
percent since Oct. 13, the Financial Supervisory Commission said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The commission said it felt the revised cap on the lower limit was no longer
needed because downward spirals in international markets have eased.</P>
      <P>The commission also noted that its ban on short selling of stocks will remain in
place until the end of this year to prevent speculative sales of stocks from
leading to further plunges in share prices.</P>
      <P>Restrictions on loans on securities will be eased, however, to give investors
who need to sell their stocks to raise cash easier access to credit, the
commission said.</P>
      <P>The announcement came amid reports that the 3.5 percent cap had seriously curbed

    <HEADLINE>One child dies unnaturally every two days in 2007: rights groups</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>One child died an unnatural death every two days in Taiwan in 2007, and the
numbers of children abused or killed when their parents committed suicide
increased at an alarming rate, a child welfare group reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Child Welfare League Foundation said in a study of abused children in Taiwan
that 24 children died from abuse, 19 were killed as part of their parents'
suicides, and 205 died in accidents in 2007.</P>
      <P>The total of 248 children dying from unnatural causes represented more than one
every two days, and the situation is worsening, the foundation warned.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics released by the Ministry of the Interior, the report said
there were 31 cases in the first 10 months of the year in which a parent or both
parents committed suicide along with their children, a four-year high.</P>
      <P>About 90 percent of the 45 children involved in those cases were sacrificed by
their biological parents who "murdered" their children under the pretext of
"sparing them the misery of living, " the foundation said.</P>
      <P>Some 8,200 children were abused in the first half of this year, an average of 45
children per day, or twice as many as the 21 children per day averaged in 2004.</P>
      <P>The report attributed a lack of knowledge on how to act as a parent as the main
cause of the abuse and said the increasing number of abused children highlights
the fact that more and more people are raising children before they understand
their responsibilities as parents.</P>
      <P>Death by accident has always been the top cause of death among children, and the
foundation said that 12 children have fallen from high-rise buildings and five
others were involved in domestic accidents triggered by negligence so far this
year.</P>
      <P>Noting that these accidents have killed 11 children and seriously injured six,
the foundation said that the parents' recklessness or leaving their young
children unattended might put their children in extreme danger and saddle them
with irreversible injuries.</P>
      <P>The foundation released the report to highlight the launch of its campaign to
seek 100 proposals from the public on ways to love children. People interested
in the campaign are invited to visit Web site http://blog.yam.com/lovekids2008

    <HEADLINE>Regulations on insider trading criticized as 'unclear'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA)
10/26/08  20:21:51

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's regulations on insider trading are "unclear" and the Cabinet-level
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC)  should  be held responsible  for
neglecting  its duty, participants in a forum in Taipei Sunday complained.</P>
      <P>At the forum on how to revitalize the financial market and uphold social
justice, Robert Tsao, honorary chairman of Taiwan's chipmaker giant United
Microelectronics Corp., said many of Taiwan's businesses are apt to become
insider trading offenders because of the unclear nature of the regulations.</P>
      <P>Tsao said the regulations have not defined insider trading clearly, nor is it
clear what constitutes a violation that should be referred to public
prosecutors.</P>
      <P>"The Financial Supervisory Commission has seriously neglected its duty and
should be impeached," he said.</P>
      <P>Former Minister of Finance Yen Ching-chang said the insider trading regulations,
in their present form, should not be enforced rigorously because doing so would
hurt the interests of many enterprises and their shareholders.</P>
      <P>Yen added that before referring an insider trading case to public prosecutors
for investigation, the Ministry of Finance should allow a business operator to
defend himself by giving him the opportunity to explain the process of the
transaction.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao agreed that the regulations governing the nature and
scope of "material, non-public information" for insider trading  and the
definition  of the moment when that information becomes material are not clear.
He suggested that a review is needed to examine how to revise the regulations.</P>
      <P>The current regulations rely on the point at which information becomes material
to determine whether an accused party is guilty of insider trading.</P>
      <P>The regulations stipulate that insiders -- including company directors, managers
and their close relatives -- are not allowed to buy or sell stocks of their
company within 12 hours of the release of important information.</P>
      <P>The controversy  is over how to determine  at what point information should be
judged as being in the public domain.</P>
      <P>Officials at the FSC declined to comment on the criticism leveled against the
independent financial governing body.</P>

    <HEADLINE>35 injured in coach crash during return from Taipei protest march</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Thirty-five passengers returning to Kaohsiung County from the "oppose toxic
products, protect Taiwan" protest rally were injured when four southbound
coaches carrying them collided late Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the Kaohsiung County headquarters of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) which co-organized the rally, most people were asleep
when the crash took place and suffered minor abrasions and contusions.</P>
      <P>They returned home after receiving treatment.</P>
      <P>Two people remain hospitalized and were visited Sunday by the party's
chairwoman, Tsai Ing-wen.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung County headquarters quoted witnesses and coach drivers as saying
that the accident was caused by a lack of clear signs warning that the No. 1 Sun
Yat-Sen Freeway would narrow from three lanes to one due to ongoing construction
in the roadway's Sinying section, leaving drivers without enough time to react.</P>
      <P>The police said, however, that the drivers were partially to blame for the crash
for not keeping an appropriate distance between the vehicles.</P>
      <P>Party headquarters chief Chen Chi-yu, who is also a DPP lawmaker, said he would
inquire into the negligence of the National Freeway Bureau on behalf of the
injured passengers and assist them with follow-up procedures such as gaining
insurance compensation.</P>
      <P>During her visit with the patients, Tsai expressed her sadness over the incident
but also noted that she was glad the injured supporters received prompt medical
attention.</P>
      <P>She said that accidents are sometimes unavoidable in large-scale social
movements, but that the crisis management of local party offices was efficient.</P>
      <P>She added that the incident should not affect the holding of future events.</P>

      <P>Five months after taking office, President Ma Ying-jeou and his wife Chow Mei-
ching finally moved into the president's official residence in downtown Taipei
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The move began early Sunday and it took one big lorry and two medium vans to
carry the first family's belongings from Ma's private home in JingMei District
to his new residence in ZhongZheng District, both in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>A crew member of the moving company told a local TV station that he was really
surprised when he knocked on the door of the customer and found the president
opened the door and handed him a carton full of the first family's belongings.</P>
      <P>The first lady who packed all the cartons was waiting at the new residence which
has been given a new code-name of ZhongXing Apartment deriving from the name of
the ZhongZheng District where the residence located and the name of the XingLong
Road on which the president's private house is located.</P>
      <P>Ma who resumed his post as head of state on May 20 had to wait for five months
before moving into the official residence because of the construction of the
residence's sewage system, an aide to the president said.</P>
      <P>Unlike its predecessors in the residence, the first family which consists of the
president, his wife and a dog would not hire any cook. The aide explained that
Ma rarely eats at home because of his busy schedule and the first lady prefers
to cook by herself unless there are guests at home when she would order foods
from caterers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Designation issue to be discussed in cross-strait preparatory meet</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The issue of how President Ma Ying-jeou should be addressed by China's top
negotiator with Taiwan during an upcoming meeting will be discussed by cross-
strait negotiators in Shenzhen in southern China Monday,  a senior Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) official said.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman and secretary-general of Taiwan's main liaison
body with Taiwan, the SEF, said at the airport prior to his departure for
Shenzhen that SEF officials will talk again with their Chinese counterparts from
the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) on
the issue of how Ma should be addressed.</P>
      <P>Kao and several SEF officials headed to Shenzhen Monday morning for a one-day
meeting with their ARATS counterparts for a second preparatory meeting on the
agenda and accords to be signed during the second top-level cross-strait meeting
to be held in Taipei early next month.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has proposed that Chen Yunlin, China's top negotiator with Taiwan and
ARATS president, and his delegation travel to Taiwan Nov. 3 for a five-day
visit. Chen is expected to meet with SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung for a second
round of negotiations on cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>Chen would be the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit Taiwan since the two
sides separated after a civil war more than five decades ago.</P>
      <P>However, the question of how Chen will address President Ma when they meet in
Taipei is an sensitive issue, especially as China still considers Taiwan as its
province.</P>
      <P>Kao said that although the SEF and ARATS negotiators have exchanged views
concerning the agenda and accords expected to be signed, there are still
differences between the two sides on some matters.</P>
      <P>In addition to the expected agreements on cargo charter flights, direct shipping
and postal links, Kao said, the SEF will also propose Monday that cross-strait
financial and monetary cooperation in the face of the global economic storm
should be on the agenda.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kao said, the SEF will also suggest Monday that China render
assistance to Taiwan in the island's bid to reposition itself as a new business
operation center in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>"The food safety issue will also be brought up Monday with the ARATS officials,
as the recent discovery of melamine-tainted dairy products and food ingredients
from China has given rise to problems in Taiwan's food industry and caused a
scare among consumers, " Kao said.</P>
      <P>The Chiang-Chen meeting in Taipei will be a follow-up to a landmark meeting in
Beijing between the two in mid-June during which both sides reached an agreement
on weekend cross-strait charter flights and the expansion of the number of
Chinese tourists allowed to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Regular weekend flights were launched July 4, but some believe the flights are
not frequent enough and are inconvenient because they must still pass through
Hong Kong airspace, due to security concerns, before heading to their final
destinations.</P>
      <P>Direct shipping links still do not exist.</P>
      <P>Fu Don-cheng, a vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, was
also on the flight to Hong Kong with other Taiwanese officials who will transit
to Shenzen for the meeting. Fu did not make any public statements at the airport
prior to his departure.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's consumer confidence index for October dropped 2.1 points to stand at
52.22 -- the lowest level since the National Central University's Research
Center for Taiwan Economic Development (RCTED) began the monthly surveys at the
start of 2001.</P>
      <P>The October index, released by the center on Monday, declined slightly over the
previous month's level.</P>
      <P>All of the survey's six sub-indices, which reflect consumers' expectations of
economic conditions over the next half year, dropped from the previous month's
levels.</P>
      <P>The steepest decline was in the category of "whether the next six months would
be a good time to buy stocks," which slid 4.7 points to stand at 48.7, according
to the center.</P>
      <P>In the survey, a score of between 0-100 for a sub-index is classified as
"pessimistic", while a score of 100-200 is considered "optimistic," the center
said.</P>
      <P>Each of the sub-indices for October stood at below 100, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The second steepest drop was in the category of "whether the next six months
would be a good time to buy durable goods," dropping 3.5 points to stand at
93.15, followed by "job opportunities," down 2.7 points to 64.9.</P>
      <P>Rounding out the list were "domestic economic conditions in the next six months,
" down 0.65 points to stand at 43.6, "family economic conditions in the next six
months, " sliding 0.55 points to 44.1, and "price levels in the next six months,
" down 0.5 points to 18.85, according to the center.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by telephone on randomly selected adults over the age
of 20 between Oct. 19-22, with a total of 2,456 valid samples being collected.</P>
      <P>It had a 95-percent confidence level and a margin of error of plus or minus 2
percentage points, according to the authors.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that the government is "working hard" to send
a higher level official to the upcoming annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum slated to open in Lima, Peru on Nov. 22.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA on Friday, Ma said that the annual APEC informal
leadership meeting is attended by the heads of government of all the member
economies except for Taiwan, which faces restrictions due to various factors.</P>
      <P>Noting that all out efforts are being made to address this issue, Ma said that
the government will soon announce to the public its plans regarding Taiwan's
envoy to the APEC meeting.</P>
      <P>Due to pressure from China, Taiwan has had to send a special envoy to represent
the president at the annual APEC gathering in past years.</P>
      <P>Stan Shih, founder of the leading computer manufacturer Acer, attended last
year's gathering in Sydney, Australia on behalf of President Chen Shui-bian,
while Morris Chang, chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., took
part in the 2006 meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam.</P>
      <P>On  Taiwan's  efforts  to  participate  in  international organizations,
President Ma said that a "practical" and "flexible" approach must be employed,
noting that the previous administration's stance of insisting on the use of the
name Taiwan to join the World Health Organization, for example,  proved
ineffective and even counter-productive.</P>

      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) has continued to improve its earthquake
monitoring  technology and expertise with the aim of being able to detect and
report on earthquakes within 30 seconds after they strike, a senior CWB official
in charge seismology said Monday.</P>
      <P>The CWB Seismology Center plans by the end of 2009 to be able to detect the
epicenter and intensity of a quake in the Taiwan area within 30 seconds of it
striking, according to a proposal submitted by the CWB to the Legislative Yuan
for budget screening.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau also aims to disseminate disaster information within seconds
to the public via cell phone text messaging, fax, email and other global-based
Internet systems, according to the CWB budget proposal.</P>
      <P>According to Seismology Center Director Kuo Kai-wen, the center currently
maintains 109 earthquake monitoring stations nationwide, and can detect the
intensity and epicenter of a quake within 35 seconds -- a world leading
performance.</P>
      <P>In comparison, Kuo said, Japan can detect an earthquake and report on it in one
minute, while the United States can do it in 40-50 minutes because of its vast
territory.</P>
      <P>"Twenty years ago when the center had only 22 monitoring stations, Taiwan needed
40-50 minutes to detect and report on an earthquake," Kuo recalled.</P>
      <P>According to the 2009 CWB budget proposal, it would require roughly NT$364
million to increase the number of underground seismic observation stations and
to implement an undersea marine seismic observation system off Taiwan's eastern
coast.</P>
      <P>According to the Seismology Center, 70 percent of the earthquakes around Taiwan
originate off the northeast coast, which tends to affect the greater Taipei
area. However, all of Taiwan's existing earthquake monitoring systems are
located on land.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's rising unemployment rate cannot be reversed without comprehensive
economic development and growth, Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Minister Wang
Ju-hsuan said Monday.</P>
      <P>The council launched a NT$3.7 billion package of new measures last week to boost
the employment rate, but legislators suggested it would only have a short-term
effect on the high unemployment rate, and Wang did not disagree.</P>
      <P>"To solve the long-term unemployment problem in Taiwan, it is still necessary
to expand domestic demand, Wang said at a Legislative Yuan committee hearing,
stressing that the country's economic development needed to be strengthened to
reverse existing trends.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's administration launched an NT$58.3 billion program
early this year to expand domestic demand that hopes to increase economic growth
by 0.25 percent and create 56,000 jobs, but it is unclear if the plan has shown
any tangible results amid an economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>Wang said that even if the unemployment rate climbs from September's 4.27
percent to the historical high of 5.17 percent set in 2003, the Employment
Insurance Fund's NT$102 billion is sufficient to protect workers' rights.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) also recently presented a plan to boost
local employment, but as it was considered similar to the CLA's package of
measures, Minister without Portfolio Tsai Hsun-hsiung suggested over the weekend
that the MOEA encourage enterprises to replace foreign laborers with local
workers.</P>
      <P>About 35,000 foreign workers could be laid off if the plan is approved by the
Executive Yuan, but Chen I-min, director-general of the Bureau of Employment and
Vocational Training under the CLA, said the plan was still under discussion.</P>
      <P>Among the NT$3.7  billion  in employment-boosting  measures announced by the CLA
Friday, enterprises that hire a worker who has been unemployed for the previous
three months can receive a monthly NT$10,000 subsidy per worker for up to six
months.</P>
      <P>The program hopes to fund the hiring of up to 10,000 workers by the end of the
year.</P>
      <P>Local government agencies will also be given subsidies for hiring
underprivileged individuals to perform temporary jobs.</P>
      <P>If the CLA's current measures do not make enough of an impact in creating jobs,
the agency will consider expanding their scale, Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics under
the Executive Yuan, the unemployment rate reached 4.27 percent in September, or
more than 464,000 jobless people, the highest level in four years, as Taiwan's
economy has felt the pinch of a global financial meltdown and economic recession
in the key United States market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Electricity prices won't drop despite crude oil price falls: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Gas prices in Taiwan could fall in November due to drops in global crude oil
prices over the past two months, but there is still no room for a lowering of
electricity prices, the minister of economic affairs said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yiin Chii-ming said that the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was adjusted
lower by NT$0.5 per kg in September and again in October. The price of
household-used LPG currently stands at NT$27.72 per kg and that of industry-used
LPG is at NT$30.8 per kg.</P>
      <P>Since LPG prices were mainly influenced by the international LPG market supply
and demand, Yiin said he believes there is space for prices to be reduced in the
near future.</P>
      <P>However, the same situation will not happen on power prices, Yiin said, because
when they were hiked in July and October, they only came to half of the
suggested increase level.</P>
      <P>Besides, he explained, international coal prices continue to rise, which gave
the state-run Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) - dominated by coal-fired power
generation - no choice but to maintain the current price levels.</P>
      <P>Yiin said the international coal price was at NT$2,280 per ton on July 1, and
surged to NT$3,938 in October. Taipower assessed it will still suffer from an
operational deficit of NT$100 billion this year, despite the power prices being
hiked.</P>
      <P>The power company is expected to sustain a further deficit of NT$150 billion
next year if power prices are not adjusted further by then to reflect actual
cost, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>Yiin made the remarks in replying to a demand by lawmakers at the Legislative
Yuan for immediate drops in power and gas prices.</P>
      <P>Some lawmakers complained at the legislative Economics Committee meeting earlier
in the day that the prices of commodities in the country failed to reflect the
fact that prices of crude oil and staple raw materials have been falling in the
international market over the past few weeks.</P>

      <P>Star pitcher Chien-ming Wang and pianist Meng-chieh Liu were among 10 people who
were selected Monday as the 10 most outstanding young men and women in Taiwan
for 2008.</P>
      <P>Wang, a Taiwan-born starting pitcher for the New York Yankees, was chosen in
recognition of his outstanding performance in the United States major leagues,
said Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who was on the panel of judges.</P>
      <P>After spending five years in the minor leagues and overcoming arm surgery, Wang
joined the big league club in 2005 and emerged as the Yankees' most consistent
starter in both 2006 and 2007.</P>
      <P>He won 19 games both years, setting a new mark for wins by an Asian pitcher in a
major league season.</P>
      <P>"Wang's fighting spirit and superior career achievements have made him a role
model for young people in Taiwan," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Pianist Liu, a recipient of the 2002 Avery Fisher Career Grant and the 2002
Philadelphia Musical Fund Society Career Advancement Award, was also selected
for the honor for his refusal to succumb to a debilitating disease and persevere
with his musical career, according to the judges.</P>
      <P>Liu made headlines in 1993 as a 21-year-old student at The Curtis Institute of
Music when he substituted for Andre Watts in the All-Star Series at the Academy
of Music in Philadelphia.</P>
      <P>The concert earned high acclaim from critics and the audience alike and was
followed by a number of widely praised performances, including a recital at the
Kennedy Center in Washington D.C.</P>
      <P>Liu's bright career, however, was abruptly halted by a rare and debilitating
illness that affected his connective tissues in 1995.</P>
      <P>After being hospitalized and almost immobile for two years, a determined Liu
underwent intensive physical therapy and embarked again on his concert career in
1998.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Monday that she
will meet with the leader of the main opposition party to discuss cross-Taiwan
Strait issues, as President Ma Ying-jeou is concerned about the party's
objections to his administration's China policy.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, Ma summoned her to the Presidential Office Monday and asked
whether she had discerned any great difference between his cross-strait policies
of the last five months and those of the former Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) administration in the eight years it was in power.</P>
      <P>The president wanted to know why DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen was opposed his
policies toward China, Lai related.</P>
      <P>Lai said she told the president she did not see any great difference  between
the  cross-strait  policies  of  the  two administrations, and she offered to
meet with Tsai to hear her opinions and to discuss with her the government's
approach to cross-strait matters.</P>
      <P>"I will meet with Tsai and explain our China policy to her, " Lai said at a
press conference. However, at the time, she had not yet contacted Tsai to make
the offer to meet.</P>
      <P>Later in the day,  Tsai turned a cold shoulder to Lai's suggestion, saying that
President Ma should focus on responding to the concerns of the people who joined
a protest rally Saturday that was organized by the DPP.</P>
      <P>The DPP's Department of International Affairs Director Lin Chen-wey suggested
that Lai give a policy briefing to the DPP caucus at the legislature before
meeting with Tsai.</P>
      <P>Lai defended the administration's direction on issues relating to China,  saying
that Taiwan is a democratic  society  and the government's policies are based on
the will of the people.</P>
      <P>"The current cross-strait policy protects Taiwan's dignity and and security and
safeguards its sovereignty," she said.</P>
      <P>However, Saturday's mass rally has given rise to concerns that administration's
approach to cross-strait issues does not have the approval of the opposition,
Lai said.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, there is a need for the government and the opposition to meet and
discuss cross-strait policy," she said. "If both sides of the Taiwan Strait can
sit down and negotiate, why shouldn't the ruling and opposition parties within
Taiwan do the same?"</P>
      <P>The response from the MAC came in the wake of a challenge issued by Tsai
Saturday for Ma to hold a public debate and dialogue with her on the issues of
national sovereignty and the country's cross-strait policy.</P>
      <P>Tsai was speaking at a mass rally attended by hundreds of thousands of people
who denounced the Ma administration's tilt towards China since it took office in
May.</P>
      <P>The DPP is also strongly opposed to an upcoming visit to Taiwan by China's top
liaison official with Taiwan, President of the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits Chen Yulin, and plans to organize daily protests during his
stay in Taiwan.</P>

Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen and step up bipartisan
cooperation on issues of major concern to the public, including the economy and
corruption, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chih said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks to reporters at the Presidential Office after Tsai led a
demonstration by tens of thousands of people in Taipei Saturday to criticize
Ma's China policy ahead of a Nov. 3 visit by China's top negotiator with Taiwan
-- Chen Yunlin, president of the quasi-official Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>According to the Presidential Office spokesman, Ma will continue to invite Tsai
as he has done in the past to discuss major national issues, such as anti-
corruption efforts, at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Concerning Tsai's request to hold a debate with Ma on Taiwan's sovereignty, Wang
said it was unnecessary because Taiwan's people had made a choice on the issue
in March's presidential election in which Ma was elected by an overwhelming
majority, defeating the DPP's candidate Frank Hsieh.</P>
      <P>The DPP, which is pro-Taiwan independence, had also favored improving ties with
long-time rival China, but wanted a slower and more cautious approach. Since Ma
came into office in May, the DPP has criticized Ma for moving too fast and
making too many concessions in efforts to build stronger ties with China.</P>
      <P>Ma, however, has pledged to safeguard the Republic of China's independent
sovereignty from China and since the weekend rally, has reassured the public
that he would not sell out Taiwan. He has insisted his policies are necessary to
boost Taiwan's economy and achieve peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan has
told the president that she would meet Tsai and exchange views on cross-strait
relations with her, said Wang.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference later Monday, DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang
criticized spokesman Wang's remarks as "extremely arrogant" and said that the
DPP will host anti-China activities during Chen's five-day visit in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"President Ma has the full responsibility to clearly explain his stance in
cross-strait dealings and address the concerns raised by the protesters
attending the weekend's demonstration in Taipei, " Cheng argued.</P>
      <P>Demonstrators  of the Saturday  protest march demanded  Ma specifically define
whether Taiwan is a nation or an area, whether Taiwan's 23 million people have
the right to determine the country's fate, or whether China should apologize and
compensate Taiwan's consumers and companies over its melamine-tainted milk
products sold to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>When Chen is in Taiwan, the DPP will launch anti-China protests during the day
time and hold vigils at night, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>National Security Bureau Director-General Tsai Chao-ming on Monday pledged to
protect Chen's personal safety as part of the government's efforts to guarantee
a smooth proceeding of a second round of negotiations between Chen and his
Taiwanese counterpart -- Chairman Chiang Pin-kung of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>The National Police Agency (NPA) will deploy some 7,000 policemen to ensure
Chen's safety, NPA Director-General Wang Cho-chiun said later on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen and Chiang are expected to discuss the expansion of cross-strait tourism
and travel links as a follow-up to their historic meeting in Beijing in June.</P>

      <P>A local hospital is seeking 50 volunteer patients with the metabolic syndrome to
take part in a three-month study aimed at understanding the possible medical
applications of the plant kakorots on patients suffering from problems in
metabolism.</P>
      <P>Cheng  Ching Hospital  in Taichung  City,  tasked  by the Cabinet-level National
Science Council, is currently conducting research on the potential effectiveness
of the plant, which is used in India to treat diabetes, to balance the level of
blood sugar.</P>
      <P>The metabolic syndrome is a term used to describe early signs of metabolism
malfunction in the body that could eventually lead to diseases such as diabetes
and hypertension.</P>
      <P>Some patients suffering from the syndrome are not eligible to receive medication
at the early stage, though signs of blood vessel abnormality may have already
appeared in them, according to Tsai Chung-huang, chairman of the family medicine
division of the hospital's Jhonggang branch.</P>
      <P>Patients facing such conditions are usually recommended by doctors to watch
their diet or to exercise to avoid the syndrome being aggravated to diabetes and
heart diseases, but it is not easy to succeed without strong will and expert
assistance, Tsai explained.</P>
      <P>If research findings prove the plant's effectiveness in treating people
suffering from the syndrome, Tsai said, kakorots can then serve as a useful
dietary supplement for such patients.</P>
      <P>Tsai noted that a research and development project executed by National Taiwan
University on health food derived from kakorots has shown good results, and that
the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture has also cultivated refined breeds of
the plant after years of efforts.</P>
      <P>The plants have been processed into health food as well.</P>
      <P>However, there is still a lack of convincing evidence on the medical
effectiveness presented from human research, Tsai said, prompting the need for
such an experiment.</P>
      <P>Volunteers interested in the experiment may contact the hospital at 04-2463-2000

      <P>Security measures have been activated to provide China's point man on Taiwan
with "watertight" protection when he visits in early November,  National
Security  Bureau (NSB) Director-General Tsai Chao-ming pledged Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , is scheduled to arrive in Taiwan Nov. 3 for a second
round of talks with his Taiwanese counterpart Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the
semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>Chen will be the highest-ranking People's Republic of China official to have
ever visited Taiwan if his trip proceeds as scheduled.</P>
      <P>Security measures will likely be tightened for Chen's trip after his deputy,
Zhang Mingqing, was besieged and jostled to the ground by anti-China protesters
during a visit to the southern Taiwan city of Tainan last week.</P>
      <P>In response to concerns over Chen's safety voiced by legislators at a hearing
held by the Legislative Yuan's Foreign and National Defense Committee, Tsai said
the NSB will follow three principles -- that Chen's visit is safe, peaceful and
hitch-free -- in preparing security measures for his stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The bureau will also not tolerate violence, challenges against governing
authorities, violation of administrative neutrality, or disturbances that harm
the Chiang-Chen talks, Tsai stressed.</P>
      <P>He also said the measures would be designed to ensure Chen's personal safety and
when he enters and exits the country. Security will be tight at Chen's hotel, at
negotiating venues, at press conferences, on visits to local attractions and
when he is on the road, Tsai added.</P>
      <P>Asked by a legislator if threats had been made against Chen, Tsai replied that
the NSB had received all kinds of intelligence with varying threat levels, but
added that his bureau was on top of the situation.</P>
      <P>NSB is the agency authorized to coordinate efforts to ensure Chen's safety
during his visit.</P>

      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation has received an official letter of apology from
its counterpart in Mainland China, apologizing to the people of Taiwan for
troubles caused by imports of melamine-tainted milk products.</P>
      <P>According to the fax received by SEF, the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait said that the tainted milk products problem has been investigated
and is the wrongdoing of a group of criminals.</P>
      <P>"The ARATS apologizes to Taiwan's people for the losses and damages caused,"
ARATS said in its fax to SEF, according to the quasi-official intermediary body.</P>
      <P>"Mainland China will not tolerate any harm to the health and rights of consumers
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, " ARATS also stressed.</P>
      <P>ARATS pointed out in the faxed letter of apology that it will "severely punish"
anyone who is responsible for endangering the health and rights of consumers.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's dairy suppliers have been accused of adding melamine, which is
used in the production of plastics, paint and adhesives, to water-down milk to
make the product appear rich in protein on fool quality control tests.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's opposition party organized a rally on Oct. 25, with one of the main
goals being to protest Mainland China's tainted milk products, which is believed
to have sickened three children in Taiwan, while causing panic among consumers

      <P>President Ma has openly criticized Mainland China for the scandal and has raised
the issue of setting up a task force to request compensation from Mainland

      <P>The internationally renowned Vienna Boys' Choir will sing for Taiwanese music
lovers around the island in the next two weeks, despite the general economic
downturn, which has caused many concerts to be canceled, organizers said Monday.</P>
      <P>"It is true that the recent economic downturn has a slight negative impact (on
the sales of concert tickets) , but we are still confident as the choir has a
great fame, " said Chou Tun-rern, general-manager of the Ars Formosa Company,
which is organizing the concerts.</P>
      <P>Chou told Central News Agency that about 90 percent of the tickets for the two
concerts that will take place in Taipei on Nov. 4 and 5 have been sold, and that
he was optimistic about box office sales in central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The choir has come to Taiwan many times in the past because it is welcomed by
Taiwanese audience, Chou said.</P>
      <P>This year's performance will feature popular songs of several musicals, such as
"If I were a rich man" from the Fiddler on the Roof and "Prepare ye the way of
the Lord" from the Godspell, Chou said.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, cultural activities, such as musicals and stage plays, have done
poorly at the box office or been canceled this year.</P>
      <P>The phenomenon could be blamed on the economic downturn and the lack of long-
term support for the art from the government, according to some local art
magazines.</P>
      <P>The Vienna Boys' Choir will perform on Oct. 28 in Taichung in central Taiwan,
Oct. 29 in Tainan and Oct. 30 in Kaohsiung in the south.</P>
      <P>The choir will continue the tour in northern Taiwan, with performances in
Hsinchu on Oct. 31, in Jung-li on Nov. 1, as well as the performances in the
capital on Nov. 4 and 5, according to the company.</P>
      <P>Ticket prices range from NT$400 to NT$2,000 each.</P>
      <P>The Vienna Boys' Choir was established in Austria in 1498 to provide musical
accompaniment to the church Mass. Divided in four groups, the around 100
choristers, aged between 10 and 14, have given about 300 concerts per year
around the world.</P>

      <P>The Central Personnel Administration (CPA) said Monday it will ease restrictions
to allow government agencies to hire extra hands to help ease rising
unemployment.</P>
      <P>CPA Minister Chen Ching-hsiou said his agency will cooperate with a short-term
measure developed by the Council for Economic Planning and Development to
address the jobless problem.</P>
      <P>Chen said the CPA has in the past imposed restrictions on the total number of
civil servants in government agencies, but he said restrictions will now be
"eased."</P>
      <P>Starting Nov. 1 until June 30 next year, government agencies will be allowed to
"hire extra hands" based on their respective manpower needs.</P>
      <P>"The extra jobs will be short-term in nature, and the total number of such
personnel will be controlled by the Executive Yuan, " he added.</P>
      <P>According to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics under
the Executive Yuan, the unemployment rate reached 4.27 percent in September, the

      <P>Stressed-out students at a Beitou elementary school will now be able to put
their best foot forward after a hot spring foot spa was opened on school grounds
Monday.</P>
      <P>The hot spring pool, in which students will be able to dip their feet and which
will also serve as a teaching facility, is the unique perk now being offered at
Hushan Elementary School in Taipei City's Beitou district, one of Taiwan's best-
known hot spring centers.</P>
      <P>According to the school's principal, Her Yi-chun, the school's outdoor hot
spring pool -- the first ever at a school in Taiwan -- was the result of test
hot spring water wells drilled by the city's Department of Economic Development
in the area in 2007.</P>
      <P>School authorities noticed that hot spring water regularly bubbled up to the
surface through the small test well drilled on the school's grounds and decided
to investigate further.</P>
      <P>They discovered that 100 tons a day of 40-degree Celsius water from a carbonic
spring with fairly neutral PH readings rose to the surface every day, Her said,
and decided to turn it into a place for students, teachers and residents of the
community to relax.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Education Department Director Wu Ching-shan, who presided over
Monday's opening of the hot spring pool, praised the school staff's idea and

    <HEADLINE>Economic indicators in September paint gloomy picture: CEPD</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan's leading economic indicators are pointing to a recession as the total
indicator monitoring score fell to 12 points, a level not seen since December
2001, according to a report released Monday by the Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>The indicators also flashed a blue light for the month, a sign that the economy
is heading toward recession, after signaling a slowdown a month earlier with a
yellow-blue light.</P>
      <P>It was the second blue light to appear this year after first appearing in July,
said Hung Jui-bin, director-general of the CEPD's Economic Research Department.</P>
      <P>The CEPD uses five colors to measure domestic economic health, with "red"
indicating serious overheating, "yellow-red" for slight overheating, "green" for
steady growth, "yellow-blue" for a slowdown and "blue" for recession.</P>
      <P>The composite index of leading indicators -- a barometer for the economy's
outlook in the coming three months -- stood at 106.4 in September, down 0.3
percent from the month-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The index has now fallen 11 consecutive months since last November, the CEPD
said, attributing the September decline to drops in three leading indicators --
the stock market index, export orders, and semiconductor shipments.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the index of coincident indicators, which reflects current economic
activity, registered 109 in September, down 0.7 percent from August.</P>
      <P>The decline was mainly caused by fall-offs  in industrial production index,
manufacturing sales, and exports, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Hung attributed the recession to a continuing slowdown in the financial,
manufacturing, consumption and export sectors and warned that the domino effect
of the U.S. financial storm and economic slowdown was so powerful that Taiwan's
economy would not be immune to its impact.</P>
      <P>If there were any bright spots in September, Hung said, it was that crude oil
prices and prices of staple raw materials were dropping in the international
market, which is expected to drive inflation lower, Hung said.</P>
      <P>The official also forecast that the economy would begin to recover in the second
half of next year, as previous cycles of economic decline or contraction had
lasted 12-15 months.</P>
      <P>Hung suggested that the recession may soon reach bottom because the monitoring
indicators have dropped for several months in a row.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Minister of defense acquitted of slander against former president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court ruled Monday that Minister of National Defense Chen
Chao-min did not slander President Chen Shui-bian in May when he implied that
the assassination attempt against the ex-president on the eve of the 2004
presidential election was staged.</P>
      <P>The court ruled that the defense minister had no intention of defaming the
former president when he made those remarks while being pressed on the issue by
lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The court noted that an opposition legislator had asked him the same question on
his view of the incident seven times before the minister gave his controversial
answer, and that his reply was based on the findings of a report issued by the
319 (March 19) Shooting Truth Commission after conducting an independent
inquiry.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-min was one of the commission's 17 members. The former president filed
the slander suit against the minister on May 27, seeking NT$10 million
(US$297,775) in damages. He may still appeal the case to a higher court.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-min said on May 21, the day after Chen Shui-bian finished serving his
second term as president, that the wound on the former president's abdomen was
not caused on Chinhua Street -- the scene of the shooting -- in southern
Taiwan's Tainan City on March 19, 2004.</P>
      <P>He was answering a DPP legislator's questions at his first hearing in the
Legislative Yuan's Foreign and National Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>The shooting occurred when Chen Shui-bian and then Vice President Lu were
campaigning in a jeep in Tainan on the eve of the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The opposition believes the shooting was arranged by Chen himself to generate
sympathy votes, enabling him to win a second term by less than 0.25 percent of
the vote.</P>
      <P>In August 2005, the Tainan Public Prosecutors Office ended its investigation
into the shooting after concluding that Chen Yi-hsiung, the lone suspect in the
shooting, had apparently committed suicide by drowning himself in Anping Harbor
in Tainan City 10 days after the shooting.</P>
      <P>The Chen Shui-bian administration refused to cooperate with the first,  as well
as the second, commission established by the legislature to investigate the
incident.  The second commission completed two reports in 2006 -- one in August
and the second in November.</P>
      <P>The first report claimed that based on forensic analysis led by James Chun-i
Lee, a professor at National Taiwan University's Graduate Institute of Forensic
Medicine, Chen Yi-hsiung did not kill himself but was most likely murdered
because his body -- wrapped in a fishing net and found in the harbor -- had been
dumped into the water after he died.</P>
      <P>The second report overturned one of the conclusions reached by a Criminal
Investigation Bureau task force that the two shots fired at the president and
vice president came from the same pistol, because one of the two bullet casings
found at the scene had an outer caliber measuring 9.1 mm and could not be loaded
into the chamber of the 9 mm pistol that police believe was used by the suspect.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government has stepped up efforts to contain the spread of
dengue fever as 28 new cases were reported in certain parts of the southern port
city last week, a local health official said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Twenty-eight more indigenous dengue fever cases were reported in the city last
week alone, bringing the total cases to 186 so far this year, " said Ho Chi-
kung, director of the municipal Department of Health.</P>
      <P>As an annual national sports meet is being held in the city and a warm-up event
for the 2009 World Games will also open in Kaohsiung Tuesday, Ho said the city
government's dengue fever-fighting team has heightened its alert and stepped up
preventive operations, including epidemiological  surveys,  environmental
cleanups and emergency disinfection.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, this year's dengue fever situation is far more complicated than
before.</P>
      <P>In the past, the outbreak in the city was usually caused by a single strain of
the virus, but this year, he said, two types of the virus originating in four
different countries -- Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines and Cambodia -- were
detected in cases reported in the city.</P>
      <P>Making epidemic control even more challenging is that the four different strains
penetrated different districts of the city, Ho said.</P>
      <P>For instance, dengue fever cases reported in the city's Nantzu district were
mainly caused by a Type 1 virus originating in Thailand, Ho said, with 14
boroughs in the district affected by the epidemic.</P>
      <P>But except for Jenchang borough, which was still being closely monitored, the
epidemic had been brought under control in all other boroughs, with no new cases
reported in those areas for more than six weeks.</P>
      <P>A single case reported in Fenghua borough in Kushan district was caused by a
Type II strain originating in the Philippines, Ho said, adding that no new case
of this strain has been reported for more than four weeks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Type II Cambodian strain mainly affects Chienchen district and
neighboring Kaohsiung County's Fengshan City, and the cases reported in the
city's Lingya district were mainly caused by the Type I Vietnamese strain of the
virus, Ho said.</P>
      <P>He suspected that the Cambodian and Vietnamese strains spread to neighboring
areas in Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County in August, and although the
outbreak was later contained, some remnants of the virus were able to spread
into Chienchen and Lingya districts, causing the infection to reach a peak last
week.</P>
      <P>With intensive preventive efforts, Ho said the epidemic will be gradually
subsiding in the coming one week or two.</P>
      <P>The potentially deadly dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease which is
manifested by a sudden onset of severe headache, muscle and joint pains, a
fever, and rashes.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) reaffirmed its commitment Monday to
assist local consumers and companies harmed by tainted milk powder and food
ingredient imports from China in seeking compensation.</P>
      <P>DOH spokesman Wang Tse-chao reiterated the pledge after China's quasi-official
intermediary body in charge of engagements with Taiwan sent an official letter
of apology to its Taiwanese counterpart earlier in the day apologizing to the
people of Taiwan for troubles caused by China's shipment of melamine-tainted
milk products to the island.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that the apology came a bit late, Wang said it was worth noting
that China expressed  its willingness  to assume responsibility for protecting
consumers' health and penalize all those liable for the incident.</P>
      <P>Wang also reiterated the DOH's stance of doing its utmost to help local victims
seek compensation from China.</P>
      <P>The letter of apology from the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , addressed to the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation, came just over a week before ARATS President Chen Yunlin visits
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen, as China's top point man on Taiwan, is scheduled to arrive in Taipei Nov.
3 for a five-day visit.</P>
      <P>In August, the DOH reported that a shipment of 25 tons of melamine-adulterated
milk powder had been imported into Taiwan, causing a food scare among local
consumers.</P>
      <P>Moreover, non-dairy creamers imported by a noted local food processing company
were also found to contain melamine, an industrial chemical used to make
plastics and banned as a food additive.</P>
      <P>The supplier of the melamine-tainted creamers, Shandong Duqing Co., has so far
not offered an apology to its Taiwanese customer King Car Co. and local
consumers.</P>
      <P>Duqing sent officials to Taipei earlier this month and confirmed that non-dairy
creamers in stock at King Car were indeed supplied by the company.</P>
      <P>Duqing officials took samples back to China for testing, but have yet to offer
an apology or a reaction in the 10 days that have gone by since their return.</P>
      <P>Wang said the DOH has twice contacted Duqing through a direct communciation
channel with China over the incident, but the company's officials have said the
test results are not yet available.</P>
      <P>"We'll continue pushing the Chinese company to give an apology. Otherwise, we'll
file a protest with Beijing authorities," he added.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) has again made use of one of the leading
shopping Web sites in Taiwan to help orange growers in Gukeng, Yunlin County,
sell their produce through commercial sponsorships.</P>
      <P>The COA said that PayEasy.com took the initiative to invite businesses to
sponsor rice growers in July with good results -- 77 enterprises joined the
program to sponsor 52 hectares of rice field.</P>
      <P>"The better-than-expected result has proved that the model of enterprises
sponsoring agricultural produce is a highly accepted approach, " the COA said.</P>
      <P>Gukeng, located in south-central Taiwan, has 2,000 hectares of orange orchards
yielding 96,000 tons of oranges a year, about a quarter of the total grown in
Taiwan, the COA said.</P>
      <P>But oranges grown in warmer, southern Taiwan are the first to be harvested, and
by the time farmers in Gukeng pick their oranges, prices have already started to
slip. As a consequence, growers are forced  to sell their oranges  at a cheap
NT$4 per kilo to distributors.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the COA has again solicited the assistance of the Yunlin
farmers' association and PayEasy.Com to launch the "sponsor orange growers"
program.</P>
      <P>COA Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung said the marketing of agricultural produce should be
diversified, and that in addition to traditional and wholesale markets and
supermarkets, enterprise sponsorships are also a crucial channel.</P>
      <P>This will ensure that farmers find buyers while the fruit is still growing on
trees. Because the prices are written in the contracts, "the growers will have
stable income and the sponsoring enterprises will also have a stable source of
produce," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen was glad to learn the program to sponsor orange growers has received an
enthusiastic response, with businesses already pledging to sponsor 136 tons of
Gukeng oranges. Among them, Taishin Holdings has promised to buy 44 tons.</P>
      <P>The COA said that if the businesses are unable to eat all the oranges they
promise to buy, PayEasy will work with volunteer group "Food Banks" to donate
them to 160 underprivileged groups on behalf of the businesses.</P>
      <P>This will help achieve a "one sponsorship, double charity" goal, the COA added.</P>
      <P>In addition, for those enterprises that promise to sponsor 4,000 kgs. of
oranges, PayEasy will invest NT$15,000 to send employees of the sponsoring
companies to go to Kukeng to enjoy picking oranges and other activities.</P>

      <P>The issue regarding how President Ma Ying-jeou should be addressed by China's
top negotiator with Taiwan during their planned meeting in Taipei will be
discussed at a second round of preparatory talks, a senior Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Kao Koong-lian made the remarks upon his
return from the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen where he met with officials
from the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) to work out the itinerary and agenda for ARATS President Chen Yunlin's
historic visit to Taiwan early next month.</P>
      <P>Kao said the first preparatory meeting Monday was fruitful, with most technical
details regarding Chen's visit settled.</P>
      <P>Chen will be the highest-ranking Chinese official ever to visit Taiwan since the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait split after a bloody civil war in 1949.</P>
      <P>According to a consensus reached at the meeting, Chen will sign four agreements
with his Taiwanese counterpart, SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, on food safety
issues, the expansion of direct air links, and the establishment of direct
shipping and postal links during his Nov. 3-7 visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As to a much-anticipated meeting between President Ma and Chen, Kao said more
discussions  are needed  to flesh out details, particularly how Ma will be
addressed.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's government certainly will do its best to ensure Chen's
safety during his stay in Taiwan, Kao said safety, dignity and convenience will
be the top concerns in arranging Chen's activities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Basically, Kao said, Chen will stay at Grand Hotel during his Taipei visit and
his talks with Chiang will also be held there to save time.</P>
      <P>In consideration of his hectic schedule, Chen will not travel to central and
southern parts of Taiwan during his upcoming visit, Kao added.</P>

      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation has received an official letter of apology from
its counterpart in Mainland China, apologizing to the people of Taiwan for
troubles caused by imports of melamine-tainted milk products.</P>
      <P>According to the fax received by SEF, the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait said that the tainted milk products problem has been investigated
and is the wrongdoing of a group of criminals.</P>
      <P>"The ARATS apologizes to Taiwan's people for the losses and damages caused,"
ARATS said in its fax to SEF, according to the quasi-official intermediary body.</P>
      <P>"Mainland China will not tolerate any harm to the health and rights of consumers
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, " ARATS also stressed.</P>
      <P>ARATS pointed out in the faxed letter of apology that it will "severely punish"
anyone who is responsible for endangering the health and rights of consumers.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's dairy suppliers have been accused of adding melamine, which is
used in the production of plastics, paint and adhesives, to water-down milk to
make the product appear rich in protein on fool quality control tests.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's opposition party organized a rally on Oct. 25, with one of the main
goals being to protest Mainland China's tainted milk products, which is believed
to have sickened three children in Taiwan, while causing panic among consumers
and hurting local retail stores.</P>
      <P>President Ma has openly criticized Mainland China for the scandal and has raised
the issue of setting up a task force to request compensation from Mainland
China.</P>

      <P>The internationally renowned Vienna Boys' Choir will sing for Taiwanese music
lovers around the island in the next two weeks, despite the general economic
downturn, which has caused many concerts to be canceled, organizers said Monday.</P>
      <P>"It is true that the recent economic downturn has a slight negative impact (on
the sales of concert tickets) , but we are still confident as the choir has a
great fame, " said Chou Tun-rern, general-manager of the Ars Formosa Company,
which is organizing the concerts.</P>
      <P>Chou told Central News Agency that about 90 percent of the tickets for the two
concerts that will take place in Taipei on Nov. 4 and 5 have been sold, and that
he was optimistic about box office sales in central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The choir has come to Taiwan many times in the past because it is welcomed by
Taiwanese audience, Chou said.</P>
      <P>This year's performance will feature popular songs of several musicals, such as
"If I were a rich man" from the Fiddler on the Roof and "Prepare ye the way of
the Lord" from the Godspell, Chou said.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, cultural activities, such as musicals and stage plays, have done
poorly at the box office or been canceled this year.</P>
      <P>The phenomenon could be blamed on the economic downturn and the lack of long-
term support for the art from the government, according to some local art
magazines.</P>
      <P>The Vienna Boys' Choir will perform on Oct. 28 in Taichung in central Taiwan,
Oct. 29 in Tainan and Oct. 30 in Kaohsiung in the south.</P>
      <P>The choir will continue the tour in northern Taiwan, with performances in
Hsinchu on Oct. 31, in Jung-li on Nov. 1, as well as the performances in the
capital on Nov. 4 and 5, according to the company.</P>
      <P>Ticket prices range from NT$400 to NT$2,000 each.</P>
      <P>The Vienna Boys' Choir was established in Austria in 1498 to provide musical
accompaniment to the church Mass. Divided in four groups, the around 100
choristers, aged between 10 and 14, have given about 300 concerts per year
around the world.</P>

      <P>The Central Personnel Administration (CPA) said Monday it will ease restrictions
to allow government agencies to hire extra hands to help ease rising
unemployment.</P>
      <P>CPA Minister Chen Ching-hsiou said his agency will cooperate with a short-term
measure developed by the Council for Economic Planning and Development to
address the jobless problem.</P>
      <P>Chen said the CPA has in the past imposed restrictions on the total number of
civil servants in government agencies, but he said restrictions will now be
"eased."</P>
      <P>Starting Nov. 1 until June 30 next year, government agencies will be allowed to
"hire extra hands" based on their respective manpower needs.</P>
      <P>"The extra jobs will be short-term in nature, and the total number of such
personnel will be controlled by the Executive Yuan, " he added.</P>
      <P>According to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics under
the Executive Yuan, the unemployment rate reached 4.27 percent in September, the
highest level in four years, with more than 464,000 people out of work, the
result of the global financial crisis and economic recession in the key United
States market that have left Taiwan's economy reeling.</P>

      <P>Stressed-out students at a Beitou elementary school will now be able to put
their best foot forward after a hot spring foot spa was opened on school grounds
Monday.</P>
      <P>The hot spring pool, in which students will be able to dip their feet and which
will also serve as a teaching facility, is the unique perk now being offered at
Hushan Elementary School in Taipei City's Beitou district, one of Taiwan's best-
known hot spring centers.</P>
      <P>According to the school's principal, Her Yi-chun, the school's outdoor hot
spring pool -- the first ever at a school in Taiwan -- was the result of test
hot spring water wells drilled by the city's Department of Economic Development
in the area in 2007.</P>
      <P>School authorities noticed that hot spring water regularly bubbled up to the
surface through the small test well drilled on the school's grounds and decided
to investigate further.</P>
      <P>They discovered that 100 tons a day of 40-degree Celsius water from a carbonic
spring with fairly neutral PH readings rose to the surface every day, Her said,
and decided to turn it into a place for students, teachers and residents of the
community to relax.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Education Department Director Wu Ching-shan, who presided over
Monday's opening of the hot spring pool, praised the school staff's idea and
joined a group of schoolchildren in bathing his feet in the pool.</P>
      <P>Wu said the foot spa would be open to the public on holidays, in addition to the
school's students, teachers and staff workers.</P>
      <P>Beitou is located north of Taipei City's center and has long attracted visitors,

    <HEADLINE>Economic indicators in September paint gloomy picture: CEPD</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's leading economic indicators are pointing to a recession as the total
indicator monitoring score fell to 12 points, a level not seen since December
2001, according to a report released Monday by the Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>The indicators also flashed a blue light for the month, a sign that the economy
is heading toward recession, after signaling a slowdown a month earlier with a
yellow-blue light.</P>
      <P>It was the second blue light to appear this year after first appearing in July,
said Hung Jui-bin, director-general of the CEPD's Economic Research Department.</P>
      <P>The CEPD uses five colors to measure domestic economic health, with "red"
indicating serious overheating, "yellow-red" for slight overheating, "green" for
steady growth, "yellow-blue" for a slowdown and "blue" for recession.</P>
      <P>The composite index of leading indicators -- a barometer for the economy's
outlook in the coming three months -- stood at 106.4 in September, down 0.3
percent from the month-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The index has now fallen 11 consecutive months since last November, the CEPD
said, attributing the September decline to drops in three leading indicators --
the stock market index, export orders, and semiconductor shipments.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the index of coincident indicators, which reflects current economic
activity, registered 109 in September, down 0.7 percent from August.</P>
      <P>The decline was mainly caused by fall-offs  in industrial production index,
manufacturing sales, and exports, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Hung attributed the recession to a continuing slowdown in the financial,
manufacturing, consumption and export sectors and warned that the domino effect
of the U.S. financial storm and economic slowdown was so powerful that Taiwan's
economy would not be immune to its impact.</P>
      <P>If there were any bright spots in September, Hung said, it was that crude oil
prices and prices of staple raw materials were dropping in the international
market, which is expected to drive inflation lower, Hung said.</P>
      <P>The official also forecast that the economy would begin to recover in the second
half of next year, as previous cycles of economic decline or contraction had
lasted 12-15 months.</P>
      <P>Hung suggested that the recession may soon reach bottom because the monitoring
indicators have dropped for several months in a row.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Minister of defense acquitted of slander against former president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 27 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court ruled Monday that Minister of National Defense Chen
Chao-min did not slander President Chen Shui-bian in May when he implied that
the assassination attempt against the ex-president on the eve of the 2004
presidential election was staged.</P>
      <P>The court ruled that the defense minister had no intention of defaming the
former president when he made those remarks while being pressed on the issue by
lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The court noted that an opposition legislator had asked him the same question on
his view of the incident seven times before the minister gave his controversial
answer, and that his reply was based on the findings of a report issued by the
319 (March 19) Shooting Truth Commission after conducting an independent
inquiry.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-min was one of the commission's 17 members. The former president filed
the slander suit against the minister on May 27, seeking NT$10 million
(US$297,775) in damages. He may still appeal the case to a higher court.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-min said on May 21, the day after Chen Shui-bian finished serving his
second term as president, that the wound on the former president's abdomen was
not caused on Chinhua Street -- the scene of the shooting -- in southern
Taiwan's Tainan City on March 19, 2004.</P>
      <P>He was answering a DPP legislator's questions at his first hearing in the
Legislative Yuan's Foreign and National Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>The shooting occurred when Chen Shui-bian and then Vice President Lu were
campaigning in a jeep in Tainan on the eve of the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The opposition believes the shooting was arranged by Chen himself to generate
sympathy votes, enabling him to win a second term by less than 0.25 percent of
the vote.</P>
      <P>In August 2005, the Tainan Public Prosecutors Office ended its investigation
into the shooting after concluding that Chen Yi-hsiung, the lone suspect in the
shooting, had apparently committed suicide by drowning himself in Anping Harbor
in Tainan City 10 days after the shooting.</P>
      <P>The Chen Shui-bian administration refused to cooperate with the first,  as well
as the second, commission established by the legislature to investigate the
incident.  The second commission completed two reports in 2006 -- one in August
and the second in November.</P>
      <P>The first report claimed that based on forensic analysis led by James Chun-i
Lee, a professor at National Taiwan University's Graduate Institute of Forensic
Medicine, Chen Yi-hsiung did not kill himself but was most likely murdered
because his body -- wrapped in a fishing net and found in the harbor -- had been
dumped into the water after he died.</P>
      <P>The second report overturned one of the conclusions reached by a Criminal
Investigation Bureau task force that the two shots fired at the president and
vice president came from the same pistol, because one of the two bullet casings
found at the scene had an outer caliber measuring 9.1 mm and could not be loaded
into the chamber of the 9 mm pistol that police believe was used by the suspect.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government has stepped up efforts to contain the spread of
dengue fever as 28 new cases were reported in certain parts of the southern port
city last week, a local health official said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Twenty-eight more indigenous dengue fever cases were reported in the city last
week alone, bringing the total cases to 186 so far this year, " said Ho Chi-
kung, director of the municipal Department of Health.</P>
      <P>As an annual national sports meet is being held in the city and a warm-up event
for the 2009 World Games will also open in Kaohsiung Tuesday, Ho said the city
government's dengue fever-fighting team has heightened its alert and stepped up
preventive operations, including epidemiological  surveys,  environmental
cleanups and emergency disinfection.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, this year's dengue fever situation is far more complicated than
before.</P>
      <P>In the past, the outbreak in the city was usually caused by a single strain of
the virus, but this year, he said, two types of the virus originating in four
different countries -- Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines and Cambodia -- were
detected in cases reported in the city.</P>
      <P>Making epidemic control even more challenging is that the four different strains
penetrated different districts of the city, Ho said.</P>
      <P>For instance, dengue fever cases reported in the city's Nantzu district were
mainly caused by a Type 1 virus originating in Thailand, Ho said, with 14
boroughs in the district affected by the epidemic.</P>
      <P>But except for Jenchang borough, which was still being closely monitored, the
epidemic had been brought under control in all other boroughs, with no new cases
reported in those areas for more than six weeks.</P>
      <P>A single case reported in Fenghua borough in Kushan district was caused by a
Type II strain originating in the Philippines, Ho said, adding that no new case
of this strain has been reported for more than four weeks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Type II Cambodian strain mainly affects Chienchen district and
neighboring Kaohsiung County's Fengshan City, and the cases reported in the
city's Lingya district were mainly caused by the Type I Vietnamese strain of the
virus, Ho said.</P>
      <P>He suspected that the Cambodian and Vietnamese strains spread to neighboring
areas in Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County in August, and although the
outbreak was later contained, some remnants of the virus were able to spread
into Chienchen and Lingya districts, causing the infection to reach a peak last
week.</P>
      <P>With intensive preventive efforts, Ho said the epidemic will be gradually
subsiding in the coming one week or two.</P>
      <P>The potentially deadly dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease which is
manifested by a sudden onset of severe headache, muscle and joint pains, a
fever, and rashes.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) reaffirmed its commitment Monday to
assist local consumers and companies harmed by tainted milk powder and food
ingredient imports from China in seeking compensation.</P>
      <P>DOH spokesman Wang Tse-chao reiterated the pledge after China's quasi-official
intermediary body in charge of engagements with Taiwan sent an official letter
of apology to its Taiwanese counterpart earlier in the day apologizing to the
people of Taiwan for troubles caused by China's shipment of melamine-tainted
milk products to the island.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that the apology came a bit late, Wang said it was worth noting
that China expressed  its willingness  to assume responsibility for protecting
consumers' health and penalize all those liable for the incident.</P>
      <P>Wang also reiterated the DOH's stance of doing its utmost to help local victims
seek compensation from China.</P>
      <P>The letter of apology from the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , addressed to the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation, came just over a week before ARATS President Chen Yunlin visits
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen, as China's top point man on Taiwan, is scheduled to arrive in Taipei Nov.
3 for a five-day visit.</P>
      <P>In August, the DOH reported that a shipment of 25 tons of melamine-adulterated
milk powder had been imported into Taiwan, causing a food scare among local
consumers.</P>
      <P>Moreover, non-dairy creamers imported by a noted local food processing company
were also found to contain melamine, an industrial chemical used to make
plastics and banned as a food additive.</P>
      <P>The supplier of the melamine-tainted creamers, Shandong Duqing Co., has so far
not offered an apology to its Taiwanese customer King Car Co. and local
consumers.</P>
      <P>Duqing sent officials to Taipei earlier this month and confirmed that non-dairy
creamers in stock at King Car were indeed supplied by the company.</P>
      <P>Duqing officials took samples back to China for testing, but have yet to offer
an apology or a reaction in the 10 days that have gone by since their return.</P>
      <P>Wang said the DOH has twice contacted Duqing through a direct communciation
channel with China over the incident, but the company's officials have said the
test results are not yet available.</P>
      <P>"We'll continue pushing the Chinese company to give an apology. Otherwise, we'll
file a protest with Beijing authorities," he added.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) has again made use of one of the leading

sell their produce through commercial sponsorships.</P>
      <P>The COA said that PayEasy.com took the initiative to invite businesses to

program to sponsor 52 hectares of rice field.</P>
      <P>"The better-than-expected result has proved that the model of enterprises

      <P>Gukeng, located in south-central Taiwan, has 2,000 hectares of orange orchards
yielding 96,000 tons of oranges a year, about a quarter of the total grown in
Taiwan, the COA said.</P>
      <P>But oranges grown in warmer, southern Taiwan are the first to be harvested, and
by the time farmers in Gukeng pick their oranges, prices have already started to
slip. As a consequence, growers are forced  to sell their oranges  at a cheap
NT$4 per kilo to distributors.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the COA has again solicited the assistance of the Yunlin
farmers' association and PayEasy.Com to launch the "sponsor orange growers"
program.</P>
      <P>COA Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung said the marketing of agricultural produce should be
diversified, and that in addition to traditional and wholesale markets and
supermarkets, enterprise sponsorships are also a crucial channel.</P>
      <P>This will ensure that farmers find buyers while the fruit is still growing on
trees. Because the prices are written in the contracts, "the growers will have
stable income and the sponsoring enterprises will also have a stable source of
produce," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen was glad to learn the program to sponsor orange growers has received an
enthusiastic response, with businesses already pledging to sponsor 136 tons of
Gukeng oranges. Among them, Taishin Holdings has promised to buy 44 tons.</P>
      <P>The COA said that if the businesses are unable to eat all the oranges they
promise to buy, PayEasy will work with volunteer group "Food Banks" to donate
them to 160 underprivileged groups on behalf of the businesses.</P>
      <P>This will help achieve a "one sponsorship, double charity" goal, the COA added.</P>
      <P>In addition, for those enterprises that promise to sponsor 4,000 kgs. of
oranges, PayEasy will invest NT$15,000 to send employees of the sponsoring
companies to go to Kukeng to enjoy picking oranges and other activities.</P>

      <P>The issue regarding how President Ma Ying-jeou should be addressed by China's
top negotiator with Taiwan during their planned meeting in Taipei will be
discussed at a second round of preparatory talks, a senior Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Kao Koong-lian made the remarks upon his
return from the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen where he met with officials
from the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) to work out the itinerary and agenda for ARATS President Chen Yunlin's
historic visit to Taiwan early next month.</P>
      <P>Kao said the first preparatory meeting Monday was fruitful, with most technical
details regarding Chen's visit settled.</P>
      <P>Chen will be the highest-ranking Chinese official ever to visit Taiwan since the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait split after a bloody civil war in 1949.</P>
      <P>According to a consensus reached at the meeting, Chen will sign four agreements
with his Taiwanese counterpart, SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, on food safety
issues, the expansion of direct air links, and the establishment of direct
shipping and postal links during his Nov. 3-7 visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As to a much-anticipated meeting between President Ma and Chen, Kao said more
discussions  are needed  to flesh out details, particularly how Ma will be
addressed.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's government certainly will do its best to ensure Chen's
safety during his stay in Taiwan, Kao said safety, dignity and convenience will
be the top concerns in arranging Chen's activities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Basically, Kao said, Chen will stay at Grand Hotel during his Taipei visit and
his talks with Chiang will also be held there to save time.</P>
      <P>In consideration of his hectic schedule, Chen will not travel to central and
southern parts of Taiwan during his upcoming visit, Kao added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic indicators in September paint gloomy picture: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
10/28/08  10:55:49
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's leading economic indicators are pointing to a recession as the total
indicator monitoring score fell to 12 points, a level not seen since December
2001, according to a report released Monday by the Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>The indicators also flashed a blue light for the month, a sign that the economy
is heading toward recession, after signaling a slowdown a month earlier with a
yellow-blue light.</P>
      <P>It was the second blue light to appear this year after first appearing in July,
said Hung Jui-bin, director-general of the CEPD's Economic Research Department.</P>
      <P>The CEPD uses five colors to measure domestic economic health, with "red"
indicating serious overheating, "yellow-red" for slight overheating, "green" for
steady growth, "yellow-blue" for a slowdown and "blue" for recession.</P>
      <P>The composite index of leading indicators -- a barometer for the economy's
outlook in the coming three months -- stood at 106.4 in September, down 0.3
percent from the month-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The index has now fallen 11 consecutive months since last November, the CEPD
said, attributing the September decline to drops in three leading indicators --
the stock market index, export orders, and semiconductor shipments.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the index of coincident indicators, which reflects current economic
activity, registered 109 in September, down 0.7 percent from August.</P>
      <P>The decline was mainly caused by fall-offs  in industrial production index,
manufacturing sales, and exports, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Hung attributed the recession to a continuing slowdown in the financial,
manufacturing, consumption and export sectors and warned that the domino effect
of the U.S. financial storm and economic slowdown was so powerful that Taiwan's
economy would not be immune to its impact.</P>
      <P>If there were any bright spots in September, Hung said, it was that crude oil
prices and prices of staple raw materials were dropping in the international
market, which is expected to drive inflation lower, Hung said.</P>
      <P>The official also forecast that the economy would begin to recover in the second
half of next year, as previous cycles of economic decline or contraction had
lasted 12-15 months.</P>
      <P>Hung suggested that the recession may soon reach bottom because the monitoring
indicators have dropped for several months in a row.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Beitou elementary school students to get spa treatment</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Stressed-out students at a Beitou elementary school will now be able to put
their best foot forward after a hot spring foot spa was opened on school grounds
Monday.</P>
      <P>The hot spring pool, in which students will be able to dip their feet and which
will also serve as a teaching facility, is the unique perk now being offered at
Hushan Elementary School in Taipei City's Beitou district, one of Taiwan's best-
known hot spring centers.</P>
      <P>According to the school's principal, Her Yi-chun, the school's outdoor hot
spring pool -- the first ever at a school in Taiwan -- was the result of test
hot spring water wells drilled by the city's Department of Economic Development
in the area in 2007.</P>
      <P>School authorities noticed that hot spring water regularly bubbled up to the
surface through the small test well drilled on the school's grounds and decided
to investigate further.</P>
      <P>They discovered that 100 tons a day of 40-degree Celsius water from a carbonic
spring with fairly neutral PH readings rose to the surface every day, Her said,
and decided to turn it into a place for students, teachers and residents of the
community to relax.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Education Department Director Wu Ching-shan, who presided over
Monday's opening of the hot spring pool, praised the school staff's idea and
joined a group of schoolchildren in bathing his feet in the pool.</P>
      <P>Wu said the foot spa would be open to the public on holidays, in addition to the
school's students, teachers and staff workers.</P>
      <P>Beitou is located north of Taipei City's center and has long attracted visitors,
dating back to when Japan ruled Taiwan, to its hot springs and spas.</P>

    <HEADLINE>More dengue fever cases reported in Kaohsiung City</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Oct.27 (CNA)
10/28/08  10:59:06
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government has stepped up efforts to contain the spread of
dengue fever as 28 new cases were reported in certain parts of the southern port
city last week, a local health official said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Twenty-eight more indigenous dengue fever cases were reported in the city last
week alone, bringing the total cases to 186 so far this year, " said Ho Chi-
kung, director of the municipal Department of Health.</P>
      <P>As an annual national sports meet is being held in the city and a warm-up event
for the 2009 World Games will also open in Kaohsiung Tuesday, Ho said the city
government's dengue fever-fighting team has heightened its alert and stepped up
preventive operations, including epidemiological  surveys,  environmental
cleanups and emergency disinfection.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, this year's dengue fever situation is far more complicated than
before.</P>
      <P>In the past, the outbreak in the city was usually caused by a single strain of
the virus, but this year, he said, two types of the virus originating in four
different countries -- Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines and Cambodia -- were
detected in cases reported in the city.</P>
      <P>Making epidemic control even more challenging is that the four different strains
penetrated different districts of the city, Ho said.</P>
      <P>For instance, dengue fever cases reported in the city's Nantzu district were
mainly caused by a Type 1 virus originating in Thailand, Ho said, with 14
boroughs in the district affected by the epidemic.</P>
      <P>But except for Jenchang borough, which was still being closely monitored, the
epidemic had been brought under control in all other boroughs, with no new cases
reported in those areas for more than six weeks.</P>
      <P>A single case reported in Fenghua borough in Kushan district was caused by a
Type II strain originating in the Philippines, Ho said, adding that no new case
of this strain has been reported for more than four weeks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Type II Cambodian strain mainly affects Chienchen district and
neighboring Kaohsiung County's Fengshan City, and the cases reported in the
city's Lingya district were mainly caused by the Type I Vietnamese strain of the
virus, Ho said.</P>
      <P>He suspected that the Cambodian and Vietnamese strains spread to neighboring
areas in Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County in August, and although the
outbreak was later contained, some remnants of the virus were able to spread
into Chienchen and Lingya districts, causing the infection to reach a peak last
week.</P>
      <P>With intensive preventive efforts, Ho said the epidemic will be gradually
subsiding in the coming one week or two.</P>
      <P>The potentially deadly dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease which is
manifested by a sudden onset of severe headache, muscle and joint pains, a
fever, and rashes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA helps Yunlin orange growers through commercial sponsorships</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) has again made use of one of the leading
shopping Web sites in Taiwan to help orange growers in Gukeng, Yunlin County,
sell their produce through commercial sponsorships.</P>
      <P>The COA said that PayEasy.com took the initiative to invite businesses to
sponsor rice growers in July with good results -- 77 enterprises joined the
program to sponsor 52 hectares of rice field.</P>
      <P>"The better-than-expected result has proved that the model of enterprises
sponsoring agricultural produce is a highly accepted approach, " the COA said.</P>
      <P>Gukeng, located in south-central Taiwan, has 2,000 hectares of orange orchards
yielding 96,000 tons of oranges a year, about a quarter of the total grown in
Taiwan, the COA said.</P>
      <P>But oranges grown in warmer, southern Taiwan are the first to be harvested, and
by the time farmers in Gukeng pick their oranges, prices have already started to
slip. As a consequence, growers are forced  to sell their oranges  at a cheap
NT$4 per kilo to distributors.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the COA has again solicited the assistance of the Yunlin
farmers' association and PayEasy.Com to launch the "sponsor orange growers"
program.</P>
      <P>COA Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung said the marketing of agricultural produce should be
diversified, and that in addition to traditional and wholesale markets and
supermarkets, enterprise sponsorships are also a crucial channel.</P>
      <P>This will ensure that farmers find buyers while the fruit is still growing on
trees. Because the prices are written in the contracts, "the growers will have
stable income and the sponsoring enterprises will also have a stable source of
produce," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen was glad to learn the program to sponsor orange growers has received an
enthusiastic response, with businesses already pledging to sponsor 136 tons of
Gukeng oranges. Among them, Taishin Holdings has promised to buy 44 tons.</P>
      <P>The COA said that if the businesses are unable to eat all the oranges they
promise to buy, PayEasy will work with volunteer group "Food Banks" to donate
them to 160 underprivileged groups on behalf of the businesses.</P>
      <P>This will help achieve a "one sponsorship, double charity" goal, the COA added.</P>
      <P>In addition, for those enterprises that promise to sponsor 4,000 kgs. of
oranges, PayEasy will invest NT$15,000 to send employees of the sponsoring
companies to go to Kukeng to enjoy picking oranges and other activities.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan Tuesday described as a "belated justice" China's apology
over the export of a shipment of melamine-tainted milk powder to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu, who openly demanded such an apology Oct. 7, said he believes the goodwill
gesture by China will help create a favorable atmosphere for the upcoming
negotiations between the two sides.</P>
      <P>To help the victims claim compensation from the China, Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) is accepting registration by the affected parties, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was informed by China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS) on Sept. 12 that 25 tons of Sanlu-brand milk powder imported from
China in June as an ingredient for food manufacturing was adulterated with
melamine, after Sanlu recalled 700 tons of tainted milk powder linked to kidney-
related diseases being suffered by young children.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS  are semi-official  intermediary  bodies authorized by Taiwan
and China, respectively, to handle cross-Taiwan Strait affairs in the absence of
official ties.</P>
      <P>In its latest letter to the SEF Monday, the ARATS said the case has been proven
to be a food safety incident and offered an apology to Taiwanese consumers and
businesses affected by the problem.</P>
      <P>The move came ahead of talks slated for early November in Taipei between SEF
Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen Yunlin, in which the
establishment of a cross-strait reporting system for food safety issues will be
discussed.</P>
      <P>Chen's planned visit is strongly opposed by the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , which is dissatisfied with what it contends is the
Kuomintang administration's failure to take a tough stance  toward  China in
dealing  with the scare  over melamine-tainted milk products and ingredients
imported from China.</P>
      <P>To voice its protest against the upcoming Chiang-Chen talks, the DPP held a
massive demonstration in Taipei Saturday that the party claimed to have drawn
600,000 participants.</P>

that milk powder, creamers and ammonium bicarbonate from China had been
contaminated with melamine.</P>
      <P>"To protect consumers' safety and rights, all imports of the China-made protein
powder will be banned from today," said DOH Deputy Minister Cheng Shou-hsia at a
press conference.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, the tainted protein powder was found during random
examinations conducted by local health bureaus in the past few days. Six of the
13 samples selected tested positive for the toxic chemical at levels of 1.9 to
5.03 ppm (part per million) , he disclosed.</P>
      <P>The DOH has instructed the importers to recall product and has directed local
health bureaus to seize all of it, he said.</P>
      <P>Of the 704 tons of protein powder imported this year, 393 tons were from China,
261 tons of which was imported by four local companies and found to be
contaminated with melamine, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The four enterprises imported the tainted ingredient from two companies, Dalian
Greensnow Egg Products Development Co., Ltd. and Jilin Jinyi Egg Co., Ltd.,
located in Jilin and Liaoning provinces in northeastern China, according to
Cheng.</P>
      <P>To ensure food safety, all China-made protein powder, even if it tests negative
for melamine, will be recalled, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Protein powder is a food additive used in the production of ham, vegetarian ham,
tempura and cakes, Cheng said, adding that it constitutes about one percent of
the content of such foods.</P>
      <P>He further indicated that the Bureau of Food and Drug Analysis under the DOH has
tested 40 samples of those food products, and the melamine tests were all
negative.</P>
      <P>Melamine has been found in imports of dairy products, creamers and vegetable-
based proteins from China in the past weeks.</P>
      <P>Under the DOH's current regulations, foods testing positive for melamine  with
the  use  of the LC-MS/MS  technique  (liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry) are not allowed on the market.</P>
      <P>Melamine, an industrial material, was added by Chinese food producers to diluted
milk to falsely elevate protein levels.</P>
      <P>The practice has led to four deaths and sickened tens of thousands of children
in China who were fed with baby formula made with contaminated milk.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's bid to interact with ASEAN a test of cross-strait ties: MOFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>How China responds to Taiwan's efforts to establish relations with the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is worth observing, as it will
indicate Beijing's stance on Taiwan's campaign for more international space, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Victor Yu, director-general of the MOFAs Department of East Asian and Pacific
Affairs, said at a regular press briefing that as the establishment of closer
relations between Taiwan and the ASEAN countries depends on Beijing, it is a
good opportunity to test the improving relations between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>We have to use appropriate channels to let the Chinese leaders understand that
Taiwans efforts to promote relations with the ASEAN is crucial and will provide
a better foundation for the countrys survival and sustainable development," Yu
said.</P>
      <P>"If Beijing no longer has political concerns, it should show some goodwill on
the issue, and we will see exactly how much goodwill it has toward Taiwan,he
added.</P>
      <P>Besides seeking better relations with China under President Ma Ying-jeou's
"modus vivendi" diplomatic strategy, the Kuomintang administration has been
stepping up efforts since it took office May 20 for Taiwan to actively
participate in the integration of the Asia Pacific region and ASEAN.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign ministry decided on Oct. 17 to establish a think tank to
develop strategies to promote relations with ASEAN countries, a decision made
after a two-day coordination  meeting of the ministry's newly formed task force
on relations with ASEAN.</P>
      <P>Yu said the task force will hopefully be in full operation by next January.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fears its trade-dependent economy could be marginalized if it is not
included in a regional free trade zone being negotiated, which would include the
ASEAN countries, China, South Korea and Japan.</P>
      <P>China will make its own evaluation of Taiwan's efforts to participation in the
ASEAN, Yu said, adding that he believes that in the future both sides will put
the issue on the agenda  of cross-Taiwan  Strait  talks,  given that it involves
Taiwan's international space.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has a lot to contribute to ASEAN, Yu said that the country's
current mission is to establish a "systematic link" with the regional group to
promote bilateral and multi-lateral relations.</P>
      <P>Asked what name should be used in Taiwan's bid to participate in the ASEAN, Yu
said although it is too early to discuss that matter, "as long as there is
political goodwill, such a technical issue can be resolved."</P>
      <P>Established in Thailand in 1967, ASEAN is made up of 10 member countries --
Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Its objectives, apart from promoting regional peace, include the acceleration of
economic growth,  social progress and cultural development among its members.</P>

      <P>Diplomatic relations between Palau and Taiwan will remain solid and strong no
matter which candidate wins Palau's upcoming presidential election because both
candidates are friendly toward Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>After the first round of voting on Sept. 23, the two runners-up, incumbent Vice
President Elias Camsek Chin and Johnson Toribiong, former Palau ambassador to
Taiwan, will face each other in the Nov. 4 runoff for the presidency.</P>
      <P>"Both candidates are good friends of Taiwan and therefore our relations with
Palau will not be affected by the outcome of the election," said Victor Yu,
director-general of the MOFA's Department of East Asian and Pacific Affairs.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan and Palau share close and substantial relations, citing as
an example the fact that Taiwanese visitors make up one third of the total
tourist arrivals in Palau.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, the final result of Palaus presidential election is expected on
Nov. 11 after all the votes, including absentee ballots, have been counted. The
new president will be sworn in next January.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Palau established diplomatic relations in 1999 and the Pacific island
remains one of Taiwan's 23 diplomatic allies.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-hsiuan said Tuesday that the plan to integrate Taichung city
and county and upgrade their status to that of a special municipality is now in
the final stages.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a legislative interpellation session, Liu said all that is left is
for the president and vice president to be briefed on the details of the plan,

      <P>Liu made the remarks in response to a query on the issue by Legislator Chi Kuo-

Interior Liao Liou-yi's views on the integration plan.</P>

magistrate and mayor and the status of village and township chiefs in the
proposed special municipality.</P>
      <P>Liao was quoted as having said that all of these issues would have to be dealt
with in accordance with the law and public opinion.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu said at Tuesday's interpellation session that after the plan is

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu said Tuesday that the increased profits of the southern
port city's major international tourist and business hotels despite the tough
economic times is a reflection of the city's high-quality low-priced tourism
resources.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a municipal government meeting attended by Kaohsiung Tourism
Association Honorary President Lin Fu-nan, Chen said that the city's four major
international hotels together increased their occupancy between January and
August by 6,442 room bookings compared to the same period a year earlier.</P>
      <P>The mayor noted that Kaohsiung has been the only city in Taiwan to achieve
growth in this regard this year, attesting to its draw as a tourist destination.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Lin affirmed the municipal government's efforts at boosting
Kaohsiung's tourism industry. However, he added that more could be done, noting
that 250 of the city's smaller hotels still have an average occupancy rate of
less than 50 percent.</P>
      <P>Bureau of Redevelopment Director Liu Hsin-cheng said the fact that Kaohsiung's
major international hotels have been able to boost their revenue is both the
result of the city's attractive tourist resources as well as the municipal
government's efforts, in cooperation with local tourism operators, to promote
Kaohsiung tourism abroad.</P>
      <P>He noted that the rate of growth in revenues of the four international tourist
and business hotels in Kaohsiung ranked 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 6th, respectively,
among all major hotels in Taiwan for the January-August period this year.</P>
      <P>Their ability to buck the general trend of declining revenue amid tough economic
conditions clearly illustrates the positive results of the efforts made by the
municipal government's tourism promotion delegations sent to various overseas
destinations, including Japan and Singapore, he said.</P>

      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen demanded
Tuesday that China compensate Taiwan consumers and companies for the problems
caused by its export of tainted milk products to the country, and that the
Chinese government issue a formal apology over the food scare.</P>
      <P>The apology offered Monday by China's quasi-official Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) to Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
was not sincere and the Chinese government should publicly apologize and put
forward feasible measures to compensate Taiwan's consumers and businesses hit by
the scare over melamine-tainted milk powder and other food items, said Tsai.</P>
      <P>The melamine contamination in Taiwan was first detected in mid-September in a
Chinese brand of milk powder and since then the list of similarly tainted food
items has expanded, causing panic and outrage among local consumers.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions from DPP lawmakers at a legislative meeting, Premier Liu
Chao-shiuan said he would accept the ARATS' apology, although he was not very
satisfied with the way China has handled the issue.</P>
      <P>"The ARATS should have apologized sooner," he contended.</P>
      <P>The premier said he was confident that ARATS President Chen Yunlin would
personally apologize to the Taiwan people over the issue when he arrives in the
country next week.</P>
      <P>During his visit to Taiwan from Nov. 3-7., Chen will hold talks with his
Taiwanese counterpart, SEF Chairman Chiang Ping-kun, on the expansion of cross-
Taiwan Strait tourism and travel exchanges as a follow-up to their historic
meeting in Beijing in June.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, the issue of melamine-tainted food products from China will be
discussed in the coming ARATS-SEF meeting, and the SEF will ask, on behalf of
the Taiwan people, for compensation from "the Chinese government and (culpable)
companies."</P>

      <P>Franklin Graham, son of renowned American evangelist Billy Graham, will host a
four-day evangelistic conference at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei
between Oct. 30 and Nov. 2.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Franklin Graham Festival is expected to attract over a quarter of a
million people from around Taiwan, the event preparation committee said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Franklin Graham, born in 1952, is the president and CEO of both the Billy Graham
Evangelistic Association and the international Christian relief organization
Samaritan's Purse.</P>
      <P>He will talk to local audiences about the political, economic and social
problems that are disrupting society from the standpoint of religious faith,
members of the committee said.</P>
      <P>They noted that Graham hopes to convey the message of "new life, new hope" in
Taiwan at a time when society's spirits have been dampened by rising
unemployment, surging consumer prices and an economic slowdown triggered by the
global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Billy Graham, who will turn 90 on Nov. 7, hosted a five-day evangelistic
roadshow in late October 1975 in Taipei, drawing more than 200,000 people.</P>
      <P>Acclaimed as the most famous contemporary evangelist who has had a personal
audience with every sitting U.S. president since Harry Truman, Billy Graham has
preached to more than 200 million people in 185 countries around the world.</P>
      <P>Franklin Graham, who has taken over his father's evangelical duties,  is
scheduled to visit President Ma Ying-jeou at the Presidential Office Thursday
before the conference begins.</P>
      <P>He will pray for the president and invite him, as well as Premier Liu Chao-

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan promised Tuesday that the government will uphold the
country's dignity and interests in its reception of China's top negotiator with
Taiwan, who is scheduled to visit Taipei in early November.</P>
      <P>Liu said that while he has no plan to meet with Chen Yunlin, president of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), the details of
President Ma Ying-jeou's planned meeting with Chen will be made public after
they are finalized.</P>
      <P>Liu ruled out the possibility for the meeting to take place at the Grand Hotel
where Chen will be staying, stressing that President Ma will be "receiving"
Chen, not "paying him a call."</P>
      <P>Liu said the government hopes Chen will call Ma "president, " but has prepared
for other possible scenarios to make sure Ma's status is not downgraded in the
meeting.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks when asked about the issue during an interpellation
session in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chen will be in Taipei Nov. 3-7 to hold talks with his Taiwanese counterpart,
Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, to discuss issues ranging
from extending the weekend cross-Taiwan Strait charter flight services to every
day of the week and opening direct cross-strait shipping links to establishing a
reporting system on food safety issues.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which believes the talks will
lead to the sacrificing of Taiwan's sovereignty, is strongly against Chen's
visit.</P>
      <P>In addition to holding a massive rally to protest the visit on Saturday, the DPP
is also planning to hold various demonstrations during Chen's stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DPP plans, for example, to have supporters set up national flags on
Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office to assert Taiwan's
sovereignty.</P>
      <P>On this matter, Liu said the government will allow the public to freely express
their opinions and will not remove the national flags set up by protesters.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, tight security measures will be imposed to prevent any
possible outbreak of violence, Liu said.</P>
      <P>During his visit to the southern Taiwanese city of Tainan last week, ARATS Vice
President Zhang Mingqing was jostled to the ground by protesters, forcing him to

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou positively acknowledged  Tuesday  an apology  from
China's  quasi-official intermediary body handling Taiwan affairs over the
shipment of melamine-tainted milk powder to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The apology is good and worthy of recognition, though it indeed came a bit
late, " Ma said while meeting with top leaders of seven of Taiwan's largest
industrial and commercial associations.</P>
      <P>Ma was referring to an official letter of apology from the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) sent to its
Taiwanese counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation, the day before, in which
it apologized to the people of Taiwan for the "food safety incident."</P>
      <P>Noting that the ARATS' promise to have the unscrupulous milk powder supplier
punished was not enough, Ma said Taiwanese victims were entitled to claim
compensation from China.</P>
      <P>The SEF has set up a mechanism to assist local consumers and companies harmed by
the melamine incident in seeking compensation, Ma said.</P>
      <P>ARATS informed the SEF Sept. 12 that 25 tons of Sanlu-brand milk powder imported
from China in June as an ingredient used in food processing was adulterated with
melamine, after Sanlu recalled 700 tons of the tainted milk powder linked to
kidney-related diseases suffered by tens of thousands of young children in
China.</P>
      <P>Melamine is an industrial chemical used to make plastics and banned as a food
additive.</P>
      <P>Ma told the senior business executives that maintaining peace with China is in
Taiwan's best interest.</P>
      <P>"We need not instigate conflicts to seek sympathy and should instead use
peaceful means to resolve cross-strait disputes, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Ma said, some recent incidents, including the melamine scare,
have cast clouds on relations with China.</P>
      <P>He said if Chinese authorities had offered an apology earlier over the melamine
scare, Taiwan's people would have felt differently about the situation.</P>
      <P>The letter of apology came just over a week before ARATS President Chen Yunlin
visits Taiwan. Chen, as China's top point man on Taiwan, is scheduled to arrive
in Taipei Nov.3 for a five-day visit, during which he is expected to meet with
Ma.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that many practical cross-strait issues need to be addressed, such
as protection of Taiwanese investors in China, Ma said his administration will
exercise prudence in engagements with China and will avoid any rash moves.</P>
      <P>The business leaders wno met with Ma included Chen Wu-hsiung, chairman of the
Chinese National Federation of Industries; Chang Pin-chao, chairman of the
General Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of China and Chang Chiung-chang,
secretary-general of the Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>Kung Te-cheng, the 77th direct lineal descendant of Confucius, died Tuesday at
the age of 89 in a hospital in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>According to the Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital in the county's Sindian City,
Kung checked into the hospital on Oct. 20 after developing pneumonia with a
complication of sepsis.</P>
      <P>Although doctors placed him in an intensive care unit and tried to use medicine
and a respiratory device to stabilize his condition, he died of heart and lung
failure at 10: 50 a.m. Tuesday, a hospital spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Kung is survived by his wife of 72 years, Sun Chi-fang, son Wei-ning, daughters
Wei-er and Wei-lai, five grandchildren and a great grandson.</P>
      <P>As the head of the main line of Confucius' offspring around the world, Kung had
served as the presiding official since 1935 at the annual ceremonies held by the
central government on Sept. 28, Confucius' birthday, to honor the great Chinese
sage.</P>
      <P>Kung served in many important positions. He was a member of the National
Assembly from 1946 to 1991 and helped draft the 1947 Constitution. From 1956 to
1964 he was director of the National Palace Museum in Taipei, overseeing the
treasures transported from mainland China to Taiwan during the civil war with
the communists. He was also a senior adviser to four successive presidents of
the Republic of China from 1948 to 2000.</P>
      <P>He served as the president of the Examination Yuan for nine years between 1984
and 1993. In recent years, he held professorships at National Taiwan University,
Fu Jen Catholic University and Soochow University.</P>
      <P>As Kung's first son Wei-yi, the 78th lineal descendant, died in 1989, his first
grandson Tsui-chang -- the 79th lineal descendant -- born in 1975, has now
become the head of the main line of the Confucian offspring and will serve as
the sacrificial official in future Confucian ceremonies. .</P>
      <P>Kung's great-grandson Yu-jen, the 80th lineal descendant, was born in Taipei on
Jan. 1, 2006.</P>
      <P>Confucius was born in 551 B.C. in the state of Lu -- now the Shandong province
of China. He died at 73. His teachings have become the cornerstone of
traditional Chinese culture and have greatly influenced other Asian countries as
well.</P>
      <P>In 1952, the Republic of China government in Taipei designated Confucius'
birthday as Teachers' Day in recognition of his great achievements as a teacher.
The Confucian temples around Taiwan and in other countries all hold sacrificial
rituals on this day every year in honor of the highly respected sage.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou stressed Tuesday that the upcoming talks between
quasi-official  bodies representing Taiwan and China would not address political
issues.</P>
      <P>Ma stated that the high-profile talks, to take place in Taipei in early
November, will focus on "technical and functional problems, " which if not
properly addressed would make it difficult to normalize bilateral economic ties.</P>
      <P>He said the talks would cover issues such as opening new air routes and more
destinations across the Taiwan Strait, extending direct weekend charter flights
to weekdays, establishing direct shipping links and postal exchanges, and
developing a framework to deal with food safety issues.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during his meeting at the Presidential Office with leaders
of seven major industrial and commercial associations in the country.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , will arrive in Taiwan Nov. 3 for a five-day visit for a
second round of talks with his Taiwanese counterpart Chiang Pin-kung, chairman
of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) .</P>
      <P>The visit was opposed by pro-independence activists who held a large-scale
protest march in Taipei City Oct. 25 to voice their discontent with what they
believe is Ma's conciliatory policy toward China.</P>
      <P>But Ma said he expected the visit of Chen, the highest ranking Chinese official
ever to visit Taiwan, to drive cross-Taiwan Strait relations to a new stage, he
said.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that once transportation between Taiwan and China becomes more
convenient, the business and cultural sectors will be able to adapt the new
traffic model to benefit their own exchanges with China.</P>
      <P>Such interactions extend far beyond the government's influence, the president
said, and he urged the public to avoid politicizing all aspects of exchanges
with China.</P>
      <P>The seven industrial and commercial association leaders who called on Ma to show
their support for his policy included Chen Wu-hsiung, chairman of the Chinese
National Federation of Industries; Chang Pin-chao, chairman of the General
Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of China; and Chang Chiung-chang, secretary-
general of the Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>The other four were Lee Cheng-chia, chairman of the Taiwan Federation of
Industry; Lin Ping-pin, chairman of the National Association of Small and Medium
Enterprises; Chen Fu-hsiung, vice chairman of the Taiwan Electrical and
Electronic Manufacturers' Association; and Lai Cheng-yi, chairman of the Council
for Industrial and Commercial Development.</P>

      <P>Seven Taiwanese industrial and commercial associations on Tuesday jointly
expressed their support for the upcoming historic meeting between top
negotiators of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, stressing that cross-strait
interactions will be in the interests of Taiwans development and lead to a
harmonious bilateral relationship.</P>
      <P>In the statement on the upcoming meeting between Chiang Pin-kung, the Strait
Exchange Foundation (SEF) chairman, and his Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin,
chairman of the Association of Relations Across Taiwan Straits (ARATS), the
associations urged the government to maximize Taiwanese people's interests in
negotiations under the principles of equality, dignity and mutual benefit, in
order to foster an advantageous environment for the countrys economic
revitalization.</P>
      <P>They also stated that through bilateral exchanges, Taiwans food safety can be
ensured, referring to the recent scandal over Chinas melamine-contaminated milk
products, which were imported to Taiwan, causing consumer panic and hurting
local food businesses.</P>
      <P>The two sides can also discuss the global financial crisis, the groups said.</P>
      <P>(The government) should consider how to enhance bilateral cooperation in the
fields of economic cooperation and trade, in order to mitigate the impact (of
the global financial crisis) on Taiwan, Preston W. Chen, chairman of the Taipei-
based Chinese National Federation of Industries (CNFI), said at a press
conference.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, China has become one of Taiwans most important trade
partners, as Taiwan ranks among the top five countries that invest the most in
China.</P>
      <P>China is also Taiwan's largest export market and second-largest source of
imports.</P>
      <P>Roscher Lin, president of the National Association of Small and Medium
Enterprises,  said he hoped that the issue of Taiwan businessmens investment in
China will be discussed.</P>
      <P>He said Chinese authorities should apply the same regulations, such as
stipulations concerning taxes, to Taiwanese investors as to Chinese people.</P>
      <P>Chen added that Taiwanese industrial and commercial associations are also hoping
Taiwanese SMEs can have access to more Chinese capital to help their businesses
grow and cope with increasing production costs.</P>
      <P>Lin explained that domestic banks seem to have decreased loans to enterprises,
which have a strong need for capital.</P>
      <P>He said that the amount of loans that banks give to enterprises is in accordance
with enterprisesturnover. Under the pressure of the global economic downturn,
their turnover has declined, which has led to more difficulties getting loans
from banks, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin is slated to arrive in Taiwan on Nov. 3 for a five-day visit,
leading a 60-member delegation, including financial officials and leaders of
major banks in China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taichung to host Asia's second largest documentary festival</HEADLINE>

      <P>Asia's second largest documentary festival will kick off in Taichung at the end
of October, showcasing over 130 domestic as well as international film
productions, including 18 from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The biennial Taiwan International Documentary Festival, which will open on Oct.
31 in the central Taiwanese city, has attracted some 115 overseas works from 34
countries this year for screenings and competitions in various categories.</P>
      <P>"The works reflect the directors' concerns over 21st Century issues, such as the
environment and marginalized groups, " Dr. Ava Hsueh, director of the National
Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts in Taichung, said at a news conference Tuesday.</P>
      <P>One of the entries includes a documentary project "Invisibles", which is
coordinated by German filmmaker Wim Wenders and comprised of five sections of
films shot by directors from Spain, Peru and Germany aimed at making  harsh
situations  faced by marginalized  and underprivileged groups better known to
the world.</P>
      <P>Wenders himself chose to record stories of rape victims to highlight the problem
of domestic violence in Congo.</P>
      <P>The festival comes as a homegrown Taiwanese film "Cape No. 7" has taken the box
office by storm - generating a record 440 million NT dollars in ticket sales so
far. However, it is not a documentary and will not be included in the festival.</P>
      <P>The story of love and humor celebrates what Taiwan is all about and has made
local audiences regain enthusiasm in the local film industry, despite the sector
being in a relatively quiet stage since its heydays in the '70s and '80s when it
was considered the Hollywood of Chinese-speaking societies.</P>
      <P>Hsueh said that the festival will not only serve as a platform for documentary
makers to exchange ideas, but also help the museum with its initiative to expand
its documentary database for research and public use.</P>
      <P>"It will also allow viewers to gain different perspectives on the world through
the filmmakers' lenses, " Hsueh said.</P>
      <P>International filmmakers are expected to make appearances during after-screening
gatherings, along with workshops and forums on documentaries held throughout the
nine-day event.</P>
      <P>Hsueh noted that this is Taiwan's first time cooperating with Asian and European
film festival organizers to recommend awarded films to be shown at one another's
events.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the festival will also feature productions of local themes, including
six documentaries from the series "Doc Taichung II: Taichung Through Different
Eyes, " which are chosen as one of the two opening films at the festival.</P>
      <P>The Doc Taichung II selection records the city's various aspects and civic
activities, such as doctors' care for children, and the elderly's nostalgia of
the past.</P>
      <P>"A film festival has a tight connection with the locality, " Hsueh said,
stressing that the event has made a point of focusing on the city.</P>
      <P>Of the 18 Taiwanese works to be screened, four are running for awards in the
international categories.</P>
      <P>"Heat Sun, " for instance, records the sad fates of Taiwanese soldiers recruited
to fight the Pacific War under the Japanese Occupation but were treated as
prisoners of war when the war ended. They nevertheless show great vitality
despite their suffering.</P>
      <P>The documentary will  represent Taiwan in the "International Competition -
Feature Length" category.</P>
      <P>Among the venues where the films will be rolling are the museum and the Cultural
Affairs Bureau of Taichung City.</P>
      <P>Free shuttle bus services to the film festival venues will be available at the
Taichung Station on the Taiwan High Speed Rail.</P>
      <P>The festival will close on Nov. 9.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chiayi County magistrate detained over suspicions of graft</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen was taken into custody by prosecutors
Tuesday on suspicions he engaged in graft by leaking confidential information to
help a businessman win a tender worth more than NT$650 million.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi District Court granted the Chiayi Prosecutors Office's request to
take Chen into custody out of concern that he could tamper with evidence in the
case.</P>
      <P>It said also he was eligible to be detained because the crime he was suspected
of committing carries a sentence of more than five years in prison.</P>
      <P>A panel of three judges made the decision, reversing a ruling by the same court
on Oct. 4, when Chen was released on NT$3 million (US$89,652) bail.</P>
      <P>Building contractor Lai Wen-cheng, who was released on NT$1.5 million bail on
Oct. 4 in the same case, was also detained as requested by prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Chen, a rising political star of the Democratic Progressive Party, is suspected
of leaking to Lai the reserve price for a tender for a sewage system to be
constructed in rural Minsyong township.</P>
      <P>According to investigators who tapped Chen's phone last year after Chen's office
tendered the sewage system, Chen called Lai to visit him at the magistrate's
Taipei residence in May 2007.</P>
      <P>Lai phoned his staff to rewrite his company's bidding price immediately after
leaving Chen's residence and eventually won the contract with a bid of NT$654
million, or NT$200,000 less than the reserve price, prosecutors alleged in their
request to the court to detain Chen.</P>
      <P>As prosecutors believed Chen was the only one who knew the reserve price of the
tender, they had investigators search the magistrate's office and Lai's company
on Oct. 3 and sought their detention.</P>
      <P>Chen denied any wrongdoing in the bidding process, and the Chiayi District Court
rejected prosecutors' detention request on Oct. 4.</P>
      <P>The ruling was thrown out by the Tainan Branch of the Taiwan High Court on Oct.
21 after prosecutors appealed the original ruling, which led to Tuesday's second
hearing of the request.</P>
      <P>Chen was escorted away from the court by sheriffs after the court announced its
ruling, which stunned Chen's wife Liao Shui-hui and many of his supporters and
drove them to tears in the court room.</P>
      <P>Although his status as the county's magistrate won't be affected unless he is
indicted and found guilty, his job at the county government will be assumed by
Deputy Magistrate Huang Kui-nan while he is in custody.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chang Hwa-kuan described the case as political persecution. The
party resolved on Oct. 8 that Chen was innocent of the allegations and warned
prosecutors not to allow political partisanship to interfere with the case.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that the government's approach to improving
relations with China is "neither too fast nor too slow, " and would not harm
Taiwan's national dignity and sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Ma defended the government's China policy at a meeting with leaders of seven
industrial and commercial associations at the Presidential Office, responding to
critics who argue that the administration is tilting too closely toward Beijing
at the cost of the country's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The president insisted to the entrepreneurs that Taiwan and China stand as
equals in their negotiations and that the problem of Taiwan being belittled does
not exist.</P>
      <P>As the president of the Republic of China, Ma said he will definitely make the
safety and happiness of 23 million Taiwanese people his top priority.</P>
      <P>"I grew up on Taiwanese rice and Taiwanese water, " he said, in expressing his
determination to fight for Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>With some suggesting that the government is opening the doors to China too
quickly, while others believing the liberalizing moves have come too slowly, Ma
said he understands that different people have different opinions.</P>
      <P>Those seeing the development of ties with China as proceeding too quickly feel
that way because there was no progress on the issue over the past eight years,
Ma argued.</P>
      <P>The president recalled, however, that late Formosa Plastics Group founder Wang
Yung-ching once complained that the government walked too slowly.</P>
      <P>"We will go neither fast nor slow" and will satisfy the needs of different
sectors in the country, Ma said.</P>

      <P>Health officials of the Taipei City government said Tuesday that they had
examined 35 vegetarian products sold on the market and found that six of them
contained beef, pork or chicken.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the six substandard vegetarian products, which
constituted 17.1 percent of the samples examined, were not packaged and that
consumers had no way of knowing their contents.</P>
      <P>These food products  were sold as vegetarian  fish balls, vegetarian pork
meatballs -- also known as Lion's head -- and various other vegetarian
meatballs, but actually they contained animal ingredients, probably with the
purpose to enhance their flavor, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Chiang Yu-mei, director of the Food and Drug Division of the city government's
health department, said that from July 1 next year, all vegetarian  food
manufacturers  and stores must comply with a certification system designed to
protect the rights of Taiwan's more than 2 million vegetarians.</P>
      <P>She explained that the packages of the vegetarian products must label clearly to
which of the five classes they belong: purely vegetarian, vegetarian with eggs,
vegetarian with dairy products, vegetarian with eggs and dairy products, or
vegetarian without animal content.</P>
      <P>A package marked "purely vegetarian" means that it does not contain animal
products or any of the five herbs that are considered as non-vegetarian --
onions, garlic, Chinese chives, shallots and leeks -- because, according to
Buddhist scriptures, they excite the senses.</P>
      <P>Those who do not comply with the certification system will be liable to fines of
between NT$30,000 (US$895) and NT$150,000. If the description does not match the
contents, or if the products are found to contain animal ingredients, their
manufacturers will be fined between NT$60,000 and NT$300,000, Chiang warned.</P>

      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , founded in 1991 to deal with China in
the absence of official ties, elected 49 directors Tuesday, four more than
currently sit on the foundation's board.</P>
      <P>Speaking  after  the  new directors  were  elected  in an extra-ordinary meeting
of the foundation's board, SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said the increase in the
numbers of directors was necessary in light of the foundation's more prominent
role.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of more frequent exchanges between the foundation and its
Chinese counterpart, the Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) , Chiang said the number of seats for government officials on the board
was increased from 12 to 16.</P>
      <P>The seats for business leaders who are mainly founders of the foundation and are
eager to tap the Chinese market has been increased from 24 to 28.</P>
      <P>But the number of seats reserved for social leaders decreased from three to two,
and the number of seats for political parties fell from four to three.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the elected directors will meet next month to elect a new chairman.</P>
      <P>The foundation, which is preparing for talks in Taiwan with its Chinese
counterparts early next week, was sidelined for nearly eight years under the
administration of former President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>It was brought back into the limelight after the Kuomintang was swept to power
to act as Taiwan's intermediary with China in line with President Ma Ying-jeou's
policy of improving ties with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chiang will meet ARATS President Chen Yunlin on Oct. 4 and the two are expected
to sign four agreements on direct postal and shipping links, food safety issues,

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) will promote Taiwan's agricultural tourism at
the upcoming 2008 Taipei International Travel Fair, Stanley Yen, chairman of the
organizing committee, announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The COA will present three separate pavilions to illustrate the theme of "Enjoy
life, experience happiness" at the 2008 ITF Taipei, which will open Oct. 31 at
the Taipei World Trade Center's Exhibition Hall 1 for a four-day run.</P>
      <P>They will showcase recreational farming, agri-flavored delicacies and country
liquors, said COA deputy chief Wang Chen-teng at a press conference held in the
Taipei International Convention Center.</P>
      <P>According to Wang the COA has been trying to develop overseas travel markets to
gain more opportunities for Taiwan's agricultural tourism.</P>
      <P>The COA's primary goal is to attract tourists from Chinese speaking  countries
in the Asian-Pacific  region  due to the similarities in language, culture and
eating habits, but this is only the first step of a marketing campaign to
promote agricultural tourism internationally, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The 62 countries showcasing their products at more than 1,200 booths will be the
most in the fair's 22-year history, making it the largest and most important
travel fair in Asia. It is estimated that more than 190,000 people will attend

      <P>The Taipei-based representative office of the Czech Republic held a national day
reception Tuesday to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the countrys independence
from the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</P>
      <P>The independent Republic of Czechoslovakia was formed in 1918, following the
collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I. In an 1948 coup
detat, Czechoslovakia became a communist ruled state and on Jan. 1, 1993, the
country peacefully split into its constituent states, the Czech Republic and
Slovakia.</P>
      <P>Jaroslav Dolecek, representative of the Czech Economic and Cultural Office in
Taiwan, said at the function that putting behind the 40 years of totalitarian
communist rule,the people of the Czech Republic now live in a free and smoothly
functioning democratic society and enjoy a thriving economy with rapid growth in
exports, a strong inflow of foreign capital and relatively low unemployment.</P>
      <P>Many people might be surprised to learn of the many things that Czechs have
discovered  or invented,  such as contact lenses, polarography, the screw
propeller, the wordrobotand so on, Dolecek said.</P>
      <P>He added that in that context, the best way to describe the East European
country is through Victor Hugo's words:There is no such thing as a little
country. The greatness of a people is no more determined by their number than
the greatness of a man is determined by his height.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan and the Czech Republic do not have diplomatic relations, Dolecek
said that the two countries still share very good and close relations.</P>
      <P>In the spirit of mutual benefit and reciprocity, bilateral exchange and
cooperation between Taiwan and the Czech Republic in such fields as trade,
tourism and science is constantly growing, he said.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the function, Vice Foreign Minister Javier Hou said that both Taiwan
and Czech started the process of democratization at roughly the same time.</P>
      <P>Former Czech President Vaclav Havel led the non-violentVelvet Revolutionthat
brought down communism in 1989, just two years after Taiwan lifted martial law.</P>
      <P>Our shared beliefs have paved the way for strong bilateral cooperation and
exchange, Hou said.They have also encouraged reciprocal   visits  between
senior-level   officials  and parliamentarians.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwanese also have experience in fighting communism and pursuing
democracy and freedom, Hou said Taiwan can therefore share in the joy felt over
Czechs joining the European Union in 2004.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan would also one day become a more active participant in the
international community.</P>
      <P>Next year the Czech Republic will hold the EU presidency, which I suppose is
dream come true for you, Hou said.Becoming more involved in the international
community is a dream of our own as well.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Health officials of the Taipei City government said Tuesday that they had
examined 35 vegetarian products sold on the market and found that six of them
contained beef, pork or chicken.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the six substandard vegetarian products, which
constituted 17.1 percent of the samples examined, were not packaged and that
consumers had no way of knowing their contents.</P>
      <P>These food products  were sold as vegetarian  fish balls, vegetarian pork
meatballs -- also known as Lion's head -- and various other vegetarian
meatballs, but actually they contained animal ingredients, probably with the
purpose to enhance their flavor, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Chiang Yu-mei, director of the Food and Drug Division of the city government's
health department, said that from July 1 next year, all vegetarian  food
manufacturers  and stores must comply with a certification system designed to
protect the rights of Taiwan's more than 2 million vegetarians.</P>
      <P>She explained that the packages of the vegetarian products must label clearly to
which of the five classes they belong: purely vegetarian, vegetarian with eggs,
vegetarian with dairy products, vegetarian with eggs and dairy products, or
vegetarian without animal content.</P>
      <P>A package marked "purely vegetarian" means that it does not contain animal
products or any of the five herbs that are considered as non-vegetarian --
onions, garlic, Chinese chives, shallots and leeks -- because, according to
Buddhist scriptures, they excite the senses.</P>
      <P>Those who do not comply with the certification system will be liable to fines of
between NT$30,000 (US$895) and NT$150,000. If the description does not match the
contents, or if the products are found to contain animal ingredients, their
manufacturers will be fined between NT$60,000 and NT$300,000, Chiang warned.</P>

      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , founded in 1991 to deal with China in
the absence of official ties, elected 49 directors Tuesday, four more than
currently sit on the foundation's board.</P>
      <P>Speaking  after  the  new directors  were  elected  in an extra-ordinary meeting
of the foundation's board, SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said the increase in the
numbers of directors was necessary in light of the foundation's more prominent
role.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of more frequent exchanges between the foundation and its
Chinese counterpart, the Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) , Chiang said the number of seats for government officials on the board
was increased from 12 to 16.</P>
      <P>The seats for business leaders who are mainly founders of the foundation and are
eager to tap the Chinese market has been increased from 24 to 28.</P>
      <P>But the number of seats reserved for social leaders decreased from three to two,
and the number of seats for political parties fell from four to three.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the elected directors will meet next month to elect a new chairman.</P>
      <P>The foundation, which is preparing for talks in Taiwan with its Chinese
counterparts early next week, was sidelined for nearly eight years under the
administration of former President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>It was brought back into the limelight after the Kuomintang was swept to power
to act as Taiwan's intermediary with China in line with President Ma Ying-jeou's
policy of improving ties with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chiang will meet ARATS President Chen Yunlin on Oct. 4 and the two are expected
to sign four agreements on direct postal and shipping links, food safety issues,
and expanding air links a day later.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) will promote Taiwan's agricultural tourism at
the upcoming 2008 Taipei International Travel Fair, Stanley Yen, chairman of the
organizing committee, announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The COA will present three separate pavilions to illustrate the theme of "Enjoy
life, experience happiness" at the 2008 ITF Taipei, which will open Oct. 31 at
the Taipei World Trade Center's Exhibition Hall 1 for a four-day run.</P>

gain more opportunities for Taiwan's agricultural tourism.</P>
      <P>The COA's primary goal is to attract tourists from Chinese speaking  countries
in the Asian-Pacific  region  due to the similarities in language, culture and
eating habits, but this is only the first step of a marketing campaign to
promote agricultural tourism internationally, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The 62 countries showcasing their products at more than 1,200 booths will be the
most in the fair's 22-year history, making it the largest and most important
travel fair in Asia. It is estimated that more than 190,000 people will attend
the event this year.</P>
      <P>"The annual travel fair will include exhibitors from airlines, travel agencies,
hotels, cruise lines, government tourist offices, land operators,  bus
operators,  car rental  companies,  trade publications and other travel related

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen was taken into custody by prosecutors
Tuesday on suspicions he engaged in graft by leaking confidential information to
help a businessman win a tender worth more than NT$650 million.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi District Court granted the Chiayi Prosecutors Office's request to
take Chen into custody out of concern that he could tamper with evidence in the
case.</P>
      <P>It said also he was eligible to be detained because the crime he was suspected
of committing carries a sentence of more than five years in prison.</P>
      <P>A panel of three judges made the decision, reversing a ruling by the same court
on Oct. 4, when Chen was released on NT$3 million (US$89,652) bail.</P>
      <P>Building contractor Lai Wen-cheng, who was released on NT$1.5 million bail on
Oct. 4 in the same case, was also detained as requested by prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Chen, a rising political star of the Democratic Progressive Party, is suspected
of leaking to Lai the reserve price for a tender for a sewage system to be
constructed in rural Minsyong township.</P>
      <P>According to investigators who tapped Chen's phone last year after Chen's office
tendered the sewage system, Chen called Lai to visit him at the magistrate's
Taipei residence in May 2007.</P>
      <P>Lai phoned his staff to rewrite his company's bidding price immediately after
leaving Chen's residence and eventually won the contract with a bid of NT$654
million, or NT$200,000 less than the reserve price, prosecutors alleged in their
request to the court to detain Chen.</P>
      <P>As prosecutors believed Chen was the only one who knew the reserve price of the
tender, they had investigators search the magistrate's office and Lai's company
on Oct. 3 and sought their detention.</P>
      <P>Chen denied any wrongdoing in the bidding process, and the Chiayi District Court
rejected prosecutors' detention request on Oct. 4.</P>
      <P>The ruling was thrown out by the Tainan Branch of the Taiwan High Court on Oct.
21 after prosecutors appealed the original ruling, which led to Tuesday's second
hearing of the request.</P>
      <P>Chen was escorted away from the court by sheriffs after the court announced its
ruling, which stunned Chen's wife Liao Shui-hui and many of his supporters and
drove them to tears in the court room.</P>
      <P>Although his status as the county's magistrate won't be affected unless he is
indicted and found guilty, his job at the county government will be assumed by
Deputy Magistrate Huang Kui-nan while he is in custody.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chang Hwa-kuan described the case as political persecution. The
party resolved on Oct. 8 that Chen was innocent of the allegations and warned
prosecutors not to allow political partisanship to interfere with the case.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei health officials find meat in vegetarian products</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Health officials of the Taipei City government said Tuesday that they had
examined 35 vegetarian products sold on the market and found that six of them
contained beef, pork or chicken.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the six substandard vegetarian products, which
constituted 17.1 percent of the samples examined, were not packaged and that
consumers had no way of knowing their contents.</P>
      <P>These food products  were sold as vegetarian  fish balls, vegetarian pork
meatballs -- also known as Lion's head -- and various other vegetarian
meatballs, but actually they contained animal ingredients, probably with the
purpose to enhance their flavor, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Chiang Yu-mei, director of the Food and Drug Division of the city government's
health department, said that from July 1 next year, all vegetarian  food
manufacturers  and stores must comply with a certification system designed to
protect the rights of Taiwan's more than 2 million vegetarians.</P>
      <P>She explained that the packages of the vegetarian products must label clearly to
which of the five classes they belong: purely vegetarian, vegetarian with eggs,
vegetarian with dairy products, vegetarian with eggs and dairy products, or
vegetarian without animal content.</P>
      <P>A package marked "purely vegetarian" means that it does not contain animal
products or any of the five herbs that are considered as non-vegetarian --
onions, garlic, Chinese chives, shallots and leeks -- because, according to
Buddhist scriptures, they excite the senses.</P>
      <P>Those who do not comply with the certification system will be liable to fines of
between NT$30,000 (US$895) and NT$150,000. If the description does not match the
contents, or if the products are found to contain animal ingredients, their
manufacturers will be fined between NT$60,000 and NT$300,000, Chiang warned.</P>

      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , founded in 1991 to deal with China in
the absence of official ties, elected 49 directors Tuesday, four more than
currently sit on the foundation's board.</P>
      <P>Speaking  after  the  new directors  were  elected  in an extra-ordinary meeting
of the foundation's board, SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said the increase in the
numbers of directors was necessary in light of the foundation's more prominent
role.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of more frequent exchanges between the foundation and its
Chinese counterpart, the Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) , Chiang said the number of seats for government officials on the board
was increased from 12 to 16.</P>
      <P>The seats for business leaders who are mainly founders of the foundation and are
eager to tap the Chinese market has been increased from 24 to 28.</P>
      <P>But the number of seats reserved for social leaders decreased from three to two,
and the number of seats for political parties fell from four to three.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the elected directors will meet next month to elect a new chairman.</P>
      <P>The foundation, which is preparing for talks in Taiwan with its Chinese
counterparts early next week, was sidelined for nearly eight years under the
administration of former President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>It was brought back into the limelight after the Kuomintang was swept to power
to act as Taiwan's intermediary with China in line with President Ma Ying-jeou's
policy of improving ties with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chiang will meet ARATS President Chen Yunlin on Oct. 4 and the two are expected
to sign four agreements on direct postal and shipping links, food safety issues,
and expanding air links a day later.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ex-chief of Hsinchu Science Park detained over corruption suspicions</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The former chief of Hsinchu Science Park, James J. Lee, was taken into custody
by prosecutors Wednesday over his  possible  links  to the former  first
family's  alleged money-laundering activities.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court granted the request from prosecutors at the Special
Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office on the grounds that
he had very likely engaged in corruption, which is a felony, and might tamper
with evidence unless brought into custody.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors requested Lee's detention after questioning him and his wife
Feng Chao-ching  for five hours Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The two were interrogated after Special Investigation Division investigators
conducted  simultaneous  searches of four sites, including Lee's residences in
Taipei and Yilan City.</P>
      <P>The case stemmed from the prosecutors' investigation into alleged money-
laundering by the family members of former President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>An anonymous  official  familiar  with the case said that investigators found
that a development company controlled by Jeffrey Koo, founder of the ChinaTrust
Group, wired large sums of funds to the overseas bank accounts opened by two
proxies of the first family after its land in Longtan, Taoyuan County, was
purchased by the Hsinchu Science Park in February, 2004.</P>
      <P>The official said the investigators suspected that the funds, which ended up in
the first family's overseas bank accounts, were kickbacks offered by Koo's firm
for the land deal, which was sealed at what investigators claimed to be
unreasonably high prices during Lee's term as chief of Hsinchu Science Park.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors in charge of the case refused to divulge whether Lee was detained
because of his links to the ex-first family's alleged financial manipulations,
saying only that he was suspected of steering undue profit toward Koo's firm.</P>
      <P>A pro-independence activist, Lee went into exile in the United States when
Taiwan was ruled by the Kuomintang, and returned to Taiwan to serve as the vice
environment minister when the Democratic Progressive Party took power in 2000.</P>
      <P>He was named as chief of the Hsinchu Science Park in October, 2001, and retired
from that post after the KMT administration assumed office in May this year.</P>

manufactured indigenous defense fighter, bursts its nose-wheel during a test
flight at Chingchuenkang Air Force Base in Taichung.

1986: The Ministry of Economic Affairs announces that ROC-U.S. trade talks on
wine and tobacco imports are in a stalemate. Washington charged that Taipei

2000: A poll unveiled by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party shows that only
33.2 percent of the Taiwan public supports the Cabinet's decision to halt
construction on the island's fourth nuclear power plant, while 47.5 percent
oppose the decision.

2001: The Republic of China Ministry of Finance approves an application from
Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. -- the second-largest banking group in
Japan and the world -- to upgrade its local representative office to a branch
office.

Mencius' lesson of the day: "When a ruler regards his ministers as his hands and
feet, they regard him as their belly and heart; when he regards them as dogs and
horses, they regard him as a common citizen; when he regards them as dirt and
grass, they regard him as a robber and enemy."</TEXT>

      <P>Lawmakers on the Legislative Yuan's Economics  Committee  demanded  Wednesday

      <P>Legislators across party lines passed a resolution at a meeting Wednesday,
demanding that prices of household liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas,
fuel oil and electricity be adjusted downward to reflect the decline in the
prices of crude oil and basic commodities in the international market since

      <P>Announcing the resolution, KMT Legislator Chiu Ching-chun, who chaired
Wednesday's committee meeting, said the committe will suspend screening of the

price reduction plan.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Yiin Chii-ming said Monday that natural gas prices in Taiwan
could fall in November because of falling crude oil prices over the past two
months, but indicated there was little room for cuts in electricity prices.</P>
      <P>Yiin said power prices would likely remain close to their current levels because
the previous price hikes in July and October only covered half the amount needed
to cover the state-run Taiwan Power Company's losses.</P>
      <P>Taipower estimated that it will still suffer an operating deficit of NT$100

      <P>The power company is expected to sustain a further deficit of NT$150 billion

costs, Yiin said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Pompe disease screening key to better prognosis: study</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese medical researchers have developed a new method to screen newborn
babies for Pompe disease, enabling accurate early detection and efficient
treatment that can greatly improve survival rates, academic sources said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>With the help of "Myozym" -- a new drug developed by Chen Yuan- tsong of
Academia Sinica -- babies suffering from the rare genetic disorder can be
treated before they are one-month old and can recuperate to near-full faculties.</P>
      <P>Pompe disease, also known as glycogen storage disease type II, is caused by the
deficiency in an enzyme called "acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA)" that is needed to
break down glycogen.</P>
      <P>Without the enzyme, glycogen accumulates in organs and muscles and gradually
damages their functions. In the worst cases, infants with the illness will die
from respiratory or cardiac complications before the age of one.</P>
      <P>The incidence of Pompe disease is estimated at one in every 35,000 to 40,000
newborns, according to National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) , one of the
institutions that participated in the project.</P>
      <P>Hwu Wuh-liang, director of NTUH's Medical Genetics Department and a co-author of
the scientific paper, said their search for an earlier detection method was
sparked by disappointing clinical results with Myozym after it was approved for
sale that did not live up to results obtained during the testing stage.</P>
      <P>"We suspected the reason for the poor performance was that the treatments tended
to start as late as half a year after birth, " Hwu said.</P>
      <P>As a result, Hwu, Chen, and other researchers from Taiwan and the United States
turned their attention to developing a new detection method that could spot
Pompe disease earlier.</P>
      <P>Compared to the conventional screening method that spots the syndrome between
three to six months after birth, Hwu said that among all 132,538 newborns
screened between October 2005 and March 2007, the new method successfully
isolated four baby patients before they were a month old.</P>
      <P>Along with three other patients, the four newborns were treated with Myozym as
early as possible, Hwu noted. After receiving treatment every two weeks for more
than a year, the seven newborn patients have grown healthily and their organ
functions are almost as good as normal, Hwu said.</P>
      <P>The results, which have been published in the science journal Pediatrics, have
made possible the wider application of Pompe disease screening among Taiwan's
newborns, said Hwu.</P>
      <P>Beginning next year, he said, almost all newborns can undergo the test at a cost
of NT$200 (about US$6).</P>

      <P>The Presidential Office would not confirm reports Wednesday that former Control
Yuan President Fredrick Chien will be appointed by President Ma Ying-jeou to
attend the 2008 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum leaders summit in
Peru next month.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi had no comment on reports by two major
Chinese-language dailies Wednesday speculating that Chien, who was Taiwan's
foreign minister between 1990 and 1996, would attend the APEC summit meeting on
behalf of the president.</P>
      <P>"We will make an announcement at an opportune time on who will represent
President Ma in attending the summit meeting," Wang noted.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News reported that if Chien is appointed by Ma to attend the
2008 APEC summit meeting, to be held in Lima, Peru Nov. 22-23, he would be the
highest-ranking former Republic of China (Taiwan) official to attend the APEC
leaders gathering.</P>
      <P>His participation would mark a "significant development" in Taiwan's relations
with China since Ma took office in May, the daily said. Ma has adopted a policy
of "diplomatic detente" to ease tensions across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's opposition, ROC presidents have been barred from the APEC
unofficial leadership summit meeting since the country became a member of the
regional grouping in 1991 under the moniker "Chinese Taipei."</P>
      <P>Ma said during an exclusive interview with the Central News Agency last week
that "we will do whatever we can to raise the level of our representation at the
APEC leadership summit."</P>
      <P>In recent days, former Vice President Lien Chan has also been named as a
possible envoy to the forum.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was represented by prominent business leaders in the important regional
meetings over the last two years -- by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
Chairman Morris Chang and Acer Group Chairman Stan Shih, respectively.</P>
      <P>Chien, 73, has also served as speaker of Taiwan's now-defunct National Assembly
and chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development.
He also taught Ma when Ma was a student at National Taiwan University.</P>

the previous price hikes in July and October only covered half the amount needed

      <P>Taipower generates much of its electricity from thermal coal, and Yiin said a
rise in international coal prices from NT$2,280 per ton on July 1 to NT$3,938 in
October, made it difficult to cut power rates to users.</P>
      <P>Yiin's remarks appeared to fly in the face of reality, as spot coal prices in
the international market have been on the decline since reaching a peak at the
beginning of July.</P>
      <P>But a Taipower spokeswoman told the Central News Agency that Yiin was actually
conveying the utility's average coal costs.</P>
      <P>She said that the lower prices in the first half of 2008 still reflected the
long-term coal contracts Taipower had signed in 2007, while rising prices in
international markets in 2008 were only being reflected in purchases made in
recent months, leading to a rise in average costs.</P>
      <P>The spokeswoman said with market prices highly volatile, Taipower to date has
only signed long-term contracts for 12 percent of its coal needs in 2009.</P>
      <P>She added that while spot prices on some coal markets have fallen well below
US$100 per ton, large vendors have been unwilling to sign one-year supply
contracts at those prices, leaving next year's cost picture uncertain.</P>
      <P>Taipower estimates that it will still suffer an operating deficit of NT$100
billion this year, despite the two price increases.</P>
      <P>The power company is expected to sustain a further deficit of NT$150 billion

    <TEXT>
      <P>The percentage of businesses offering on-the-job training has declined
significantly since last year amid tough economic times, according to the
results of a survey released by 1111 Job Bank Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the online employment services provider during the
latter half of this month, revealed that only 61.33 percent of businesses offer
on-the-job training, down from 85.65 percent in a similar survey last year.</P>
      <P>Among the businesses taking part in the survey, 66.1 percent said they are in
favor of providing assistance to their employees for on-the-job training, down
slightly from 70.45 percent last year, while 28.95 percent said they have no
opinion as they consider job skills training a personal decision.</P>
      <P>Only 4.95 percent of the respondents said they do not support providing
assistance for such training, with the main reasons mentioned being concerns
about work load, waste of company resources and inability to offer overtime.</P>
      <P>By sector, businesses in the information technology and real estate industries
were the most likely to offer on-the-job training to employees.</P>
      <P>Ryan Wu, chief operating officer of 1111 Job Bank, said the percentage of
businesses in the IT and real estate sectors offering on-the-job training is so
high because skilled employees are at the core of these businesses'
profitability.</P>
      <P>The survey on the effects of the economic downturn on businesses' attitudes
toward providing on-the-job training was conducted online between Oct. 15-28,
with a total of 525 valid samples being collected.</P>

      <P>A violin concert was held at the Taichung Drug Abuser Treatment Center
Wednesday, where 20 former drug abusers entertained center officials, their
peers and visiting relatives by playing four musical compositions.</P>
      <P>The visiting relatives of the inmates, including a 90-year-old grandmother, were
all moved by their performances.</P>
      <P>The inmates have attended a three-month violin class that the center sponsored
as one of the programs devised to help the drug abusers kick their habit while
continuing to grow mentally.</P>
      <P>"It takes patience and perseverance to get rid of addiction, but abstention will
be easier or more pleasant if the center can help the inmates rediscover the
value of their lives during the rehab process," said Chou Hui-huang, director of
the center.</P>
      <P>One of the inmates said that by learning to play the violin, he has become more
settled internally and has gained a clearer sense of his life's direction.</P>
      <P>In addition to violin class, the center has had many other classes and programs
in place to help the inmates weather tests and challenges, Chou said.</P>
      <P>The classes and programs include religion groups, martial art classes, gardening
and greening programs, a computer maintenance class,  an Aboriginal dancing
class,  a mind exploration  and improvement program and an experience sharing
class, according to Chou.</P>
      <P>The Taichung  Drug Abuser  Treatment  Center,  one of the government-funded
rehab centers in Taiwan, was established Jan. 1, 2006.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP to further demonstrate against Chinese negotiator's visit</HEADLINE>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will hold a series of
demonstrations next week against the visit of China's top negotiator with
Taiwan, after holding a massive anti-China rally last Saturday, a party official
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The  planned  demonstrations  will  include  a  vigil,  an encircling-the-city
protest and simultaneous rallies around Taiwan, said Cheng Wen-tsang, director
of the DPP's Department of Culture and Information.</P>
      <P>There will also be protests targeted specifically at separate meetings to be
held by Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and President
Ma Ying-jeou with Beijing's top negotiator with Taiwan, Chen Yunlin, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>He said the DPP will make sure the demonstrations are peaceful and non-violent
when encouraging  the public to express their opposition to the "Chiang-Chen
meeting" and "Ma-Chen meeting."</P>
      <P>Chen, president of the Beijing-based semi-official Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits, is scheduled to lead a delegation to Taipei Nov. 3-7
to discuss with the SEF issues ranging from extending the weekend charter flight
services between Taiwan and China to every day of the week and opening direct
shipping links to establishing a reporting system on food safety issues.</P>
      <P>The DPP believes the talks will lead to the sacrificing of Taiwan's sovereignty
and is strongly against Chen's visit. The party is also dissatisfied  with what
it claims  is the Kuomintang administration's conciliatory attitude in dealing
with the scare over melamine-tainted milk products and ingredients imported from
China.</P>
      <P>The upcoming demonstrations will be follow-ups of a march held by the DPP in
Taipei Saturday, which the party claims drew 600,000 participants.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior announced Wednesday that the number of Citizen
Digital Certificate cards issued to date has surpassed the 1.5 million mark.</P>
      <P>The card -- an electronic identity card with security features in the form of a
contact microprocessor 'smart' chip card -- is the basis for an e-government
initiative that links all government agencies through networking and provides
convenient and versatile services to citizens, the ministry said in a press
release.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,548 different types of government applications can now be made
using the CDC card, which citizens have used over 20 million times since its
launch in 2003, according to the ministry.</P>
      <P>The government began accepting applications for CDC cards on Apr. 30, 2003, and
it completed the integration of all 374 household registration offices around
Taiwan into the system by June of the following year, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>The card can now be used for a wide range of services, including income tax
submission, vehicle registration, labor insurance and pension matters,  driver's
license application,  and household registration, to name a few, according to
the ministry.</P>
      <P>The ministry said that the issuance of more than 1.5 million cards illustrates
the concrete achievements of the government's promotion of the e-government
services initiative.</P>
      <P>It said that the services offered under the CDC card program will be expanded
and that it is currently in consultation with various government agencies to
join the program, adding that the expanded services will attract even more
citizens to apply for the CDC card in the future.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese director Wei Te-sheng, whose romantic comedy "Cape No. 7" has taken
box offices by storm, has donated funds raised from an auction of props used in
the film to a local charity to help impoverished aboriginal families.</P>
      <P>Wei, along with actors and actresses in the film, donated NT$1.82 million
(US$54,675.99) to the Christian charity World Vision Taiwan Tuesday. The charity
will use the funds to help needy aboriginal families in central Taiwan and the
southern county of Pingtung, where the movie was made.</P>
      <P>The donated funds were raised from an Oct. 3-20 online auction of props used in
the film.</P>
      <P>The film, Wei's first full-length motion picture, is still being screened in
movie theaters around Taiwan, with box office earnings already surpassing NT$400
million -- the second highest in Taiwan, next to the NT$775 million for the
Hollywood Blockbuster "Titanic".</P>
      <P>The film tells two interrelated stories. One is a love story about a Japanese
man leaving his Taiwanese girlfriend at the end of World War II when Japan gave
up its colonial rule of the island. The other is about the dreams of a group of
young, amateur Taiwanese musicians.</P>
      <P>"Cape No. 7" won the Best Narrative Film at the 2008 Louis Vuitton Hawaii
International Film Festival on Oct. 15.</P>
      <P>According to information posted on the festival's Web site, an international
jury screened 150 entries from 36 countries based on the Hawaii film festival's
mandate "to entertain, enlighten and empower."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Government Information Office officials noted recently that in addition
to receiving a cash award of NT$100,000, Wei will be entitled to a government
subsidy to cover 20 percent of the movie's NT$50 million budget, due to the

      <P>Taipei City Parking Management Office in collaboration with Chunghwa Telecom
will launch Nov. 1 a new parking query system that will help drivers locate the
three parking lots closest to their vehicles with a simple text message, an
official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>To provide the service, the city and Chunghwa Telecom have collaborated on a
mobile phone positioning system that will link a system identifying the location
of the cell phone user's vehicle with computerized information on nearby parking
lots, according to Chien Pai-chang, an official at the office's operation
department.</P>
      <P>Drivers who are Chunghwa Telecom subscribers only need to send a text message to
"55145" to get parking information, Chien said.</P>
      <P>Once the text message is sent, Chunghwa Telecom will determine the phone's
location based on the strength of the cell phone's signal received by its base
stations and then transmit that information to the Parking Management Office's
computer system.</P>
      <P>The office's computer will then search for parking lots in the area and the
number of empty spaces left and text that information automatically to the
driver.</P>
      <P>The process takes around two minutes and costs NT$2.3 per request, Chien said.</P>
      <P>Taipei City will also continue with its instant parking query system, which
enables drivers to obtain information on public parking spaces available in the
city by telephone, according to Chien.</P>
      <P>Under that system, Chunghwa Telecom mobile subscribers can dial "55145" to make
voice queries on parking fees and open parking spaces.</P>
      <P>Some users had complained that the voice service was not convenient enough and
that cell phone inquiries were expensive, Chien said, which prompted the office
to expand the query system's functions and convenience.</P>
      <P>Non-Chunghwa Telecom cell phone subscribers or local telephone users can dial
(02) 2726-9600 ext. 2 to make similar queries as well, Chien added.</P>

      <P>Although a violent incident might impact Chinese tourists' willingness to visit
Taiwan, tourist arrivals from many parts of the world have been on the rise this
year, Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Except for Japan, numbers of tourist arrivals from European and Southeast Asian
countries as well as the United States and South Korea have been increasing this
year, " Lai told a legislative committee meeting screening the bureau's 2009
budget.</P>
      <P>"It is clear evidence that the government is not only setting its sights on
China in its tourism expansion efforts," she asserted.</P>
      <P>Lai acknowledged that an incident last week in which a visiting Chinese official
was besieged by local protesters might affect the willingness of Chinese
tourists to visit, but said most visitors from China had a good impression of
Taiwan and its people's hospitality.</P>
      <P>Zhang Mingqing,  vice president  of China's  quasi-official Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , was harassed and jostled to the
ground by a group of anti-China protesters Oct. 21 while on a private visit to
the Confucius Temple in southern Taiwan's Tainan City.</P>
      <P>As a result of the incident, seven Chinese representatives who were slated to
attend the 2008 Taipei International Travel Fair from Oct. 31 - Nov. 3 canceled
their trip to Taiwan out of fear for their personal safety, she said.</P>
      <P>However, a total of more than 290 Chinese people, a figure higher than last
year's level, have applied to take part in this year's international travel fair
at the Taipei World Trade Center, Lai said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ARATS President Chen Yunlin will arrive in Taiwan Nov. 3 for a five-
day visit and will hold talks with Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Chiang Pin-kung on the expansion of two-way exchanges on travel, tourism and

      <P>Taiwan's investor confidence plunged to a record low in the third quarter of
2008, as pessimism prevailed amid the global financial crisis, according to the
results of a survey released Wednesday by asset management firm JF Taiwan
Limited.</P>
      <P>The results show that Taiwan's investor confidence index stood at 81.8 in
October, a 23.3 percent decline compared to July when the survey was last
conducted and marking the lowest level since the survey was launched in July
2004.</P>
      <P>An index below 100 is indicative of pessimism, while one above 100 is indicative
of optimism.</P>
      <P>All six components of the index declined in October, with the largest drop-off
coming in respondents' outlook on the possibility of "one's own investment
portfolio appreciating in the next six months," which fell 28.9 percent to 69.8.</P>
      <P>The possibility of "Taiwan's economic environment" improving posted the second
largest fall, declining 28.21 percent from three months earlier to reach a
record low of 69.3.</P>
      <P>Also hitting a record low level was the possibility of an "increase in the
Taiex, " which registered 89.9 in October, down 21.3 percent from July.</P>
      <P>While the "possibility for a better investment market environment and
atmosphere" dropped 26.6 percent to 81.4, the possibility for "a better global
economic environment" lost 15.2 percent to stand at 70.8.</P>
      <P>The possibility  for a "better political  environment  and cross-Taiwan Strait
relations" decreased 19.8 percent to 109.5, making it the only indicator that
still remained above the median value of 100.</P>
      <P>The results ran parallel to those of a similar survey conducted in Hong Kong, in
which the Hong Kong investor confidence index plummeted 20.2 percent to 95 in
September, marking the first time the index has dropped below 100 since the
survey was launched in July 2006 in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Investor confidence in other areas, such as the possibilities for better
employment opportunities, higher commodity prices, higher property prices and
increases in income, also declined significantly in both Taiwan and Hong Kong,
all hitting record lows.</P>
      <P>While the prospect for better employment opportunities and higher property
prices nosedived by around 60 percent in both Taiwan and Hong Kong, the outlook
for higher commodity prices plunged by 50.7 percent in Taiwan and 32.6 percent
in Hong Kong thanks to the ease in inflationary pressures.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 58.8 percent of Taiwanese investors surveyed thought the measures put
forth recently by governments worldwide would help boost investor confidence.</P>
      <P>Approximately 40 percent of respondents were upbeat that the global economic
downturn would touch bottom within one year, while 30 percent believed it would
touch bottom in between one and two years.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan survey was conducted via telephone Oct. 13-19 among 1,079 investors
aged 20 and above. The Hong Kong survey was carried out via face-to-face
interviews in late September among 500 investors aged 21-60.</P>

      <P>The southern county of Tainan has entered its black-faced spoonbill season, with
638 of the endangered birds having flown south as of Wednesday to winter in the
county's wetlands, a local official said that same day.</P>
      <P>This year's first black-faced spoonbill was observed in the southern county Oct.
1, according to the official at the county's Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The birds migrate from northern China and the border between North and South
Korea to the wetlands near the Tzengwen River's estuary in Tainan county's Chigu
township every October and stay through the following April.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the Council of Agriculture under the Executive Yuan
designated a protection zone in the wetlands in 2002 for the conservation of the
species.</P>
      <P>Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih said the wetlands have many other
attractions waiting to be discovered and the county government has tried to
preserve the topography in order to retain more creatures there.</P>
      <P>The county government has improved its management of the wetlands and held
promotional activities to invite the public's support for its preservation
efforts, Su said.</P>
      <P>The local government established the Black-Faced  Spoonbill Conservation and
Management Center near the wetlands three years ago to carry out research on the
endangered species, which is viewed as an environmental indicator, Su said.</P>
      <P>The number of migrating spoonbills to Tainan County increased from nearly 300 in
1997 to 1,013 early this year, which was close to half of the world's 2,065
spoonbills recorded in the latest global census released this January, the
official said.</P>
      <P>The total number of migrating spoonbills to Tainan county this year is expected
to increase from the current figure, but it is difficult to predict the exact
number, the official said.</P>
      <P>The county  will  hold  its annual  black-faced  spoonbill conservation festival
on a date not yet decided, to allow the public to learn more about the rare bird
and the wetlands' resources.</P>

      <P>Food safety will be a major topic of discussion when Chiang Pin-kung, chairman
of Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), meets with his
Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin early next month, Department of Health (DOH)
Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yeh told reporters that Chiang and Chen, president of China's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) , are expected to sign an agreement
under which both sides of the Taiwan Strait will establish a mechanism to ensure
food safety.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to arrive in Taipei Nov. 3 for a five-day visit at the
invitation of Chiang for a second round of talks between them. They last met in
Beijing in June.</P>
      <P>Yeh pointed out that there is already a dialogue channel between the Cabinet-
level DOH and the Ministry of Health of China, and that health officials from
the two sides have already reached consensus on the text of the agreement to be
finalized and signed at the meeting.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, under the proposed food safety mechanism, China's General
Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine should strictly
enforce the same standards for food exports to Taiwan, the United States, Europe
and Japan.</P>
      <P>In addition, he added, the DOH will set up a food and drug administration to
stop the import of all substandard food products from China at Taiwan's borders.</P>
      <P>The mechanism will allow for compensation to those who have suffered harm and
losses due to toxic and substandard food imports from China, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's food sector has suffered a series of blows as a result of the
importation of melamine-tainted food products, including milk power, protein
powder and ammonium bicarbonate -- a bread raising agent -- from China.</P>
      <P>Many coffee shops and bakeries have complained that the melamine scare has
caused them to lose up to 50 percent of their business.</P>

      <P>The Presidential Office announced Wednesday that former  Vice President  Lien
Chan will attend  the 2008 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
leaders summit in Peru next month on behalf of President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Lien would be the highest-ranking former Republic of China official ever to
attend an APEC leaders summit, and his participation will be seen by some as a
symbol of progress in Taiwan's relations with China following Ma's inauguration
on May 20.</P>
      <P>Ma has adopted a policy of "diplomatic detente" to ease tensions across the
Taiwan Strait that critics contend will not reverse China's  efforts to prevent
Taiwan from participating  in the international community.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's opposition, ROC presidents have been barred from the APEC
leaders summit meeting since the country became a member of the regional
grouping in 1991 under the moniker "Chinese Taipei."</P>
      <P>Ma said during an exclusive interview with the Central News Agency last week
that "we will do whatever we can to raise the level of our representation at the
APEC leadership summit."</P>
      <P>Taiwan was represented at the first APEC leaders summit, held in Seattle in
1993, by Vincent Siew,  then chairman of Taiwan's Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development. Siew is now vice president.</P>
      <P>In 2001, then President Chen Shui-bian proposed to send former Vice President Li
Yuan-zu to attend the APEC leaders summit to be held in Shanghai. Taiwan
boycotted that gathering after Chen's proposal was rejected.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was represented by prominent business leaders in the last two APEC forums
-- by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Chairman Morris Chang and Acer
Group Chairman Stan Shih, respectively.</P>
      <P>Lien, 72, who earned a Ph.D. in political science from the University of

    <HEADLINE>Top China negotiator's visit a milestone for cross-strait ties: SEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 29 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said in an exclusive
interview with the Central News Agency Wednesday that the upcoming visit by
mainland China's top negotiator Chen Yunlin is a "milestone" in relations across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"Mainland China official Chen Yunlin's visit to Taipei is a milestone in cross-
strait relations and will serve to brightly polish Taiwan's plaque," said
Chiang.</P>
      <P>However, Chiang stressed that "hospitality and courtesy to guests will need to
be observed, as it is the means to win mainland China's respect for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>In addition, it is important to pay Chen respect as the international community
will be watching this historic meeting in Taiwan, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"We ourselves  also need to polish  the plaque of Taiwan sovereignty by
strengthening our economy and ensuring that the government is corrupt-free. We
should not let protests ruin this plaque and make us the laughing stock of the
world," said Chiang.</P>
      <P>The five-day visit is scheduled to begin on Nov. 3. Chen will be the highest-
ranking Chinese official to visit Taiwan since the two sides split at the end of
a civil war in 1949.</P>
      <P>Chiang's comments reflected concerns over the opposition's strong objections to
Chen's visit. The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) held a rally
which was attended by tens of thousands of people in Taipei on Oct. 25.
Protesters voiced discontent over the visit and Ma's opening-up policies toward
China.</P>
      <P>Just last week, ARATS Deputy President Zhang Mingqing was slightly injured when
he was mobbed by protesters in Tainan City in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DPP and pro-independence activists are planning further protest activities
to coincide with Chen's visit.</P>
      <P>Apparently due to worries about Chen's safety and to avoid any chance of
protesters mobbing Chen, Chiang said Chen will not do any sightseeing in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Chen's visit to Taiwan will be purely for negotiations and that no other visits
to Taiwan tourist sites will be included due to security reasons," said Chiang.</P>
      <P>He noted that Chen's itinerary originally included visits to central and
southern Taiwan, but those visits have been canceled due to the mobbing of ARATS
Deputy President Zhang.</P>
      <P>The landmark meeting between Chiang and Chen will cover issues such as opening
new air routes and more destinations across the Taiwan Strait, extending direct
weekend charter flights to weekdays, establishing  direct shipping links and
postal exchanges,  and developing a framework to deal with food safety issues,
Chiang said, adding that cross- strait direct air cargo transport will be
included in negotiations on chartered flights.</P>
      <P>Chiang indicated there was a high likelihood that agreements on these issues
will be signed.</P>
      <P>"The details for these agreements have all been settled in previous cross-strait
negotiations and the visit by Chen is to sign these agreements," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Chiang noted that as part of plans to improve future cross-strait ties, the two
sides will also sign a memorandum of understanding, or MOU, regarding financial
and banking issues.</P>
      <P>Chiang expressed hopes that the upcoming meeting between him and Chen in Taipei
will be able to lay the ground works for financial opening. If so, Taiwan's
banks will be able to set up subsidiaries in mainland China and vice-versa.</P>
      <P>"Attracting mainland China investment, in addition to tourists, will be
important issues in future cross-strait cooperation, " noted Chiang.</P>
      <P>Given the current global credit crisis, Chiang said the two sides should also
discuss ways to cope with the negative effects of the crisis.</P>
      <P>The addition of financial issues in the upcoming cross-strait meetings is
requested by Chen, with the aim of initiating cooperation between Taiwan and
mainland China to counter the global credit crisis.</P>
      <P>"European countries are uniting to counter the snowballing woes. Both sides of
the strait should work together as one on this particular issue," said Chiang.</P>
      <P>The modes for future cross-strait dialogues will also be set out by these
meetings between the heads of SEF and ARATS, Chiang indicated.</P>
      <P>"In addition,  Taiwan and mainland China,  by engaging in cross-strait
dialogue,  serves to improve regional stability", according to Chiang.</P>
      <P>He also stressed that there are no under-the-table dealings whatsoever by SEF
and ARATS, addressing a concern raised by the opposition DPP.</P>
      <P>SEF  is a quasi-official  body  responsible  for  handling cross-strait affairs.
Its counterpart in mainland China is ARATS.</P>
      <P>Since Ma Ying-jeou took office as president, Chiang and Chen have already met
once in Beijing in June 2008. Chen's visit to Taiwan will be the first ever trip
for a president of ARATS to Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The case involving seven Tainan City residents charged with allegedly mobbing a
visiting Chinese official was handed over to prosecutors Wednesday for further
investigation, according to a spokesman for the city police department.</P>
      <P>Wang Ting-yu,  a Tainan City councilor  of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), was among the seven suspects, the spokesman said. Two of them
failed to report to the police for an initial investigation.</P>
      <P>Zhang Mingqing,  vice president  of China's  quasi-official Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, was besieged and jostled to the ground by a
group of anti-China protesters on a private tour to the city's Confucius Temple
on Oct. 21.</P>
      <P>One protester even jumped onto the hood of Zhang's car and stamped on it with
his feet as Zhang was being escorted away from the site by a local official and
a tour guide.</P>
      <P>Wang, who allegedly mobilized the protesters to the scene, was charged with
hindering personal freedom, assault and eroding public order.</P>
      <P>Tainan City police authorities are still trying to identify two other suspects
who were seen pushing and attacking Zhang in a video footage held by police as
evidence, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Zhang filed a formal complaint with police against those who harassed him
following the incident. He cut short his visit and returned to Beijing the next
day.</P>
      <P>At the head of a 22-member delegation, Zhang arrived in Taiwan Oct. 19 for a
four-day visit. He took part in an academic seminar at Tainan National

      <P>A spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office said Wednesday that the relevant
agencies are currently working on the issue of expanding the range of Chinese
citizens eligible to travel to Taiwan for sightseeing visits.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular press briefing, spokesman Yang Yi said that the agencies
are considering an expansion of the number of Chinese provinces whose citizens
are eligible to travel to Taiwan and also an increase in the number of travel
agencies authorized to arrange tour groups to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yang pointed out that Wang Yi, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, had
already announced in Xiamen in early September that the number of provinces and
travel agencies would be significantly increased in the future.</P>
      <P>As to the scope of the expansion of eligibility for Taiwan travel, China's
National Tourism Office will make announcement after a decision has been
reached, Yang said.</P>
      <P>According to recent media reports, the relevant agencies on the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait have reached a consensus on increasing the number of provinces
whose citizens are eligible to travel to Taiwan from the current 13 to 19, and
the number of authorized travel agencies from 33 to 60.</P>

      <P>The government has no plans at this time to cut back on the number of foreign
workers in Taiwan's labor-intensive sectors to help create job opportunities for
local people, Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yiin admitted that the Council of Labor Affairs had recently discussed, on
unofficial occasions, the idea of slashing the number of foreign workers in
Taiwan, but he said Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has ruled  out that possibility  at
a time when local businesses are experiencing difficulties amid sagging economic
conditions across the globe.</P>
      <P>Foreign laborers are usually placed in dangerous, labor-intensive or night-shift
jobs that Taiwanese workers are not willing to do, and represent a significant
work force in Taiwan companies, he said.</P>
      <P>Against such a background, Yiin said, his ministry is opposed to the idea of
replacing foreign workers with Taiwanese workers to help Taiwan's industry
better cope with rising operating costs.</P>
      <P>There are more than 300,000 foreign workers in Taiwan, most of whom are from
Southeast Asian countries.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan expressed the hope Wednesday that France will help
Taiwan participate in United Nations specialized  agencies,  when  France  takes
over the rotating chairmanship of the European Union (EU) in the second half of
this year.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks in a meeting with Patrick Bonneville, the new director-
general of the French Institute in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Responding to Liu's appeal, Bonneville noted that in September the EU expressed
its support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in U.N. specialized agencies,
and he emphasized that France and the EU support the peaceful progress of cross-
Taiwan Strait relations and regional stability.</P>
      <P>On the topic of the economy, Bonneville said some French businesspeople view
Taiwan as a springboard for investment in China and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Liu responded that French investors are smart and that the Taiwan government
will like to be their partner in business and to contribute to strengthening the
Asian economy.</P>
      <P>He said he hoped that Taiwan and France will share information on the world's
financial crisis so as to better cope with the global problem.</P>
      <P>Liu told Bonneville that Taiwan's economic development remains promising and
that the government has introduced a series of stimulus measures such as fully
insuring deposits in local banks, asking banks to support local firms, and
bringing on stream a series of public construction projects.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and France have maintained good relations, the premier noted, adding that

    <TEXT>
      <P>An international seminar on the prevention of human trafficking will open in
Taipei Thursday for brainstorming on enhancing the efficiency of anti-human
trafficking operations, a senior official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A U.S. prosecutor in charge of human trafficking cases, James Felte, has been
invited to give tips on the investigation and prevention of trafficking in
persons,  particularly  women and children, said Chien Tai-lang, deputy minister
of the interior.</P>
      <P>Non-government organizations representatives, including Panadda Changmanee of
Vietnam's Oxfam Quebec International and Navauth Ya of CARAM Cambodia, will also
deliver keynote speeches at the seminar to share experiences in the prevention
of and crackdown on human trafficking, Chien said.</P>
      <P>Since the United Nations issued the Protocol on the Prevention, Prohibition and
Punishment of Trafficking in Persons in 2003, all U.N. member countries are
required to take effective steps to prevent human trafficking and penalize
offenders, as well as to protect victims of relevant crimes.</P>
      <P>As a member of the global village, Taiwan has mounted concerted efforts to
prevent and clamp down on human trafficking in recent years, even though it is
not a U.N. member, said Chien who concurrently serves as acting director-general
of the National Immigration Agency (NIA) under the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>With its prosperous economy, Chien said, Taiwan has become a major importing
country of migrant workers and female marriage immigrants from Southeast Asia in
recent years.  Against this backdrop, Taiwan has also become a major destination
or transit stop in human trafficking operations, he added.</P>
      <P>To grapple with this situation, Chien said, the NIA has placed emphasis on the
protection of those who have fallen victim to human trafficking crimes. Among
other initiatives, he said, a three-year program has been launched this year to
set up 11 shelters for human trafficking victims and will offer them
psychological counseling, legal aid and medical care during their stay at the
shelters, as well as provide them with financial aid for repatriation.</P>
      <P>Noting that the immigration law incorporates a special chapter on human
trafficking prevention, Chien said the government will further legislate a
special act to strictly regulate prevention and investigation of and crackdown
on human trafficking.</P>

      <P>The National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in downtown Taipei attracted the most
visitors from at home and abroad in the period Jan.-Aug. this year, according to
statistics released Wednesday by the Department of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics under the Taipei City government.</P>
      <P>The hall, which was built in memory of the late President Chiang Kai-shek after
his death in 1975, was visited by an average of 16,000 people a day during the
eight-month period, the figures showed.</P>
      <P>The second most popular site was the National Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall,
which commemorates the founding father of the Republic of China, with an average
of 13,000 visitors a day, while the Taipei Zoo, with 9,000 daily visitors, was
in third place.</P>
      <P>However, the biggest attraction for foreign tourists was the night markets,
which drew 63 out of every 100 foreign visitors to Taiwan in the Jan-Aug period.
The National Palace Museum, which attracted 45 out of every 100 foreign tourists
to see its exquisite cultural treasures, was in second place among such
visitors.</P>
      <P>The third biggest attraction for visitors from overseas was the skyscraper
Taipei 101, with 39 out of every 100 foreign visitors going to see the landmark
building.</P>
      <P>Among the privately run sightseeing spots, the Taipei 101 observation deck was
the most popular, drawing around 3,000 visitors per day.</P>
      <P>As for historic sites and buildings, Lungshan Temple in Taipei's Wanhua District
was number one, attracting an average of 5,000 visitors daily during the eight-
month period.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the figures showed that Taipei city had the highest number of tourism
hotels in Taiwan, totaling 33 as of the end of August.</P>

only to Kenting hotels in Pingtung county.</P>
      <P>Other hotels in Taipei recorded an occupancy rate of 72.59 percent during the
eight-month period, with Hsinchu the only area that surpassed that rate.</P>
      <P>The room rates for international tourist hotels in Taipei averaged NT$4,075
(US$122) per day, the third highest price in Taiwan after the Lalu in Nantou and
the Hotel Royal Chiao Hsi in Yilan.</P>
      <P>The average room rate for other hotels in Taipei was NT$2,032 per day, about 10

      <P>A scientist in Taiwan has invented the world's first chlorophyll organic battery
that can supply electricity within 10 seconds of being wetted with water,
beverages or even urine.</P>
      <P>Chungpin Hovering Liao, a professor at the Graduate School of Electro-Optic and
Material Science of National Formosa University in central Taiwan's Yunlin
County, told a news conference Wednesday that the battery, when wetted, can
provide electricity for two days to a week.</P>
      <P>While the strength of the battery is about half that of an ordinary battery, its
storage capacity is more than that of Japan's water-powered fuel cells, he said.</P>
      <P>The production cost of the chlorophyll organic battery is very cheap -- about
NT$1 to NT$2 (US$.03 to US$.06) , Liao said, adding that the battery contains no
toxic substances and will not pose an environmental hazard, even if discarded at
will.</P>
      <P>The professor disclosed that he is in the process of applying for patent in
Taiwan, the United States and other countries for the new invention and expects
to see mass production in the near future.</P>
      <P>Liao, 49, received a B.S. degree in nuclear engineering from National Tsing Hua
University in Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1982. He earned M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in
plasma science and fusion technology from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology of the United States in 1989 and 1992, respectively.</P>

      <P>A visiting Chinese tourism official said Wednesday that he believes larger
numbers of Chinese tourists will visit Taiwan when the conditions are right.</P>
      <P>Zhang Xiqin, China's National Tourism Administration deputy director who also
serves as head of the non-official Cross-Strait Tourism Association, said many
more Chinese sightseers would visit Taiwan once the current problems, such as
insufficient airplane seats and too few flight destinations between the two
sides, have been resolved.</P>
      <P>Zhang made the comments on arrival at Taoyuan International Airport in northern
Taiwan at the head of a delegation of more than 290 members who will attend the
2008 Taipei International Travel Fair from Oct. 31-Nov. 3.</P>
      <P>He also brushed aside concerns on Taiwan's part that a recent violent incident
involving a visiting Chinese scholar might deter Chinese tourists from coming to
the island, saying that it has only been three months since Taiwan opened its
doors wider to Chinese tourists, and that it will take time for things to
improve.</P>
      <P>Zhang, who is on his fifth visit to Taiwan, said that each time he is touched by
the Taiwan people's hospitality.</P>
      <P>He said his delegation's participation in the Taiwan travel fair is particularly
important this year because of the developments in cross-Taiwan Strait
exchanges.</P>
      <P>"It is important to take part in this year's Taipei International Travel Fair --
the first since Taiwan's wider opening in July to tourists from China -- because
it marks a genuine start to enhanced two-way tourism exchanges," he said.</P>
      <P>Apart from allowing  people  in Taiwan  to gain a better understanding of
China's tourism, Zhang said, the main goal this time around is to give Chinese
tourism operators a chance to acquire more in-depth knowledge of Taiwan and help
bring more Chinese tourists to the island.</P>
      <P>Zhang's trip to Taiwan comes a few days ahead of a visit by China's top cross-
strait liaison officer, Chen Yunlin, president of the quasi-official Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, who is slated to arrive Nov. 3 for a
five-day visit.</P>
      <P>Chen will hold talks with Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung

security cooperation, in a follow-up to their landmark meeting in Beijing in

Society, the orchids on display include the original species, the single-flower
type, the multiflora type and the standard type.</P>
      <P>The lady slipper orchids are also known in the United States as moccasin
flowers, because of their resemblance to a shoe or moccasin.</P>
      <P>The orchids are in the subfamily Cypripedioidea. They are so named because of
the flowers' slipper-shaped pouches. The pouch can trap insects in order to

      <P>Former Vice President Lien Chan's attendance at this year's Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Peru next month will symbolize significant
progress in relations across the Taiwan Strait, a diplomatic official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Henry Chen made the remarks after the
Presidential Office announced earlier in the day that Lien Chan has been chosen
to attend the 2008 APEC summit on behalf of President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Lien would be the highest-ranking former official of the Republic of China ever
to attend an APEC informal leadership meeting.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's opposition, ROC presidents have been barred from the annual
APEC summit and have been forced instead to name a proxy to attend.</P>
      <P>Noting that APEC is one of the most important multilateral international
organizations that Taiwan managed to join as a full member, Chen said Lien's
attendance at the forum's annual summit will mark a positive development in
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>With a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Chicago, Lien has rich
experience in international affairs. He held many important government posts,
including minister of foreign affairs, Taiwan governor and premier, before
serving as vice president from 1996 through 2000.</P>
      <P>Given his political stature, Lien is widely seen as the most appropriate person
to represent Ma at the annual APEC summit, which will take place in the Peruvian
capital of Lima Nov.22-23, Chen added.</P>
      <P>In 2005, Lien made an ice-breaking visit to Beijing in his capacity as chairman
of then-opposition Kuomintang, becoming the first opposition leader from Taiwan
to ever visit China.</P>
      <P>During that visit, he met with Chinese President Hu Jintao for wide-ranging
talks and laid the groundwork for the establishment of a dialogue platform for
the KMT and its former civil war enemy -- the Communist Party of China.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued after learning of Ma's decision to name him as his proxy
for the upcoming APEC summit, Lien said he will be honored to serve as the
president's surrogate at such an important international conference.</P>
      <P>At a time when the world is facing a credit crunch and economic turmoil, Lien
said, he will share his views and experiences with top leaders from APEC member
economies to tackle challenges and promote mutual cooperation.</P>
      <P>"I'll do whatever I can to fulfill my duty," he added in the statement.</P>

      <P>All agreements signed between the two quasi-official intermediary bodies across
the Taiwan Strait should be approved by the Legislative Yuan and any bilateral
dealings involving national sovereignty should be put to referendum, the
country's main opposition party said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) made the pitch in a five-point statement
issued just a few days before Nov. 3 when China's top negotiator with Taiwan,
Chen Yunlin, is scheduled to arrive in Taipei for a new round of talks with his
Taiwanese counterpart in his capacity as president of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>In its statement, the DPP also demanded that the arrangement for Chen's meeting
with Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung should follow
the protocol and practices usually observed in state-to-state conferences or
engagements,  in order to uphold Taiwan's sovereign status and dignity.</P>
      <P>Since the upcoming Chiang-Chen talks will take place within the framework of the

      <P>The National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in downtown Taipei attracted the most
visitors from at home and abroad in the period Jan.-Aug. this year, according to
statistics released Wednesday by the Department of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics under the Taipei City government.</P>
      <P>The hall, which was built in memory of the late President Chiang Kai-shek after
his death in 1975, was visited by an average of 16,000 people a day during the
eight-month period, the figures showed.</P>
      <P>The second most popular site was the National Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall,
which commemorates the founding father of the Republic of China, with an average
of 13,000 visitors a day, while the Taipei Zoo, with 9,000 daily visitors, was
in third place.</P>
      <P>However, the biggest attraction for foreign tourists was the night markets,
which drew 63 out of every 100 foreign visitors to Taiwan in the Jan-Aug period.
The National Palace Museum, which attracted 45 out of every 100 foreign tourists
to see its exquisite cultural treasures, was in second place among such
visitors.</P>
      <P>The third biggest attraction for visitors from overseas was the skyscraper
Taipei 101, with 39 out of every 100 foreign visitors going to see the landmark
building.</P>
      <P>Among the privately run sightseeing spots, the Taipei 101 observation deck was
the most popular, drawing around 3,000 visitors per day.</P>
      <P>As for historic sites and buildings, Lungshan Temple in Taipei's Wanhua District
was number one, attracting an average of 5,000 visitors daily during the eight-

      <P>A scientist in Taiwan has invented the world's first chlorophyll organic battery
that can supply electricity within 10 seconds of being wetted with water,
beverages or even urine.</P>
      <P>Chungpin Hovering Liao, a professor at the Graduate School of Electro-Optic and
Material Science of National Formosa University in central Taiwan's Yunlin
County, told a news conference Wednesday that the battery, when wetted, can
provide electricity for two days to a week.</P>
      <P>While the strength of the battery is about half that of an ordinary battery, its
storage capacity is more than that of Japan's water-powered fuel cells, he said.</P>
      <P>The production cost of the chlorophyll organic battery is very cheap -- about
NT$1 to NT$2 (US$.03 to US$.06) , Liao said, adding that the battery contains no
toxic substances and will not pose an environmental hazard, even if discarded at
will.</P>
      <P>The professor disclosed that he is in the process of applying for patent in
Taiwan, the United States and other countries for the new invention and expects
to see mass production in the near future.</P>
      <P>Liao, 49, received a B.S. degree in nuclear engineering from National Tsing Hua

      <P>A visiting Chinese tourism official said Wednesday that he believes larger
numbers of Chinese tourists will visit Taiwan when the conditions are right.</P>
      <P>Zhang Xiqin, China's National Tourism Administration deputy director who also
serves as head of the non-official Cross-Strait Tourism Association, said many
more Chinese sightseers would visit Taiwan once the current problems, such as
insufficient airplane seats and too few flight destinations between the two
sides, have been resolved.</P>
      <P>Zhang made the comments on arrival at Taoyuan International Airport in northern
Taiwan at the head of a delegation of more than 290 members who will attend the
2008 Taipei International Travel Fair from Oct. 31-Nov. 3.</P>
      <P>He also brushed aside concerns on Taiwan's part that a recent violent incident
involving a visiting Chinese scholar might deter Chinese tourists from coming to
the island, saying that it has only been three months since Taiwan opened its
doors wider to Chinese tourists, and that it will take time for things to
improve.</P>
      <P>Zhang, who is on his fifth visit to Taiwan, said that each time he is touched by
the Taiwan people's hospitality.</P>
      <P>He said his delegation's participation in the Taiwan travel fair is particularly
important this year because of the developments in cross-Taiwan Strait
exchanges.</P>
      <P>"It is important to take part in this year's Taipei International Travel Fair --
the first since Taiwan's wider opening in July to tourists from China -- because
it marks a genuine start to enhanced two-way tourism exchanges," he said.</P>
      <P>Apart from allowing  people  in Taiwan  to gain a better understanding of
China's tourism, Zhang said, the main goal this time around is to give Chinese
tourism operators a chance to acquire more in-depth knowledge of Taiwan and help
bring more Chinese tourists to the island.</P>
      <P>Zhang's trip to Taiwan comes a few days ahead of a visit by China's top cross-
strait liaison officer, Chen Yunlin, president of the quasi-official Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, who is slated to arrive Nov. 3 for a
five-day visit.</P>
      <P>Chen will hold talks with Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung
on travel and tourism exchanges between Taiwan and China as well as food
security cooperation, in a follow-up to their landmark meeting in Beijing in
June.</P>

      <P>An exhibition of Paphiopedilum orchids -- better known as Lady's Slipper Orchids
-- opened Wednesday at the Taipei Botanical Garden and will run until Nov. 23.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, jointly sponsored by the National Museum of Natural Sciences and
the Taiwan Paphiopedilum Society, is putting more than 190 pots of Lady's
Slipper Orchids on display, including many that have won awards in various
competitions.</P>
      <P>According to Kao Chi-ching, general-secretary of the Taiwan Paphiopedilum
Society, the orchids on display include the original species, the single-flower
type, the multiflora type and the standard type.</P>
      <P>The lady slipper orchids are also known in the United States as moccasin
flowers, because of their resemblance to a shoe or moccasin.</P>
      <P>The orchids are in the subfamily Cypripedioidea. They are so named because of
the flowers' slipper-shaped pouches. The pouch can trap insects in order to
force them to climb up past the staminode, behind which they collect or deposit
pollinia.</P>
      <P>Lady's Slipper orchids originated in the tropical and subtropical forests  of
Southeast  Asia,  including  southern  China,  but over-collecting has caused
the flowers to become rare and endangered in their original habitats.</P>

      <P>Former Vice President Lien Chan's attendance at this year's Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Peru next month will symbolize significant
progress in relations across the Taiwan Strait, a diplomatic official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Henry Chen made the remarks after the
Presidential Office announced earlier in the day that Lien Chan has been chosen
to attend the 2008 APEC summit on behalf of President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Lien would be the highest-ranking former official of the Republic of China ever
to attend an APEC informal leadership meeting.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's opposition, ROC presidents have been barred from the annual
APEC summit and have been forced instead to name a proxy to attend.</P>
      <P>Noting that APEC is one of the most important multilateral international
organizations that Taiwan managed to join as a full member, Chen said Lien's
attendance at the forum's annual summit will mark a positive development in
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>With a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Chicago, Lien has rich
experience in international affairs. He held many important government posts,
including minister of foreign affairs, Taiwan governor and premier, before
serving as vice president from 1996 through 2000.</P>
      <P>Given his political stature, Lien is widely seen as the most appropriate person
to represent Ma at the annual APEC summit, which will take place in the Peruvian
capital of Lima Nov.22-23, Chen added.</P>
      <P>In 2005, Lien made an ice-breaking visit to Beijing in his capacity as chairman
of then-opposition Kuomintang, becoming the first opposition leader from Taiwan
to ever visit China.</P>
      <P>During that visit, he met with Chinese President Hu Jintao for wide-ranging
talks and laid the groundwork for the establishment of a dialogue platform for
the KMT and its former civil war enemy -- the Communist Party of China.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued after learning of Ma's decision to name him as his proxy
for the upcoming APEC summit, Lien said he will be honored to serve as the
president's surrogate at such an important international conference.</P>
      <P>At a time when the world is facing a credit crunch and economic turmoil, Lien
said, he will share his views and experiences with top leaders from APEC member
economies to tackle challenges and promote mutual cooperation.</P>
      <P>"I'll do whatever I can to fulfill my duty," he added in the statement.</P>

      <P>All agreements signed between the two quasi-official intermediary bodies across
the Taiwan Strait should be approved by the Legislative Yuan and any bilateral
dealings involving national sovereignty should be put to referendum, the
country's main opposition party said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) made the pitch in a five-point statement
issued just a few days before Nov. 3 when China's top negotiator with Taiwan,
Chen Yunlin, is scheduled to arrive in Taipei for a new round of talks with his
Taiwanese counterpart in his capacity as president of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>In its statement, the DPP also demanded that the arrangement for Chen's meeting
with Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung should follow
the protocol and practices usually observed in state-to-state conferences or
engagements,  in order to uphold Taiwan's sovereign status and dignity.</P>
      <P>Since the upcoming Chiang-Chen talks will take place within the framework of the
institutionalized SEF-ARATS engagement mechanism, the statement said, Chen would
be the People's Republic of China's representative who should not engage in any
political activities other than talks with SEF officials during his stay and his

      <P>The Central Bank of the Republic of China further lowered Taiwan's key interest
rates by 0.25 basis points Thursday in an emergency measure to boost the
country's economy that has shown signals of a recession.</P>
      <P>The latest reduction -- the second of its kind this month -- marked the discount
rate down further to 3 percent, the rate on accommodations with collateral to
3.375 percent and the rate on accommodations without collateral to 5.25 percent.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank said in a statement that while inflationary pressure has eased
following the fall in global oil and commodity prices, the risk of an economic
downturn is escalating due to sluggish business activities.</P>
      <P>The situation is reflected in Taiwan's unsatisfactory performance in terms of
exports,  industrial production,  consumption  and employment over the past few
months, the Central Bank said.</P>
      <P>According to a report released Monday by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development,  Taiwan's leading economic indicators flashed a blue light for
September, a sign that the economy is heading toward recession, after signaling
a slowdown a month earlier with a yellow-blue light.</P>
      <P>It was the second blue light to appear this year after the first one in July.</P>

      <P>A visiting Chinese tourism official said Wednesday that he believes larger
numbers of Chinese tourists will visit Taiwan when the conditions are right.</P>
      <P>Zhang Xiqin, China's National Tourism Administration deputy director who also
serves as head of the non-official Cross-Strait Tourism Association, said many
more Chinese sightseers would visit Taiwan once the current problems, such as
insufficient airplane seats and too few flight destinations between the two
sides, have been resolved.</P>
      <P>Zhang made the comments on arrival at Taoyuan International Airport in northern
Taiwan at the head of a delegation of more than 290 members who will attend the
2008 Taipei International Travel Fair from Oct. 31-Nov. 3.</P>
      <P>He also brushed aside concerns on Taiwan's part that a recent violent incident
involving a visiting Chinese scholar might deter Chinese tourists from coming to
the island, saying that it has only been three months since Taiwan opened its
doors wider to Chinese tourists, and that it will take time for things to
improve.</P>
      <P>Zhang, who is on his fifth visit to Taiwan, said that each time he is touched by
the Taiwan people's hospitality.</P>
      <P>He said his delegation's participation in the Taiwan travel fair is particularly
important this year because of the developments in cross-Taiwan Strait
exchanges.</P>
      <P>"It is important to take part in this year's Taipei International Travel Fair --
the first since Taiwan's wider opening in July to tourists from China -- because
it marks a genuine start to enhanced two-way tourism exchanges," he said.</P>
      <P>Apart from allowing  people  in Taiwan  to gain a better understanding of
China's tourism, Zhang said, the main goal this time around is to give Chinese
tourism operators a chance to acquire more in-depth knowledge of Taiwan and help
bring more Chinese tourists to the island.</P>
      <P>Zhang's trip to Taiwan comes a few days ahead of a visit by China's top cross-
strait liaison officer, Chen Yunlin, president of the quasi-official Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, who is slated to arrive Nov. 3 for a
five-day visit.</P>
      <P>Chen will hold talks with Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung
on travel and tourism exchanges between Taiwan and China as well as food
security cooperation, in a follow-up to their landmark meeting in Beijing in
June.</P>

      <P>An exhibition of Paphiopedilum orchids -- better known as Lady's Slipper Orchids
-- opened Wednesday at the Taipei Botanical Garden and will run until Nov. 23.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, jointly sponsored by the National Museum of Natural Sciences and
the Taiwan Paphiopedilum Society, is putting more than 190 pots of Lady's
Slipper Orchids on display, including many that have won awards in various
competitions.</P>
      <P>According to Kao Chi-ching, general-secretary of the Taiwan Paphiopedilum
Society, the orchids on display include the original species, the single-flower
type, the multiflora type and the standard type.</P>
      <P>The lady slipper orchids are also known in the United States as moccasin
flowers, because of their resemblance to a shoe or moccasin.</P>
      <P>The orchids are in the subfamily Cypripedioidea. They are so named because of
the flowers' slipper-shaped pouches. The pouch can trap insects in order to
force them to climb up past the staminode, behind which they collect or deposit
pollinia.</P>
      <P>Lady's Slipper orchids originated in the tropical and subtropical forests  of
Southeast  Asia,  including  southern  China,  but over-collecting has caused
the flowers to become rare and endangered in their original habitats.</P>

      <P>Former Vice President Lien Chan's attendance at this year's Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Peru next month will symbolize significant
progress in relations across the Taiwan Strait, a diplomatic official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Henry Chen made the remarks after the
Presidential Office announced earlier in the day that Lien Chan has been chosen
to attend the 2008 APEC summit on behalf of President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Lien would be the highest-ranking former official of the Republic of China ever
to attend an APEC informal leadership meeting.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's opposition, ROC presidents have been barred from the annual
APEC summit and have been forced instead to name a proxy to attend.</P>
      <P>Noting that APEC is one of the most important multilateral international
organizations that Taiwan managed to join as a full member, Chen said Lien's
attendance at the forum's annual summit will mark a positive development in
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>With a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Chicago, Lien has rich
experience in international affairs. He held many important government posts,
including minister of foreign affairs, Taiwan governor and premier, before
serving as vice president from 1996 through 2000.</P>
      <P>Given his political stature, Lien is widely seen as the most appropriate person
to represent Ma at the annual APEC summit, which will take place in the Peruvian
capital of Lima Nov.22-23, Chen added.</P>
      <P>In 2005, Lien made an ice-breaking visit to Beijing in his capacity as chairman
of then-opposition Kuomintang, becoming the first opposition leader from Taiwan
to ever visit China.</P>
      <P>During that visit, he met with Chinese President Hu Jintao for wide-ranging
talks and laid the groundwork for the establishment of a dialogue platform for
the KMT and its former civil war enemy -- the Communist Party of China.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued after learning of Ma's decision to name him as his proxy
for the upcoming APEC summit, Lien said he will be honored to serve as the
president's surrogate at such an important international conference.</P>
      <P>At a time when the world is facing a credit crunch and economic turmoil, Lien
said, he will share his views and experiences with top leaders from APEC member
economies to tackle challenges and promote mutual cooperation.</P>
      <P>"I'll do whatever I can to fulfill my duty," he added in the statement.</P>

      <P>All agreements signed between the two quasi-official intermediary bodies across
the Taiwan Strait should be approved by the Legislative Yuan and any bilateral
dealings involving national sovereignty should be put to referendum, the
country's main opposition party said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) made the pitch in a five-point statement
issued just a few days before Nov. 3 when China's top negotiator with Taiwan,
Chen Yunlin, is scheduled to arrive in Taipei for a new round of talks with his
Taiwanese counterpart in his capacity as president of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>In its statement, the DPP also demanded that the arrangement for Chen's meeting
with Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung should follow
the protocol and practices usually observed in state-to-state conferences or
engagements,  in order to uphold Taiwan's sovereign status and dignity.</P>
      <P>Since the upcoming Chiang-Chen talks will take place within the framework of the
institutionalized SEF-ARATS engagement mechanism, the statement said, Chen would
be the People's Republic of China's representative who should not engage in any
political activities other than talks with SEF officials during his stay and his
itinerary should be kept open and subject to popular and media supervision.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the statement urged President Ma Ying-jeou to reiterate that Taiwan's
future is up to the decision of its 23 million people.</P>
      <P>The statement also demanded that Ma ask Chen during their meeting in Taipei to
push the Chinese government to apologize to the people of Taiwan for its
military threat and diplomatic suppression against Taiwan over the past decades
and to promise to dismantle its missiles targeting at Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Financial officials from Taiwan and China will meet for the first time in Taipei
next week to discuss various cross-Taiwan Strait financial issues, including the
signing of a memorandum of understanding for cooperation on financial regulation
and supervision, officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>After the discussion, officials from the two sides are expected to meet again in
China by the end of the year to speed up the signing of the agreement, said the
officials from the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC).</P>
      <P>The upcoming meeting will also touch on the possible relaxation of  investment
restrictions  on  Chinese  qualified  domestic institutional investors (QDII) in
Taiwan and the issue of allowing financial institutions on both sides to set up
branches in each other's territories, the FSC officials said.</P>
      <P>According to Fu Don-cheng, a vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council,
participants in the meeting will include the heads of several Chinese financial
institutions and Chinese officials in charge of the regulation and supervision
of banking, insurance and securities operations.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet decided in July to allow QDII from China to invest in Taiwan's stock
market. However, without an MOU with China, the policy would only be able to
attract a maximum 3 percent of Chinese QDII, which would represent a combined
investment of NT$33.8 billion.</P>
      <P>Also, the government hopes that the offices opened by seven Taiwanese banks in
China could be upgraded to bank branches.</P>
      <P>The financial talks will take place on the sidelines  of negotiations between
the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , the two quasi-
official intermediary bodies representing the respective governments in dealing
with cross-strait affairs in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>The highlight of the upcoming negotiations, to be headed by SEF Chairman Chiang
Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen Yunlin, will be the possible signing of
agreements on cross-strait air services, shipping links, mail services and food
safety.</P>
      <P>Fu noted that the planned agreement on air services will cover the opening of
more direct cross-strait air routes, extension of the weekend charter flight
services to every day of the week, and the launch of cargo charter flight
services.</P>
      <P>As far as the air route issue is concerned, the two sides are expected to
finalize a new route that would allow the cross-strait charter flights to skip a
detour through Hong Kong's or Macau's air space, as they are currently required
to do, Fu said.</P>

      <P>MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan made the disclosure in a briefing at the

      <P>As far as the current plan goes, in the first two days, Chen will focus largely
on the meetings and negotiations with the SEF, Lai stressed.</P>
      <P>However, "when the signing of the agreements is completed, arrangements will be

priority to "the country's sovereignty, Taiwan's dignity and the people's

      <P>Concerned that the negotiations could lead to a compromise of Taiwan's

      <P>Prosecutors are seeking a 14-month jail sentence for Tainan City Councilor Wang

      <P>Seven suspects, including Wang of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party

      <P>Wang allegedly mobilized the protesters who later mobbed the Chinese official,
and was charged by prosecutors with hindering personal freedom, assault and
eroding public order.</P>
      <P>The Tainan Prosecutors Office made the announcement after it concluded the

office the day before by the Tainan city police.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Thursday he will meet with China's top negotiator
on Taiwan to discuss the issue of pandas during the latter's upcoming visit to
the island next week.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Taipei City Council meeting on food safety management and
investment in businesses, Hau said he will meet with Chen Yunlin, president of
Beijing's quasi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits,
for a brief discussion during Chen's visit from Nov. 3-7.</P>
      <P>"We'll meet mainly for talks on the two giant pandas that China has promised as
gifts to Taiwan -- known as 'Tuan Tuan' and 'Yuan Yuan,'" Hau noted.</P>
      <P>Taipei city and several other cities in Taiwan have competed to host the two
giant pandas, which China wants to loan to Taiwan. Hau and Taipei city
government officials even paid a visit to Shanghai in June to forge  a pact on
exchanges  related  to rare animal conservation,  including swapping animals as
gifts and sharing know-how in animal raising and reproduction.</P>
      <P>Chen has said that he will not bring pandas with him in his upcoming visit to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lien Sheng-wen, a member of the ruling Kuomintang's policy-making
Central Standing Committee, who doubles as chairman of the Taipei EasyCard
Corp., said at the Taipei City Council meeting that he has no idea whether Chen
will take time during his visit in Taipei to ride Taipei's subway system, the
MRT.</P>
      <P>"As far as I know, the usage of EasyCard or similar electronic ticketing systems
are much wider in China than in Taiwan," Lien said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hau said that it's not against the law for people who plan to
demonstrate during Chen's visit to wear whatever they like, including clothes
made of the national flag.</P>
      <P>"However, the demonstrators will be dealt with in accordance with the law if
their behavior violates the Assembly and Parade Law, " Hau said.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which believes Chen's visit to
Taiwan and talks with his Taiwanese counterpart, chairman Chiang Pin-kung of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , will lead to the erosion of Taiwan's
sovereignty, plans to hold various demonstrations during Chen's visit, including
a sit-in outside the Grand Hotel, where Chen is expected to stay.</P>

      <P>Several bakeries filed a lawsuit Wednesday against New Tai Milk Products Co.,
seeking compensation for the financial losses they suffered as a result of the
company's import and sale of melamine-contaminated milk powder from China.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the bakeries, accompanied by Taiwan Solidarity Union
Secretary-General Lin Jhi-jia, filed a civil lawsuit with the Taipei District
Court in the first legal action ever brought by local bakeries against the
importer of dairy products.</P>
      <P>One of the bakery representatives, Ho Kuan-ching, said that since the melamine
scandal surfaced more than a month ago, there has been no goodwill action from
the Taoyuan County-based New Tai -- the Taiwan subsidiary of the New Zealand
dairy giant Fonterra.</P>
      <P>New Tai is known to have imported 25 tons of the melamine-tainted milk powder
from China's Sanlu Group, one of that country's largest manufacturers of dairy
products.</P>
      <P>New Tai has made no move to compensate local bakeries for their losses, except
to say that the Sanlu Group should be held accountable for the melamine
incident, according to Ho.</P>
      <P>Ho said that it was beyond her understanding why New Tai had not sought
compensation from Sanlu. The lawsuit by the bakeries was filed with the purpose
of pressing the Taiwanese  importer to seek compensation from the Chinese
manufacturer, she added.</P>
      <P>She said the bakeries are seeking compensation for financial losses incurred
over a period of more than one month. However, New Tai offered to pay only
NT$50,000 in compensation to each of the bakeries, an amount that Ho said is
unacceptable because it does not even cover operating costs for a single day.</P>
      <P>The maximum financial losses suffered by each bakery over the period probably
exceeds NT$500,000, Ho estimated,  adding that numerous bakeries have fallen
victim to the scandal.</P>
      <P>She also said that although the government plans to provide subsidies to
bakeries with a business turnover of less than NT$5 million, those that qualify
for the subsidy have yet to be informed of their eligibility and those with a
turnover of more than NT$5 million have complained that their right to
compensation was ignored.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the lawsuit was a last resort, as the bakeries had no other
options. He also urged the government to formulate and adopt compensation or
indemnity measures in order to help the affected bakeries tide over their
financial woes.</P>
      <P>The government, as the gatekeeper of food imports, was partly to blame for the
toxic milk scandal,  and should grant national compensation to businesses that
suffered losses as result of the incident, he urged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan horseshoe crab population decreasing: survey</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 30 (CNA)
10/30/08  17:37:15
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The population of horseshoe crabs in Kinmen -- Taiwan's only remaining habitat
for both baby and adult horseshoe crabs -- has been on the decline since 2003,
indicating that human activities have been gradually threatening the existence
of the species, biologists reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The other habitat -- on the outlying Penghu islands -- will host only adult
horseshoe crabs, according to the marine biologists who have surveyed the
species for years.</P>
      <P>They urged the government to take swift action to conserve the ancient species,
as its habitats in Taiwan have all been destroyed due to over-exploitation years
ago.</P>
      <P>The species is found in Taiwan on the outlying islands of Kinmen, which lies
closer to China's southeast coast than to Taiwan proper, and on the Penghu
archipelago in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The horseshoe crab is sometimes nicknamed the "living fossil" because the
species has existed on Earth for some 400 million years and has remained in its
present form for 200 million years. Although it called a crab, the arthropod is
more closely related to its land-based counterparts, such as spiders and
scorpions.</P>
      <P>Even though the species is not listed as endangered, its numbers in North
America, Europe, Japan, and Taiwan have been significantly reduced in recent
years. Part of the reason is that medical researchers have found valuable
substances in the blood of horseshoe crabs, which can be used to develop new
drugs.</P>
      <P>Chen  Chang-po,  a research  fellow  of Academia  Sinica's Biodiversity Center,
said that following the destruction of the habitats in the main Taiwan area, he
and other biologists helped to organize surveys to monitor the remaining
horseshoe crab habitats in Penghu and Kinmen.</P>
      <P>In the surveys, they found that baby horseshoe crabs will only appear at the
intertidal zones along the coastline of the Kinmen islets, while adult horseshoe
crabs will frequent both Penghu and Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The facts suggested that, were the Kinmen habitats to be threatened, the entire
population of horseshoe crabs would be in great danger because of the loss of an
important breeding ground, said Chen.</P>
      <P>Based on surveys conducted between 2003 to 2007, the population of baby
horseshoe crabs in Kinmen has decreased, Chen said, adding that this indicated
the need for government intervention to better preserve the species.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)  on Thursday held a mock
debate featuring local university students on the upcoming U.S. presidential
election, to encourage Taiwanese people to have a better understanding of the
issues and process of the election.</P>
      <P>This debate is being held to encourage a better understanding of the U.S. and
the issues, Scott Robinson, director of the AITs American Culture Center, said
at the event.</P>
      <P>This is really intended as an educational exercise to stimulate debates about
U.S. issues rather than advocate for or against a particular candidate,Robinson
added.</P>
      <P>In addition to students from National Chengchi University (NCCU) debating as
Team Obama and National Tsinghua University (NTHU) as Team McCain, participants
included panelists at the debate Stacey Tsai, AIT Public Affairs Officer; Ming
Lee, professor of the NCCUs Department of Diplomacy; and Yen Chen-shen,
professor of the NTHU s Department of General Studies.</P>
      <P>The debaters challenged each other on various of issues, such as the economy,
foreign policy and U.S. domestic policy in the 90-minute competition. The
audience was then asked to cast a virtual ballot for the team with the better
performance.</P>
      <P>Despite  that the performance  between  the two teams was neck-to-neck, Team
Obama won by a small margin of votes and left the event with a NT$ 10,000 (US$
305) check.</P>
      <P>Commenting on their performance, Robinson lauded the students knowledge about
U.S. elections and said that he was really impressed by their performance in the
debate, especially in the wildcard question part where each team confronted each
other back and forth.</P>
      <P>I think they were well-prepared. Considering none of them is a native speaker,
but they talked about tough policies. I think its pretty amazing,he said.</P>
      <P>Chang Su-hau, who is in his fifth year at the NCCUs Department of Diplomacy,
said he enjoyed the process from the beginning to the end because he likes
challenges and enjoys speaking to the public.</P>
      <P>What I learned from the debate is that it takes a lot of effort and confidence
to speak in public about your ideas, Chang said, adding thatit is not easy to be
a politician and try to persuade somebody who doesnt believe that much in you.</P>
      <P>The aspiring  diplomat  from the winning  team who speaks native-speaker-like
English said that although he has never lived in a foreign country for more than
a year, he tried to talk to the audience in a charismatic way and with fluency.</P>
      <P>Yvonne Tyan, a senior from NTHUs Department of General Studies, said that even
though her team lost the debate, they did their best and it was a great learning
experience.</P>
      <P>I think its fun. We can learn a lot from their attitude and experience. Its an
awesome experience,she said.</P>
      <P>Computer-science major Stanley Ho, a sophomore from the NTHU representing John
McCain, said that he thinks McCain, if elected as the next U.S. president, will
be more supportive of Taiwan against China. However, Ho said that he is a
supporter of Barack Obama because the world needs a new face and change.</P>
      <P>The AIT functions as a de facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic relations between Taipei and Washington.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1.63 million have received free flu shots under inoculation program</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 1.63 million Taiwanese people have received free flu shots this month under
an annual government-funded flu inoculation program targeting vulnerable groups,
an official of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of
Health said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The target of this year's program, which began on Oct. 1, includes senior
citizens aged 65 and older, residents and workers of nursing homes, children
between the ages of six months and three years, and first through fourth graders
at elementary schools.</P>
      <P>Also targeted are patients suffering from rare diseases, serious illnesses or
injuries, disease prevention and control personnel at medical and health care
institutions, workers in the poultry and livestock industries, and animal
disease control and prevention personnel.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Lin Ting said Thursday that it is estimated that at
least 3 million people are entitled to receive the flu shots.</P>
      <P>Since the launch of the program, the inoculation rate was the highest among
members of the disease prevention and control personnel at medical and health
institutions at 67 percent.</P>
      <P>In comprison, only 41 percent of elderly citizens and those with serious
diseases or injuries have received flu shots.</P>
      <P>Flu outbreaks normally peak in late November and gradually tail off after the
Lunar New Year holiday, which usually falls in February.</P>
      <P>As it takes around two weeks for the vaccine to produce an immunity, Lin advised
people to get vaccinated before the end of October.</P>
      <P>Lin said the CDC has purchased 3.2 million doses of flu vaccine to meet this
year's demand.</P>
      <P>If there are doses left over by Nov. 30 when the program expires, they will be
available to other citizens from Dec. 1, he noted.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou purchased a shipment of daily necessities online and had
them delivered by express service to disadvantaged children, in a show of
support for a charity drive launched Wednesday by the Taiwan Fund for Children
and Families, according to the fund's Chief Executive Officer Wang Ming-jen.</P>
      <P>The drive was initiated by PChome Online, one of the nation's leading Internet
portals, in cooperation with the children's fund and the home delivery service
President Transnet.</P>
      <P>Under the program, all the basic necessities required by the fund's 22 centers
around the country are available on PChome's Web site, which allows the public
to purchase and donate basic items to those in need.</P>
      <P>All purchased items will be delivered within 24 hours to designated centers,
and the centers will swiftly deliver the donations to disadvantaged children,
Wang said.</P>
      <P>The drive was launched with Ma's order that included toothpaste, toothbrushes,
shower gel, rice, toilet paper and facial tissues, all of which were to be
delivered to the fund's centers within one day.</P>
      <P>Wang said most of children receiving aid from the fund are from poor families
and they are reliant on charity for their livelihood and education until they
can become independent.</P>
      <P>Wang expressed the hope that the charity drive will help to alleviate the dire
financial situation of disadvantaged families, which has been exacerbated by
rising consumer prices.</P>
      <P>The fund currently provides aid to about 40,000 children in Taiwan and nearly
36,000 in foreign countries, and has helped 170,944 people come off the poverty
line and live independently.</P>
      <P>Vincent Hsieh, PChome's chief operating officer, said he is proud of the Web
portal's staff who initiated the online charity drive -- the first of its kind
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang Chien-li, general manager of President Transnet, said his company is
committed to participating in the drive and will guarantee delivery of all
donations to the fund's centers, no matter how difficult the route.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that delivery will be free during the first month of the charity
drive.</P>

    <HEADLINE>More convenient transport links to keep businessmen at home</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  30  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>More convenient cross-Taiwan Strait transport  links will encourage Taiwanese
business owners with operations in China keep their operational bases and homes
in Taiwan, Minister of Transportation and Communications Mao Chi-kuo said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Mao said if cross-strait charter flight services were more convenient -- with
added numbers of flights and destinations -- the impact would not only be
economical.</P>
      <P>"It would also have a positive influence on social development across the
strait, leading more Taiwanese business owners to become more willing to keep
their roots at home in Taiwan," Mao said.</P>
      <P>China is Taiwan's number one destination for foreign direct investment and
around 1 million Taiwanese business people and their families are believed to be
living in mainland China, mostly in coastal cities such as Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Before weekend cross-strait charter flights were launched on July 4 this year,
the only non-stop flights available were on a handful of holidays each year,
making it necessary for Taiwanese investors to move to the mainland.</P>
      <P>The weekend flight services were launched following an agreement signed by
Taiwan and China's top negotiators -- Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's
quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Chen Yunlin, president of
China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS),
respectively.</P>
      <P>The agreements  were  signed  in mid-June  after  the two quasi-official
intermediary bodies in charge of negotiations in the absence  of formal
government-to-government  relations  resumed top-level cross-strait dialogues
which were suspended in 1999.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to arrive in Taiwan on Nov. 3 for a five-day visit as a
reciprocal gesture for Chiang's visit to Beijing in June.</P>
      <P>During the planned  meeting in Taipei,  Chiang,  Chen and representatives from
the two sides are expected to cover issues such as opening new air routes and
more destinations across the Taiwan Strait,  extending direct weekend charter
flights to weekdays, establishing  direct shipping links and postal exchanges,
and developing a framework to deal with food safety issues. Agreement on these
issues are also expected to be signed.</P>
      <P>Although regular weekend flights have been launched, some believe the flights
are not frequent enough and are inconvenient because they must pass through Hong
Kong airspace, due to security concerns, before heading to their final
destinations.</P>
      <P>The number of routes are also not considered sufficient.</P>
      <P>Mao quoted the results of a recent poll conducted by the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications as indicating that about 45 percent of China-
based Taiwanese business owners would choose to live in Taiwan if the weekend
cross-strait charter services, currently operated between Friday and Monday,
were extended to every day of the week.</P>
      <P>In comparison, Mao said, only 3 percent of the Taiwanese business owners said
they would move their business operation nerve centers from Taiwan to China if
there were more convenient cross-strait transport links, which would enable them
and their families to remain in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mao said, if direct shipping links, which still do not exist at
present, are opened in the near future, time for a one-way trip by ship from
Taiwan to the Chinese mainland will be reduced by one to four days -- a prospect
that would make Taiwan's agricultural exports to China more competitive, by
shortening delivery time and ensuring freshness.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP criticizes indictment of councilor for harassing Beijing official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) accused Tainan prosecutors
Thursday of staging a show to appease China, prior to a visit by a key figure
from Beijing, with the indictment of a city councilor on charges of harassing a
visiting Chinese official last week.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang made the charge at the party's headquarters in
Taipei after Tainan prosecutors announced earlier the same day that they would
seek a sentence of 14 months in jail for Tainan City Councilor Wang Ting-yu of
the DPP for harassing Zhang Mingqing -- vice president of China's Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) -- in public last week.</P>
      <P>Zhang fell to the ground as he was being besieged and jostled by a group of
anti-China protesters, allegedly mobilized by Wang, while Zhang was touring
Tainan City's Confucius Temple on Oct. 21 in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors  charged Wang with assault,  hindering personal freedom and eroding
public order. A total of seven people, including Wang, were indicted in the
case, which was transferred by the Tainan city police to Tainan prosecutors
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cheng criticized the prosecutors' swift indictment, saying that the "speedy"
handling of the case was to "appease" China ahead of an imminent visit by ARATS
President Chen Yunlin -- China's top negotiator with Taiwan -- from Nov. 3-7.</P>
      <P>"Political considerations might be behind the swift indictment, " Cheng alleged.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors are also seeking an eight-month jail term for a protester,
identified by the surname Lin, who jumped onto the hood of Zhang's car and
stamped on it as Zhang was being escorted away from the site by a local official
and a tour guide.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued later Thursday, the Tainan Prosecutors Office rejected the
DPP's accusation and stressed that the indictment was not politically motivated
and that there was no interference in the case by any superior official or
government agency.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors were able to quickly wrap up the investigation into the case because
of the solid evidence available, the Tainan Prosecutors Office said.</P>

      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said that the apology by
China's top negotiator Chen Yunlin over imported melamine-tainted products
Thursday will help smooth the way for Chen's upcoming visit here, but Chiang
insisted that Taiwan still wants to be compensated for economic losses suffered.</P>
      <P>"The mainland's  top negotiator  Chen Yunlin  has publicly apologized to
Taiwan's people for the tainted milk incident. I welcome it because it will help
the upcoming Chiang-Chen meeting in Taipei," Chiang told reporters at a news
conference.</P>
      <P>Chen, president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, said
this morning in Beijing during a press conference that the tainted milk incident
is a huge breach of food safety. It has caused great harm to the health of the
people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, he said.</P>
      <P>"I feel very sad. I am hereby apologizing to the people in Taiwan," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Having heard Chen's open apology, Chiang responded: "Taiwan's people not only
require an apology. We demand compensation as well. However, Chen's apology will
help to smooth the process for the upcoming Chiang-Chen meeting."</P>
      <P>On Monday, ARATS had faxed a formal letter of apology to SEF over the issue.</P>
      <P>"What is important in the future is that both sides of the strait have  to work
together  to prevent  similar  incidents  from re-occurring, " Chiang said,
pointing out that measures that will allow a quick response between mainland
China and Taiwan need to be established.</P>
      <P>Chen also told the news conference that he is disappointed that he will not be
able to visit Chiayi County in central Taiwan to see the famous mountain
Alishan.</P>
      <P>Chen's itinerary had originally included a trip to Chiayi County but due to the
fact that earlier on Oct. 21, ARATS deputy president Zhang Mingqing was mobbed
by protestors in Tainan City in southern Taiwan, Chen's visits to central and
southern Taiwan were canceled.</P>
      <P>"He is expressing his true emotions. He is a hearty man, like most people from
northeastern mainland China", said Chiang. "I am sure that as long as both sides
of the Taiwan Strait could just sit down and talk, we could actually work out
many problems, " Chiang added.</P>
      <P>Chen will be the highest ranking mainland Chinese official to set foot on Taiwan
since the two sides split at the end of a civil war in 1949.</P>
      <P>The upcoming meeting will be the second meeting between Chiang and Chen since
their first meeting in Beijing in June of 2007.</P>
      <P>The purpose of Chen's visit to Taiwan is to sign landmark agreements,  including
on expanding direct chartered  flights, launching shipping and postal links as
well as setting up a mechanism to deal with food safety issues between Taiwan
and mainland China.</P>

      <P>Rhythmic gymnastics was the first of five gymnastics events in the 12-day warm-

      <P>Participants in a cross-Taiwan Strait academic  forum on conservation  of
fishery  resources  called unanimously Thursday for the establishment of a
mechanism to resolve cross-strait  fishery disputes and provide relief to
fishermen operating in the strait.</P>
      <P>Forum attendees, including academics from National Taiwan Ocean University
(NTOU) , researchers from the Fujian Marine Research Institute and from the
Kinmen Fisheries Research Institute, also called for closer fishery cooperation
between Taiwan and China so that sustainable fishery resources in the strait can
be maintained.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the forum, Liao Cheng-hsin, director of the NTOU's Department of
Environmental Biology and Fisheries Science, said the fishery sectors from both
sides already maintain very close ties because they share the Taiwan Strait as
their major fishing ground.</P>
      <P>Because of these close ties, Liao said, a mechanism for fishery disputes across
the strait and the protection of fishermen from both sides should be established
in order for development to continue.</P>
      <P>Huang Shifong,  chairman of the Fujian Deep Sea Fisheries Association, suggested
that the fishery sectors from the two sides should cooperate more closely and
should build a common fishery management body so that they can learn from and
complement each other.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng pointed out in his opening address that Taiwan
and China are separated only by a narrow strait, and said this makes both
countries responsible  for conserving  fishery resources in the strait and
protecting the maritime environment.</P>
      <P>"Nothing constructive will be achieved if the efforts are made by one side
only," Lee said.</P>

      <P>A makeshift factory that specialized in counterfeiting NT$50 (US$1.53) coins for
the past 10 years has been discovered and manufacturing stopped in the southern
county of Kaohsiung, with its owner arrested, police announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The 61-year-old owner, identified only by his family name Lin, told police he
had been producing the fake NT$50 coins for a decade, injecting more that
500,000 fake coins, with a total face value of over NT$20 million, into the
local market.</P>
      <P>Acting on a tip-off, a law enforcement team of officers from the Criminal
Investigation Bureau (CIB) and police bureaus in Kaohsiung City, Kaohsiung
County and neighboring Tainan County, raided the factory in Kaohsiung County's
Luchu township Wednesday and seized its owner and a large number of finished and
unfinished fake NT$50 coins, as well as counterfeiting machines and other
equipment.</P>
      <P>According to a CIB spokesman, Lin sold the fake coins to downstream accomplices
who then laundered the money through retail market channels, night markets,
convenience stores and automatic vending machines.</P>
      <P>As the amounts were not large and no coin verification machines are available on
the local market, the operation was not detected until recently, the police
said.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese gymnast Yu Pei-lung, who won two bronze medals at the 2009 World Games
Pre-event Series, said Wednesday that she hopes the experience gained in the
warm-up event will better prepare her for next July's World Games.</P>
      <P>The two bronze medals that Yu won for her Chinese Taipei team were in the hoop
event Tuesday with a score of 14.975 for a routine with high degree of
difficulty, and in clubs with a score of 15.025 Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yu said that compared with Tuesday's performance, she was more relaxed on the
second day, and was pleased to win the second bronze medal.</P>
      <P>Yu, a student at National Taiwan Normal University, is a member of Taiwan's
rhythmic gymnastics training team for next year's World Games.</P>
      <P>She will vie with Wang Yi-chieh, another Taiwanese gymnast who also competed in
the two-day rhythmic gymnastics warm-up events, for the only representative
place in the World Games rhythmic gymanastics category.</P>
      <P>Wang placed fourth in the qualifying rounds of the two-day competition's four
events--rope, hoop, clubs, and ribbon.</P>
      <P>Having competed three times in the Pacific Rim Gymnastics Championship, Yu said
each international competition helps her, but added that competing in Taiwan and
being watched by compatriots in the pre-event spurred her to better
performances.</P>
      <P>Though  welcoming  the experience  gained  in international competitions,  Yu
said that she is worried  about her future development as she has had less time
to practice since she entered university and has had difficulty finding a proper
practice venue.</P>
      <P>The rising Taiwanese star in the field of rhythmic gymnastics also said it was
stressful to learn that there are more and more gymnasts than ever before in
competition.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Yu expressed hope that she will be able to compete in the World
Games and give a performance that will bring honor to her country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Vaccines for riemerella anatipestifer infection pass animal test</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Virologists at a government-run laboratory have completed animal testing on
vaccines against three separate types of riemerella  anatipestifer  (RA)
infection,  a common communicable  disease in poultry in Taiwan,  officials of
the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The officials reported that RA-infection is highly lethal, with a mortality rate
as high as 75 percent, and that it is impossible to develop a standard vaccine
that can induce immunity against all serotypes of the bacterium.</P>
      <P>In addition, they noted, the RA bacterium has 21 serotypes, although six
serotypes -- RA-1, RA-2, RA-6, RA-8, RA-10 and RA-11 -- have been the most
prevalent ones in recent years.</P>
      <P>The fact that scientists have to deal with multiple serotypes individually
further  complicates  the process  of RA vaccine development, said the
officials, adding that after four years, only vaccines for RA-1, RA-2 and RA-6
have been made.</P>
      <P>The serotype, or serovar, is a sub-species classification that groups micro-
organisms or viruses of the same species into different categories according to
their cell surface antigens.</P>
      <P>Chao Parn-hwa, director of the COA's Animal Health Research Institute, said that
some 38 million head of poultry are consumed annually in Taiwan, representing a
market value of NT$8 billion (about US$ 244 million) . To reduce losses
resulting from RA infection, he went on, the institute began the vaccine
development in 2004 with the help of several other Taiwanese universities.</P>
      <P>Last year, after the vaccines were produced from inactivated bacteria, the
project team began animal experiments on some 5,000 ducks and geese on three
farms in the central counties of Yunlin and Chiayi, said Chao, adding that the
results have been promising.</P>
      <P>Chao said the institute will soon submit an application for mass production to
the central health authority and that once permission has been granted,  the
institute  will  transfer  the related technologies to private pharmaceutical
companies for mass production.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gov't promoting first law targeting human trafficking: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior is pushing for the passage of the country's first
comprehensive law specifically targeting human trafficking, which would impose
stricter punishment against offenders, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an international conference, Deputy Interior Minister Lai Fong-wei
said that enacting such a law would demonstrate the government's resolve to
combat the crime and is part of its efforts to curb the serious crime.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently has laws and regulations addressing the issue, but the law
mentioned by Lai will become the country's first to specifically address human
trafficking offenses.</P>
      <P>Offenders caught exploiting trafficked victims by forcing them to work, for
instance, will be sentenced to up to seven years in prison based on the new law.
Civil servants found guilty of such a crime will receive a punishment that is
one and half times harsher than that of a regular citizen, if the law is
enacted.</P>
      <P>Lai said the draft law is expected to clear the legislative floor by the end of
the current legislative session.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry's National Immigration Agency (NIA) , Taiwan is one of
the major importing countries of migrant workers and marriage immigrants from
Southeast Asia. Against this background, human trafficking rings have exploited
such channels to smuggle in Southeast Asian women, who are forced into
prostitution or other illegal work. Mainland Chinese women are also smuggled
here to work as prostitutes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's police has tracked down 275 cases of suspected human trafficking from
January 2007 to September this year, with 190 cases involving sexual
exploitation and 85 involving labor exploitation, according to NIA statistics.</P>
      <P>Lai noted that with the establishment of an inter-agency meeting earlier this
year, the ministry is stepping up its anti- human trafficking efforts with an
allocation of NT$390 million (US$11.93 million) for the 2008-2010 period, in a
bid to strengthen what he described as the "3P" measures.</P>
      <P>The "3P" measures refer to prevention of the crime, prosecution of the
perpetrators and protection for the victims.</P>
      <P>In terms of protection, the government can grant trafficking victims work and
temporary residency permits, according to Chieh Li-kung, vice director-general
of the NIA.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chieh stressed that the cross-border pattern of human trafficking
highlights the importance of setting up international cooperation networks to
efficiently respond to the crime.</P>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan director Stephen M. Young said at the conference
that the United States applauds and supports Taiwan's efforts and is committed
to working with Taiwan on this global problem.</P>
      <P>He said, however, there is still more for Taiwan to do, such as standardizing
implementation of victim protection and strengthening coordination across
agencies.</P>
      <P>Another problem Taiwan faces, which is apparent to people who live here, is the
insufficient implementation of laws. Many organized prostitution facilities, for
example, are allowed to operate behind closed doors, while police authorities
only crack down on prostitutes who are street walkers.</P>
      <P>Human trafficking, which generates unlawful profits worth US$ 31.6 billion every
year worldwide, is considered the second biggest type  of crime  next to drug
trafficking,  according  to the International Labour Organization, a United
Nations agency.</P>
      <P>Around 12.3 million people are victims of forced labor around the world at
present, with 2.4 million of them trafficked for the purposes of sexual and
labor exploitation, as well as removal of human organs for lucrative transplant
operations.</P>

      <P>An application filed by an opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) city
councilor to stage rallies next week on roads leading to the Grand Hotel to
heckle China's top negotiator with Taiwan was rejected by the Taipei Municipal
Police Department Thursday.</P>
      <P>DPP Taipei City Councilor Chuang Jui-hsiung, who filed the application, said it
is "ridiculous" that the police rejected the rally application on the grounds
that permission to use the roads has already been applied for by the Taipei City
Chapter of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) during a Nov. 3-7 visit by China's top
liaison officer with Taiwan, Chen Yunlin, president of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>The areas for which the KMT have applied for use Nov. 3-7 include the uphill
side of the road leading to the Grand Hotel and the Grand Hotel Park, while the
areas that Chuang has applied for are the downhill side of the road leading to
the hotel and part of the nearby Bei An Road, the Taipei Police Department said.</P>
      <P>Since KMT followers will gather on the KMT-reserved roads while Chen and his
group were planning to gather on the other side of the roads, an undesirable
conflict would probably occur, given the proximity of the two sides, the police
said.</P>
      <P>In addition to rallies, the DPP followers have also planned to fire whistling
rockets to "prevent Chen Yunlin from sleeping at night."</P>
      <P>Noting that tens of thousands of DPP members and followers took to the streets
Oct. 25 for a "safeguarding Taiwan" rally that took place near the Presidential
Office peacefully, Chuang described the Taipei police as "lacking a sense of
humor" in their handling of Chen Yunlin's visit to the city.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin's deputy, ARATS vice president Zhang Mingqing, was mobbed by angry
protesters during a visit to the southern Taiwanese city of Tainan last week,
forcing him to cut short his stay.</P>

      <P>A decision by China's top negotiator with Taiwan to stay away from central and
southern Taiwan during his upcoming visit to the country drew mixed reactions
Thursday in Chiayi, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, president of the quasi-official Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), apologized at a news conference in Beijing earlier
in the day for Chinese exports of melamine-contaminated dairy products and food
ingredients to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also noted that he promised to visit Chiayi when he met several residents of
the southern city in Zhangzhou, Fujian Province last month.</P>
      <P>"I now have to apologize, " said Chen, his voice breaking with apparent emotion,
adding that "because of the arrangement of the itinerary, I will be unable to
visit central and southern Taiwan during my visit Nov. 3-7."</P>
      <P>Chiayi Councilor Chen Wen-lin of the ruling Kuomintang said he met the ARATS
chief Sept. 24 when he visited the tulou (earth building) in Zhangzhou, listed
as a world heritage site.</P>
      <P>After learning that Chen Yunlin was to visit Taiwan in October, he and other
members of his tour group invited the official to visit Chiayi to see the famous
Mt. Ali and taste steamed rice with turkey, a Chiayi delicacy.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-lin said he regretted that Chen Yunlin would not visit Chiayi and
expressed hope that the public would not "over politicize" his visit.</P>
      <P>"Those who visit Taiwan should be treated as guests. If he can travel to central
and southern Taiwan, he will also gain a deeper understanding of Taiwan's
freedom and democracy," Chen Wen-lin said.</P>
      <P>"The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should not confront each other forever, but
should gradually ease the tensions," he added.</P>
      <P>Although he has welcomed Chen Yunlin's visit, however, others obviously have
very different views, with a bronze statue of the late President Chiang Kai-shek
that stands in a park in Chiayi County defaced with characters that read "Chen
Yunlin get out."</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin's decision to stay out of central and southern Taiwan during his
visit is due to safety reasons, following an ugly incident Oct. 21 in which
Zhang Mingquing, a deputy of Chen Yunlin, fell to the ground after being jostled
by protesters while he was visiting the Confucius Temple in Tainan, southern
Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and Indonesia reached consensus on a variety of issues in a recent
Taiwan-Indonesia  labor affairs conference,  including an agreement to allow
direct hiring of Indonesian laborers in all relevant industries, an official of
the Council of Labor Affairs said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The conference, held in Taipei Oct. 29, was attended by officials from both
sides and presided over by the council's Chairwoman Wang Ju-hsuan and Mohammed
Jumhur Hidayat, director-general of Indonesia's National Agency for the
Placement and Protection of Indonesian Overseas Workers.</P>
      <P>The consensus will allow Indonesia to join other foreign labor source countries
that have agreed to apply the direct hiring system to better protect their
overseas workers' rights, the official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government set up the Direct Hiring Service Center in December 2007 to
help local people find foreign caretakers, with the main objective of
streamlining  the process of hiring foreign caregivers and protecting foreign
laborers from being exploited by employment agencies.</P>
      <P>The measure allows foreign laborers to find jobs in Taiwan without having to go
through labor brokers either in their own countries or in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For Indonesian workers in Taiwan, the measure is currently only applicable for
those in caregiving, who account for 90 percent of the 120,000 Indonesian
workers in Taiwan, the official said.</P>
      <P>The consensus reached Wednesday will benefit the remaining 10 percent of
Indonesian workers in the manufacturing and construction industries, the
official added.</P>
      <P>The two sides also agreed to shorten the application time and to simplify
process of direct hiring services, the official went on.</P>
      <P>In addition to the direct hiring measure, Taiwan and Indonesia also agreed on
exchanges of information on training of family caregivers in the hope of
improving the standards of Indonesian caregivers, with the exchanges to be
carried out within one month.</P>
      <P>Indonesia also promised control its employment agencies, which have a high rate
of absconding laborers, and will establish a mechanism within one month to cover
Taiwan's expenses in finding, detaining, and deporting absconding Indonesian
workers, the official said.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan approved Thursday a draft package of regulations governing
the development of the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and surrounding
areas with the aim of stimulating local economic growth.</P>
      <P>"The draft package is designed to facilitate the development of an aviation city
revolving around the airport to meet the demand of both aviation services and
local economic development, " said Premier Liu Chao-shiuan at a weekly Cabinet
meeting in which the package was reviewed and approved.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Taoyuan aviation city project is one of the 12 "i-Taiwan"
programs touted by President Ma Ying-jeou when he was on the campaign trail for
the presidency, Liu said a state-owned airport company will be established in
accordance with the new package, which he said will allow for the introduction
of entrepreneurial skills to airport management.</P>
      <P>He added that the raft of regulations will be referred to the Legislative Yuan
for approval in the near future.</P>
      <P>"If the bill clears the legislative floor by the end of this year, the proposed
state-run airport company will be inaugurated in 2010," Liu explained.</P>
      <P>Highlights of the bill include tax breaks for the new airport company, which
will not face business tax on airport service charges and other revenues, while
airport buildings will be exempt from housing tax and all airport land plots
will be exempt from land tax.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Minister of Transportation and Communications Mao
Chi-kuo said the Taoyuan aviation city development project symbolizes the
government's resolve to catch up with other major countries, including those in
the Asia-Pacific region, which are also developing their major international
airports into logistics centers.</P>
      <P>"Our project covers two sectors -- the Taoyuan airport park and the aviation
city in its vicinity, " Mao noted, adding that the ultimate goal is simultaneous
development of the airport and its surrounding regions.</P>
      <P>While enjoying tax breaks, the airport company will be required to offer part of
its profits to the Taoyuan county government for local development projects and
to financially support the country's money-losing airports.</P>
      <P>As to who will be eligible to bid for development projects in the airport  park
and aviation  city,  Mao said the Ministry  of Transportation  and
Communications will be responsible for all planning work and that local
governments will also be allowed to take part in the projects.</P>
      <P>Operators in the manufacturing and service sectors are also welcome to invest in
the development projects to make the country's main gateway into a locomotive
for industrial and economic growth.</P>
      <P>The draft bill contains 46 articles in nine chapters that include general
operation guidelines, program planning and revisions, airport park management
and aviation city development and construction.</P>
      <P>According to the regulations, the park and aviation city will be granted
privileges similar to free trade ports, which enjoy greater flexibility in
hiring foreign laborers and local workers than regular businesses.</P>

      <P>A group of streetwalkers and prostitutes' rights activists demonstrated in front
of the Executive Yuan building Thursday, appealing for the abolishment of a
regulation that punishes streetwalkers but not their clients.</P>
      <P>A spokeswoman for the Taipei-based Collective of Sex Workers and Supporters
(COSWAS) said the group organized the demonstration to highlight its appeal
because a "consensus conference" commissioned by the Executive Yuan will take
place in November to discuss whether prostitutes should be exempt from
punishment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's legal system only punishes prostitutes, not their patrons, and mainly
targets women who walk the streets looking for customers rather than women who
work in bars or clubs.</P>
      <P>For years, the COSWAS and other prostitutes' rights activists have been pushing
for the scrapping of Article 80 of the Social Order Management  Act which only
mandates punitive measures for the prostitutes, while allowing the men who pay
for their services to get off scot-free.</P>
      <P>At a time when the world is engulfed in serious financial turmoil and credit
crunch, the COSWAS spokeswoman said, domestic jobless rates are skyrocketing,
adding to the economic harships  for underprivileged families.</P>
      <P>Noting that the some 100,000 sex workers in Taiwan face a constant struggle to
support themselves and their families, she added that the government should
abolish the unfair law and legalize prostitution.</P>
      <P>If the sex trade were to be legalized, better management could be introduced to
provide better protection for sex workers, most of whom are socially
underprivileged, she added.</P>

the hotel and part of the nearby Bei An Road, the Taipei Police Department said.</P>
      <P>Since KMT followers will gather on the KMT-reserved roads while Chen and his
group were planning to gather on the other side of the roads, an undesirable
conflict would probably occur, given the proximity of the two sides, the police
said.</P>
      <P>In addition to rallies, the DPP followers have also planned to fire whistling
rockets to "prevent Chen Yunlin from sleeping at night."</P>
      <P>Noting that tens of thousands of DPP members and followers took to the streets
Oct. 25 for a "safeguarding Taiwan" rally that took place near the Presidential
Office peacefully, Chuang described the Taipei police as "lacking a sense of
humor" in their handling of Chen Yunlin's visit to the city.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin's deputy, ARATS vice president Zhang Mingqing, was mobbed by angry
protesters during a visit to the southern Taiwanese city of Tainan last week,
forcing him to cut short his stay.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Mixed reactions in Chiayi to top Chinese negotiator's remarks</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 30 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A decision by China's top negotiator with Taiwan to stay away from central and
southern Taiwan during his upcoming visit to the country drew mixed reactions
Thursday in Chiayi, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, president of the quasi-official Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), apologized at a news conference in Beijing earlier
in the day for Chinese exports of melamine-contaminated dairy products and food
ingredients to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also noted that he promised to visit Chiayi when he met several residents of
the southern city in Zhangzhou, Fujian Province last month.</P>
      <P>"I now have to apologize, " said Chen, his voice breaking with apparent emotion,
adding that "because of the arrangement of the itinerary, I will be unable to
visit central and southern Taiwan during my visit Nov. 3-7."</P>
      <P>Chiayi Councilor Chen Wen-lin of the ruling Kuomintang said he met the ARATS
chief Sept. 24 when he visited the tulou (earth building) in Zhangzhou, listed
as a world heritage site.</P>
      <P>After learning that Chen Yunlin was to visit Taiwan in October, he and other
members of his tour group invited the official to visit Chiayi to see the famous
Mt. Ali and taste steamed rice with turkey, a Chiayi delicacy.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-lin said he regretted that Chen Yunlin would not visit Chiayi and
expressed hope that the public would not "over politicize" his visit.</P>
      <P>"Those who visit Taiwan should be treated as guests. If he can travel to central
and southern Taiwan, he will also gain a deeper understanding of Taiwan's
freedom and democracy," Chen Wen-lin said.</P>
      <P>"The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should not confront each other forever, but
should gradually ease the tensions," he added.</P>
      <P>Although he has welcomed Chen Yunlin's visit, however, others obviously have
very different views, with a bronze statue of the late President Chiang Kai-shek
that stands in a park in Chiayi County defaced with characters that read "Chen
Yunlin get out."</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin's decision to stay out of central and southern Taiwan during his
visit is due to safety reasons, following an ugly incident Oct. 21 in which
Zhang Mingquing, a deputy of Chen Yunlin, fell to the ground after being jostled
by protesters while he was visiting the Confucius Temple in Tainan, southern
Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and Indonesia reached consensus on a variety of issues in a recent
Taiwan-Indonesia  labor affairs conference,  including an agreement to allow
direct hiring of Indonesian laborers in all relevant industries, an official of
the Council of Labor Affairs said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The conference, held in Taipei Oct. 29, was attended by officials from both
sides and presided over by the council's Chairwoman Wang Ju-hsuan and Mohammed
Jumhur Hidayat, director-general of Indonesia's National Agency for the
Placement and Protection of Indonesian Overseas Workers.</P>
      <P>The consensus will allow Indonesia to join other foreign labor source countries
that have agreed to apply the direct hiring system to better protect their
overseas workers' rights, the official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government set up the Direct Hiring Service Center in December 2007 to
help local people find foreign caretakers, with the main objective of
streamlining  the process of hiring foreign caregivers and protecting foreign
laborers from being exploited by employment agencies.</P>
      <P>The measure allows foreign laborers to find jobs in Taiwan without having to go
through labor brokers either in their own countries or in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For Indonesian workers in Taiwan, the measure is currently only applicable for
those in caregiving, who account for 90 percent of the 120,000 Indonesian
workers in Taiwan, the official said.</P>
      <P>The consensus reached Wednesday will benefit the remaining 10 percent of
Indonesian workers in the manufacturing and construction industries, the
official added.</P>
      <P>The two sides also agreed to shorten the application time and to simplify
process of direct hiring services, the official went on.</P>
      <P>In addition to the direct hiring measure, Taiwan and Indonesia also agreed on
exchanges of information on training of family caregivers in the hope of
improving the standards of Indonesian caregivers, with the exchanges to be
carried out within one month.</P>
      <P>Indonesia also promised control its employment agencies, which have a high rate
of absconding laborers, and will establish a mechanism within one month to cover
Taiwan's expenses in finding, detaining, and deporting absconding Indonesian
workers, the official said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan approved Thursday a draft package of regulations governing
the development of the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and surrounding
areas with the aim of stimulating local economic growth.</P>
      <P>"The draft package is designed to facilitate the development of an aviation city
revolving around the airport to meet the demand of both aviation services and
local economic development, " said Premier Liu Chao-shiuan at a weekly Cabinet
meeting in which the package was reviewed and approved.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Taoyuan aviation city project is one of the 12 "i-Taiwan"
programs touted by President Ma Ying-jeou when he was on the campaign trail for
the presidency, Liu said a state-owned airport company will be established in
accordance with the new package, which he said will allow for the introduction
of entrepreneurial skills to airport management.</P>
      <P>He added that the raft of regulations will be referred to the Legislative Yuan
for approval in the near future.</P>
      <P>"If the bill clears the legislative floor by the end of this year, the proposed
state-run airport company will be inaugurated in 2010," Liu explained.</P>
      <P>Highlights of the bill include tax breaks for the new airport company, which
will not face business tax on airport service charges and other revenues, while
airport buildings will be exempt from housing tax and all airport land plots
will be exempt from land tax.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Minister of Transportation and Communications Mao
Chi-kuo said the Taoyuan aviation city development project symbolizes the
government's resolve to catch up with other major countries, including those in
the Asia-Pacific region, which are also developing their major international
airports into logistics centers.</P>
      <P>"Our project covers two sectors -- the Taoyuan airport park and the aviation
city in its vicinity, " Mao noted, adding that the ultimate goal is simultaneous
development of the airport and its surrounding regions.</P>
      <P>While enjoying tax breaks, the airport company will be required to offer part of
its profits to the Taoyuan county government for local development projects and
to financially support the country's money-losing airports.</P>
      <P>As to who will be eligible to bid for development projects in the airport  park
and aviation  city,  Mao said the Ministry  of Transportation  and
Communications will be responsible for all planning work and that local
governments will also be allowed to take part in the projects.</P>
      <P>Operators in the manufacturing and service sectors are also welcome to invest in
the development projects to make the country's main gateway into a locomotive
for industrial and economic growth.</P>
      <P>The draft bill contains 46 articles in nine chapters that include general
operation guidelines, program planning and revisions, airport park management
and aviation city development and construction.</P>
      <P>According to the regulations, the park and aviation city will be granted
privileges similar to free trade ports, which enjoy greater flexibility in
hiring foreign laborers and local workers than regular businesses.</P>

      <P>A group of streetwalkers and prostitutes' rights activists demonstrated in front
of the Executive Yuan building Thursday, appealing for the abolishment of a
regulation that punishes streetwalkers but not their clients.</P>
      <P>A spokeswoman for the Taipei-based Collective of Sex Workers and Supporters
(COSWAS) said the group organized the demonstration to highlight its appeal
because a "consensus conference" commissioned by the Executive Yuan will take
place in November to discuss whether prostitutes should be exempt from
punishment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's legal system only punishes prostitutes, not their patrons, and mainly
targets women who walk the streets looking for customers rather than women who
work in bars or clubs.</P>
      <P>For years, the COSWAS and other prostitutes' rights activists have been pushing
for the scrapping of Article 80 of the Social Order Management  Act which only
mandates punitive measures for the prostitutes, while allowing the men who pay
for their services to get off scot-free.</P>
      <P>At a time when the world is engulfed in serious financial turmoil and credit
crunch, the COSWAS spokeswoman said, domestic jobless rates are skyrocketing,
adding to the economic harships  for underprivileged families.</P>
      <P>Noting that the some 100,000 sex workers in Taiwan face a constant struggle to
support themselves and their families, she added that the government should
abolish the unfair law and legalize prostitution.</P>
      <P>If the sex trade were to be legalized, better management could be introduced to
provide better protection for sex workers, most of whom are socially
underprivileged, she added.</P>

      <P>The official, however, declined to comment on whether the participation of Lien
-- the highest-ranking former ROC official ever to attend an APEC leadership
meeting -- symbolizes a breakthrough for Taiwan and progress in cross-Taiwan
Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lien will attend this year's Nov. 22-23 summit in Lima, Peru, on behalf of
President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>APEC is one of the few international organizations that admits both Taiwan and
China as members. Due to China's opposition, Taiwan's president is barred from
attending the annual informal leadership meeting in person and instead has to
name a special envoy who attends on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was represented at the first APEC leaders summit, held in Seattle in
1993,  by Vincent Siew,  then-chairman of Taiwan's Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development. Siew is now vice president.</P>
      <P>In the last two APEC forums, Taiwan was represented by prominent business
leaders -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Chairman Morris Chang and Acer
Group Chairman Stan Shih, respectively.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, Randy Schriver, a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state
for East Asian and Pacific affairs, told CNA in Washington that he is pleased to
see Lien's participation in the next summit.</P>
      <P>Schriver said he hopes the United States -- the host of the 2010 APEC forum --
will invite Ma to attend that event in person.</P>
      <P>His view echoed that of Douglas Paal, former Taipei Office director of the
American Institute in Taiwan, who has proposed that Ma seek to participate in
the APEC summit under a "proper" title.</P>
      <P>Paal,  currently vice president of the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, predicted during a visit to Taiwan earlier this month that
Ma's participation in the summit could be possible in the coming two to three
years thanks to his efforts to improve cross-Taiwan Strait relations through a
"modus vivendi" approach that advocates a "diplomatic truce" with China.</P>
      <P>According to Paal, Ma's approach has received good responses from China, as seen
in the postponement of Paraguay's plan to switch diplomatic recognition from
Taipei to Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Former national security chief detained on suspicions of corruption</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former National Security  Council Secretary-General Chiou I-jen was detained and
held incommunicado Friday on suspicions of defrauding half a million U.S.
dollars in the name of promoting diplomacy.</P>
      <P>After a two-month investigation, prosecutors from the Special Investigation
Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office summoned Chiou and five other
witnesses in the wee hours of Friday for questioning on suspicion that he
defrauded US$500,000 from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)  earmarked for
a diplomacy promotion effort known as the An Ya Project and sought Chiou's
detention afterward.</P>
      <P>Their request was granted by the Taipei District Court Friday.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA officials, after the An Ya Project was executed, Chiou, then
secretary general of the National Security Council, wrote a letter to the MOFA,
demanding that the ministry appropriate US$500,000 for him to facilitate the
progress of the An Ya Project.</P>
      <P>The MOFA issued several traveler's checks for the amount under the instruction
of then-Vice Foreign Minister Michael Ying-mao Kau and the checks were submitted
to Chiou's office by one of Kau's secretaries, the Taipei District Court said in
its ruling.</P>
      <P>Chiou's scheme cam to light when part of those checks were cashed by him at a
casino overseas, according to the ruling.</P>
      <P>He took the money in the name of facilitating the progress of "secret diplomacy"
in which former President Chen Shui-bian is said to have engaged during his
tenure.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors searched six locations Friday before questioning Chiou and said
that the search had yielded evidence.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court granted the prosecutors' request to have Chiou
detained incommunicado out of concern that he could tamper with evidence.</P>
      <P>The other five people were released after questioning.</P>
      <P>Chiou stepped down in disgrace as vice premier only two weeks before he was due
to finish his term May 20 in the wake of a diplomatic bungle in which Taiwan was
defrauded of US$29.8 million while seeking to forge official ties with Papua New
Guinea in 2006.</P>
      <P>Several media outlets quoted Control Yuan member Hung Chao-nan as alleging
several days ago that Chiou handed US$10 million in cash to the president of a
Latin American country when Chen was visiting that country, with which Taiwan
maintains formal diplomatic relations. Hung did not identify the country in
question.</P>
      <P>Chiou denied Hung's allegation.</P>
      <P>Chiou's case was a spin-off of the prosecutors' efforts to sort out other
details involving Chen and his family's alleged money laundering via overseas
bank accounts.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's second-largest international air carrier, Eva Airways, is scheduled to
resume Taipei-Paris passenger flights from January in view of lower oil prices,
a corporate source said Friday.</P>
      <P>From Jan. 21, EVA will offer three weekly passenger flights, on Monday, Friday
and Sunday, departing from Taipei for Paris, while the returning flights will
depart from Paris for Taipei every Monday, Thursday and Saturday, according to
the EVA official.</P>
      <P>EVA suspended its passenger flight operations on the Taipei-Paris route last
November after deficits caused by soaring oil prices. In addition to higher fuel
prices, expensive costs for flying over Russian airspace also led the carrier to
call a halt to the Taipei-Paris route, the official said.</P>
      <P>EVA will be using new Boeing 777-300ERs on the route, which will save up to 20
percent of the fuel consumed by the Boeing 747-400s that were used on the route
prior to November 2007, said the official.</P>
      <P>The flights will still fly over Russia's Siberia flight zone, he added.</P>

      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) performed a protest skit outside a
Taipei City hotel Friday to demand that Association for Relations Across the

over melamine-contaminated food imported from China.</P>
      <P>Chen and his delegation are expected to stay at the hotel during a visit to
Taiwan slated to kick off Monday.</P>
      <P>The TSU demanded compensation following a verbal apology to Taiwan by the ARATS
head in Beijing a day earlier. Chen's apology came in the wake of a written
apology issued by the association on Monday.</P>
      <P>TSU  Secretary-General  Lin Jhi-jia  said  the imports  of melamine-tainted milk
powder from China has caused serious harm to Taiwan's baking industry.</P>
      <P>He said the protest skit was staged because Taiwan's "patience has come to an
end" regarding tainted food products from China.</P>
      <P>The head of the tiny pro-independence party said Chen must offer "concrete
compensation" for the harm caused by the scandal, otherwise the TSU will call
for the Taiwanese people to "ask him to eat tainted pie."</P>
      <P>Lin said the next step will be to urge all sectors of Taiwanese society to voice
a formal protest to Chen, adding that the party has people ready to follow the

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said in a television interview Thursday that "relations

      <P>Liu made the remarks in an interview with China Television on an upcoming

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that the government has no plans to lift its
import ban on 830 Chinese agricultural products as he pledged to protect the
interests of Taiwanese farmers.</P>
      <P>Raising the issue while receiving  representatives  of the agricultural, fishing
and livestock sectors, Ma noted that Taiwan has over the past eight years opened
its market to a total of 1,417 Chinese agricultural products, with 37 percent
remaining forbidden.</P>
      <P>"The government is very careful (about further opening the market) to protect
Taiwanese farmers and fishermen from any damage, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>He added that the interests of Taiwan and its people are his administration's
top concern.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, the establishment of direct cross-Taiwan Strait shipping
links -- an issue to be addressed during upcoming negotiations between Taiwan
and China -- will be favorable to the development of Taiwan's agricultural and
fishing sectors because it will facilitate Taiwanese exports to China.</P>
      <P>Ma predicted that after the shipping links are launched, Taiwan's agricultural
and fish exports to China will rise by 20 percent, increasing the income of
local farmers and fishermen by 10 percent to 15 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin,  who as president of China's Association for Relations Across the

    <HEADLINE>Health surcharge on cigarettes to be increased to NT$20</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 31 (CNA)
10/31/08  15:44:50
(By Ruth Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet has passed a draft amendment to the Tobacco Hazards Prevention and
Control Act, increasing the health and welfare surcharge on cigarettes to NT$20
per pack from the existing NT$10 and expanding non-smoking areas in public
spaces, a Department of Health (DOH) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Under the revisions, non-smoking areas will be extended to schools at senior-
high  level or below,  medical institutions, government units and offices for
use by three persons or above.</P>
      <P>Those who violate the regulations will face a maximum fine of NT$10,000 (US$305)
and those who provide smoking paraphernalia such as ashtrays in non-smoking
areas or who fail to set up no-smoking signs in smoking-prohibited places will
be subjected to a maximum fine of NT$50,000, the official said.</P>
      <P>The revisions will take effect Jan. 11 next year after being ratified by the
legislature, the official went on.</P>
      <P>The revisions are designed in accordance with regulations set forth by the World
Health Organization to increase prices in an effort to reduce tobacco
consumption, the official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan spends about NT$45 billion annually on health insurance to cover medical
treatment of diseases related to smoking, the official said, adding that the new
measure raising tobacco prices will be beneficial to public health.</P>
      <P>He noted that prices of tobacco products in Taiwan are still lower than that in
some other countries.</P>
      <P>Refusing to support the increase of health surcharge, Taiwan's tobacco  industry
association  said that without supplementary measures, the considerable increase
in health surcharge will trigger more serious smuggling of tobacco products and
will cause the government's tax revenues to shrink.</P>
      <P>However, DOH Deputy Minister Cheng Shou-hsia said the country's health surcharge
revenue on cigarettes will increase from NT$20 billion to NT$38 billion after
the amendments take effect next year.</P>
      <P>The increased revenue will be used as subsidies for medical treatment for the
disadvantaged, including those with rare diseases or financial difficulties and
those living in remote areas where medical resources are insufficient, Cheng
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Premier Liu Chao-shiuan  instructed the DOH at Thursday's weekly
Cabinet meeting, in which the revisions were passed, to communicate with the
ruling Kuomintang and opposition Democratic Progressive Party to come up with
effective measures against hording and smuggling of tobacco products.</P>
      <P>Cheng said there will always be people protesting against the increase of
tobacco health tax no matter when the increase is proposed.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that the revisions will increase Taiwan's tobacco health
surcharge, currently about 32 percent of the price of a pack of cigarettes, to
slightly over 50 percent, which is still much lower than the 66 percent -80
percent in some other countries.</P>

event follow next July's World Games standards, said Hsu Cho-Chuan, chief
executive of the Kaohsiung Organizing Committee, which is in charge of the
event.</P>
      <P>Beef, chicken and vegetarian options are being offered to around 500

schools that have been pressed into service as eateries for the event, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Hsu added that the athletes and referees have been accommodated in 250 rooms in
nine hotels around the city. They also receive lunch and dinner vouchers worth
NT$250 (US$7.6) each from the organizer, with breakfast provided by the hotels.</P>
      <P>The warm-up competition, which kicked off Oct. 28 in the southern port city,
sees athletes competing in four sports -- water skiing, gymnastics, boules and
korfball, with the assistance of around 1,000 volunteers who are helping with

the event venues for their convenience.</P>
      <P>The event is expected to attract 4,500 athletes from around 100 countries.</P>

meeting, they will also urge the Kuomintang administration to quickly deliver on
its campaign promises to open direct postal, business and transportation links
with China.</P>
      <P>One of the priorities, Chang said, will be to extend the weekend nonstop cross-
strait charter flights that already exist to every day of the week by the end of
the year.</P>
      <P>"We also urge that financial institutions from each side be allowed to set up
branches on the other side so that Taiwanese businesses in China can get

China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- are
scheduled to meet in Taipei next week to follow up on their meeting in Beijing

      <P>When Chen Yunlin arrives in Taipei Nov. 3 for a five-day historic visit, he will
be the highest ranking People's Republic of China official to have ever visited
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During the planned meeting, Taiwan and China are expected to cover issues such

extending direct weekend charter flights to weekdays, establishing direct
shipping links and postal exchanges, and developing  a framework to deal with

      <P>Four agreements on those issues are expected to be signed.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, 12 representatives of Taiwanese businesses in China will

      <P>The representatives are also scheduled to host a luncheon together with other
Taiwanese industrial and business groups to honor Chen Yunlin and accompanying
ARATS officials at the Grand Hotel Nov. 6, Chang added.</P>
      <P>China is Taiwan's number one destination for foreign direct investment and

      <P>The ruling party Kuomintang's Secretary General Wu Den-yi said in a press
conference Friday that many people from central and southern Taiwan regret that
China's top negotiator Chen Yunlin will not be able to visit their areas due to
security concerns during his upcoming visit, and would like to send him a
message of peace.</P>
      <P>Wu said the residents would like to hold a seminar in Taipei during Chen's visit
next week "to tell him that Taiwan people love peace."</P>
      <P>According to Wu, people from Kaohsiung County, Pingtung County, Tainan County,
Tainan City and Chiayi City would like to come to Taipei to hold the seminar.
These people say that this upcoming meeting between Straits Exchange Foundation
Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and Chen, president of the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait, is "very much to the benefit of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan people are very friendly and hospitable. We do not want the
international community nor the people from mainland China to think that we are
brutal in nature. We would like to send a message to Chen, to tell him that
Taiwan people love peace", said Wu.</P>
      <P>Sources from the ruling party Kuomintang (KMT)  also said yesterday that ARATS
President Chen, in addition to meeting SEF Chairman Chiang, will also meet with
KMT heavyweights such as former vice-president Lien Chan, KMT Chairman Wu Poh-
hsiung and People's First Party Chairman James Soong.</P>
      <P>ARATS President Chen will be the highest ranking mainland Chinese official to
visit Taiwan since the two sides of the Taiwan Strait split at the end of a
civil war in 1949. The upcoming meeting between Chiang and Chen will be the
second meeting between the two since their first meeting in Beijing in June
2007.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to visit Taiwan from Nov. 3 to 7 to sign landmark agreements,
including on expanding direct chartered flights, launching shipping and postal
links as well as setting up a mechanism to deal with food safety issues between
Taiwan and mainland China.</P>

      <P>Academia Sinica, Taiwan's top academic and science research institute, signed a
memorandum of understanding with the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan
(NAOJ) Friday to collaborate in optical and infrared wavelength astronomy and on
the development of a new camera for the Subaru Telescope.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Chi-Huey Wong and Paul Ho, director of the preparatory
office of the planned Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics
(IAA) , sealed the new partnership in Toyko, Japan, according to a statement
from Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>Subaru, built and first operated by the NAOJ in 1991, is an 8.2-meter optical
infrared telescope situated at the summit of Nauna Kea of Hawaii, the United
States.</P>
      <P>It is the NAOJ's flagship telescope and one of the largest and most advanced
optical telescopes in the world.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, the NAOJ proposed to build a new camera, called
Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) in 2006, a next generation very wide-field camera for
the telescope.</P>
      <P>Its targeted field of view is 1.5 degrees in diameter, giving it almost 10 times
the field of view and survey speed of the existing prime focus camera (Suprime-
Cam) on the telescope, while maintaining the equivalent image quality necessary
for weak lensing survey.</P>
      <P>The camera's development began in 2007, and it is scheduled to be completed in
2012. When built, it will be the world's largest CCD camera, composed of 120 8
-million-pixel CCD chips, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The IAA was invited to develop certain special parts and components for the
sophisticated camera and to join scientific observatory projects involving the
state-of-the-art device.</P>
      <P>The NAOJ, a member of Japan's inter-university research agency National
Institutes of Natural Sciences, is a core Japanese national institute for
astronomy and is widely acknowledged as having some of the world's most advanced
observatory facilities.</P>

      <P>The establishment of the Taiwan-United Kingdom parliamentary group serves as an
excellent channel for the two countries to further promote bilateral relations
and exchanges, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Friday.</P>
      <P>"It is such a good thing that we established the Taiwan-U.K. parliamentary
association because in this way, we can promote diplomacy in a more relaxed
manner and by building up interpersonal relationships (among legislators), Liu
said at the inauguration of the Legislative Yuan's "Taiwan-U.K.  Parliamentary
Communication Association.</P>
      <P>"Parliamentary diplomacy can serve as the mainstay of our national diplomatic
work and provides a strong and firm support for it," he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the U.K. has one of the oldest multi-party democratic systems in the
world, Liu said this parliamentary group is a platform for legislators from both
sides to learn from each other and further promote bilateral relations on the
foundations of strong economic, educational, cultural and scientific exchanges.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who also serves as the honorary chairman
of the association, said the establishment of the parliamentary group isall that
one could wish forbecause it can complement the government's diplomatic efforts.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the same occasion, Michael Reilly, director of the British Trade and
Cultural Office (BTCO) in Taiwan, noted that just over two years ago, the Select
Committee of Foreign Affairs in the U.K. House of Commons published an extensive
report on Britain's relations with China and Taiwan, in which it suggested that
Taiwan and the U.K. should have closer links.</P>
      <P>In its conclusions it stressed that the growth and development of democracy in
Taiwan is of the greatest importance, and it recommended the British government
should increase its contacts with Taiwan at a political level,Reilly said.</P>
      <P>"In particular, it recommended that we should work to increase the links between
elected representatives of Taiwan and those of the U.K.," Reilly added.</P>
      <P>The top British representative to Taiwan said he hopes this association will be
more than just a friendship group and be a platform for the two countries to
work together.</P>
      <P>He said the U.K. and Taiwan -- in common with many other developed countries --
face many shared challenges including tackling global warming, resisting
protectionism, combating the spread of infectious diseases, and ensuring social
justice.</P>
      <P>TheTaiwan-U.K. Parliamentary Communication Associationis the 30th such group set
up by the Legislative Yuan with counterparts from other countries.</P>
      <P>Initiated by Kuomintang Legislator Lu Hsueh-chang, who serves as the chairman of
the association, the group has 57 members and is still growing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>On the Penghu Islands off southwest Taiwan, the strong chilly sea wind from the
northeast has replaced the gentle summer southerly breeze. The beginning of the
Penghu coastal fishing season has arrived.</P>
      <P>Recently more and more enthusiastic anglers were spotted standing on rocks along
the coasts of the Penghu archipelago, concentrating attention on the fishing
pole in their hands and enjoying the fun of fishing on the seashore.</P>
      <P>Lu Hung-chih, the founder and chairman of the Penghu Islands Rocks Fishing
Association, touted Friday that the archipelago, which is located in the Taiwan
Strait, is a heaven of rock fishing.</P>
      <P>There are perfect spots for seashore fishing everywhere in Penghu which is a
group of 90 islets that houses many fishing grounds in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Anglers in Kaohsiung, Tainan, Chiayi and Taichung on the west coast of Taiwan
proper were often seen sailing at night to remote islets off Penghu for fishing,
he added.</P>
      <P>The seasons of autumn and winter are regarded as the best time for rock fishing
in Penghu, Lu said, because migratory fish usually gather  near seashores  in
the cold seasons  when the strong northeasterly wind blows.</P>
      <P>"It is like schools of fish waiting for you to angle, instead of the fishers
waiting for the fish, " said Lu, who developed the interest in rock fishing when
he was a junior high school student.</P>
      <P>On the downside, amateur anglers threaten the islets' beautiful ecologic
environment by using fish bait mixed with chemical raw materials and the garbage
they leave behind -- including plastic bottles and empty plastic lunch boxes, Lu
said.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Friday that it will cooperate fully
with the investigation of a former national security chief who was detained on
suspicion of defrauding the ministry of half a million U.S. dollars in the name
of promoting diplomacy.</P>
      <P>However, the MOFA declined to release any specific details of the case.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry will not comment on this specific case but will give full
cooperation in the investigation, " MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said in response
to reporters' questions.</P>
      <P>Former National Security Council Secretary-General Chiou I-jen was detained
Thursday and held incommunicado  on suspicion of corruption in connection with
the "An Ya Project, " the content of which has not be made public.</P>
      <P>Chiou's case was a spin-off of prosecutors' efforts to sort out the details of
allegations against former President Chen Shui-bian and his family of laundering
money via overseas bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Henry Chen said the Chiou case was one of the many in which standard procedure
was not followed and that other such instances are being currently being
investigated, but he refused to give any further details.</P>
      <P>However, he stressed, this was why Foreign Minister Francisco H.L Ou insisted,
upon taking office on May 20, that all diplomatic work should "return to being
carried out under standard procedure and in accordance with the system."</P>
      <P>No such thing ever happened before 2000 under the Kuomintang administration, as
diplomatic work was conducted using professional standards, " the MOFA spokesman
said. "We have to return to diplomatic professionalism and respect that."</P>
      <P>According to a decision by the Taipei District Court, after the An Ya Project
was closed, Chiou, then secretary general of the National Security Council,
wrote a letter to the MOFA, asking the ministry to allocate US$500,000 to him to
continue the project.</P>
      <P>The MOFA issued several travelers' checks to him for the requested amount at the
instruction of then-Vice Foreign Minister Michael Ying-mao Kau, stated the Court
in its decision to detain Chu, adding that the Chiou case came to light when he
cashed some of the checks at a casino overseas.</P>
      <P>Chiou stepped down in disgrace as vice premier in early May -- two weeks before
his term expired -- amid a scandal over a diplomatic bungle in which Taiwan was
defrauded of US$29.8 million while seeking to forge official ties with Papua New
Guinea in 2006.</P>

      <P>China's acceptance of former Vice President Lien Chan as Taiwan's representative
at this year's informal leadership summit of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum is an important sign of improved cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lien, who will attend the Nov. 22-23 summit in Lima, Peru on behalf of President
Ma Ying-jeou, will be the highest-ranking former Republic of China official ever
allowed to take part in the annual event.</P>
      <P>Chiang pointed out that in the past when cross-strait relations were tense,
Taiwan was subjected to obvious suppression by China in its participation in
APEC.</P>
      <P>The situation, however, has changed following the easing of tensions between the
two sides, as seen in the example of Lien, he said.</P>
      <P>APEC is one of the few international organizations that admits both Taiwan and
China as members. Due to China's opposition, Taiwan's president is barred from
attending the leadership meeting in person and instead has to name a special
envoy to attend on his behalf.</P>

      <P>Larger numbers of Chinese tourists are likely to sightsee in Taiwan after flying
across the Taiwan Strait becomes more convenient, a visiting Chinese official
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking in Taipei, China's National Tourism Administration deputy director,
Zhang Xiqin, brushed aside Taiwan's concern that the number of Chinese tourists
coming here has remained low after the two sides agreed in June to allow up to
3,000 Chinese nationals a day to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Only 20,000 Chinese tourists have visited Taiwan since the agreement took effect
in mid-July, but Zhang said he was more concerned that Taiwan's tourism
facilities might not be able to accommodate the coming influx of Chinese
tourists.</P>
      <P>He asserted that large numbers of Chinese tourists will come to Taiwan soon as
long as more flights and routes are established across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Zhang, who also serves as head of the non-official Cross-Strait Tourism
Association, made the comments after presiding over the opening of the 2008
Taipei International Travel Fair at the Taipei World Trade Center with Tourism
Bureau Director-General Janice Lai, who also heads the Taiwan Strait Tourism and
Travel Association.</P>
      <P>He arrived in Taiwan Wednesday to attend this year's Taipei International Travel
Fair, which runs until Nov. 3, at the head of a 290-member  delegation  composed
of  tourism  officials  and representatives from 31 provinces.</P>
      <P>Zhang's trip to Taiwan came a few days ahead of a visit by China's top
negotiator with Taiwan, Chen Yunlin, president of the quasi-official Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, who is slated to arrive Nov. 3 for a
five-day visit.</P>
      <P>Chen will hold talks with Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung
on travel and tourism exchanges between Taiwan and China as well as food
security cooperation, in a follow-up to their landmark meeting in Beijing in

      <P>For her part, Lai said all of Taiwan's sectors are paying a high degree of
attention to Chen's visit to Taiwan next week and welcomed his visit.</P>

      <P>The second meeting between top negotiators of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
scheduled for Nov. 3 will mark a new era for Taiwan's tourism, as more direct
links between Taiwan and China will be established,  the head of the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>MOTC Minister Mao Chi-kuo said at the opening ceremony of the Taipei
International Travel Fair 2008 (Taipei ITF 2008) that amid an economic downturn,
the tourism industry in Taiwan is still seeing growth this year and it will head
into a new era, as relations between Taiwan and China reach a milestone with
more direct air and sea links between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Mao was referring to an upcoming meeting between Taiwan and China's top cross-
strait negotiators, in which the two sides are expected to sign agreements  on
broadening  their tourism and transportation links.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) , will head a delegation of around 60 people on a historic visit
to Taiwan Nov. 3-7 to meet with his Taiwan counterpart Chiang Pin-kung, chairman
of the Straits Exchange Foundation. They are slated to sign four agreements,
including a "Cross-Taiwan Strait Air Links Agreement" and accords on direct
shipping and postal links.</P>
      <P>Chen will be the highest ranking official from the People's Republic of China to
visit Taiwan since the two sides split in 1949 after a civil war.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening of the travel fair, Stanley Yen, director of the Taipei
ITF Organizing Committee, said that the direct links between Taiwan and China
will bring a complete change for travelers coming to Asia.</P>
      <P>"Now that travelers from Europe and from the United States can easily include
both Taiwan and China on their itinerary, this will officially put Taiwan on the
road to becoming a regional transportation hub," Yen said.</P>
      <P>According to Yen, Taipei ITF 2008 set new records this year with exhibitors from
62 countries and regions around the world occupying a total of 1,206 booths.</P>
      <P>The fair was divided into six major exhibition areas -- each with its own unique
features -- namely Europe, America, Africa, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific
Region, and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Taipei ITF, which each year attracts huge crowds, has become the
greatest tourism exhibition in Asia, Vice Premier Paul Chiu said that Taiwan is
definitely worth visiting, as it has diverse cultures, beautiful scenery and
most important of all -- the friendliest people.</P>
      <P>The Taipei ITF, is in its 16th year, was organized by the Taiwan Visitors
Association under the supervision of the MOTC.</P>
      <P>According to the organizers, the most heavily represented countries and regions
at the fair this year are Japan with 69 booths, Malaysia with 25, South Korea
with 20, the U.S. with 14, Hong Kong with 12, and Macau also with 12.</P>
      <P>Visitors are advised to make use of the Taipei ITF Web site to obtain the latest

    <TEXT>
      <P>An advocacy group for the unemployed urged the government Friday to do more for
those without jobs at a time of rising unemployment, especially people who have
been without work for more than six months.</P>
      <P>According to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) under the Executive Yuan, 144,000 people at the end of September had
been jobless for more than six months, 20,000 more than at the same time last
year.</P>
      <P>Among them, 66,000 were classified as long-term jobless, meaning they had been
without work for more than a year.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Employment and Vocational Training under the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) has long had diverse measures to promote job creation for the
long-term jobless, including subsidizing private businesses to hire those who
have been unemployed for more than five months.</P>
      <P>The bureau also provides them with training to gain new skills that will better
meet the demands of the labor market, a council official said.</P>
      <P>But Son Yu-lian, secretary-general of the Taiwan Labor Front, criticized the
measures, saying that most long-term jobless are middle-aged or older, and that
vocational training has only a limited effect, as some basic skills, such as
word processing, present technical challenges.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that the Taiwan's persistently high jobless rate indicated
that unemployment in the country not only consisted of cyclical unemployment
caused by the global economic downturn but also of structural employment.</P>
      <P>Structural unemployment occurs when job seekers' skills do not match employer
demands in the labor market, generally because of structural changes in the
economy.</P>
      <P>Son was also skeptical about a newly introduced CLA measure to subsidize
businesses for six months that hire workers who have been unemployed for more
than three months.</P>
      <P>The measures seem to be able to help many people, especially employers who need
short-term manpower, but the structural problem cannot be solved with short-term
subsidies,he said, predicting that the unemployment rate will remain high until
next year.</P>
      <P>He suggested  that  the government  create  long-term  job opportunities in the
area of public service, such as tour guides and traffic conductors, and extend
the period during which those without work are eligible for unemployment
benefits.</P>
      <P>Currently, people who lose their jobs can apply for unemployment benefits, equal
to 60 percent of the average monthly insured wage under the labor insurance
program, for up to six months.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS, the unemployment rate climbed to 4.27 percent in
September, marking the highest level for the same period in the past four years,
with 464,000 people out of work.</P>
      <P>The global economic downturn has been blamed for the high unemployment rate, as
31 percent of the jobless, or 145,000 people, have lost their jobs due to
business closings or downsizing, according to the DGBAS.</P>

passed by the Cabinet Thursday to increase the health and welfare surcharge on
cigarettes to NT$20 per pack from the existing NT$10.</P>
      <P>The amendment also included extending non-smoking areas to schools at the
senior-high level or below, medical institutions, government units, and offices
used by three or more people.</P>
      <P>The revisions will take effect Jan. 11 next year after being ratified by the
legislature, according to an official of the Department of Health Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the revisions are in accordance with the World Health
Organization's  recommendation  to  create  non-smoking environments and raise
tobacco prices - which it believes are the two most effective measures to reduce
tobacco consumption and smoking among young people.</P>
      <P>It is rare for a government to promote the two measures simultaneously, Lin
said, praising the Executive Yuan for passing the revisions.</P>
      <P>A World Bank report in 1999 showed that tobacco consumption is reduced by 4-8
percent and smoking by youngsters by 10 percent if tobacco prices are increased
by 10 percent, Lin said.</P>
      <P>What is considered a reasonable price for tobacco products in Taiwan should
range between NT$80 and NT$100 per pack, based on international pricing levels,
and Taiwan's national personal average income of US$15,000 a year, Lin said.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan's tobacco prices are still among the lowest in the world, said Lin.
During the past two decades, Taiwan has only increased its cigarette prices from
NT$45 to NT$60 per pack.</P>
      <P>In that same period, New York has raised its tobacco prices from NT$60 to
NT$280, and Hong Kong from NT$45 to NT$125, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong started actively increasing health surcharges on cigarettes in 1983
and now a pack of tobacco sold there has a surcharge of more than NT$70, Lin
said. The effort has successfully reduced the area's smoking rate from 23
percent in 1982 to 14 percent in 2005, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>There is still room for Taiwan's government to increase tobacco tax and prices
to prevent the island from turning into a haven for tobacco dumping, she said.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Department of Health, about 23 percent
of Taiwan's population are smokers, with the smoking rate of men higher than
that of women - 49 percent compared to 5 percent. Meanwhile, one out of 10
people aged below 18 are smokers.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the legal age for smoking is 18, which means many teenagers are
smoking illegally.</P>

      <P>The Cross-Taiwan Strait talks to be held next week in Taipei will greatly
benefit the outlying Penghu Islands, Vice Minister of the Interior Lai Fong-wei
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lai,  who served as the offshore county's magistrate from 1997-2005, made the
remarks in a published letter to the editor of the local newspaper, Penghu
Times.</P>
      <P>Although talks between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) from Nov. 3-7 will
focus on the opening of direct shipping links and the expansion of air services
between the two sides, Lai said, the negotiations will also benefit the Penghu
Islands.</P>
      <P>If a shorter route is established between Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport
and Shanghai airports, this would boost the appeal of the island group to more
Chinese tourists because of Penghu's location, he said.</P>
      <P>The Penghu Islands are located in the Taiwan Strait -- some 140 km south east of
mainland China.</P>
      <P>A straighter route between Taipei and Shanghai could help reduce the flying time
by 62 minutes to 82 minutes, and as much as NT$3 billion (US$915 million) could
be saved in carriers' operating costs and travelers' expenditure, Lai said.</P>
      <P>In terms of cross-strait cargo shipping, he said, this could help to bring down
consumer product prices in Penghu because staple commodities, construction
materials and daily necessities could be imported directly from China.</P>

      <P>Local pro-Taiwan independence groups announced Friday that they will launch a
"Safeguard Taiwan Week" movement starting Nov. 3 in opposition to the visit of
China's top negotiator Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>"Our appeals are to safeguard (the country's) sovereignty and protect Taiwan, "
Lo Chih-cheng, secretary-general of the Taiwan Society, one of the organizing
groups, said at a news conference.</P>
      <P>The series of activities, which will continue until Nov. 7 when Chen Yunlin, the
president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, is
scheduled to leave the island, "would demonstrate Taiwan's public opinion," Lo
contended.</P>
      <P>The groups called upon Taiwan's people to stand up and make their voices heard
by the international community.</P>
      <P>The organizers suggested five ways to show support for Taiwan and object to
Chen's visit, such as wearing clothes with protest slogans or joining the vigil
held by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and other local pro-
independence groups.</P>
      <P>They also encouraged people to phone, fax or e-mail the Grand Hotel, where Chen
will stay during his landmark visit, to protest the more than 1,000 missiles
China has targeted at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Balloons reading "Taiwan is my country" will be distributed in venues such as
Taipei Railway Station and at exits of the city's major metro stations.</P>
      <P>Chen's delegation will meet with their counterparts from the quasi-official
Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation to sign agreements on the expansion of
chartered passenger flights between Taiwan and China, the launch of direct
shipping and postal links and the establishment of a mechanism to deal with food
safety issues.</P>
      <P>Chen's visit has proven controversial, with the DPP and pro-independence groups
looking to take advantage of it to vent their doubts over closer ties with China
and protest Beijing's threat to use force against Taiwan if it were to declare
independence.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A promising new drug that can inhibit cancer development has been transferred
from its developers, two universities in Taiwan, to a multinational
pharmaceutical company, which will continue research and development on the
medication, academic sources reported Friday.</P>
      <P>According to National Taiwan University (NTU) in Taipei and National Cheng Kung
University (NCKU) in Tainan, the drug -- an inhibitor against integrin protein
"alpha-nu-beta-3 (\v]3) " -- will be released to the Taiwanese subsidiary of
U.S.-based Anchen Pharmaceuticals under an agreement signed Oct. 30 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chuang Woei-jer, a professor of medicine at NCKU, explained that the integrin
alpha-nu-beta-3 adheres one cell to another, which can inadvertently trigger
angiogenesis -- a process whereby cancer cells encourage the growth of extra
blood vessels to acquire additional nutrition.</P>
      <P>By inhibiting the alpha-nu-beta-3, Chuang said, the drug -- dubbed "alpha-nu-
beta-3 disintegrin" -- can effectively suppress angiogenesis and the activity of
osteoclasts -- a kind of cell that destroys bone cells.</P>
      <P>When osteoclasts are over-excited, they can lead a cancer to metastasize to the
bones.</P>
      <P>Once angiogenesis and osteoclasts are moderated, the tumorous cells will lose
their vitality and become more susceptible to the curative powers of other
drugs, Chuang said.</P>
      <P>Fu Wen-mei, a professor of medicine at NTU, said the new drug can be used to
treat cancer's metastasis  to the bones,  macular degeneration, and
osteoporosis.</P>
      <P>Potential annual sales of the drug have been estimated at no less than NT$30
billion (about US$910 million), Fu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH foresees better management of medicine herb imports from China</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan will take steps to ensure the safety of Chinese medicine herbs imported
from China, as soon as the two sides forge a food-safety agreement that is
expected to stem the inflow of substandard food products from the mainland, an
official at Taiwan's Department of Health (DOH) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Food safety is one of major issues on the agenda of the upcoming talks between
Chiang Pin-kun, chairman of Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation,
and Chen Yun-ling, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits, when the two meet in Taipei in early November.</P>
      <P>The issue took center stage with the exposure last month of a toxic milk power
incident in China that swiftly expanded into global concern over China-produced
substandard food products.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-hsin, chairman of the DOH Committee on Chinese Medicine and Pharmacy,
said that once the two sides seal the food safety agreement, the committee will
seek quality certification of all medicine herbs imported from China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan consumes more than 10,000 tons of medicine herbs, which are used not only
in traditional Chinese medical treatment, but also as culinary ingredients due
to their health benefits.</P>
      <P>While 90 percent of these herbs, in a wide variety, are imported from China, it
has been difficult for the Taiwanese health authorities to control the quality
because there has been no clear channel between the two sides for the management
of herbal medicine, Lin admitted.</P>
      <P>The quality of China-produced medicine herbs on the Taiwan market at present is
mixed, the official said, adding that quite often such imports are found to
contain toxic substances like aflatoxin and heavy metals.</P>
      <P>However, the problem will be addressed if the two sides sign the agreement on
food safety, Lin said, explaining that Chinese medicine herbs are categorized as
food products.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that the DOH committee has been making efforts over the past years to
promote the management of Chinese medicine ingredients. It recently completed
work on the proper labeling of these products, and is currently working to set
standards on the permissible levels of toxic substances in medicine herbs, he
said.</P>
      <P>The committee will later concentrate on ensuring the safety of medicine herb
sources in China, Lin added.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan approved an NT$10 billion (US$303 million) plan Friday
that will create temporary jobs and help people in need, beginning Nov. 1, the
Executive Yuan said in a statement released Friday.</P>
      <P>The plan will create an estimated 46,000 short-term jobs for unemployed workers
by the end of this year, the Executive Yuan said, and provide another 56,000
temporary placements for the jobless in the first half of 2009.</P>
      <P>Some NT$3.1 billion of the funds for the program have been earmarked from this
year's government budget, while the remaining NT$6 billion will be part of the
government's spending for next year, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Short-term jobs offered in the program will mainly be in the public sector,
including street cleaning, community services and river inspection.</P>
      <P>The measure is part of the government's efforts to boost employment at a time
when the jobless rate is rising due to the global economic downturn.</P>

      <P>Three major foreign trade and business groups issued a joint statement Friday
welcoming next week's talks between Taiwan and China in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In their joint statement, the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei, the
European Chamber of Commerce Taipei, and the Japanese Chamber of Commerce &amp;
Industry Taipei called for substantial progress in the negotiations between
Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), from Nov. 3-7.</P>
      <P>The upcoming  negotiations  between  the two quasi-official intermediary bodies
will provide a landmark opportunity for the two sides to remove the long-term
obstacles between them and are set to benefit  Taiwan greatly because they will
help boost Taiwan's interaction with one of the world's fast-growing
powerhouses, they said.</P>
      <P>If a breakthrough could be made on the extension of the current cross-strait
weekend passenger charter flights to every day of the week and in the opening of
direct air cargo services and shipping links, it would definitely help rebuild
the confidence of both Taiwanese and foreign companies, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The three major foreign business associations also asserted that foreign
enterprises will station more workers in Taiwan if they can dispatch personnel
from Taiwan to China in a more convenient and efficient manner.</P>
      <P>In a bid to maintain fair market competition, they also expressed the hope that
foreign shippers could also be included in the direct shipping program to help
them reduce operating costs and boost efficiency.</P>
      <P>They said they are looking forward to enhanced cooperation between Taiwan and

      <P>The Executive Yuan has approved a visa program aimed at attracting highly
qualified foreign personnel to come to Taiwan for academic exchanges, employment
or investment, a government economic planner said Friday.</P>
      <P>"Under the program, three special cards -- an academic and commercial travel
card, an employment pass and a 'plum blossom' permanent residency card -- will
be issued from next year to attract outstanding foreign professionals," said San
Gee, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>According to San, the CEPD-proposed special visa program emulates the United
States' green card, the European Union's blue card, South Korea's IT card, gold
card and science card in loosening restrictions on the entry of highly qualified
foreign personnel to make them more willing to come to Taiwan to share
professional expertise or invest in local industries.</P>
      <P>"Under the program, procedures for persons of international repute and senior
professionals to apply for entry and residency will be simplified in line with
the global trend of attracting outstanding talent," San added.</P>
      <P>He further explained that international heavyweights in their fields who want to
enter Taiwan for purposes other than work will be issued "academic and
commercial travel cards" valid for up to three years, with no limit on the
number of visits and eligible to stay for a maximum of 30 days on each visit.</P>
      <P>Highly qualified foreign personnel intending to take a job in Taiwan will be
issued a "four-in-one" card known as an "employment pass, " which incorporates a
visa, work permit, alien resident's certificate and re-entry permit, San said.</P>
      <P>For those intending to immigrate to Taiwan based on their professional expertise
or investment,  "plum blossom" permanent residency cards will be issued, San
said.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior will flesh out detailed regulations covering
application  procedures,  required  documents  and qualifications, the CEPD
official added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a CEPD proposal to exempt graduates of the world's top 100
universities from a requirement that they must have two years of experience
before they can work in Taiwan has not yet been approved by the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>"In light of the current high domestic unemployment rate, the Cabinet has
demanded that the CEPD come up with more extensive complementary measures before
opening the door wider to graduates of world famous universities, in order not
to affect local college graduates' job opportunities," San said.</P>
      <P>In his view, he said, it would be regrettable that a new graduate from Harvard
University would be denied the opportunity to work in Taiwan simply because he
or she failed to meet the work experience requirement.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan wants to upgrade its service industry, it should take bold steps to
ease restrictions regarding the hiring of highly qualified immigrant workers,"
San added.</P>
