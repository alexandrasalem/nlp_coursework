    <HEADLINE>Over 910kg hog selected as top offering at Zushiye temple</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A hog weighing more than 900 kilograms was selected in a competition as the
premier offering at a traditional temple ceremony in Sansia township, Taipei
County, Saturday.</P>
      <P>On Jan. 6 each year on the lunar calendar, the Qingshui Zushiye Temple in Sansia
celebrates the birthday of a deity known as zushiye, who is enshrined at the
temple famous for its artistic carvings.</P>
      <P>In Chinese, zushiye means the founder of a sect of Buddhism or Taoism.</P>
      <P>The Qingshui zushiye was a Buddhist monk who lived in Anxi in the Fujien area in
southeastern China 1047-1101 A.D. After his death, the locals deified him as
their tutelary god.</P>
      <P>When they moved to Taiwan, the Anxi people brought a statue of the god to the
island and developed a special religious culture in the Taipei county area
covering Sansia, Yingge, Tucheng and Dashi to worship the god.</P>
      <P>Every year, "sacred hogs" are selected in a competition and presented as
offerings on the birthday of the god.</P>
      <P>According to legend, those who touch the sacred hogs are blessed, while those
who pull out the hairs of the deified animal will gain wisdom and those who eat
the meat will live safely and well.</P>
      <P>A total of four hogs were entered in the contest this year, with the top prize
winner weighing over 910 kg -- the largest hog in nearly five years, according
to the organizer.</P>
      <P>The temple was packed Saturday with tourists and people praying for good luck,
including Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei.</P>

direction and found that my student cannot himself see its bearings into other
directions, I do not then repeat my lesson."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Hu's six-point overture will guide China's ties with Taiwan: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1 (CNA)
02/01/09  15:09:16
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The six-point overture on the peaceful development of cross-strait ties that
Chinese President Hu Jintao spelled out recently can be seen as a framework for
China's policy toward Taiwan in the year to come, an official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Hu's six-point overture, however, indicates that the "one-China" principle
remains Beijing's bottom line, from which it will never budge an inch, said Chao
Chien-min, a vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>In a Dec. 31 statement marking the 30th anniversary of the adoption of China's
"peaceful reunification" policy toward Taiwan, Hu renewed the call for the two
sides to negotiate under the "one-China" principle to end cross-strait
hostilities and to sign a peace accord.</P>
      <P>He suggested  the political  basis for promoting  peaceful development of the
cross-strait relations should rest on the concept that "both the mainland and
Taiwan belong to one China."</P>
      <P>Hu also proposed closer economic cooperation and reasonable arrangements to
address Taiwan's efforts to join international organizations.</P>
      <P>Chao said Hu's six-point overture will definitely be the major plank in shaping
China's policies toward Taiwan in the future, adding that it appears that the
eight-point  proposal  made by Hu's predecessor,  Jiang Zemin,  on the
development of cross-strait relations has already been swept into the dust of
history.</P>
      <P>"It's only a matter of time before the 'Hu six-point overture' is written into
the charters of the Communist Party of China, " Chao forecast.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, President Ma Ying-jeou's office has not yet made a concise or
concrete response to Hu's proposals.</P>
      <P>In its initial response on Jan. 1, the Presidential Office commented positively
on the "new mindset and pragmatism" of the Chinese authorities, but stressed
that as a pluralistic society, Taiwan's people have diverse views about the
country's future and that different political views and expressions have to be
respected.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office reiterated the "1992 consensus, " which allows Taipei
and Beijing to agree to disagree on the meaning of "one China, " and the
principle of "mutual non-denial" as a reminder to China about Taiwan's stance on
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>On Jan. 6,  Ma said Taiwan has to learn more about the connotations of the
policy implications for Taiwan in China's latest cross-strait proposal.</P>
      <P>The Ma administration has also called for economics to take precedence over
politics at this time and reiterated the island's desire to participate in
international organizations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai Wei, a professor at Chinese Culture University's Sun Yat-sen
Graduate Institute, said from Hu's overture one can discern that China has not
and will never let go of its "one-China" principle as far as cross-Taiwan Strait
relations are concerned.</P>
      <P>"Hu's proposals could at best be viewed as a change in the way Beijing is
articulating its 'one-China' principle," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>"Hu's call for both sides to open up 'international space, ' end cross-strait
hostilities and build mutual trust could be seen as new approach that
nonetheless still lacks concrete, positive action, " Tsai contended.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan needs a newspaper that reflects people's voices: ex-VP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 1 (CNA)
02/01/09  15:55:18
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Vice President Annette Lu, who held her first fundraiser Sunday for a
proposed midday newspaper, said that Taiwan needs a publication that reflects
the views of the people, as there is perception abroad that the whole country is
on board with the new government's policies.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks at the first luncheon to raise funds for the midday paper,
which will be called the Formosa Post, or Yushan (Mt. Jade) noon paper in
Chinese. The event was attended by some 60 guests, including former Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, Taiwan Solidarity Union Chairman
Huang Kun-huei, and former Judicial Yuan Vice President Cheng Chung-mo.</P>
      <P>Lu said that during a recent trip to Washington D.C. to attend the inauguration
of U.S. President Barack Obama, she was disconcerted to learn that the United
States thinks there is no need to worry about cross-Taiwan Strait affairs now
that the new Taiwan government is leaning toward China.</P>
      <P>She said she got a strong message from her friends in the U.S. that the
government there has the impression that everything the Taiwan administration
does has the approval of the population, as there is no conflict between Taiwan
and China and there are no dissenting voices among the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, based on the basic principles of the Taiwan Relations Act, the U.S.
does not have to mind that (cross-strait) business too much," Lu quoted her
friends as saying.</P>
      <P>However, the former vice president stressed that while there are diverse views
in Taiwan, they are not loud or clear enough to be heard.</P>
      <P>"Washington is under the impression that, like an obedient child, Taiwan is
gradually marching toward China," Lu said. "As long as there are no other
voices, the U.S. has nothing to be concerned about."</P>
      <P>Cross-strait relations between Taiwan and China have improved significantly
since President Ma Ying-jeou took office May 20, 2008 and adopted a series of
pragmatic policies to open economic exchanges with Beijing.</P>
      <P>However, the DPP has expressed fears that the strategic shift by the government
to prioritize its partnership with China may come at the expense of Taiwan's
sovereignty and national interests.</P>
      <P>"My trip to Washington solidified my resolution to establish the Formosa Post,
as Taiwan needs a newspaper to unify people who love Taiwan, so as to normalize,
globalize and enrich the country," the former vice president said.</P>
      <P>"Together we can make it," she added.</P>
      <P>Noting that Obama would not have been the president were it not for the sound
democratic system in the U.S., Lu said Taiwan has many new challenges to face,
as its democracy is not yet fully developed or perfect.</P>
      <P>She urged people to join and subscribe to her midday paper, which she said will
serve as a launch pad for a "civic journalists' movement" in Taiwan, to bring
hope in times of despair and to show the world a better Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the newspaper, which will go on sale at 3 p.m. daily, will
focus on local and international politics, culture, science and technology, as
well as on other events and values.</P>

    <HEADLINE>46% of office workers in Taiwan affected by unpaid leave: survey</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1 (CNA)
02/01/09  16:28:53

    <TEXT>
      <P>The practice of sending workers on unpaid leave has been growing among
production companies in Taiwan since October last year, and the domestic job
market may see another wave of layoffs in the first quarter of 2009, the
Internet-based 1111 Job Bank warned Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ryan Wu, chief operating officer of 1111 Job Bank, said an online survey
conducted recently by his organization showed that 46 percent of Taiwan's office
workers had been told to take up to 10 days of unpaid leave each month since
October.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, office workers sent on unpaid leave have seen their
monthly wages reduced by one-third on average. Some 20 percent have thought of
looking for another job, and 80 percent appeared to be depressed about the
situation, the survey found.</P>
      <P>Noting that some enterprises have asked some of their employees to take an
additional month of unpaid leave following the nine-day Lunar New Year holiday,
Wu said it seems unlikely that the strategy will be dropped by the end of March,
as many people are hoping.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the results of the latest survey conducted by the Cabinet-level
Council of Labor Affairs showed that among those enterprises that have a
workforce of over 200 people, 18 percent have resorted to unpaid leave as a
means of coping with their difficulties caused by the ongoing global economic
downturn and financial crisis. It was estimated that more than 200,000 office
workers had been affected.</P>
      <P>Earlier statistics released by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) in late December showed that as a result of the unpaid leave
practice, 741,000 people were working fewer than 35 hours per week in November,
an increase of 205,000 people over October's total of 536,000.</P>
      <P>Other DGBAS figures showed that the number of unemployed people in Taiwan
totaled 549,000 in December 2008, the highest since October 2003. The figure
represented an increase of 4.64 percent over October last year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top tourism official expressed confidence Sunday in the domestic
tourist market, saying that she believes it can spur economic development
despite the global financial crisis, and that the tourism industry will
eventually help turn the tide if it perseveres.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has been putting a lot of effort into promoting
international and domestic tourism over the years, Tourism Bureau Director-
General Janice Lai told the Central News Agency that the government's recent
shopping voucher program will help to create a virtuous business cycle.</P>
      <P>Some 91 percent of eligible Taiwan citizens had picked up their NT$3,600
(US$107) worth of vouchers by Jan. 18. The vouchers are the business end of an
NT$85.7 billion program that is part of the government's economic stimulus
package.</P>
      <P>With every city and county in Taiwan launching various promotion drives to
encourage people to spend their vouchers, the program is expected to help expand
Taiwan's economic growth by about 0.66 percentage points or more, according to
Council for Economic Planning and Development Chairman Chen Tain-jy recently.</P>
      <P>"While the tourism industry might be suffering amid the economic downturn,
springtime will soon come, as long as we hang in there and wait out the bitter
winter," Lai said.</P>
      <P>Noting that during the 10-year bubble economy in the late 1980s Japan still
managed to create many successful hot spring businesses, Lai said "as long as
one has good products, there is no need to worry about reduced purchasing
power."</P>
      <P>She cited the example of a Japanese karaoke club owner who bought up many hot
spring hotels that were close to bankruptcy during the bubble economy and
launched a low-price self-service accommodation package that attracted many
customers because of the good value of the product.</P>
      <P>Urging the public to travel more within the country, Lai said she hoped that the
various tourism packages being offered by county and city governments will serve
to restore confidence in the domestic travel market.</P>
      <P>On the regional front, the number of Japanese tourists to Taiwan has been
declining recently, as more Japanese are choosing to travel to South Korea
because the yen remains strong against the weakening South Korean won.</P>
      <P>Lai, however, expressed confidence in Taiwan's tourism market, saying that
Taiwan remains an attractive tourism destination for Japanese visitors because
it offers high quality travel packages and great tourism spots.</P>
      <P>As for tourism from China, Lai said six months after the Taiwan government
opened up to allow more Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan, the number of Chinese
visitors has been gradually increasing and is expected to continue to grow.</P>
      <P>Another important tourism market is Southeast Asia, Lai said, adding that the
government will try to relax the visa process to attract more tourists from
countries like Singapore and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, there were some 3.84 million visitors to Taiwan in 2008, a
number that fell short of the goal of the "Tour Taiwan Years 2008-2009" program.</P>
      <P>The program, which was launched Feb. 15, 2008, aimed to attract four million
international tourists in 2008 and 4.25 million in 2009. However, according to
the top tourism official, the decreased number of Japanese tourists was the main
reason for the failure to reach the target. She vowed to work all out to attain
the goal of attracting four million international tourists this year.</P>

      <P>The Taiwanese box office hit "Cape No. 7" will premiere in China in mid-
February, giving Chinese movie goers some insight into Taiwanese culture and way
of thinking, a movie source said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The film was to be shown in China before the Lunar New Year holiday, but the
screening was postponed due to censor procedures. However, Chinese authorities
recently gave the green light for it to premiere there around Feb. 14,
Valentine's Day, which is also considered in the movie industry as a major box-
office season.</P>
      <P>"Cape No. 7, " released in 2008, is the highest grossing locally produced movie
of all time in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As one of the promotional tie-ins, millet wine, which is seen many times in the
film, will be offered at theaters in 12 cities around China Feb. 15-28, said
Qian Junyan, a vice president of Wanda International Cinema, Shanghai. The 12
Chinese cities are Beijing, Harbin, Huizhou, Jinjiang, Shanghai, Dongguan,
Nanchang, Nanning, Ningbo, Chengdu, Changsha and Nanjing, Qian said.</P>
      <P>Preferential  tickets will be sold at the Shanghai  Wanda International Cinema
seven days in advance of the premiere in a promotional strategy to spur
competition for tickets and thus make "Cape No. 7" more popular, Qian added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to Qian, ticket buyers will have a chance to take part in a
lucky draw for a five-day travel package to Taiwan to see in person the filming
locations in the southern county of Pingtung.</P>
      <P>The prize will be awarded to 10 winners, who will travel from Beijing to Taiwan
and spend one day in Kaohsiung, two days in Pingtung and two days in Taiwan's
only landlocked county of Nantou, Qian said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, "Cape No. 7" is also expected to premiere at the 15th Vesoul
International Film Festival of Asian Cinema slated for Feb. 10-17 in France.</P>
      <P>"Cape No. 7" has been nominated in the unreleased feature films section of the
"Faces of Asian Contemporary Cinema" category, and will compete with other films
from China, South Korea, India, Indonesia, Iran, Kazakhstan, the Philippines and
Sri Lanka, according to Jean-Marc Therouanne, the founder of the film festival.</P>
      <P>Therouanne told the Central News Agency recently that "Cape No. 7" has been
shortlisted because it is an interesting film that has become very popular not
only in Taiwan but also in Southeast Asia.</P>

      <P>Following the launch of the 15-day 2009 Pingsi International Lantern Festival on
Jan. 26, the annual event is set to reach its climax on Feb. 9, with the release
of thousands of sky lanterns carrying wishes written by people in the hope of
bringing good luck and happiness to their loved ones in the new year.</P>
      <P>Pingsi township in the northern county of Taipei has been the center of sky
lantern activities in the last few years, attracting around 30,000 foreign and
local visitors each year on Lantern Festival day, which is celebrated 15 days
after the Lunar New Year.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the Taipei county government which first organized the grand
celebration  of the festival 10 years ago,  the Pingsi festivities have become
the most representative Lantern Festival event in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to folklore, the lanterns, which are actually miniature hot-air
balloons, bring good luck to the people who launch them. The higher a lantern
rises, the more good luck it brings, the legend claims.</P>
      <P>A local Pingsi elder surnamed Chen told the Central News Agency that there are
three different stories about the origins of sky lanterns.</P>
      <P>"According to one popular story, the sky lantern, or Kongming Lantern, was
invented for the purpose of military communication by Zhuge Kongming -- a noted
sage and military strategist in Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period in
220-280 A.D.," Chen said. "It was called Kongming Lantern because the shape of
it resembled the hat that Zhuge Kongming was traditionally shown to be wearing."</P>
      <P>Others have said that the tradition dates back to the Qing Dynasty in the late
18th century when village watchmen would release the lanterns to tell people in
the mountain areas that they were safe from bandits.</P>
      <P>The tradition was brought to Pingsi and Shihfen townships in Taipei County by
immigrants from Fujian Province in China and was also known as "lantern for
blessings," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Another story regarding the origins of the sky lantern is that in 1928 when
Shihfen township was occupied by the Japanese army, people would release
lanterns into the sky to signal those taking refuge in the mountains that it was
safe to return.</P>
      <P>The Taipei county government has a total of 10,000 ox-shaped sky lanterns, in
celebration of the Year of the Ox, to hand out to visitors who wish to send
their New Year's wishes to the gods, according to the county's Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>This year's sky lantern celebrations began on Chinese New Year's Day, Jan. 26,
and will run through Feb. 9, Lantern Festival day.</P>
      <P>The celebrations feature three main events -- a smaller event at Chingtung
Elementary School on Jan. 31 and larger-scale extravaganzas at Pingsi Junior
High School on Feb. 7 and at "Sky Lantern Square" in Shihfen township on Feb. 9.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Opening hours at Taipei Zoo back to normal</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Taipei Zoo decided Sunday to revert to its normal opening hours, from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m. daily, beginning Monday, after seven consecutive days of extended
service during the Chinese New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>The zoo had extended its opening hours to between 8: 45 a.m. and 5: 30 p.m. for
seven days to accommodate a record number of visitors, as it debuted its two
giant pandas -- Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan -- from Sichuan province in southwestern
China.</P>
      <P>Under a daily quota system, 22,000 people per day visited the panda house in the
7-day period starting Jan. 26 to watch the two rare bamboo-eating animals, said
Jason Yeh, head of the zoo.</P>
      <P>The free shuttle buses between the zoo and a MRT station, which were operating
during the Lunar New Year holiday, will also be suspended from Monday, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, tallies show that a total of 175,386 people visited the Taipei
Zoo in the first six days of the New Year holiday, marking a 100 percent
increase year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Yeh estimated that some 40,000 people would have been visiting the zoo Sunday,
the last day of the Lunar New Year holiday, although only a maximum of 22,000
would be allowed to see the pandas.</P>
      <P>Since their arrival in Taiwan Dec. 23, 2008, Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan have
triggered a media frenzy befitting the arrival of a major world leader or rock
star, with many in Taiwan hardly able to contain their excitement.</P>
      <P>The male Tuan Tuan and female Yuan Yuan, both four years old, were not put on
public display until Jan. 26 because they had to remain in quarantine for at
least a month.</P>
      <P>The two rare animals were a gift from Beijing that many critics said was part of
its strategy to unify China and Taiwan. The combined name of the two pandas --
Tuan Yuan -- means reunion in Chinese.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP plans to set up social movements department</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) plans to set up a department
of social movements and to conduct an overall assessment of the government's
performance, as part of its effort to push for reform, a DPP official said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>In line with the DPP's designation of 2009 as the year of social movements, DPP
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen recently instructed a party reform team to study issues
related to the establishment of a social movements department, a party official
said.</P>
      <P>This would require revising the party's organization law to prepare for constant
engagement in street protests, according to the official.</P>
      <P>Under Tsai's reform plan, for the first five months of this year the DPP will
focus on soliciting opinions from all sectors of the society and forging
consensus through discourse and discussion, the official added.</P>
      <P>During this period, the DPP will hold a civic conference on national affairs to
educate local citizens on their right to assemble peacefully and to vote in
referendums, and also to instill the concept of Taiwan's national sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The party might also hold a rally for the unemployed on May 1, Labor Day.</P>
      <P>Tsai called on reform-minded youths aged 30 to 40 to join the preparatory
meetings for the national affairs conference and to contribute their ideas for
reform of the party and of the country.</P>
      <P>In the second phase of the plan, the DPP will assess the performance of
President Ma Ying-jeou's administration before the end of its first year in
power on May 20, the official said.</P>
      <P>With the ruling Kuomintang  and its allies holding nearly three-fourths of the
seats in the legislature, the DPP has no other option but to resort to street
demonstrations to carry out its function of providing checks and balances and to
guard against abuse of power, according to the official.</P>
      <P>The concept of establishing a social movements department was the brainchild of
former Premier Frank Hsieh, the official added.</P>
      <P>In related news, an academic said Sunday that the DPP chairwoman, while seeking
reform on many fronts, should come up with solutions to the crises and problems
the country is facing.</P>
      <P>Describing Tsai's move to solicit public opinions as just a starting point for
party reform, Soochow University political science professor Lo Chih-cheng said
that she should work hard to strengthen communication  and build  mutual  trust
with civic groups  by demonstrating her sincerity.</P>
      <P>Lo said that in pushing for reform, Tsai will inevitably have to demonstrate
her political power by leading her party to win elections.</P>
      <P>This includes the two legislative by-elections slated to be held in Miaoli
County March 14 and in Taipei City's Daan district March 28, and the year-end
elections for county magistrates and city mayors around the country, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gov't working to reduce alcohol abuse among indigenous people</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will continue promoting its policy to help reduce alcohol abuse
among the country's aboriginal people, after initial signs of progress in this
area, said officials at the Cabinet-level Council of Indigenous Peoples Sunday.</P>
      <P>Last year, 12 of the more than 30 aboriginal townships across the country joined
the council's efforts and succeeded in bringing down alcohol use among their
residents to 53.1 percent, an average reduction of 7.6 percent compared to the
2007 ratio, said Council Minister Chang Jen-hsiang.</P>
      <P>Chang called for greater participation by indigenous people in her council's
efforts so as to help decrease the number of injuries and accidents among them
resulting from alcohol use and to take better care of their health.</P>
      <P>The mortality rate among Taiwan's aboriginal peoples is four to five times than
that of the rest of the population, and the leading causes of death among the
indigenous people are malignant tumor, liver diseases and accidents -- all of
which are closely related to alcohol abuse, Chang said.</P>
      <P>National Yang Ming University professor Kuo Shien-wen, who is in charge of a
project launched by the council in 2005 to curb alcohol abuse among the
indigenous people, said 12 aboriginal townships joined the project in 2007,
while four withdrew and another four later entered the program.</P>
      <P>Last year, seven of the eight townships actively participating in the program
posted an average decline of 7.6 percent in the number of alcohol consumers
among their residents from a year ago, recording a 53.1 percent alcohol use for
2008, he said.</P>
      <P>Wulai township in northern Taiwan's Taipei County had the largest annual
decrease of 24.9 percent in 2008, followed by Heping township in central
Taiwan's Taichung County with 17.6 percent, and Namasia township in southern
Kaohsiung County with 16 percent, he added.</P>
      <P>Kuo said there is room for greater efforts to be made in this regard, as there
are over 800 aboriginal tribes scattered throughout more than 30 townships
across the country.</P>
      <P>"So far, the anti-alcohol program has been advocated in a dozen townships
nationwide," he said.</P>
      <P>In 2009, the Council of Indigenous Peoples will allocate an some NT$10 million
(US$298,000) -- an increase of NT$7 million from last year -- to continue the
program, he added.</P>
      <P>Due to long-term disadvantages encountered in the society, a large percent of
aboriginal people of both genders, have developed the habit of drinking alcohol
as a way of dealing with their problems.</P>

      <P>The current legislature's third session, scheduled to begin Feb. 20, will focus
on bills aimed at reviving the national  economy  and addressing  issues related
to people's livelihood, the legislative caucus of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
indicated Sunday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yang Chiung-ying, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus, told
reporters that the first and foremost item on the legislative  agenda will be
the special  budget bill for the government's expanded public construction
program.</P>
      <P>Under the investment plan devised by the Cabinet, she noted, NT$500 billion

      <P>A month-long festival of tranquility kicked off Sunday on Yushan, Taiwan's
highest peak, during which mountain climbing activities will not be allowed on
any of the peaks that form the imposing mountain range.</P>
      <P>The tranquility festival followed a three-day mountain cleanup drive that began
Jan. 30, with environmentalists and mountain climbing enthusiasts cleaning up
major mountain trails from Tataka Anbu/Saddle entrance to the main peak of
Yushan, also known as Jade Mountain.</P>
      <P>The Yushan National Park Administration staged a Tsou aboriginal mountain deity
worshipping rite at the Tataka Anbu/Saddle entrance to Yushan at around noon to
symbolize the start of the month-long closure of the mountain range to any
hiking or mountain climbing activities.</P>
      <P>It marked the fifth consecutive year that a one-month tranquility festival was
being observed as part of efforts to protect the natural environment, ecology
and wildlife of Taiwan's sacred mountain.</P>
      <P>At an elevation of 3,952 meters, Yushan is the highest peak not only in Taiwan,
but also in East Asia. The mountain range in central-southern Taiwan has 22
peaks that rise higher than 3,000 meters and 12 of them are listed among

    <HEADLINE>Tobacco surcharge hike will help smokers quit habit: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1 (CNA)
02/01/09  21:22:19

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although smokers are complaining over an impending increase in the tobacco
surcharge from NT$10 (US$0.29) to NT$20 per packet after a recent law amendment,
a government official said Sunday that the higher price should spur smokers to
quit the habit.</P>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Vice Minister Cheng Shou-shia said he thinks that the
higher surcharge, which will raise the price of cigarettes from the current
NT$55 to NT$70 per pack, will push some people to stop smoking in these hard
economic times.</P>
      <P>The current average price of cigarettes in Taiwan is quite low compared to other
countries or areas like Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Australia, Cheng
noted.</P>
      <P>Despite the planned surcharge hike, cigarette prices in Taiwan will remain lower
than most other countries in Asia, he said.</P>
      <P>The tobacco surcharge increase is expected to help generate an additional NT$18
billion per year in national revenue, pulling in about NT$38 billion this year,
he said, citing DOH estimates.</P>
      <P>Ninety percent of that NT$38 billion will go toward the estimated NT$45 billion
spent annually on treating smoking-related diseases included in the national
health insurance program, while nine percent will be allotted for the DOH's
cancer prevention campaigns and its vaccine injection projects and medical care
programs in remote areas, he explained.</P>
      <P>All the above-mentioned measures are expected to benefit some 500,000 people,
including rare disease patients, underprivileged and elderly citizens and
toddlers, according to the DOH vice minister.</P>
      <P>The remaining 1 percent of revenue from the surcharge will go toward supporting
government crackdowns on the smuggling of tobacco products, in line with the
law, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Prospects for cross-strait tourism seen as uncertain</HEADLINE>

02/01/09  21:29:22
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although both Taiwan and China took concrete steps last year to upgrade cross-
Taiwan Strait tourism, the number of tourist arrivals from China has fallen
short of the average daily target of 1000 people, casting doubts over the future
prospects of the business, industry sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to Chang Chih-yuan, owner of E Trip tour agency based in central
Taiwan's Taichung City, the problem is rooted in the many restrictions imposed
by the governments on both sides, rather than in the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Taiwan government restrictions, such as the condition that only groups of more
than five members are allowed to visit and that they must enter and depart the
country at the same time, have discouraged many individual Chinese businessmen
who are most likely to visit Taiwan and to spend heavily, he said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government's stipulation of the type and price of accommodation that
Chinese tourists must take is another obstacle to the free development of the
market, Chang noted, adding that free market competition will settle the issue
itself.</P>
      <P>What the government should do is set up a sound system to monitor business
practices,  instead of imposing such regulations,  he suggested.</P>
      <P>In line with the terms of an accord signed by Taiwan and China last November,
the two sides agreed to operate a maximum of 108 charters each week, based on a
framework established in July when they began allowing non-stop cross-strait
charters on weekends.</P>
      <P>Taiwan opened eight of its airports to local and China-based airlines plying the
daily cross-strait charter flights, but the aviation companies have concentrated
most of their business on four of the airports. These are Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport in northern Taiwan, Taichung
Chingchuankang Airport in central Taiwan and Kaohsiung International Airport in
the south.</P>
      <P>In China, the number of destinations for the direct cross-strait charters were
increased from five to 21 when the flight service was upgraded to a daily one in
mid-December last year.</P>
      <P>However, he added, only a small number of 33 Chinese travel agencies have been
given permission to arrange tours to Taiwan and the limited number of direct
charter flights  between popular destinations on the two sides have dampened the
interest of many people who were keen to cash in on the business.</P>
      <P>Too many unnecessary government restrictions will only hamper market mechanisms,
Chang contended.</P>
      <P>With the governments on both sides interfering in the market, it is difficult to
predict when cross-strait tourism would fully take off, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan is facing a long-existing gap in cross-strait tourism
revenue, which Chang said has become a thorny issue for all concerned.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese people make more than 2 million visits to China every year, while less
than 10 percent of Chinese tourists traveling abroad come to Taiwan, he said.
"This is a serious issue that both Taiwan government authorities and the private
sector must address."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taichung City offers subsidy for LPG vehicle conversion</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taichung city government announced Sunday that this year it will offer
another 300 vehicles owners a subsidy of NT$30,000 each to remodel their cars to
run on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).</P>
      <P>However, only owners of vehicles less than five years old are allowed to apply
to modify their cars for LPG, said Lee Li-de, director of the city's Bureau of
Environmental Protection.</P>
      <P>He noted that 90 percent of the vehicles in the city that are under five years
old have already been remodeled to run on LPG, with the help of the city
subsidy.</P>
      <P>The growing popularity of LPG vehicles is reflected in the volume of fuel sales,
according to Lee, who said that the two LPG filling stations in the city sold a
total of 9,158 kiloliters of fuel last year, which represented an increase of 91
percent from the 2007 level.</P>
      <P>Because of the high number of LPG-fueled vehicles in the city, carbon dioxide
emissions dropped by 2,708 tons last year from the 2007 level, Lee said, adding
that the reduction was equivalent to what would be absorbed by 225,694 trees.</P>
      <P>Lee said that given the growing popularity of LPG vehicles, it is expected that
more LPG filling stations will be established in the city.</P>
      <P>Last year, licenses were granted for the opening of three private LPG filling
stations, one of which will become operational around the middle of this year to
relieve the inconvenience that LPG car drivers have endured, he added.</P>
      <P>The subsidy program is aimed at encouraging more vehicle owners to switch to LPG
to help reduce air pollution, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He noted the cost of running a vehicle on LPG fuel is NT$0.38/per kilometer less
than on unleaded gasoline because the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) has been subsidizing the cost of LPG vehicle fuel to the
tune of NT$2 per liter. This means that LPG vehicle owners can save fuel costs
of around NT$20,000 a year, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan presided Sunday over an inter-ministerial brainstorming
session aimed at pooling the resources of various government agencies to create
more jobs and alleviate the soaring unemployment rate amid the lingering global
economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan sources said the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) was expected to come up with a report on the current job market situation
at the meeting, which was attended by top officials from the Council of Labor
Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Transportation and
communications, the Ministry of the Interior and the Public Construction
Commission.</P>
      <P>Also high on the agenda were conclusions reached at a similar inter-agency
meeting chaired by Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung Saturday.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu will report to President Ma Ying-jeou Monday on any concrete
programs devised at the Sunday session, the sources said.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Liu has kept close tabs on Taiwan's job situation
since the domestic unemployment rate broke the 5 percent psychological barrier
last December.</P>
      <P>"The premier has repeatedly reminded relevant agencies to gear up to address the
issue, as he believes that the worst is yet to come, " said an Executive Yuan
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>Under a short-term job promotion program, the government offered 47,000 job
openings late last year, and 22,000 additional job openings are expected to be
up for grabs this year. Nevertheless, the official said, the premier is not
satisfied with the number and has demanded more.</P>
      <P>According to the official, Liu has asked the Ministry of National Defense and
the National Science Council -- the two agencies believed to have relatively
more resources -- to create more openings for positions such as administrative
and cleaning work at military hospitals and contract research assistant
positions for the newly unemployed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, media reports said the government plans to carry out various small-
and medium-size public construction projects ahead of original schedules in oder
to create more job openings as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The government originally plans to inject up to NT$500 billion in public
infrastructure construction projects over the next four years as part of its
economic stimulus package. As some of those projects my take long time to
prepare for open tender after the legislature passes relevant special budget
bills, the reports said the Executive Yuan is now mulling to focus on small- and
medium-size projects first, such as urban landscaping, commercial zones
facelift, sidewalk improvement and refurbishment of major tourist attractions.</P>
      <P>Anyway, the reports said, the government wants to focus on projects that can be
completed in two years, which government officials believe will be able to
maximize the public investment effects in creating new jobs and curtailing a
further rise in the unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>According to a CEPD estimate, at least 70,000 new job openings should be created
if the domestic jobless rate will be lowered to 4.5 percent from December's 5.03
percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gov't working to reduce alcohol abuse among indigenous people</HEADLINE>

      <P>The government will continue promoting its policy to help reduce alcohol abuse
among the country's aboriginal people, after initial signs of progress in this
area, said officials at the Cabinet-level Council of Indigenous Peoples Sunday.</P>
      <P>Last year, 12 of the more than 30 aboriginal townships across the country joined
the council's efforts and succeeded in bringing down alcohol use among their
residents to 53.1 percent, an average reduction of 7.6 percent compared to the
2007 ratio, said Council Minister Chang Jen-hsiang.</P>
      <P>Chang called for greater participation by indigenous people in her council's
efforts so as to help decrease the number of injuries and accidents among them
resulting from alcohol use and to take better care of their health.</P>
      <P>The mortality rate among Taiwan's aboriginal peoples is four to five times than
that of the rest of the population, and the leading causes of death among the
indigenous people are malignant tumor, liver diseases and accidents -- all of
which are closely related to alcohol abuse, Chang said.</P>
      <P>National Yang Ming University professor Kuo Shien-wen, who is in charge of a
project launched by the council in 2005 to curb alcohol abuse among the
indigenous people, said 12 aboriginal townships joined the project in 2007,
while four withdrew and another four later entered the program.</P>
      <P>Last year, seven of the eight townships actively participating in the program
posted an average decline of 7.6 percent in the number of alcohol consumers
among their residents from a year ago, recording a 53.1 percent alcohol use for
2008, he said.</P>
      <P>Wulai township in northern Taiwan's Taipei County had the largest annual
decrease of 24.9 percent in 2008, followed by Heping township in central
Taiwan's Taichung County with 17.6 percent, and Namasia township in southern
Kaohsiung County with 16 percent, he added.</P>
      <P>Kuo said there is room for greater efforts to be made in this regard, as there
are over 800 aboriginal tribes scattered throughout more than 30 townships
across the country.</P>
      <P>"So far, the anti-alcohol program has been advocated in a dozen townships
nationwide," he said.</P>
      <P>In 2009, the Council of Indigenous Peoples will allocate an some NT$10 million
(US$298,000) -- an increase of NT$7 million from last year -- to continue the
program, he added.</P>
      <P>Due to long-term disadvantages encountered in the society, a large percent of
aboriginal people of both genders, have developed the habit of drinking alcohol
as a way of dealing with their problems.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A month-long festival of tranquility kicked off Sunday on Yushan, Taiwan's
highest peak, during which mountain climbing activities will not be allowed on
any of the peaks that form the imposing mountain range.</P>
      <P>The tranquility festival followed a three-day mountain cleanup drive that began
Jan. 30, with environmentalists and mountain climbing enthusiasts cleaning up
major mountain trails from Tataka Anbu/Saddle entrance to the main peak of
Yushan, also known as Jade Mountain.</P>
      <P>The Yushan National Park Administration staged a Tsou aboriginal mountain deity
worshipping rite at the Tataka Anbu/Saddle entrance to Yushan at around noon to
symbolize the start of the month-long closure of the mountain range to any
hiking or mountain climbing activities.</P>
      <P>It marked the fifth consecutive year that a one-month tranquility festival was
being observed as part of efforts to protect the natural environment, ecology
and wildlife of Taiwan's sacred mountain.</P>
      <P>At an elevation of 3,952 meters, Yushan is the highest peak not only in Taiwan,
but also in East Asia. The mountain range in central-southern Taiwan has 22
peaks that rise higher than 3,000 meters and 12 of them are listed among
Taiwan's top 100 peaks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tobacco surcharge hike will help smokers quit habit: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1 (CNA)
02/01/09  21:22:19
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although smokers are complaining over an impending increase in the tobacco
surcharge from NT$10 (US$0.29) to NT$20 per packet after a recent law amendment,
a government official said Sunday that the higher price should spur smokers to
quit the habit.</P>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Vice Minister Cheng Shou-shia said he thinks that the
higher surcharge, which will raise the price of cigarettes from the current
NT$55 to NT$70 per pack, will push some people to stop smoking in these hard
economic times.</P>
      <P>The current average price of cigarettes in Taiwan is quite low compared to other
countries or areas like Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Australia, Cheng
noted.</P>
      <P>Despite the planned surcharge hike, cigarette prices in Taiwan will remain lower
than most other countries in Asia, he said.</P>
      <P>The tobacco surcharge increase is expected to help generate an additional NT$18
billion per year in national revenue, pulling in about NT$38 billion this year,
he said, citing DOH estimates.</P>
      <P>Ninety percent of that NT$38 billion will go toward the estimated NT$45 billion
spent annually on treating smoking-related diseases included in the national
health insurance program, while nine percent will be allotted for the DOH's
cancer prevention campaigns and its vaccine injection projects and medical care
programs in remote areas, he explained.</P>
      <P>All the above-mentioned measures are expected to benefit some 500,000 people,
including rare disease patients, underprivileged and elderly citizens and
toddlers, according to the DOH vice minister.</P>
      <P>The remaining 1 percent of revenue from the surcharge will go toward supporting
government crackdowns on the smuggling of tobacco products, in line with the
law, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Prospects for cross-strait tourism seen as uncertain</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 1 (CNA)
02/01/09  21:29:22
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although both Taiwan and China took concrete steps last year to upgrade cross-
Taiwan Strait tourism, the number of tourist arrivals from China has fallen
short of the average daily target of 1000 people, casting doubts over the future
prospects of the business, industry sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to Chang Chih-yuan, owner of E Trip tour agency based in central
Taiwan's Taichung City, the problem is rooted in the many restrictions imposed
by the governments on both sides, rather than in the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Taiwan government restrictions, such as the condition that only groups of more
than five members are allowed to visit and that they must enter and depart the
country at the same time, have discouraged many individual Chinese businessmen
who are most likely to visit Taiwan and to spend heavily, he said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government's stipulation of the type and price of accommodation that
Chinese tourists must take is another obstacle to the free development of the
market, Chang noted, adding that free market competition will settle the issue
itself.</P>
      <P>What the government should do is set up a sound system to monitor business
practices,  instead of imposing such regulations,  he suggested.</P>
      <P>In line with the terms of an accord signed by Taiwan and China last November,
the two sides agreed to operate a maximum of 108 charters each week, based on a
framework established in July when they began allowing non-stop cross-strait
charters on weekends.</P>
      <P>Taiwan opened eight of its airports to local and China-based airlines plying the
daily cross-strait charter flights, but the aviation companies have concentrated
most of their business on four of the airports. These are Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport in northern Taiwan, Taichung
Chingchuankang Airport in central Taiwan and Kaohsiung International Airport in
the south.</P>
      <P>In China, the number of destinations for the direct cross-strait charters were
increased from five to 21 when the flight service was upgraded to a daily one in
mid-December last year.</P>
      <P>However, he added, only a small number of 33 Chinese travel agencies have been
given permission to arrange tours to Taiwan and the limited number of direct
charter flights  between popular destinations on the two sides have dampened the
interest of many people who were keen to cash in on the business.</P>
      <P>Too many unnecessary government restrictions will only hamper market mechanisms,
Chang contended.</P>
      <P>With the governments on both sides interfering in the market, it is difficult to
predict when cross-strait tourism would fully take off, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan is facing a long-existing gap in cross-strait tourism
revenue, which Chang said has become a thorny issue for all concerned.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese people make more than 2 million visits to China every year, while less
than 10 percent of Chinese tourists traveling abroad come to Taiwan, he said.
"This is a serious issue that both Taiwan government authorities and the private
sector must address."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taichung City offers subsidy for LPG vehicle conversion</HEADLINE>

02/01/09  22:23:35

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taichung city government announced Sunday that this year it will offer
another 300 vehicles owners a subsidy of NT$30,000 each to remodel their cars to
run on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).</P>
      <P>However, only owners of vehicles less than five years old are allowed to apply
to modify their cars for LPG, said Lee Li-de, director of the city's Bureau of
Environmental Protection.</P>
      <P>He noted that 90 percent of the vehicles in the city that are under five years
old have already been remodeled to run on LPG, with the help of the city
subsidy.</P>
      <P>The growing popularity of LPG vehicles is reflected in the volume of fuel sales,
according to Lee, who said that the two LPG filling stations in the city sold a
total of 9,158 kiloliters of fuel last year, which represented an increase of 91
percent from the 2007 level.</P>
      <P>Because of the high number of LPG-fueled vehicles in the city, carbon dioxide
emissions dropped by 2,708 tons last year from the 2007 level, Lee said, adding
that the reduction was equivalent to what would be absorbed by 225,694 trees.</P>
      <P>Lee said that given the growing popularity of LPG vehicles, it is expected that
more LPG filling stations will be established in the city.</P>
      <P>Last year, licenses were granted for the opening of three private LPG filling
stations, one of which will become operational around the middle of this year to
relieve the inconvenience that LPG car drivers have endured, he added.</P>
      <P>The subsidy program is aimed at encouraging more vehicle owners to switch to LPG
to help reduce air pollution, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He noted the cost of running a vehicle on LPG fuel is NT$0.38/per kilometer less
than on unleaded gasoline because the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) has been subsidizing the cost of LPG vehicle fuel to the
tune of NT$2 per liter. This means that LPG vehicle owners can save fuel costs
of around NT$20,000 a year, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier calls inter-agency meeting on job openings</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan presided Sunday over an inter-ministerial brainstorming
session aimed at pooling the resources of various government agencies to create
more jobs and alleviate the soaring unemployment rate amid the lingering global
economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan sources said the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) was expected to come up with a report on the current job market situation
at the meeting, which was attended by top officials from the Council of Labor
Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Transportation and
communications, the Ministry of the Interior and the Public Construction
Commission.</P>
      <P>Also high on the agenda were conclusions reached at a similar inter-agency
meeting chaired by Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung Saturday.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu will report to President Ma Ying-jeou Monday on any concrete
programs devised at the Sunday session, the sources said.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Liu has kept close tabs on Taiwan's job situation
since the domestic unemployment rate broke the 5 percent psychological barrier
last December.</P>
      <P>"The premier has repeatedly reminded relevant agencies to gear up to address the
issue, as he believes that the worst is yet to come, " said an Executive Yuan
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>Under a short-term job promotion program, the government offered 47,000 job
openings late last year, and 22,000 additional job openings are expected to be
up for grabs this year. Nevertheless, the official said, the premier is not
satisfied with the number and has demanded more.</P>
      <P>According to the official, Liu has asked the Ministry of National Defense and
the National Science Council -- the two agencies believed to have relatively
more resources -- to create more openings for positions such as administrative
and cleaning work at military hospitals and contract research assistant
positions for the newly unemployed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, media reports said the government plans to carry out various small-
and medium-size public construction projects ahead of original schedules in oder
to create more job openings as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The government originally plans to inject up to NT$500 billion in public
infrastructure construction projects over the next four years as part of its
economic stimulus package. As some of those projects my take long time to
prepare for open tender after the legislature passes relevant special budget
bills, the reports said the Executive Yuan is now mulling to focus on small- and
medium-size projects first, such as urban landscaping, commercial zones
facelift, sidewalk improvement and refurbishment of major tourist attractions.</P>
      <P>Anyway, the reports said, the government wants to focus on projects that can be
completed in two years, which government officials believe will be able to
maximize the public investment effects in creating new jobs and curtailing a
further rise in the unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>According to a CEPD estimate, at least 70,000 new job openings should be created
if the domestic jobless rate will be lowered to 4.5 percent from December's 5.03
percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 150,000 new jobs will be created this year to keep the annual jobless
rate below 4.5 percent, Executive Yuan spokesman Su Jun-pin said late Sunday.</P>
      <P>Su, who doubles as Government Information Office minister, made the announcement
after an inter-ministerial brainstorming session aimed at pooling government
resources to create more jobs and alleviate the soaring unemployment rate amid
the lingering global economic recession.</P>
      <P>During the two-hour meeting chaired by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, several
conclusions,  including expanding  public infrastructure construction budget,
were reached with unanimous support of the participants, Su said.</P>
      <P>At the premier's  discretion,  priority  will be given to easier-to-undertake
public construction projects, such as sewer systems, urban rejuvenation,
commercial zones facelift and sidewalk improvement, Su said.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop,  Su said, the government's economic stimulus package for
2009 will be adjusted to increase public sector investment to NT$130 billion
(US$3.88 billion) from the original NT$100 billion.</P>
      <P>The budget increase and adjustment of priority investment targets will be able
to generate more than 150,000 job openings this year to help drive the
unemployment rate down to below 4.5 percent from a high of 5.03 percent recorded
in December 2008, Su explained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister-without-Portfolio Tsai Hsung-hsiung, who also attended the
extra brainstorming session, said the Executive Yuan will unveil within a week
details about the 150,000 new jobs set to be generated this year.</P>
      <P>Of the projected new jobs, 120,000 to 140,000 openings will be created through
the launch of public infrastructure construction projects, Tsai said, adding
that the public sector is also expected to offer 20,000-plus service jobs.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Tsai said the government will actively seek private enterprises'
cooperation in cutting foreign laborers to increase 30,000 jobs for local wage
earners.</P>
      <P>Responding to Premier Liu's concerns about high unemployment rate among
university graduates, Ministry of Education officials said the ministry will
collaborate with private enterprises in arranging internship programs for
university graduates.</P>
      <P>Top officials  from the Council for Economic Planning and Development, the
Council of Labor Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of
Transportation and communications, the Ministry of the Interior, the Public

    <HEADLINE>Premier calls inter-agency meeting on job openings</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan presided Sunday over an inter-ministerial brainstorming
session aimed at pooling the resources of various government agencies to create
more jobs and alleviate the soaring unemployment rate amid the lingering global
economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan sources said the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) was expected to come up with a report on the current job market situation
at the meeting, which was attended by top officials from the Council of Labor
Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Transportation and
communications, the Ministry of the Interior and the Public Construction
Commission.</P>
      <P>Also high on the agenda were conclusions reached at a similar inter-agency
meeting chaired by Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung Saturday.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu will report to President Ma Ying-jeou Monday on any concrete
programs devised at the Sunday session, the sources said.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Liu has kept close tabs on Taiwan's job situation
since the domestic unemployment rate broke the 5 percent psychological barrier
last December.</P>
      <P>"The premier has repeatedly reminded relevant agencies to gear up to address the
issue, as he believes that the worst is yet to come, " said an Executive Yuan
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>Under a short-term job promotion program, the government offered 47,000 job
openings late last year, and 22,000 additional job openings are expected to be
up for grabs this year. Nevertheless, the official said, the premier is not
satisfied with the number and has demanded more.</P>
      <P>According to the official, Liu has asked the Ministry of National Defense and
the National Science Council -- the two agencies believed to have relatively
more resources -- to create more openings for positions such as administrative
and cleaning work at military hospitals and contract research assistant
positions for the newly unemployed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, media reports said the government plans to carry out various small-
and medium-size public construction projects ahead of original schedules in oder
to create more job openings as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The government originally plans to inject up to NT$500 billion in public
infrastructure construction projects over the next four years as part of its
economic stimulus package. As some of those projects my take long time to
prepare for open tender after the legislature passes relevant special budget
bills, the reports said the Executive Yuan is now mulling to focus on small- and
medium-size projects first, such as urban landscaping, commercial zones
facelift, sidewalk improvement and refurbishment of major tourist attractions.</P>
      <P>Anyway, the reports said, the government wants to focus on projects that can be
completed in two years, which government officials believe will be able to
maximize the public investment effects in creating new jobs and curtailing a
further rise in the unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>According to a CEPD estimate, at least 70,000 new job openings should be created
if the domestic jobless rate will be lowered to 4.5 percent from December's 5.03
percent.</P>

      <P>A shipping company from China's Hubei Province is scheduled to launch direct
shipping operations between Taiwan and China around mid-February, marking the
first of such links operated by a shipping company from central China, a Hubei-
based daily newspaper reported Monday.</P>
      <P>The Wuhan-based Datong Industrial Co. is expected to dispatch a 2,000-ton
asphalt ship from a seaport in Vietnam for Taiwan's southern port city of
Kaohsiung Feb. 11, followed by a 5,000-ton asphalt ship from Shanghai for
Kaohsiung on Feb. 20, according to the Chutian Metropolis Daily.</P>
      <P>Vessels owned and operated by Datong are allowed to make port calls at Taiwan's

    <HEADLINE>The Executive Yuan deserves applause: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that the Executive Yuan deserves to be
applauded for the timely policies it has launched to cope with the effects of
the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a speech at the Kuomintang's (KMT's) Lunar New Year
reception. The event was presided over by KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung, and was
attended by dignitaries and party heavyweights, including Premier Liu Chao-
shiuan, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and Economics Minister Yiin Chii-
ming.</P>
      <P>The president  said that while it may have been somewhat "unfortunate" that his
administration had to face rising oil, electricity and commodity prices and a
global economic downturn as soon as it took office in May last year, these
challenges can also serve as test of the government, which has taken a series of
measures to cope with the problems.</P>
      <P>"The efficacy of these measures is gradually emerging and even the foreign media
has given a nod to our policies because we mitigated the external pressure by
designing effective measures, which might help us to turn things around," Ma
said.</P>
      <P>"We should all applaud the Executive Yuan," he added.</P>
      <P>Citing last month's shopping voucher program as an example of the Executive
Yuan's hard work, the president said that the initiative has become the hottest
topic over the past two months and indeed has had a strong positive effect on
the economy as the distribution of the vouchers was timed just before the
Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>"The effects of the shopping voucher program might be short-term, but at least
every one was able to have a good Chinese New Year," Ma said. "The program was a
humanitarian one and a response to public opinion."</P>
      <P>Some 91 percent of eligible Taiwan citizens had picked up their NT$3, 600
(US$107) worth of vouchers by Jan. 18. The vouchers are the business end of an
NT$85.7 billion program that is part of the government's economic stimulus
package.</P>
      <P>The president also praised the Executive Yuan for taking further steps to cope
with the soaring unemployment rate right before the first working day after the
Chinese New Year holiday, saying that the government is working non-stop to
create more opportunities at a difficult time to improve people's lives.</P>
      <P>More than 150,000 new jobs will be created this year to keep the annual jobless
rate below 4.5 percent, Executive Yuan spokesman Su Jun-pin announced Sunday
after an inter-ministerial brainstorming session aimed at pooling government
resources to create more jobs amid the lingering global economic recession.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the reception, Wu pledged that the KMT will offer full support to Ma
and his administration, and urged every KMT member to join the battle against
unemployment.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's consumer confidence index for January slid 0.18 points to 48.95, its
lowest level since National Central University's Research Center for Taiwan
Economic Development (RCTED) began conducting the monthly surveys in 2001.</P>
      <P>Although three of the survey's six sub-indices -- which reflect consumers'
expectations of economic conditions over the next six months --  rose from the
previous  month's levels,  the "job opportunities" category continued to slide,
the pollsters said.</P>
      <P>The sharpest drop recorded in January was in the category of "job opportunities,
" which dived 6.95 points to 39.3, followed by the outlook for buying stocks in
the first half of the year, which fell 1.5 points to 46.2, and the outlook for
buying durable goods in the first six months of the year, which dropped 2.3
points to 82.9.</P>
      <P>In the survey, a score of between 0-100 for a sub-index is classified as
"pessimistic, " while a score of 100-200 is considered "optimistic, " according
to the RCTED classification system.</P>
      <P>The category of "price levels" registered the largest increase in January, up
5.65 points to 35.05, followed by "family economic conditions, " which rose 2.6
points to reach 46.3, and "domestic economic conditions over the next six
months, " which rose 1.4 points to 43.95, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by telephone among randomly selected adults aged 20 or
older between Jan. 19-22, with a total of 2,214 valid samples collected.</P>
      <P>It had a 95 percent confidence level and a margin of error of 2.1 percentage
points.</P>

      <P>The Taipei City Government will coordinate with the local service industry to
provide professional training courses for the unemployed in order to ease the
rapidly rising unemployment rate, Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking  at the Taipei City Government's  Lunar New Year reception, Hau said
that the government cannot ignore the fact that the worsening economic situation
in the country has resulted in an escalation of the unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>"Rather than giving fish to people in need, we want to give them the means to be
self-sufficient by teaching them to fish," said Hau.</P>
      <P>According to Hau, the Taipei City Government is planning to coordinate with
labor-intensive local companies,  especially the service industries, to provide
the unemployed with professional training courses aimed at reintroducing them
into the nation's workforce.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hau said, Taipei City's Bureau of Labor and Department of Social
Welfare will also provide assistance to low income families and the unemployed.</P>
      <P>With the new school year about to start, the Taipei City Government will provide
financial assistance through its Bureau of Education to low income families that
cannot afford to pay tuition and lunch costs for their children, he promised.</P>
      <P>Asked about an earlier proposal to distribute NT$5,000 in food vouchers to each
of 10,000 families in March, Hau said that the City's Bureau of Civil affairs is
currently engaged in an evaluation process to select eligible households.</P>
      <P>"The food vouchers will be issued on March 1, once the social workers have
finalized the selection process," said Hau, adding that the food voucher plan
will at least give some temporary relief to low income families.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City Government's food voucher plan came in the wake of a similar
program implemented by the Kaohsiung City Government earlier this year. The
Kaohsiung City Government issued NT$1,500 worth of food vouchers to each of 300
low-income families in January.</P>

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming indicated Monday that personnel
changes may be on the cards for the state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC)
and Taiwan Power Company (Taipower), as his ministry decided last year to
restructure the two companies.</P>
      <P>Yiin, who made the remarks in response to reporters' questions after the
Kuomintang's Lunar New Year reception, stressed that the plan, if implemented,
would not target any specific individual.</P>
      <P>He said the Ministry of Economic Affairs decided last year to restructure CPC
and Taipower, and that a personnel reshuffle could be part of the process.</P>
      <P>According to the local daily Liberty Times, the ministry will this year launch a
"state-owned businesses reform program" that would involve a full-scale review
of CPC and Taipower in areas such as company image, company culture, personnel,
financial status and production process.</P>
      <P>The ministry does not exclude the possibility of replacing the chairmen of the
two companies, the report quoted Yiin as saying.</P>
      <P>Stressing that organization reform usually includes cuts and changes in
personnel, the top economic official said "what I meant by personnel reshuffle
is this -- it would not target the chairmen in particular."</P>
      <P>However, when asked to confirm the report that the chairmen of CPC and Taipower
are likely to be replaced, Yiin said anything is possible, adding that he cannot
disclose any more details since the reform program has not yet been fully
developed.</P>
      <P>As to whether he has already contacted any possible candidates for the chairmen
positions,  Yiin  said he thinks  that any restructuring should involve changes
at the senior management level in general, rather than pinpoint the chairmen.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is likely to see a sharp rise in unemployment after the Chinese New Year
holiday, Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Minister Wang Ju-hsuan said Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the CLA's Chinese New Year reception, Wang said that this year the
economic slowdown and the unemployment rate will most likely worsen.</P>
      <P>"Last year was bad, but this year it's only going to get worse," she forecast.
"Amid the global economic downturn, public servants should do their best to help
and serve the citizens of the nation."</P>
      <P>According  to Wang,  public servants and officials hold a relatively stable job
compared to people working in private companies, and are therefore the "lucky
and happy ones who have been least affected by the recent economic downturn."</P>
      <P>"It's hard to design a perfect plan to assist all those in need, and in these
desperate times the public will complain about almost anything we do, " she
said, urging that despite the public's complaints, government officials and
public servants should not give up.</P>
      <P>"I was a lawyer before I become a public servant, " said Wang, adding that she
gave up the chance of making "tons of money" because there is nothing more
meaningful in life than providing assistance to the needy.</P>
      <P>Anticipating an increase in the number of people seeking jobs through the CLA
after the Chinese New Year holiday, Wang said, she and her staff went to work
early Monday to prepare to deal with the public.</P>
      <P>"With things getting worse for the citizens of this country, we the government
officials and public servants should never stop fighting for the welfare of our

      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said
Monday that the government should create job opportunities that have
"substantive meaning" and are linked to the industrial structure rather than
providing just short-term openings.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who was greeting DPP staff on the first working day after the Lunar New
Year holiday, made the remarks in response to reporters' questions on the
government's latest measure to battle the soaring unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>More than 150,000 new jobs will be created this year in an effort to keep the
annual jobless rate below 4.5 percent from a high of 5.03 percent recorded in
December 2008, Executive Yuan spokesman Su Jun-pin  announced  a day earlier
after  an inter-ministerial brainstorming session aimed at pooling government
resources to create more jobs amid the global economic recession.</P>
      <P>Of the projected new jobs, 120,000 to 140,000 openings will be created through
the launch of public infrastructure construction projects  while the public
sector is also expected  to offer 20,000-plus service jobs, according to the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>In addition,  the government  will seek private enterprise cooperation in
cutting the number of much cheaper foreign laborers in the hope that so doing
would provide a further 30,000 jobs for local workers.</P>
      <P>"Most of these jobs are short-term openings that do not have any substantive
meaning and are as if they were social assistance, " Tsai contended.</P>
      <P>"The government should create jobs that have substantive meaning. Spending big
money on creating short-term jobs not only fails to address the problem but is
also a waste of national resources, " she argued.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP is obligated to point out problems to the government, Tsai
predicted that the unemployment issue will severely impact social stability
after the Lunar New Year.</P>

      <P>Local wildlife conservationists have expressed growing concerns about an
increase in the number of sightings in Taiwan of a wild bird species from China.</P>
      <P>In a wetland forest in the eastern county of Taitung, the frequent sightings of
a couple of garrulax canorus -- a Formosan hwamei, a species endemic to Taiwan,
and a Chinese hwamei -- has caused worry among local bird watchers that mating
of the two species may eventually compromise the pedigree of the Formosan
hwamei.</P>
      <P>The Formosan hwamei, also known as the melodious laughing-thrush, has been
listed as an endemic species entitled to special protection.</P>

Chinese mainland to Taiwan and that the Chinese hwamei spotted in Taiwan's
forests could have escaped from or been released by their owners.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H. L. Ou said Monday that cooperation programs will
serve as a more effective tool than gifts to strengthen Taiwan's relations with
other countries.</P>
      <P>Speaking after a Lunar New Year reception held by his ministry, Ou said that
gifts should simply symbolize friendship with and respect for the recipient, and
therefore "handing out high-priced presents" would not be an appropriate
(foreign policy) approach.</P>
      <P>"The money should be spent on cooperation initiatives instead, " he said.</P>
      <P>According to a local media report, leaders of Taiwan's diplomatic allies often
ask for expensive gifts such as diamonds, furniture and computers when they are
on state visits to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To curb the practice of "money diplomacy, " President Ma Ying-joeu, after taking
office last May, made it clear that the value of any gifts to foreign visitors
should not exceed NT$5,000 (US$148).</P>
      <P>Ou said that his ministry is following Ma's directive, but that in the past the
MOFA did not have "much of a standard" regarding gifts.</P>
      <P>Now, based on the guidelines it has been given, the MOFA selects gifts worth no
more than NT$10,000 for president-level guests, NT5,000 for ministerial-level
officials, and NT$3,000 for visitors at the deputy minister level, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Brushing off disapproval from some members of the opposition  Democratic
Progressive  Party (DPP) ,  the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
said Monday that the closer cross-Taiwan Strait ties since President Ma Ying-
jeou was inaugurated last May do not jeopardize Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>On allegations by some DPP politicians that Ma's administration has tilted
excessively toward China at the expense of Taiwan's sovereignty, the MAC said in
a press release that it has always acted under the preconditions of safeguarding
Taiwan's sovereignty and the interests of the people.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's cross-strait economic liberalization policies are aimed at improving
Taiwan's investment environment  and boosting the country's economic
development," the press statement said.</P>
      <P>"Our China policy has in no way put Taiwan's sovereignty at risk," said the MAC,
adding that it will continue to conduct cross-strait policy with a view of
creating a mutually beneficial outcome for both sides.</P>
      <P>In addition, it reiterated its stance that the inauguration of direct cross-
strait shipping links and the launch of expanded cross-strait air links last
December do not symbolize Taiwan "paying tribute to the Chinese leadership," as
some detractors have alleged.</P>
      <P>The press release also emphasized that under the Constitution, Taiwan will
pursue a policy of maintaining the cross-strait status quo, under which Taiwan
will not seek unification or independence and will not foment war against China.</P>
      <P>"The  Taiwanese  government  will continue  conducting  its cross-strait policy
that it believes is in tune with mainstream public opinion," the MAC said.</P>
      <P>It further said that maintaining close dialogue and economic cooperation with
China can help improve the cross-strait situation and lessen military and
security concerns.</P>
      <P>"By improving bilateral cross-strait relations, we have also been able to
improve our ties with Japan and the United States, " said the MAC, adding that
developing mutually beneficial economic ties with China is the centerpiece of
the present Taiwan-China relations until such time as the two sides can discuss
political issues.</P>
      <P>Since President Ma Ying-jeou took office May 20 last year, his administration
has prioritized the policy goals of restoring cross-strait talks and pursuing
the normalization of cross-strait economic relations, said the MAC, adding that
the government will continue to act on the principle of minimizing the threat
and maximizing the advantage.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) held two rounds of high-level talks June 13
and Nov. 14 last year, in which they signed six agreements covering direct
cross-strait charter flights, Chinese tourist visits to Taiwan, direct cross-
strait air and sea cargo transport, postal cooperation and a food safety
mechanism.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS  are semi-official  intermediary  bodies responsible for
cross-strait dealings in the absence of official contacts between the two sides.
The MAC supervises SEF operations.</P>
      <P>According to private sector estimates, the establishment of direct transport
links can save Taiwan up to US$90 million per year in flight and shipping costs.</P>

      <P>Fruit growers in the eastern county of Taitung were busy Monday packing 15 tons
of pineapple custard apples, a variety of the fruit native to Taitung, for
export to China.</P>
      <P>A full container of the fruit was scheduled to be shipped from southern Taiwan's
Kaohsiung Harbor bound for Guangzhou in southern China, taking advantage of the
direct cross-Taiwan Strait shipping links that were opened last Dec. 15.</P>
      <P>The Taitung Farmers Association has received orders from China for a total of
200 tons of pineapple custard apples, with deliveries scheduled to be made prior
to the Lantern Festival, which falls on Feb. 9 this year and is a traditional
holiday, so that sales are expected to boom, said association chief Lee Kun-ho.</P>
      <P>Lee said exports of the fruit topped 1,200 tons between Dec. 1, 2008 and Jan.
31, representing a three-fold increase year-on-year.</P>
      <P>The export markets included China, Singapore and Canada, with China taking the
bulk of the shipments.</P>
      <P>Lee said the fruit's high season is usually in the first and second months of
the lunar calendar, with output averaging about 60 tons per week.</P>
      <P>"Exports have contributed to easing a glut of the fruit on the domestic market,"

      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou said Monday that a high level of
international support for Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Assembly (WHA)
as an observer and the improvement in cross-Taiwan Strait relations should "make
it easier to find a solution" to the issue.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also seek assistance from its diplomatic allies to boost the
country's efforts to join the WHA -- the decision-making arm of the World Health
Organization (WHO), he added.</P>
      <P>Ou said that based on the responses of Chinese officials to Taiwan's attempts to
seek international space on several occasions on which representatives from the
two sides met, "we felt that the other side has shown more willingness to
resolve the issue through cross-strait negotiations."</P>
      <P>However, he went on, as no actual details have been discussed in the dialogues,
it is still too early to say whether Taiwan will accept "Chinese Taipei" as the
name for WHA representation.</P>
      <P>Due to Beijing's obstruction, Taiwan has been barred from taking part in
international organizations or activities that require statehood, including the
United Nations and the U.N.-affiliated WHO and WHA.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reiterated last November in a TV interview that securing
observer status for Taiwan in the WHA was his administration's top diplomatic

      <P>Creating job opportunities for higher- education graduates will be the
government's top priority this year in its efforts to spur employment and to
push the country's jobless rate below 4.5 percent, officials of the Cabinet-
level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Monday.</P>
      <P>To achieve that goal, the government will offer subsidies to enterprises to
encourage them to employ large numbers of interns with college and university
degrees, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>Public agencies will also create more vacancies for positions such as research
assistants, to provide work for university graduates in these hard economic
times, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Funding for the job-creation programs will come from the NT$500 billion (US$14.9
billion) special budget drawn up by the Executive Yuan for a four-year public
works construction program, they said.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan is set to approve the NT$500 billion program in its weekly
meeting next week, and will submit the bill to the Legislative Yuan for
screening as soon as the new legislative session opens.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan presided over an inter-agency conference Sunday, the
last day of the nine-day Lunar New Year holiday season, to find ways to curb the
country's rising unemployment.</P>
      <P>It was decided during the meeting that an additional NT$30 billion will be
included in this year's budget to fund the upgrading of infrastructure, which
would bring the total 2009 infrastructure budget to NT$130 billion and help
create some 150,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>Heads of government agencies, including the Ministry of Education and National
Science Council, agreed to jointly make available thousands of research
assistant jobs for qualified college and university graduates.</P>
      <P>The government sector will also offer subsidies to private companies and ask
them to provide training opportunities  for internees with higher education.</P>
      <P>Education Minister Cheng Jui-cheng said Monday that the precise number and type
of projects will be made public after discussions with the National Science
Council (NSC).</P>

      <P>Eight major industrial and business groups voiced their support Monday for the
administration's efforts to help generate over 150,000 new jobs this year in an
effort to keep the country's annual jobless rate below 4.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The groups, led by the National Association of Small and Medium Enterprises of
the Republic of China, are scheduled to endorse Feb. 6 a campaign to respond to
the government's job-boosting drive by calling upon private companies to keep
their redundancy rates at under 1 percent.</P>
      <P>Association chief Lin Ping-pin said some 1,000 members of the association are
expected to take part in the endorsement, although he added that he has no idea
yet exactly how many companies around Taiwan will step forward to support the
low-redundancies call.</P>
      <P>The industrial and business groups made the decision in response to an
announcement by the Executive Yuan the previous day that it plans to pool
government resources to create more jobs and alleviate the soaring unemployment
rate amid the global economic recession.</P>
      <P>Executive  Yuan spokesman  Su Jun-pin  announced  that the government's economic
stimulus package for 2009 will be adjusted to increase public sector investment
to NT$130 billion (US$3.88 billion) -- up from the original NT$100 billion --
and that the budget increase and adjustment of priority investment targets will
generate more than 150,000 jobs this year, which in turn will help bring the
unemployment rate down to below 4.5 percent from a high of 5.03 percent recorded
in December 2008.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Council of Labor Affairs Minister Wang Ju-hsuan warned that Taiwan is
likely to see a sharp rise in unemployment after the Chinese New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>"Last year was bad, but this year it's only going to get worse," Wang said,
forecasting that the economic downturn and the jobless rate will most likely
worsen this year compared to last year.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu said Monday that she is seeking  central  government
support  for seven major construction projects in her southern port city,
including extending the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit (MRT)  system to
neighboring counties.</P>
      <P>Chen disclosed that she handed a letter to President Ma Ying-jeou Jan. 31 in
which she urged the central government to help Kaohsiung with its construction
projects.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung MRT system has two lines. The 28.3-km Red Line has its
northernmost station at Chiaotou in Kaohsiung County and ends at Linhai
Industrial District in the south of the city, connecting with the Kaohsiung
International Airport.</P>
      <P>The east-west Orange Line is 14.4-km-long and runs from National Sun Yat-sen
University in the west to Daliau in Kaohsiung County in the east.</P>
      <P>In its 12 prioritized public construction projects, the central government has
already included a plan to extend the Red Line further north to Lujhu township
in Kaohsiung County, and the Orange Line further east to Pingtung County. The 12
projects would cost NT$3.99 trillion (US$122 billion) over eight years from 2009
to 2016.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Cabinet is working on another plan to spend NT$500 billion
(US$14.85 billion) over a four-year period on an expanded public construction
program,  Chen suggested that the Kaohsiung MRT system's extension plan and a
Kaohsiung airport cargo transport system improvement  plan be included in the
central government's new program, so that Taiwan's second-largest city can have
a full-fledged mass transport system.</P>
      <P>Other major construction projects for which the mayor is seeking central
government help include a plan to move all railway lines in Kaohsiung
underground, a plan to build a pop music center in the Kaohsiung Harbor area, a
proposed new highway to relieve the increased traffic caused by the High Speed

      <P>The distribution of the government-issued shopping vouchers has proved
successful in stimulating domestic consumption amid the recession, creating a
NT$22.54 billion (US$668 million) domestic travel boom during the nine-day Lunar
New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>According to a statement released by the Tourism Bureau Monday, the number of
sightseeing visits to tourist spots around Taiwan totaled 11.33 million between
Lunar New Year's Day -- Jan. 26 -- and Feb. 1, the end of the holiday.</P>
      <P>The figure represents a growth of 92 percent compared with the previous Lunar
New Year holiday, which was only five days long, and a rise of 11.2 percent from
the eight-day holiday in 2007.</P>
      <P>The bureau said that most of the tours on offer around the island began between
the third and fifth days of the holiday.</P>
      <P>It estimated that some 2.26 million people visited tourist spots Thursday -- the
fourth day of the holiday -- marking the highest daily figure in terms of the
number of visits during the holiday, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Bureau official Huang Ching-hui, who is responsible for domestic tourism
affairs, said the most popular tourist spots were those that charged no entrance
fee or that offered attractive discounts for visitors.</P>
      <P>On average, 20 percent-30 percent of the income received by each tourist spot
was generated by the shopping vouchers, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>According to Tourism Bureau statistics, the low-priced or free attractions drew
nearly 9.78 million visits during the holiday period.</P>
      <P>The 23 major amusement parks around Taiwan, meanwhile, attracted some 850,000
visitors last week, representing a 54 percent increase from the same period of
2008.</P>
      <P>The parks generated total revenues of NT$510 million during the Jan. 26-Feb. 1
period, marking a year-on-year growth of 38 percent.</P>
      <P>The bureau attributed the growth to discount packages for visitors, as well as
the shopping vouchers that the government distributed to every citizen around
the country before the Lunar New Year holiday as part of efforts to stimulate
domestic spending.</P>
      <P>Around 27 percent of the average spending at the amusement parks during the
holiday was in the form of shopping vouchers, the bureau went on, adding that 75
percent of the turnover at the Yeliou Ocean World on the northeastern coast was
generated on the back of the shopping vouchers, thanks to the park's offer of
privileged treatment for shopping voucher spenders.</P>
      <P>In the various hot spring resorts around the country, the bureau estimated that
hostel and hotel occupancy reached 85 percent-90 percent last week and that the
hot spring sector generated revenue of NT$1.25 billion during the holiday,
marking a rise of 7 percent year on year.</P>
      <P>Tourist numbers were also boosted by 509 tour groups comprising 13,400 tourists
from China that visited Taiwan during the holiday, according to the bureau,
which added that the most popular tourist spots among the Chinese tourists were
Sun Moon Lake in Nantou County, central Taiwan, and Alishan in southern Chiayi
County.</P>

      <P>A Taipei County-based environmental protection association promoted a project to

      <P>Hsu Yuan-tai,  a professor at National Taiwan University's Biodiversity Research
Center, said there is a need for such a gene bank, as many indigenous aquatic
plants are at risk due to habitat loss triggered by changes in land use and
extensive  use of insecticides and pesticides, as well as the intrusion of alien
water plant species.</P>
      <P>The gene bank will be used not only for the collection and conservation of a
wide variety of endangered native water and wetland plant species but also for
the cultivation of many other native aquatic plants.</P>
      <P>In the future, workshops will be set up to train professionals in the sphere of
ecological management and a series of courses on wetlands will be launched to
educate the public on the importance of wetland protection.</P>

      <P>Government-operated employment service centers around the country were packed by
job seekers Monday, the first workday after the Lunar New Year holiday that
began on Jan. 25.</P>
      <P>In the Taoyuan City center, more than 1,200 unemployed submitted their
applications for government unemployment benefits while over 700 of them also
applied for jobs.</P>
      <P>Over 100 people lined up outside the center before it opened Monday morning,
with many of them workers who were laid off by a big computer manufacturer just
two days before Lunar New Year's Eve.</P>
      <P>One of those waiting on line to apply for unemployment benefits was a 41-year-
old mother surnamed Lin, who holds a bachelor's degree in tourism.</P>
      <P>Lin complained she was laid off without any warning and could not accept being
fired because the only explanation given her by the company was that she was no
longer suitable for the position she held.</P>
      <P>Noting that many senior workers at the same company were also laid off, Lin
speculated that the company's strategy was to first get rid of high-paid
employees  under the pretext of operational difficulties amid the recession, and
then hire new workers through the government's employment incentives program.</P>
      <P>The workers could not do anything to stop the scheme, she said, sighing "that's
life."</P>
      <P>Similar long lines of job seekers were also observed Monday at unemployment
service centers in Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties in southern Taiwan, and

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 13,400 Chinese visitors contributed NT$850 million (US$25.3 million) to
Taiwan's economy over the Lunar New Year holiday period from Jan. 26 - Feb. 1,
the Tourism Bureau reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials estimated that the Chinese tourists, scattered among 509 tour
groups, spent NT$9,000 per day during their average 7-day stays.</P>
      <P>Most of the Chinese tourists were from Guangdong province and the cities of
Beijing and Shanghai, bureau statistics showed.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that most Chinese tourists could spend their Lunar New
Year holiday in Taiwan, thanks to tourism opening measures adopted last year by
the governments on both sides.</P>
      <P>Over 3,000 Chinese tourists arrived in Taiwan Jan. 26 on Lunar New Year's Day,
reaching the daily target of 3,000 persons set by the bureau for the first time
since more Chinese were allowed to arrive in Taiwan in mid-July.</P>
      <P>Sun Moon Lake in central Taiwan's Nantou County and the Alishan Mountain resort
in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County were the most popular attractions, drawing
12,647 and 10,690 Chinese visitors, respectively.</P>
      <P>Hualien County in eastern Taiwan and Kending in southern Taiwan's Pingtung
County were also popular among Chinese tourists, bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>A woman identified by the surname Chang praised Taiwan as "small and beautiful"
and hailed the hospitality of Taiwan's people and the scenery along the
country's northeastern coast.</P>
      <P>Hung Wen-neng, chief of Nantou County's tourism bureau, said that while Sun Moon
Lake was widely visited by the Chinese visitors, most did not spend the night in
the area or in the county because hotel rooms in the county had already been
booked by Taiwanese tourists.</P>
      <P>He said most local businesses in the county benefited little from the short
stays of the Chinese tour groups, at most earning NT$150 to NT$300 per person
for a meal or a boat ride on the lake.</P>
      <P>The major challenge for the county now, Hung said, is how to craft in-depth
travel itineraries to lure Chinese tourists throughout the entire year, not just
during the Lunar New Year holidays.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that the number of Taiwanese visitors to the Sun Moon Lake
area grew markedly during this year's Lunar New Year holiday compared to
previous years, and attributed the growth to the longer nine-day holiday period,
the distribution of shopping vouchers and falling gasoline prices.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Hakka Exposition being held at the Taipei County Hakka Museum in
Sansia Township has attracted more than half a million visitors since its
opening Dec. 27, according to the event's organizer, the Cabinet-level Council
for Hakka Affairs.</P>
      <P>Officials at the council pointed out Monday that the more than 500,000 people
included 230,000 who visited the expo during the Lunar New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>The officials said they expect more large crowds to visit the show before it
ends Feb. 15, as the final two weeks coincides with the Lantern Festival and
Valentine's Day.</P>
      <P>They added that there will be special festivities over the next two weekends to
allow visitors to celebrate the two special occasions at the showground.</P>
      <P>The event is a showcase of all aspects of life of the Hakka people, one of
Taiwan's largest sub-ethnic groups, including their culture, history and way of
life. The Hakkas account for about 15 percent of Taiwan's 23 million people.</P>
      <P>The expo includes an exhibition of photos, some of which date back to the Qing
dynasty, to tell the stories of the Hakka people's migration from China to
Taiwan, their culture and way of life. Other exhibits include their traditional
costumes and various publications regarding Hakka history and the Hakka dialect.</P>
      <P>Other related activities include a Hakka film festival, daily concerts and stage
performances by Hakka artists.</P>
      <P>Visitors can savor Hakka cuisine in a food court catered by 20 selected Hakka
restaurants from around Taiwan. They can also buy farm produce, specialty
products, handicrafts and other souvenirs from well-known Hakka businesses and
farmers's associations from around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Hakka Museum in Sansia is open Tuesdays to Fridays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and
Saturdays and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Entry to the exposition is free.</P>
      <P>Free shuttle bus services to the museum are available from nearby Yingge Railway
Station, as well as three of Taipei's MRT stations -- Banciao, Yongning and
Jingan.</P>
      <P>The Hakkas are a unique ethnic group of Han Chinese, who originally lived in
central China but gradually migrated south during different dynasties and
settled in Jiangxi, Fujian and Guangdong provinces to flee from war and famine.</P>
      <P>They were called Hakka, which literally means "guest families," by the locals
when they first settled in.</P>
      <P>The Hakka are conservative in keeping their cultural traditions. One of their
outstanding characteristics is that they are willing to venture into other parts
of the world to establish themselves.</P>
      <P>During the last hundred years, the Hakka have migrated to countries in Southeast
Asia, East Africa, Europe and North and South America. EDNITEM/ls</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) on Monday urged the public to be wary of
influenza, saying that it was still the high season for the virus.</P>
      <P>According to statistics from the DOH's Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the
number of parainfluenza cases increased during the Chinese New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>The CDC noted that more than 150 medical institutions provided emergency medical
services during the nine-day holiday that ended Sunday and that on the first day

treatment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Education coupons in the works to help lower joblessness: CEPD</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The country's top economic planning agency came up with a plan Monday to help
reduce the unemployment rate among highly educated citizens by issuing education
coupons for them to return to school to refresh their minds and study.</P>
      <P>Chen Tain-jy, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD), said the plan is aimed at helping at least 100,000
unemployed tertiary academic degree holders return to schools for various study
programs or to teach at vocational schools.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's jobless rate soared to a high of 5.03 percent last December, with
549,000 people out of work, according to government statistics.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Chen said, about 220,000 of the unemployed were university
graduates and those with even higher academic degrees. Moreover, many of them
were high-tech professionals with rich working experience.</P>
      <P>Under the CEPD-drafted plan, the government will issue education coupons for
highly educated unemployed people to return to schools to attend specially
designed study programs, Chen said, adding that the plan will span no more than
two years at an estimated cost of NT$20 billion (US$597 million).</P>
      <P>The funds needed for the education coupon plan will come from a special economic
stimulus package under which the government will inject  NT$500 billion  over
the next four years into public construction projects, Chen explained.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, new college graduates will be advised to remain in school to
undertake vocational or job-related research projects. In addition, Chen said,
the government will arrange for new graduates to join internship programs at
private corporations.</P>
      <P>Even though Taiwan has not been spared by the global economic downturn, Chen
said, some local companies are still faring fairly well. "We'll seek their
cooperation to offer internship openings for new graduates," he added.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the Ministry of Education is working on regulations governing
qualifications  to enjoy education coupon benefits. Basically, he said,  the
government will offer full subsidies for qualified recipients to undertake study
programs, but will set a ceiling for the amount an individual recipient can
receive.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the Executive Yuan is expected to approve the plan next week.
"And the CEPD looks forward to seeing the education coupon plan launched in the
first half of this year," he added.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on Monday eased penalties on Taiwanese
businesses with unapproved investments in China, saying it would impose only the
minimum fine on most violators if they reported their unlawful investment and
made new investments at home.</P>
      <P>The newly modified regulations generally treat all violators indiscriminantly,
regardless of the scale of their investment in China, if they invested money
there before March 10, 2008.</P>
      <P>The businesses must also meet the two conditions and must not have invested in
product categories "banned" by Taiwan's authorities to be eligible for the
minimum fine.</P>
      <P>Businesses that made unreported investments in China after March 10, 2008, will
be fined depending on the size of investment. Still, the rule change will treat
them more leniently than under revisions to the regulations made by the previous
government on that day, MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>The major aim of the change is to encourage Taiwanese businessmen to return home
by removing the possibility of being assessed potentially onerous fines, and
generate new investment in the domestic market in the process.</P>
      <P>In response  to the MOEA's  announcement,  some  Taiwanese businessmen operating

said Monday it granted permission to 79 companies to set up shop in the
Kaohsiung Software Technology Park in 2008, with a combined investment of
NT$2.27 billion (US$67.19 million).</P>
      <P>Administration officials said they will continue to invite more software
companies to move into the park to help strengthen its identity as a unique
venue for research and development in creative technology industries.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that the most prominent of the 79 companies that received the
green light to move into the park is the Hon Hai Group, whose chairman, Terry
Gou, has promised to invest at least NT$1 billion to create 3,000 jobs for
software engineers in five years.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai, which has had people man its office in the software park since October
last year, has set a target of hiring 500 software engineers by May this year.</P>
      <P>According to the officials,  the Institute for Information Industry -- a
nongovernment organization -- also moved into the Kaohsiung Software Technology
Park, with a plan to invest NT$400 million (US$11.85 million) over five years to
set up a technology incubation center.</P>
      <P>A 40-strong staff from two of the institute's departments -- the Innovative
Digitech-Enabled  Applications  and Services and the Southern Information
Service -- will man its office in the software park in the initial stage.</P>
      <P>By the end of 2009, the institute's workforce in the park will be increased to
more than 65 people.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the presence of the institute is expected to draw more
software companies to use the park as its development base, which will help

      <P>Hon Hai, which has had people man its office in the software park since October
last year, has set a target of hiring 500 software engineers by May this year.</P>
      <P>According to the officials,  the Institute for Information Industry -- a

set up a technology incubation center.</P>
      <P>A 40-strong staff from two of the institute's departments -- the Innovative

      <P>By the end of 2009, the institute's workforce in the park will be increased to

    <HEADLINE>Education coupons in the works to help lower joblessness: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.2 (CNA)
02/03/09  12:00:25
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The country's top economic planning agency came up with a plan Monday to help
reduce the unemployment rate among highly educated citizens by issuing education
coupons for them to return to school to refresh their minds and study.</P>
      <P>Chen Tain-jy, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD), said the plan is aimed at helping at least 100,000
unemployed tertiary academic degree holders return to schools for various study
programs or to teach at vocational schools.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's jobless rate soared to a high of 5.03 percent last December, with
549,000 people out of work, according to government statistics.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Chen said, about 220,000 of the unemployed were university
graduates and those with even higher academic degrees. Moreover, many of them
were high-tech professionals with rich working experience.</P>
      <P>Under the CEPD-drafted plan, the government will issue education coupons for
highly educated unemployed people to return to schools to attend specially
designed study programs, Chen said, adding that the plan will span no more than
two years at an estimated cost of NT$20 billion (US$597 million).</P>
      <P>The funds needed for the education coupon plan will come from a special economic
stimulus package under which the government will inject  NT$500 billion  over
the next four years into public construction projects, Chen explained.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, new college graduates will be advised to remain in school to
undertake vocational or job-related research projects. In addition, Chen said,
the government will arrange for new graduates to join internship programs at
private corporations.</P>
      <P>Even though Taiwan has not been spared by the global economic downturn, Chen
said, some local companies are still faring fairly well. "We'll seek their
cooperation to offer internship openings for new graduates," he added.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the Ministry of Education is working on regulations governing
qualifications  to enjoy education coupon benefits. Basically, he said,  the
government will offer full subsidies for qualified recipients to undertake study
programs, but will set a ceiling for the amount an individual recipient can
receive.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the Executive Yuan is expected to approve the plan next week.
"And the CEPD looks forward to seeing the education coupon plan launched in the
first half of this year," he added.</P>

02/03/09  12:00:55
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on Monday eased penalties on Taiwanese
businesses with unapproved investments in China, saying it would impose only the
minimum fine on most violators if they reported their unlawful investment and
made new investments at home.</P>
      <P>The newly modified regulations generally treat all violators indiscriminantly,
regardless of the scale of their investment in China, if they invested money
there before March 10, 2008.</P>
      <P>The businesses must also meet the two conditions and must not have invested in
product categories "banned" by Taiwan's authorities to be eligible for the
minimum fine.</P>
      <P>Businesses that made unreported investments in China after March 10, 2008, will
be fined depending on the size of investment. Still, the rule change will treat
them more leniently than under revisions to the regulations made by the previous
government on that day, MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>The major aim of the change is to encourage Taiwanese businessmen to return home
by removing the possibility of being assessed potentially onerous fines, and
generate new investment in the domestic market in the process.</P>
      <P>In response  to the MOEA's  announcement,  some  Taiwanese businessmen operating
in China contended that the ministry's overture was not "very meaningful."</P>
      <P>Chuang Fu-chih, chairman of the Taiwan businessmen's association in Fuzhou City,
Fujian province, said only a sound investment climate would lure Taiwanese
businesspeople back home.</P>
      <P>"Businessmen should not be punished for their investment in China, because it is
a misguided policy, " he said. "Moreover, the number of violators is low."</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has named Judicial Yuan President Lai In-jaw as his
special envoy to attend the 30th Independence Day celebration of St. Lucia, one
of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in the Caribbean, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press briefing, Diego Chou, deputy director-general of MOFA's
Department of Central and South American Affairs, said the delegation that will
attend the Feb. 22 celebration will include Deputy Foreign Minister Javier C.S.
Hou and is slated to depart for St. Lucia Feb. 19.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry, Lai will be the highest official from Taiwan to visit
the Caribbean island nation since the two countries restored diplomatic links in
April 2007.</P>
      <P>St. Lucia established official relations with Taiwan in 1984 but the friendship
was terminated in 1997 when St. Lucia's government at the time switched
diplomatic recognition to China.</P>
      <P>Since the resumption of diplomatic ties between Taiwan and St. Lucia 10 years
later, the two countries have launched a series of cooperation programs that
include public construction, academic exchanges and tourism, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>A psychiatry hospital for which Taiwan provided funding is also expected to
begin operating in the Caribbean nation later this year, according to the MOFA.</P>
      <P>First named by Columbus, who sighted the island on St. Lucy's day in 1502, St.
Lucia has changed hands many times. Independence for the tiny island state was
achieved in 1979 from the United Kingdom and is commemorated with parades across
the island.</P>

      <P>A group  of local  non-government organizations (NGOs) announced Tuesday that
they will participate in the 2009 Taipei International Book Exhibition (TIBE) to
share their ideals and values with the public.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Labor Front (TLF), the Green Formosa Front, the Legal Aid Foundation,
the Taiwan Thinktank, and various other local NGOs will take part in this year's
TIBE under the collective name "Taiwan NGOs," a TLF representative said.</P>
      <P>According to the TLF, the NGOs will present a wide variety of topics, including
law, the environment, labor, democracy, human rights, financial justice and
other social issues in the form of books, CDs, DVDs and T-shirts.</P>
      <P>"This is the third time we have participated in the TIBE, " said the
representative, adding that through the participation in Taipei's annual book
fair during the past three years, the NGOs have had close contact and
interaction with people from different sectors of society.</P>
      <P>"Most of the people that we have had contact with did not previously entirely
understand the purpose and functions that NGOs have in our society, " said the
representative.</P>
      <P>He added that after being introduced to their work, the public has shown great
support in what the NGOs are trying to do for society.</P>
      <P>"According to our past experiences, the public is not simply indifferent to
certain social issues, " he went on, adding that most members of the public do
not show concern for many social issues due to a lack of information and
knowledge.</P>

      <P>A plan to help reduce unemployment among white collar workers by issuing
education coupons that will subsidize their return to school so they can upgrade
their qualifications and increase their competitiveness will remain as flexible
as possible, the country's top economic planning agency said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liao Yao-tsung, chief secretary of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) , said the two-year plan, which is estimated to
cost NT$20 billion (US$525 million) and is expected to be approved by the
Executive Yuan next week, is designed exclusively for highly educated white
collar workers who have lost their jobs during the recent economic downturn.</P>
      <P>"We  welcome  colleges,  universities  and  other  private establishments to
design courses for these degree holders wishing to return to school," said Liao,
adding that the education coupons will not be distributed until the proposed
classes have passed an evaluation process.</P>
      <P>According to Liao, the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) launched a
similar employment and vocational training plan in 2005, which achieved results
that were better than expected.</P>
      <P>"Although the CLA's plan targets individuals who are already in the workforce
instead of unemployed highly educated white collar workers, the education
coupons plan will use it as a reference, " said Liao.</P>
      <P>In addition, Liao went on, the classes that will be provided under the new plan
will be similar to those offered by the vocational training  plan and will
include subjects  such as information technology,  foreign language, management,
professional skills, innovation and professional development.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said that same day that the council does not rule out the
possibility of pushing for the integration of the two plans once the framework
of the CEPD plan has been drawn up, adding that integration  could be more
beneficial to the public and more cost-effective for the government.</P>
      <P>According to government statistics, the jobless rate increased to a high of 5.03
percent last December, with 549,000 people out of work, about 220,000 of whom
were university graduates or higher in terms of education and experience.</P>

      <P>Two friends of former first lady Wu Shu-jen pleaded guilty to helping Wu launder
ill-gotten gains, as the Taipei District Court on Tuesday continued its trial of
corruption and money laundering cases involving the former first family.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ming-che and Tsai Ming-chieh are among the names on a long list of
intermediaries allegedly used by Wu to wire and secretly stash huge sums of
money overseas. They are both the brothers of Tsai Mei-li, a former classmate of
the former first lady, who also allegedly played a role in the money-laundering
schemes.</P>
      <P>The plea by Tsai Ming-che and Tsai Ming-chieh followed a similar one by Wu Shu-
jen's son Chen Chih-chung, daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching and elder brother Wu
Ching-mao during the last court session held Jan. 21.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors probing the cases found that Tsai Ming-che allegedly helped the
former first family solicit bribes and lined his own pockets with a portion of
the money in a land deal between the government-run Hsinchu Science Park and
Dayu Development Corp. -- a subsidiary under the Koo Group.</P>
      <P>While the former first family allegedly received NT$300 million (US$8.96
million) in kickbacks from a total payoff of NT$400 million by Taiwan Cement
Group Chairman Leslie C. Koo, Tsai Ming-che obtained NT$70 million. The rest of
the bribe allegedly went to James Lee, then-chief of the Hsinchu Science Park
Administration.</P>
      <P>As Tsai Ming-che confessed his role in the case and offered, while being
questioned by prosecutors, to turn all the illicit funds, the prosecutors in
their Dec. 12 indictment recommended that he be given a light sentence or set
free.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also asked the court to be lenient on Tsai Ming-chieh.</P>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian and his wife are accused of siphoning off NT$104
million from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his
presidency from 2000 to May 2008.</P>
      <P>In addition to accepting bribes worth a total of NT$300 million in connection
with the land procurement deal, they are also charged with receiving another
NT$90.93 million in kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a
government construction project.</P>
      <P>The couple is still being probed on suspicion of helping several financial
conglomerates acquire financial holding companies in return for "political
contributions."</P>

      <P>The  positive  effects  of  a government-initiated  shopping voucher program to
spur domestic consumption are becoming apparent in Taipei City, as the number of
people entering a prize draw that is tied to voucher spending broke the 100,000
mark, according to figures released Tuesday by the city's Department of Economic

      <P>The draw, which is aimed at encouraging spending and creating a multiplier
effect of the shopping voucher plan, allows consumers who spend NT$300 or more
in vouchers to compete for a wide range of prizes, Liu added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, more than 1,000 franchise stores in the city are offering special
deals to voucher spenders, Liu said.</P>
      <P>According to the official, sales in various commercial districts in the city

      <P>With the ranks of the unemployed swelling after the nine-day Lunar New Year
holiday, an online manpower services provider said Tuesday that it will work
with nearly 8,000 borough chiefs around the country to help job seekers put
their resumes online.</P>
      <P>The borough chiefs will help those who do not know how to use the Internet to
fill out job application forms, then the 104 Job Bank will circulate the forms
on the Web, said Chiu Wen-jen, an executive at the employment brokerage company.</P>
      <P>The effort is expected to result in efficient matching of applicants with the
current 180,000 work opportunities posted on the Internet, whether or not the
applicants live in remote areas, Chiu said.</P>
      <P>According to a 104 Job Bank survey, many job seekers are trying to upgrade their
employability by acquiring a second vocational skill or a professional
certificate.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics reported last month
that Taiwan's unemployment rate had increased to 5.03 percent in December,
representing the highest single-month record in more than five years.</P>
      <P>Compared with the previous month, the unemployment rate grew by 0.39 percentage
points, the government agency said.</P>
      <P>The rising unemployment rate was attributed to the global recession caused by a
financial storm affecting most countries around the world.</P>
      <P>According to another online survey conducted Jan. 6-13 by 104 Job Bank among its

pulling out of the slump this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 54 percent of them said that they began recruiting new employees
immediately after the Lunar New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>Noting that many enterprises appear optimistic about the outlook for 2009 -- the
Year of Ox on the lunar calendar -- Chiu urged job seekers to be patient and

      <P>The government's decision to lighten the penalties on Taiwan businessmen who
have invested in China without the required approval will help lure Taiwanese
capital back home, officials at the Investment Commission under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Commission officials made the remarks after the MOEA announced Monday that under
newly revised regulations, Taiwan businessmen who invested in China after March
10, 2008 without government approval will be fined a minimum of NT$50,000
(US$1,492) , as long as they adhere to the specified conditions.</P>
      <P>The conditions state that the rogue investments in China must be valued at less
that NT$100 million, that the businessmen must report their investments to the
Taiwan government and that they make new investments at home. In addition, the
businesses must not have invested in product categories banned by Taiwan's
authorities.</P>
      <P>The penalties have also been reduced for Taiwanese businessmen who invested more
than NT$100 million in China without approval of the the Taiwan government.</P>
      <P>According to Investment Commission officials, a similar move implemented on
March 10 last year by the Taiwan government helped to lure Taiwanese firms to
report some 309 unregistered China investment cases, totaling US$1.58 billion.</P>
      <P>During that period, some 309 cases of unregistered investment in China were
reported, and the business people involved made new investment in Taiwan, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>Among them were a case worth over US$77 million, one worth US$59 million and two
valued at more than US$50 million, the commission's statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The more lenient rules announced by the MOEA Monday will take effect under a
revisions to the regulations that were introduced by the previous government on
March 10 last year, MOEA officials said.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) pressed the Legislative Yuan
Tuesday to formally dismiss former Kuomintang Legislator Lee Ching-an, despite
her resignation last month, for failing to prove the loss of her U.S.
citizenship by the legally mandated deadline of Jan. 31.</P>
      <P>Also, the party urged prosecutors to continue an investigation into alleged
fraud by Lee and demanded that the Central Election Commission (CEC) spell out
its legal opinion on the matter.</P>
      <P>"The case must not be closed in such a precipitate manner. The legislature, CEC
and judicial authorities must fulfill their duties and give the public a full
explanation, " said DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang during a news conference.</P>
      <P>Lee, who was sworn in for a fourth legislative term Feb. 1, 2008, was found the
following month to have never formally renounced her U.S. citizenship, even
though she had held public office in Taiwan since 1994.</P>
      <P>The Nationality Act requires public officials holding dual citizenship to
surrender their foreign citizenship before assuming public office and to obtain
a certificate as proof within one year of taking office.</P>
      <P>The law also requires that those officials who retain foreign citizenship be
removed from their posts.</P>
      <P>Calls for Lee to be formally relieved of her seat mounted after the U.S.
authorities, in response to an inquiry from Taiwan, confirmed in late 2008 that
she "has previously been documented as a U.S. citizen with a U.S. passport and
that no subsequent loss of U.S. citizenship has been documented."</P>
      <P>Lee insisted that she was awaiting a retroactive ruling by U.S. authorities on
her U.S. citizenship status based on the fact that she was holding public office
in another country, a legal cause for loss of U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>Although Lee said she was confident there would be a resolution of the matter by
Jan. 31, she resigned Jan. 8 just as DPP politicians were promoting a campaign
to recall her and pro-DPP civic groups were preparing to besiege the legislature
to protest the lawmaking body's failure to act against her.</P>
      <P>A group of DPP legislators have filed a complaint with the Taipei District
Prosecutors Office accusing Lee of forgery and fraud.</P>
      <P>The legislators alleged that by holding dual citizenship while in public office,
Lee defrauded the public coffers of over NT$100 million in salary as a Taipei
City councilor between 1994 and 1998 and as a legislator from 1999 to 2009, and
they demanded that she return the "illicit gains."</P>
      <P>The CEC is scheduled to meet Friday to discuss whether Lee's election to public
office prior to 2008 should be nullified.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top tennis player Lu Yen-hsun, who reached a career-high 58 in the
world rankings on Monday following a breakthrough performance at the Australian
Open, will miss this weekend's Davis Cup tie against Kazakhstan because of an
inflamed knee.</P>
      <P>The announcement came as Taiwan's team for the Feb. 6-8 tie at Sinjhuang
Gymnasium in Taipei County was introduced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lu suffered discomfort to his right knee during his stunning five-set upset of
10th seed David Nalbandian of Argentina in the second round of the Australian
Open, and further aggravated it last week during a Challenger series event in
Heilbronn, Germany.</P>
      <P>Doctors there suggested that Lu remain in Germany to treat the knee rather than
play in Taiwans 2009 Davis Cup opener to prevent the  inflammation  from
growing  worse  and jeopardizing  his participation in upcoming ATP Tour events.</P>
      <P>Lu will be missed against Kazakhstan, whose top three players -- Andrey Golubev,
Mikhail Kukushkin and Yuri Schukin, all ranked in the world's top 200 --  played
for Russia before changing  their nationalities last year.</P>
      <P>The Feb. 6-8 tie was made necessary because the Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Zone
Group 1 has nine teams entered this year. Taiwan and Kazakhstan were drawn to
compete for the final spot in the official eight team draw, which begins
competition in earnest March 6-8.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan beats Kazakhstan this weekend, it will host India in March. A win over
India and either Australia or Thailand in May would send Taiwan to the elusive
World Group playoffs for the first time ever, a prospect Lu would surely relish.</P>
      <P>The oft-injured 25-year-old risked playing in Germany to try and cover ranking
points he was about to lose, but the gamble did not pay off when the knee acted
up during a second round 6-2, 6-0 loss to Karol Beck of Slovakia, said Lu Wei-
ru, Lu's older brother who helps manage his younger brother's affairs.</P>
      <P>Not treating the injury now could have financial consequences. Lu has already
signed up to play at four ATP tournaments in the U.S. beginning Feb. 9, but will
be fined by tennisorganizing body, the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals)
if he misses more than one of them due to injury, Lu Wei-ru told the Central
News Agency.</P>
      <P>In Lu's absence, Taiwan will likely depend on Wang Yeu-tzuoo and Chen Ti in the
four singles matches played on Friday and Sunday. A pivotal doubles is played
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wang, ranked as high as 85th in the world in 2006, is hoping to restart his
career this weekend after being sidelined for most of 2008 with an assortment of
ailments, the most serious a persistent wrist injury.</P>
      <P>He has played in only five ATP Tour event qualifying tournaments since last
years Australian Open, winning just one set in the five appearances.</P>
      <P>Wang told the Central News Agency he spent most of 2008 conditioning his body
and had only begun hitting balls in earnest at the end of November.</P>
      <P>Asked if he was worried about his lack of match competition or that the wrist
injury might still hamper him during the Davis Cup best-of-five set matches,
Wang deadpanned: I am worried about so many things that I've decided not to
worry about any them.</P>
      <P>Wang, whose natural talent was in evidence when he reached the finals of the US
Open boys singles at the age of 16 in 2001, felt he had recovered his basic
skills and was physically fit.</P>
      <P>But confidence can only come from tournaments. There's no way you can get
confidence from just practicing, It's not possible," said Wang,  whose
confidence and match toughness are likely to be challenged against Kazakhstan.</P>
      <P>Chen Ti, who has remade his game, from his grip to his serve, in the last six
weeks, will be testing how much he's absorbed.</P>
      <P>Although the world No. 375 Chen is ranked below Kazakhstan's top three players,
he said he was more confident than when he played Australia's Lleyton Hewitt in
a Davis Cup tie last February.</P>
      <P>"Last year when I played Hewitt, I was just hoping to play well. This year, I'm
playing to win."</P>

      <P>An international series of art exhibitions "CowParade" has arrived in Taipei and
officially kicked off Tuesday under the name "CowParade Taipei 2009," featuring
107 painted ox and cow sculptures scattered throughout the city.</P>
      <P>Taipei  is honored  to be chosen to host the CowParade exhibition, which
provides a great opportunity for us to market the city," Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-
bin said at the opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>In Chinese culture, cattle have special meaning because they represent good
luck, and this is exactly what the city hopes the exhibit, the biggest of its
kind in Asia, will bring to the country and its people, the mayor added.</P>
      <P>CowParade started out in Zurich in 1998 as an innovative idea by artistic
director Walter Knapp to hold an international exhibition to raise money for
charity.</P>
      <P>In the U.S., Chicago followed up on the idea in 1999 and New York in 2000, and
CowParade has since become the largest public art campaign and the most
outstanding city marketing and charity event in the world, attracting more than
half a billion visitors to date.</P>
      <P>CowParade is celebrating its 10th anniversary in Taipei City -- the 65th city to
host the event -- to coincide with the celebration of the Year of the Ox on the
Chinese calendar and the famous Taipei Lantern Festival.</P>
      <P>Jerry Elbaum, president of the CowParade Holdings Corporation that is organizing
the art campaign, said at the opening ceremony that Taiwanese artists have
outdone most of the artists in the rest of the world and that the Taipei exhibit
has surpassed anything he has ever seen in New York, Chicago, or Moscow.</P>
      <P>He told the Central News Agency that CowParade Taipei 2009 is unique and that
what amazes him most is that every piece of work is "extremely well-executed."</P>
      <P>"Everything I see here is so creative, so well thought out, and so well put
together -- this is great art," Elbaum said. "Taiwan is a country of tremendous
creativity and artistry."</P>
      <P>He noted that every piece on display in the Taipei exhibition is a new creation
by local artists, which reflects the culture, history, personality and art of
the local community.</P>
      <P>Organized by the Taipei City government's Department of Cultural Affairs and FUN
Capital International Co., Ltd., CowParade Taipei 2009 features 107 painted cows
and oxen made from fiberglass, grazing in 12 areas of the city, including the
Civic Plaza, Taipei 101, Chanti Boulevard and Anhe Market Place.</P>
      <P>In addition to integrating local themes such as kung fu and indigenous art, the
exhibit in Taipei also include novelties such as an ox named "Ben (galloping) "
on the top of the 508-meter skyscraper Taipei 101. This is the highest elevation
at which a piece has ever been exhibited in the event.</P>
      <P>CowParade Taipei 2009 is being held from Feb. 3-March 31.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic indicators drop to lowest level in over seven years</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy is liking to continue feeling the pinch in the coming months,
as its leading indicators in December fell to their lowest level since December
2001, the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The monitoring indicators for December registered a 9, two points lower than for
the previous month, while flashing a "blue" signal for the fourth consecutive
month, indicating that the economy is still in recession, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>The CEPD uses five colors to measure domestic economic health, with "red"
indicating serious overheating, "yellow-red" for light overheating, "green" for
steady growth, "yellow-blue" for a slowdown, and "blue" for recession.</P>
      <P>Among the monitoring indicators' nine separate components, direct and indirect
finance, and non-agricultural employment each lost one point, changing their
indicators from yellow-blue to blue.</P>
      <P>The signals for the other components -- monetary aggregate M1B, the  stock
prices  index,  the industrial  production  index, customs-cleared exports,
imports of machineries and electrical equipment, manufacturing sales and sales
indexes of wholesale, retail and food services -- remained unchanged, flashing
blue.</P>
      <P>At a press conference Tuesday, Huang Jui-bin, director-general of the CEPD's
Economic Research Department, reported that the composite index of leading
indicators -- a barometer for the economy's outlook in the coming three months
-- dropped by 2.3 percent from November to 93.</P>
      <P>The annualized six-month rate of change of the leading indicators index fell by
2 points to minus 17.2 percent, falling for the 14th consecutive month, Huang
said.</P>
      <P>All leading indicators contributed negatively to the index, hit hard by declines
in export orders, average monthly overtime in industry and services, building
permits, and book-to-bill ratios in the semiconductor machinery industry, the
official elaborated.</P>
      <P>The index of coincident indicators, which represents the current economic
situation, stood at 81.6 in December, down 8.2 percent from the previous month.
Its trend-adjusted index decreased by 8.4 percent to 75.4, the 10th consecutive
decline since last March.</P>
      <P>Huang warned the recession might be more protracted than the one Taiwan
experienced in 2001 when the Internet bubble burst.</P>
      <P>During the Internet bubble crisis, the monitoring indicators signal flashed blue
for 15 consecutive months from December 2000, with the monitoring score
remaining at a low of 9 for six months in 2001.</P>
      <P>This period of economic contraction would pose a bigger challenge than in 2001,
Huang said, because the latest rececssion has battered both Taiwan's export and
domestic markets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Closer ties with China have fortified Taiwan's sovereignty: Ma</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 3 (CNA)
02/03/09  20:53:56

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that the normalization of bilateral
relations between Taiwan and China has contributed to the consolidation of
Taiwan's sovereignty and enabled the country to make significant gains in
foreign relations and national defense.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the 2009 Taiwan Businessmen in China Lunar New Year Reception held
in Tainan, Ma asserted that closer ties with China have allowed Taiwan to play a
more active role in the international arena and played a vital role in Taiwan's
economic structure.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese entrepreneurs know better than the government if they should go
invest in China, " said Ma, but it was the government's responsibility  to
provide an efficient platform to facilitate logistics operations and protect
Taiwanese investment in China.</P>
      <P>Surrounded by the biggest economies in the world, Taiwan is in an economically
vital strategic position in Southeast Asia that better ties with China could
help Taiwan exploit.</P>
      <P>"Across the Pacific lies the United States, which is the biggest economy in the
world today, and not far from us to the north is Japan, the second biggest
economy in the world. The third largest global economic entity is located just
across the Taiwan Strait, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>The president suggested, however, that Taiwan has not been able to make good use
of its advantageous position in the area due to political conflicts and
constraints.</P>
      <P>"The most important job of my administration is to eliminate all obstacles that
limit Taiwan from taking advantage of its geographical advantages and achieving
steady and prosperous economic development," the president asserted.</P>
      <P>Ma said that although the normalization of bilateral ties with China has not
gone as smoothly as expected, the launching of the "direct three links" has
increased the "bargaining  chips" of Taiwanese investors in China amid the
global economical downturn.</P>
      <P>"The air and sea transportation sectors have not been the only beneficiaries of
the launch of the links, " Ma said. "The recent economic cooperation between the
two sides has also given Taiwanese investors  in China a chance to re-evaluate
their method of operations."</P>
      <P>The president also rebuffed accusations that his administration has tilted
excessively toward China at the expense of Taiwan's sovereignty and that the
United States and Japan share the same concerns.</P>
      <P>He said the economic liberalization policies adopted by the government are aimed
at improving Taiwan's investment environment and boosting the country's economic
development.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ma said, the improved cross-strait relations has been universally
welcomed by all of Taiwan's allies around the world.</P>
      <P>Asked why Taiwan was not mentioned during the recent dialogue between the United
States and China, Ma said that, "no news is good news," adding that it is normal
that Taiwan wasn't mentioned.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan is mentioned and discussed all the time, it would be bad for Taiwan's
investment environment," said Ma.</P>
      <P>Ma also said Taiwan's goal is to seek peace and stability in the area, and that
the exclusion of the "Taiwan issue" in the recent dialogue between the U.S. and
China is the best proof that improved ties are accepted and welcomed by all
parties.</P>
      <P>According  to Ma,  the  improvement  and normalization  of cross-strait ties is
the best way to restore mutual trust with the U.S. government.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. government approved arms sales to Taiwan last September due to
Taiwan's determination to become a problem solver instead of a troublemaker on
cross-strait issues, " he said.</P>
      <P>Since the Kuomintang (KMT) returned to power last May, Ma's administration has
committed itself to improving relations with Beijing and forging links across
the Taiwan Strait, particularly on the economic front.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) will be able to provide more job
openings after the Executive Yuan's NT$500 billion (US$14.93 billion) economic
stimulus package clears the legislature, the council said in a statement
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet is scheduled to submit a budget bill authorizing financing for the
package to the Legislative Yuan later this month.</P>
      <P>Once the bill is passed, the statement said, about NT$19 billion of the fund
will be allocated to the COA for various forestation and rural development
projects as part of government efforts to spur domestic demand amid the global
economic recession.</P>
      <P>With the new funding, the official said, the COA will be able to generate more
than 4,000 short-term and long-term jobs, with average daily wages ranging
between NT$800 and NT$1,000.</P>
      <P>Most of these job openings will be related to forest cultivation, weeding, and
national park tour services as part of the COA Forestry Bureau's forestation
project, the statement said.</P>
      <P>As the legislature has passed a rural rejuvenation statute to facilitate rural
development, the COA will also hire more people to conduct rural environment
surveys, the statement indicated, with some of the job openings to be created
under this project requiring at least a college-level education.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the COA plans to recruit more research assistants with tertiary
academic degrees.</P>
      <P>Other job openings to be provided by the COA include livestock slaughterhouse
cleaning,  but not the actual sluaghtering  of livestock, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Late last year, the COA opened 1,647 positions under the government's short-term
job creation plan, with 1,100 vacancies having being filled, the statement said.</P>

      <P>Nantou City will celebrate the traditional Lantern Festival this year by
focusing on local themes such as its agricultural products and a migrant bird
that winters there every year.</P>
      <P>At ceremony held in the Yungxing community on Mt. Baqua in the central Taiwan
city Tuesday, the city lit a theme lantern that depicted cattle, pineapples,
ginger, Chinese yam, tea, lychees, and gray-faced buzzard eagles.</P>
      <P>The lantern designer, Wu Chang-ping, who is a teacher at Fengming Junior High
School, said that he, the students and all the other teachers at the school
spent nine days crafting the theme lantern for the city's festival which is
scheduled to begin Feb. 7.</P>
      <P>Wu said he drew inspiration for the three-meter tall theme lantern from the
abundant variety of local agricultural products and the spectacular natural
environment.</P>
      <P>He said he hopes that, like the eagle depicted in his lantern, sales of Nantou
products will soar in 2009, the Year of the Ox on the lunar calendar.</P>

      <P>The Taipei International Book Exhibition (TIBE), which will open Wednesday, will
highlight four countries in particular -- Thailand, Germany, France and the U.S.
-- as prominent authors gather in the city to introduce their latest works and
new trends in literature, the event's organizer said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a pre-opening press conference, Taipei Book Fair Foundation Chairman
Linden Lin said that the TIBE, considered the world's second largest book fair,
is known for its lively literary and business exchanges as well as the special
activities usually held in tandem with the event, and thus attracts publishers
and authors worldwide.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, France will be represented by a 16-member group -- the
largest in years -- while Thailand, the fair's theme country this year, will
send a record 100 people to participate in the exhibition.</P>
      <P>Tawara Siripipat, a 23 year-old Thai writer and R&amp;B singer known as "Dr.
Pop," said that he hopes his science fiction works will inspire readers to
"liberalize (their) imaginations" from moral, traditional, religious and
political boundaries.</P>
      <P>Siripipat, who started writing at the age of 14 and published his first book at
17, also expressed the hope that he could serve as a role model for young
aspiring writers in Taiwan and inspire them to pursue their dreams.</P>
      <P>Risuan Aramcharoen, president of the Publishers and Booksellers Association of
Thailand, made mention of three other visiting authors -- Chart Korbjitti, who
has won two Southeast Asian Writers Awards, a Buddhist philosopher writer W.
Vajiramedhi, and Suwadee Chongsatitwatana, a three-time winner of Thailand's
literary awards -- who will be at the fair.</P>
      <P>In addition, Risuan said a variety of activities will be staged at the Thailand
pavilion, including a puppet performance, cooking and handicraft demonstrations,
lectures, and quick Thai language instructions.</P>
      <P>At the German pavilion, Ulrich Janetzki, president of Literarisches Colloquium
Berlin, said that Taiwanese readers will be able to gain a different perspective
on what he described as normally "serious" German literature by reading the
works of Jan Boettcher, who uses irony to discuss philosophical issues.</P>
      <P>Anthony Chaumuzeau, an Institut Francais de Taipei official, said that France
will showcase children's literature and photography arts this year.</P>
      <P>In a demonstration of its literary scope, the United States this year will have
300 independent publishers at the fair, the organizer said, adding that the U.S.
contingent will also hold forums on the latest developments in digital content.</P>
      <P>The TIBE will be held at the Taipei World Trade Center from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Feb. 4-9, with extended opening hours to 10 p.m. from Feb. 6-8, according to the

    <TEXT>
      <P>In the face of rising unemployment around the country, several local governments
have come up with initiatives to help alleviate the jobless situation in their
municipalities.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung City government on Tuesday launched a low interest loan program
under which enterprises and stall vendors certified by the local government may
apply for loans of NT$300,000 to NT$50,000 at an interest rate of around 2.625
percent.</P>
      <P>The city government and the Small and Medium Enterprise Credit Guarantee Fund of
Taiwan will each allocate NT$20 million to fund the program, which is expected
to result in total financing of NT$400 million through a multiplier effect. The
loans will be made available to some 1,000 companies and vendors in the city.</P>
      <P>Also on Tuesday, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu announced that the city government
will offer a number of short-term jobs in the areas of street cleaning, dengue
fever prevention and promotion of the 2009 Kaohsiung World Games. It will also
create jobs for research and survey professionals, she said.</P>
      <P>Chen added that the southern city will seek at least 10,000 job openings for its
residents among the 150,000 short-term jobs the central government has promised
to supply.</P>
      <P>The mayor advised job hunters in the city to first try to land a job, then seek
to find a better one.</P>
      <P>Chen her government plans to open a series of courses for the unemployed to
sharpen their professional skills.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Kaohsiung county government submitted an employment promotion
program Tuesday to the county council for review, under which a total of 502
six-month jobs will be offered to local citizens.</P>
      <P>The county government will provide some NT$61.46 million in subsidies to
employers for salaries and labor insurance fees for these short-term workers
over six months, according to Sung Ting-tung, director general of the county's
Labor Affairs Bureau.</P>
      <P>The subsidies will cover NT$800 per day for each ordinary worker and NT$900 per
day for each executive for a maximum of 22 days a month, he added.</P>
      <P>In a different approach to the unemployment problem, Chiayi Magistrate Chen
Ming-wen led local government officials in a religious rite Tuesday to pray to
the gods to help the unemployed weather the difficult times.</P>

      <P>Baseball legend Sadaharu Oh said Tuesday that despite  recent  gambling
scandals  in Taiwan's  Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) , he is
confident that the local baseball community can find a way to win back the
hearts and minds of once loyal fans.</P>
      <P>Known in Taiwan as Wang Chen-chih, baseball's all-time home run king said at a
press conference in Taipei that the association of professional baseball players
with gamblers has been a bad influence on the country's youth and a terrible
disappointment for fans.</P>
      <P>He contended that professional athletes should not only entertain the public but
also serve as role models.</P>
      <P>"Japan had the same problem over 40 years ago, " Oh recalled, saying it took
years for Japan's government and members of Japan's baseball community to regain
the trust and support of the public.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that the mere act of using baseball as a money-making tool is not
only shameful but also disrespecful to all baseball lovers, Oh said that
professional baseball players should never betray the trust and support of their
fans by involving themselves in illegal or immoral activities.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan's baseball community works hard enough to win back the hearts and
minds of their supporters, I don't see why the CPBL can't have a bright future,"
Oh said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Oh said that despite of his many commitments in Japan, he will do his
best to promote baseball in Taiwan in order to let young players understand the
virtues that can be developed while practicing the game.</P>
      <P>"Baseball is a game of teamwork and discipline, which I believe they will need
when they grow up," Oh said.</P>
      <P>Asked what he would recommend for Taiwanese players who want to pursue a
professional baseball career in Japan, Oh said it was vital for young players to
be mentally and physically prepared since the baseball season in Japan is a
little bit longer than in Taiwan, running from February to November.</P>
      <P>Asked if he is anxious to meet President Ma Ying-jeou later this week, Oh said
that he respects Ma's efforts to help the nation cope with the recent economic
crisis and is very much looking forward to meet this "beautiful man."</P>
      <P>Oh was referring to Ma's good looks and his penchant for exercising, a rare
habit among Asian leaders, Oh remarked.</P>
      <P>Oh, who retired from the Yomiuri Giants in 1980 at the age of 40, hit 868 home
runs during his career, the most hit by a player in any professional league
around the world.</P>
      <P>The son of a Chinese father and a Japanese mother and a Republic of China
citizen, Oh has never forgotten his Chinese heritage despite spending most of
his life in Japan.</P>
      <P>He has always maintained a close relationship with Taiwan's baseball community
and has contributed his services to the sport's development here.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Yunlin County health officials took new samples from a factory run by Wei Chuan
Corp. to determine whether infant formula it exported to China may have been
tainted by a bacteria that can be lethal if it infects infants.</P>
      <P>Wu Ying-lang, a section chief at Yunlin's health bureau, said samples of three
infant formulas sold exclusively in Taiwan will be sent to the Bureau of Food
and Drug Analysis under the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) for in-
depth testing to ease local consumer concerns over food safety.</P>
      <P>It was the second day in a row that Yunlin County officials collected samples
from the company after local media reported on Monday that three infant formulas
shipped from Wei Chuan's Douliou plant were found by Chinese customs agents in
Shenzhen on Oct. 30 to be contaminated with the bacteria Enterobacter sakazakii.</P>
      <P>The shipment of 200 cartons totaling 9.264 tons of infant formula was said to be
destroyed on the spot by Chinese inspectors the same day.</P>
      <P>According to Wei Chuan executives, the three exported infant formulas were not
sold in Taiwan, but operations at the company's Douliou plant have been
temporarily suspended pending the result of the DOH tests.</P>
      <P>The news has sent Wei Chuan shares down 9.6 percent to NT$18.80 over the past
two days, despite a rebound for food shares in general on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, county officials have poured through the Douliou factory's
inspection records over the past year to help determine whether the food
producer's quality control process was in any way flawed.</P>
      <P>So far, he said, Yunlin County officials have not found any evidence that the
company's raw materials, finished products, or manufacturing facilities were
contaminated with the bacteria.</P>
      <P>The rod-shaped Enterobacter sakazakii bacteria is capable of causing meningitis

    <HEADLINE>Flu vaccines not as effective this year as in the past: DOH</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Influenza vaccines that proved to be effective late last year have failed to
live up to expectations early this year, the Department of Health (DOH) said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chou Jih-haw, deputy director general of DOH's Centers for Disease Control, said
more than 3.2 million free flu shots were given to the public in autumn and
winter last year.</P>
      <P>"Judging from the number of influenza cases in the fourth quarter of 2008, it
was significantly lower than in the same period the previous year," Chou said.</P>
      <P>"But this year, tests of flu viruses on the patients showed that the results
have not been as good as expected," he continued.</P>
      <P>Chou said influenza vaccines given in autumn 2008 and this winter should be
effective against the H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, and tests taken from patients who
were inoculated last year proved their effectiveness.</P>
      <P>But in January, tests found the vaccines did not work on 70 percent of those
with H1N1 viruses and 40 percent of those with the H3N2 virus. A vaccine is
considered effective if it controls the virus in 80 percent to 90 percent of
those inoculated.</P>
      <P>Chou would not categorize the vaccines as ineffective, however, because
influenza viruses are "prone to mutation, " meaning that the virus formula for
producing vaccines must be changed on a yearly basis.</P>
      <P>A former CDC director suggested Tuesday that part of the problem may be that flu
viruses tend to strike Taiwan between six months and two years earlier than
European countries and the United States.</P>
      <P>Su Ih-jen, director of the Division of Clinical Research of the National Health
Research Institutes, said that because of the time lag,  influenza  vaccines
produced  by European  and American pharmaceutical makers based on data provided
by the World Health Organization could not keep up with the outbreak of flu in
Asia.</P>
      <P>Su noted that with close exchanges between Taiwan and China, Taiwan has become
an outpost of influenza outbreaks.</P>
      <P>The World Health Organization began to address the issue of different prevalent
viruses in Asia and Europe last April.</P>
      <P>Currently, two out of five major vaccine manufacturers have made inroads into
China, and the production of Asian influenza vaccines "has become a trend," he
said.</P>
      <P>Su suggested that the virus in every influenza outbreak is slightly different,
and that "it can show major changes about every five years, so the effectiveness
of vaccines can diminish."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ven. Master Sheng Yen, founder of the Dharma Drum Mountain Monastery in northern
Taiwan, died Tuesday at the age of 78.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen, recognized as one of the foremost contemporary Buddhist masters
teaching Chan Buddhism, had suffered from kidney problems in recent years. He
had a dysfunctional left kidney removed in 2006, and doctors also found his
right kidney seriously calcified.</P>
      <P>He declined the doctors' suggestion that he have a kidney transplant and
insisted that he should accept the natural result in life.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen once told his disciples, "I am too old, and it would be such a waste
to have a good kidney transplanted to me."</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen was a 72nd generation descendant of Bodhidharma, the first patriarch
of Chan Buddhism, and a 67th generation descendant of Hui-Neng (638-713), the
sixth patriarch of Chan Buddhism.</P>
      <P>He was born on a farm near Shanghai in early l931 and joined a nearby Buddhist
Chan temple as a monk at 13.</P>
      <P>Unhappy that he was assigned to do mainly ordinary chores every day in the first
two years, he ran away and joined the Buddhist Academy at Ching-an Monastery in
Shanghai, where he had his first chance to hear inspiring teachings from Chan
Master Xu Yun and Master Tai Xu when they visited Shanghai.</P>
      <P>In 1949, shortly after the Communist takeover of China, he was conscripted into
the Nationalist Army and moved to Taiwan. He was a warrant officer then and
served as a telegraph operator.</P>
      <P>In the army, he continued his studies in Buddhism and meditated daily. He also
used his leave to visit various monasteries.</P>
      <P>After 10 years of military service, he retired from the army and resumed
monastic life in 1959 at the Buddhist Culture Center in Beitou, in suburban
Taipei.</P>
      <P>In that year, he met his first real master, Ling Yuan, in southern Taiwan and
learned the methods of experiencing peace, tranquility and happiness in life.</P>
      <P>He was a disciple for two years under Master Tung Chu, a heir to both the Lin
Chi and Tsao Tung sects of Chan Buddhism, before going into solitary retreat in
the mountains for six years from 1961 to 1968.</P>
      <P>At 38, he went to Japan to pursue further education to pave the way for future
Dharma preaching. He received a master's degree in 1971 and a doctorate in
Buddhist literature in 1975 from Rissho University.</P>
      <P>In 1975 he formally received transmission from Chan Master Dong Chu of the Tsao
Dong sect, and in 1978 he also received transmission from Chan Master Ling Yuan
of the Lin Chi tradition. From then on, he became the Dharma heir in the two
lineages of Chan Buddhism.</P>
      <P>Two years later,  he became the abbot of The Temple  of Enlightenment in New
York and started to teach Buddhism in the United States.</P>
      <P>In the following years, he conducted more than 140 group meditation retreats in
the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe, using his teachings to help
practitioners achieve peace and harmony of the body, the mind, the family and
their careers.</P>
      <P>Each year, he would spend half of his time in the United States and the other
half in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He traveled extensively to China, Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines, Japan,
Malaysia, Russia, The United Kingdom, Poland, Germany, Belgium, Italy, the Czech
Republic, Croatia, Argentina, Costa Rica and Brazil to preach the dharma.</P>
      <P>In 1978 Sheng Yen became a professor  at Chinese Culture University and
president of the Chung-Hwa Buddhist Cultural Institute in Taipei. The next year,
he became the abbot of Nung Chan Monastery in Beitou. He founded the Chan
Meditation Center and the Institute of Chung-Hwa Buddhist Culture in New York in
1980, and five years later, he set up the Chung-Hwa Institute of Buddhist
Studies in Taipei.</P>
      <P>With more than 1 million followers worldwide, Master Sheng Yen began to feel the
need for a permanent, spacious monastery, called Dharma Drum Mountain. After
spending eight years looking for a construction site, he finally succeeded in
2000.</P>
      <P>The Dharma Drum Mountain Monastery, located in Jinshan township, Taipei County,
was inaugurated in October 2005. His wish fulfilled, the master's health showed
signs of deterioration. In his final years, his devotion to Buddhist teaching
never faded, and he was still planning to build a Dharma Drum University.</P>
      <P>Master Sheng Yen received many awards from different governments in recognition
of his humanitarian,  cultural,  and  academic contributions. In August 2000, he
was one of the keynote speakers in the Millennium World Peace Summit of
Religious and Spiritual Leaders held in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>He was the author of some 90 books in Chinese and over a dozen books in English.
Some of his books have been translated into more than 12 languages, including
French, German, Japanese, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and
Vietnamese.</P>
      <P>In spite of his achievements, Master Sheng Yen maintained his usual humbleness,
insisting that he was just an ordinary person living a monastic life.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Baseball legend optimistic about Taiwan's pro baseball future</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Baseball legend Sadaharu Oh said Tuesday that despite  recent  gambling
scandals  in Taiwan's  Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) , he is
confident that the local baseball community can find a way to win back the
hearts and minds of once loyal fans.</P>
      <P>Known in Taiwan as Wang Chen-chih, baseball's all-time home run king said at a
press conference in Taipei that the association of professional baseball players
with gamblers has been a bad influence on the country's youth and a terrible
disappointment for fans.</P>
      <P>He contended that professional athletes should not only entertain the public but
also serve as role models.</P>
      <P>"Japan had the same problem over 40 years ago, " Oh recalled, saying it took
years for Japan's government and members of Japan's baseball community to regain
the trust and support of the public.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that the mere act of using baseball as a money-making tool is not
only shameful but also disrespecful to all baseball lovers, Oh said that
professional baseball players should never betray the trust and support of their
fans by involving themselves in illegal or immoral activities.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan's baseball community works hard enough to win back the hearts and
minds of their supporters, I don't see why the CPBL can't have a bright future,"
Oh said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Oh said that despite of his many commitments in Japan, he will do his
best to promote baseball in Taiwan in order to let young players understand the
virtues that can be developed while practicing the game.</P>
      <P>"Baseball is a game of teamwork and discipline, which I believe they will need
when they grow up," Oh said.</P>
      <P>Asked what he would recommend for Taiwanese players who want to pursue a
professional baseball career in Japan, Oh said it was vital for young players to
be mentally and physically prepared since the baseball season in Japan is a
little bit longer than in Taiwan, running from February to November.</P>
      <P>Asked if he is anxious to meet President Ma Ying-jeou later this week, Oh said
that he respects Ma's efforts to help the nation cope with the recent economic
crisis and is very much looking forward to meet this "beautiful man."</P>
      <P>Oh was referring to Ma's good looks and his penchant for exercising, a rare
habit among Asian leaders, Oh remarked.</P>
      <P>Oh, who retired from the Yomiuri Giants in 1980 at the age of 40, hit 868 home
runs during his career, the most hit by a player in any professional league
around the world.</P>
      <P>The son of a Chinese father and a Japanese mother and a Republic of China
citizen, Oh has never forgotten his Chinese heritage despite spending most of
his life in Japan.</P>
      <P>He has always maintained a close relationship with Taiwan's baseball community
and has contributed his services to the sport's development here.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Yunlin officials investigating questionable infant formulas</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Yunlin County health officials took new samples from a factory run by Wei Chuan
Corp. to determine whether infant formula it exported to China may have been
tainted by a bacteria that can be lethal if it infects infants.</P>
      <P>Wu Ying-lang, a section chief at Yunlin's health bureau, said samples of three
infant formulas sold exclusively in Taiwan will be sent to the Bureau of Food
and Drug Analysis under the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) for in-
depth testing to ease local consumer concerns over food safety.</P>
      <P>It was the second day in a row that Yunlin County officials collected samples
from the company after local media reported on Monday that three infant formulas
shipped from Wei Chuan's Douliou plant were found by Chinese customs agents in
Shenzhen on Oct. 30 to be contaminated with the bacteria Enterobacter sakazakii.</P>
      <P>The shipment of 200 cartons totaling 9.264 tons of infant formula was said to be
destroyed on the spot by Chinese inspectors the same day.</P>
      <P>According to Wei Chuan executives, the three exported infant formulas were not
sold in Taiwan, but operations at the company's Douliou plant have been
temporarily suspended pending the result of the DOH tests.</P>
      <P>The news has sent Wei Chuan shares down 9.6 percent to NT$18.80 over the past
two days, despite a rebound for food shares in general on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, county officials have poured through the Douliou factory's
inspection records over the past year to help determine whether the food
producer's quality control process was in any way flawed.</P>
      <P>So far, he said, Yunlin County officials have not found any evidence that the
company's raw materials, finished products, or manufacturing facilities were
contaminated with the bacteria.</P>
      <P>The rod-shaped Enterobacter sakazakii bacteria is capable of causing meningitis
and enteritis and has a fatality rate of more than 50 percent when infecting
newborns.</P>
      <P>Wei Chuan, one of Taiwan's biggest food processing companies, has been trying to
penetrate the Chinese market and exported the suspect shipment in October
through an agent in Hong Kong.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Flu vaccines not as effective this year as in the past: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  3 (CNA)
02/04/09  10:49:45
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Influenza vaccines that proved to be effective late last year have failed to
live up to expectations early this year, the Department of Health (DOH) said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chou Jih-haw, deputy director general of DOH's Centers for Disease Control, said
more than 3.2 million free flu shots were given to the public in autumn and
winter last year.</P>
      <P>"Judging from the number of influenza cases in the fourth quarter of 2008, it
was significantly lower than in the same period the previous year," Chou said.</P>
      <P>"But this year, tests of flu viruses on the patients showed that the results
have not been as good as expected," he continued.</P>
      <P>Chou said influenza vaccines given in autumn 2008 and this winter should be
effective against the H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, and tests taken from patients who
were inoculated last year proved their effectiveness.</P>
      <P>But in January, tests found the vaccines did not work on 70 percent of those
with H1N1 viruses and 40 percent of those with the H3N2 virus. A vaccine is
considered effective if it controls the virus in 80 percent to 90 percent of
those inoculated.</P>
      <P>Chou would not categorize the vaccines as ineffective, however, because
influenza viruses are "prone to mutation, " meaning that the virus formula for
producing vaccines must be changed on a yearly basis.</P>
      <P>A former CDC director suggested Tuesday that part of the problem may be that flu
viruses tend to strike Taiwan between six months and two years earlier than
European countries and the United States.</P>
      <P>Su Ih-jen, director of the Division of Clinical Research of the National Health
Research Institutes, said that because of the time lag,  influenza  vaccines
produced  by European  and American pharmaceutical makers based on data provided
by the World Health Organization could not keep up with the outbreak of flu in
Asia.</P>
      <P>Su noted that with close exchanges between Taiwan and China, Taiwan has become
an outpost of influenza outbreaks.</P>
      <P>The World Health Organization began to address the issue of different prevalent
viruses in Asia and Europe last April.</P>
      <P>Currently, two out of five major vaccine manufacturers have made inroads into
China, and the production of Asian influenza vaccines "has become a trend," he
said.</P>
      <P>Su suggested that the virus in every influenza outbreak is slightly different,
and that "it can show major changes about every five years, so the effectiveness
of vaccines can diminish."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chan Buddhist Master Sheng Yen dies at 78</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 3 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ven. Master Sheng Yen, founder of the Dharma Drum Mountain Monastery in northern
Taiwan, died Tuesday at the age of 78.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen, recognized as one of the foremost contemporary Buddhist masters
teaching Chan Buddhism, had suffered from kidney problems in recent years. He
had a dysfunctional left kidney removed in 2006, and doctors also found his
right kidney seriously calcified.</P>
      <P>He declined the doctors' suggestion that he have a kidney transplant and
insisted that he should accept the natural result in life.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen once told his disciples, "I am too old, and it would be such a waste
to have a good kidney transplanted to me."</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen was a 72nd generation descendant of Bodhidharma, the first patriarch
of Chan Buddhism, and a 67th generation descendant of Hui-Neng (638-713), the
sixth patriarch of Chan Buddhism.</P>
      <P>He was born on a farm near Shanghai in early l931 and joined a nearby Buddhist
Chan temple as a monk at 13.</P>
      <P>Unhappy that he was assigned to do mainly ordinary chores every day in the first
two years, he ran away and joined the Buddhist Academy at Ching-an Monastery in
Shanghai, where he had his first chance to hear inspiring teachings from Chan
Master Xu Yun and Master Tai Xu when they visited Shanghai.</P>
      <P>In 1949, shortly after the Communist takeover of China, he was conscripted into
the Nationalist Army and moved to Taiwan. He was a warrant officer then and
served as a telegraph operator.</P>
      <P>In the army, he continued his studies in Buddhism and meditated daily. He also
used his leave to visit various monasteries.</P>
      <P>After 10 years of military service, he retired from the army and resumed
monastic life in 1959 at the Buddhist Culture Center in Beitou, in suburban
Taipei.</P>
      <P>In that year, he met his first real master, Ling Yuan, in southern Taiwan and
learned the methods of experiencing peace, tranquility and happiness in life.</P>
      <P>He was a disciple for two years under Master Tung Chu, a heir to both the Lin
Chi and Tsao Tung sects of Chan Buddhism, before going into solitary retreat in
the mountains for six years from 1961 to 1968.</P>
      <P>At 38, he went to Japan to pursue further education to pave the way for future
Dharma preaching. He received a master's degree in 1971 and a doctorate in
Buddhist literature in 1975 from Rissho University.</P>
      <P>In 1975 he formally received transmission from Chan Master Dong Chu of the Tsao
Dong sect, and in 1978 he also received transmission from Chan Master Ling Yuan
of the Lin Chi tradition. From then on, he became the Dharma heir in the two
lineages of Chan Buddhism.</P>
      <P>Two years later,  he became the abbot of The Temple  of Enlightenment in New
York and started to teach Buddhism in the United States.</P>
      <P>In the following years, he conducted more than 140 group meditation retreats in
the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe, using his teachings to help
practitioners achieve peace and harmony of the body, the mind, the family and
their careers.</P>
      <P>Each year, he would spend half of his time in the United States and the other
half in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He traveled extensively to China, Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines, Japan,
Malaysia, Russia, The United Kingdom, Poland, Germany, Belgium, Italy, the Czech
Republic, Croatia, Argentina, Costa Rica and Brazil to preach the dharma.</P>
      <P>In 1978 Sheng Yen became a professor  at Chinese Culture University and
president of the Chung-Hwa Buddhist Cultural Institute in Taipei. The next year,
he became the abbot of Nung Chan Monastery in Beitou. He founded the Chan
Meditation Center and the Institute of Chung-Hwa Buddhist Culture in New York in
1980, and five years later, he set up the Chung-Hwa Institute of Buddhist
Studies in Taipei.</P>
      <P>With more than 1 million followers worldwide, Master Sheng Yen began to feel the
need for a permanent, spacious monastery, called Dharma Drum Mountain. After
spending eight years looking for a construction site, he finally succeeded in
2000.</P>
      <P>The Dharma Drum Mountain Monastery, located in Jinshan township, Taipei County,
was inaugurated in October 2005. His wish fulfilled, the master's health showed
signs of deterioration. In his final years, his devotion to Buddhist teaching
never faded, and he was still planning to build a Dharma Drum University.</P>
      <P>Master Sheng Yen received many awards from different governments in recognition
of his humanitarian,  cultural,  and  academic contributions. In August 2000, he
was one of the keynote speakers in the Millennium World Peace Summit of
Religious and Spiritual Leaders held in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>He was the author of some 90 books in Chinese and over a dozen books in English.
Some of his books have been translated into more than 12 languages, including
French, German, Japanese, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and
Vietnamese.</P>
      <P>In spite of his achievements, Master Sheng Yen maintained his usual humbleness,
insisting that he was just an ordinary person living a monastic life.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to China plunged for the third consecutive month in November
2008, throttled by declining demand due to the global economic downturn,
according to a report released Tuesday by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Exports to China fell by 38.8 percent year-on-year in November to a three-year
monthly low of US$4.16 billion, the largest-ever decrease recorded for a single
month, said the ministry's Bureau of Foreign Trade.</P>
      <P>For November 2008, exports to China contributed 24.8 percent to Taiwan's total
exports, down 6.3 percentage points from the same month of the previous year.</P>
      <P>All export items were affected by the shrinkage, with the most serious fall seen
in optical products, organic chemicals, copper and related products,
miscellaneous chemicals and mineral fuels -- all of which experienced declines
of over 50 percent.</P>
      <P>Exports to China of electrical machinery, equipment and parts -- Taiwan's
largest export item -- also fell by 31.9 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the sharp fall in exports dragged Taiwan's trade surplus with China
down to US$1.96 billion for the month.</P>
      <P>The amount marked a decrease of 55.1 percent year-on-year and was the lowest
level recorded for a single month over the past five years, after months
affected by the Chinese New Year holiday were excluded.</P>
      <P>The bureau predicted Taiwan's exports to China will remain slow through the
first half of 2009 as the global recession has not yet bottomed out.</P>

      <P>Formosan butterflies, which were flown to Sweden in paper and styrofoam cases in
their "previous life" as pupae, have brightened up Sweden's dark winter days
with their full-of-life colors, shapes and movement, Swedish media reported
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A total of 900 butterflies from Taiwan that have emerged from their cocoons at a
Stockholm butterfly house over the past month are said to have attracted
capacity crowds from around Sweden since being unveiled in the unprecedented
exhibition that opened Jan. 10.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Zoo flew the Formosan butterflies while they were still in their
pupal state on three separate flights to the Stockholm Butterfly House in early
January for the exhibition, bringing tropical warmth to people in the
Scandinavian country.</P>
      <P>Over 1,000 people visited the butterfly house this past weekend alone, according
to a report by Sweden's public television station Sveriges monitored in Berlin
Tuesday evening.</P>
      <P>"Not many people would connect Taiwan to butterflies, but actually Taiwan is one
of the countries in the world that have the greatest number of butterfly
species, and Taiwan has often been nicknamed as a 'butterfly kingdom,'" the TV
channel reported.</P>
      <P>In an interview with Sveriges Television, Taiwan's representative in Sweden Chiu
Chung-jen said that there are a wide variety of butterfly species in Taiwan and
the ongoing display of Formosan butterflies at the Stockholm Butterfly House
could serve as a window for Swedish people to catch a glimpse of Taiwan's

      <P>The stimulative effect of a massive public works program pushed by the
government is not likely to be felt until the third quarter because of the
varying scale of the projects, the Cabinet-level Public Construction Commission
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The planned public works include large-scale projects, such as railway, highway,
seaport and airport renewal and the rebuilding of sewage systems and bridges,
and medium- and small-scale projects, including flood prevention measures and
the renovation of old or dangerious school buildings, the commission said.</P>
      <P>While medium- and small-scale public construction projects are expected to
create job opportunities immediately or in the near term, large-scale projects
need a longer period to plan and prepare, a commission official said, making it
unlikely that the plan will deliver concrete results until the third quarter of
this year.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan is expected to approve the package of public works projects
next week.</P>
      <P>The plan will funnel some NT$500 billion (US$14.88 billion) over the next four
years into infrastructure projects to try to pull Taiwan's battered economy out

      <P>With Lu Yen-hsun ruled out of Taiwan's Davis Cup tie against Kazakhstan this
weekend in Taipei County, the host's hopes could rest on one player who has lost
all of his ranking points and another who has relearned the game from scratch
over the past six weeks.</P>
      <P>Wang Yeu-tzuoo and Chen Ti have been away from competitive tennis for months,
and how they will perform under Davis Cup pressure against Kazakhstan's top-200
Russian transplants makes an already important Feb. 6-8 tie truly intriguing.</P>
      <P>As insignificant as the opening Asia/Oceania Zone Group I tie of the year -- and
one being played simply to fill out the zone's eight-team draw -- might seem,
the stakes cannot be underestimated.</P>
      <P>When Taiwan reached Asia/Oceania Zone Group 1 in 2003, it expected that with
legitimate top-100 players in Lu and Wang, it would regular finish in the top
two in the zone's annual competition and qualify for the World Group playoffs --
the gateway to the World Group, the pinnacle of Davis Cup tennis.</P>
      <P>The hopes never materialized, however, derailed by injuries and turmoil between
the players and local tennis authorities.</P>
      <P>With Wang and Lu now older, and Taiwan likely to play most of its ties in the
next few years on the road, this year may be the team's last best chance for a
while to sparkle in the premier international team tennis competition.</P>
      <P>Kazakhstan, which has been pouring some of its oil wealth into tennis and wants
to become an Asian power in the sport, could be a formidable opponent with
Russian imports No. 118 Andrey Gobulev, No. 145 Mikhail Kukushkin and No. 180
Yuri Schukin.</P>
      <P>The central Asian country nearly beat Taiwan (led by Lu and Chen) in a Davis Cup
relegation playoff in Almaty in April last year with only Schukin at its
disposal, and it will now have reinforcements to take on players who have not
played a lot of matches recently.</P>
      <P>Chen Ti, who has fallen to 375 in the world rankings, last played competitively
in three Challengers last November that included a 6-2, 6-2 loss to Golubev.</P>
      <P>Though he may be rusty, he says he is rejuvenated and much improved after
working with former French player Tarik Benhabiles on the advice of a friend on
the ATP Tour, even if Benhabiles' initial appraisal of the 25-year-old who
turned pro in 2002 was brutal.</P>
      <P>"He said everything I was doing was wrong, Chen recalls.Even the way I was
holding the racket was wrong. I felt like a young kid who was learning the game
for the first time.</P>
      <P>Chen spent three weeks with Benhabiles in August and another six weeks at his
Florida academy from mid-December to the end of January overhauling his game.</P>
      <P>"We worked on everything, starting with physical conditioning and core strength,
doing 200 to 300 sit-ups to start the day,Chen said. "He also changed my grip,
but the big change was to the serve.</P>
      <P>To get Chen to serve in one fluid motion rather than the stop-start motion he
was used to, Benhabiles had him first practice throwing a ball as far as he
could and build up his shoulder strength before even letting him touch a racket.</P>
      <P>The French coach, who counts Andy Roddick, Richard Gasquet and Gael Monfils as
among those he has helped, also went back to basics to tweak Chen's ground
strokes.</P>
      <P>"We worked a lot on fundamentals like staying lower and rotating the body more,
Chen said, admitting that the experience was an eye opener.</P>
      <P>"I never really had formal training from the time I was young. I relied mostly
on observing others and doing what they did. I've finally learned how to do
things the right way.</P>
      <P>If team captain Lien Yu-hui is right, and Chen has added 20 miles per hour to
his serve, it could be a real boost to a player whose serve has always been a
liability, and even identified as such by Lleyton Hewitt after he beat Chen last
February in straight sets in an Asia/Oceania Zone Group I Davis Cup tie.</P>
      <P>"I've had trouble holding my serve, so having a better serve will really help
me. If I'm serving well, everything else seems to fall into place,said Chen,
whose highest ranking in a journeyman career was 255 in 2005.</P>
      <P>The question now is whether he has had enough time with his new game to make it
work this weekend. Although Lien will not identify who will play Friday's two
singles matches until Thursday, the odds are good he will go with Chen and the
talented Wang, who was sidelined for most of 2008 with a persistent wrist injury
and has zero ranking points to his name.</P>
      <P>Wang, a natural showman who plays better the more raucous the home crowd, is
hoping the home court advantage will overcome his lack of match preparation.</P>
      <P>I really hope there will be a big crowd, because it will help our
confidence,Wang said.</P>
      <P>The tie is being held at the Sinjhuang Gymnasium Feb. 6-8. Admission is free.
Friday's two singles matches, Saturday's doubles and Sunday's reverse singles
all begin at 1 p.m.</P>

      <P>Local athletes who will participate in the 2009 Special Olympics World Winter
Games will depart later in the day for the United States, where the competition
is being held, the Sports Affairs Council (SAC) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the flag presentation  ceremony,  President Ma Ying-jeou expressed
the hope that Taiwan's athletes will help extend the country's people-to-people
diplomacy and allow them to better understand Taiwan from a sports perspective.</P>
      <P>Though Taiwan does not have an ideal environment to train for the Winter Games,
the leader of Taiwan's delegation Pai Hsiu-hsiung said local athletes have been
able to hone their skills in places such as beaches to make up for the lack of
snow and ice.</P>
      <P>According to the SAC, the 59-member delegation, including 36 young athletes with
mental disabilities and 10 coaches, will compete in four events -- speed
skating, figure skating, snowshoeing and floor hockey -- under the name
ofChinese Taipei.</P>
      <P>Taiwan won 20 gold medals, 13 silvers and 10 bronzes in the previous Special
Olympics held in the Japanese city of Nagano, the SAC said.</P>
      <P>An estimated 2,500 athletes from 85 countries will participate in this year's
competition in Boise, Idaho from Feb. 7-13. Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing
and snowboarding will also be featured events.</P>
      <P>Similar to the Olympic Games, the Special Olympics takes place every four years
and includes summer and winter versions. The first Special Olympics Summer Games
were held in the U.S. city of Chicago in 1968, while the first Winter Games were
held in 1977 in Steamboat Springs, also in the U.S..</P>
      <P>The delegation is slated to leave the U.S. on Feb. 15 and to return to Taiwan on
Feb. 17, the SAC said.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Wednesday opened the 2009 Taipei International Book
Exhibition (TiBE) , the second largest book fair in the world, and praised
Taiwan's publishing industry for being a vital source of the country's "soft
power."</P>
      <P>Speaking at the book fair's opening ceremony, at which he also presented awards
to winners of the 2nd Taipei International Book Exhibition Prize, Ma also urged
the public to read more to enrich themselves amid a weak global economy.</P>
      <P>Ma said Taiwan's publication of over 40,000 new books last year, compared to
200,000 in China, which has 56 times more people, highlights the significant
"soft power" Taiwan possesses in the global Chinese community.</P>
      <P>"The TiBE serves as an important channel for Taiwan to communicate with
countries around the world," Ma said. "Through reading, we can make a lot of
friends and enrich the profundity of our culture and way of thinking."</P>
      <P>The president said that despite a stagnant economy, people should not save money
when it comes to buying books, as reading is a source of personal enrichment
that can come in handy in difficult times.</P>
      <P>Taipei Book Fair Foundation Chairman Linden Lin said that the 2009 TiBE serves
as a platform for international publishers and authors to exchange ideas on
publishing and share the passion of reading.</P>
      <P>Featuring some 2,000 booths from a total of 41 countries, the TiBE will be held
in the three exhibition halls of the Taipei World Trade Center, with Hall 1
reserved for international publishers, Hall 2 for cartoon and animation books,
and Hall 3 for children's books.</P>
      <P>The fair will be open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Feb. 4-9, with extended opening
hours to 10 p.m. from Feb. 6-8, according to the organizer.</P>
      <P>The first day will be reserved for professionals  in the publishing industry and
people with physical disabilities while the fair will be open to the general

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou is unlikely to visit Africa in the near future given the
situation at home and abroad, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)  spokesman
Henry Chen said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's four diplomatic allies in Africa, including Gambia and Swaziland, have
planned to invite Ma for state visits to their countries, but the president is
presently focusing his time and energy on bolstering the domestic economy and
has no plans to travel abroad, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The MOFA will make an overall assessment of the situation at home and abroad
before making plans for an overseas visit by the president, Chen added.</P>
      <P>The spokesman indicated that in the face of a global economic recession that has
hit Taiwan hard, the president will remain at home to oversee government efforts
to revive the battered domestic economy.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in response to a Liberty Times report Wednesday which said
that four of Taiwan's African allies have invited Ma for state visits and Ma may
make the visits this year, although the MOFA has yet to make any arrangements.</P>

      <P>Wang was responding to a report published in the latest issue of Next magazine,

    <HEADLINE>Ties with China play essential role in Taiwan's economy: SEF head</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 4 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said Wednesday that
closer ties with China is essential for Taiwan's economic development, as it is
the source of Taiwan's biggest trade surplus.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on international  trade and economy organized by Taiwan's
China Youth Corps., Chiang told the young elites from local universities that
relations with China affects Taiwan's economy and politics in a significant way.</P>
      <P>"As Taiwanese businesses have invested a cumulative total of more than US$74.4
billion in China, it has already become Taiwan's primary trade partner, export
market, trade surplus source and business investment destination," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Lauding President Ma Ying-jeou's efforts to make restoring talks with China and
pursuing the normalization of cross-strait economic and trade relations top
policy priorities since taking office May 20, Chiang said the new direct links
launched Dec. 15 have not only paid off, but fulfilled long-held expectations.</P>
      <P>"The present administration  has adjusted  the unreasonable restrictions imposed
by the former Democratic Progressive Party administration," Chiang argued.</P>
      <P>According to the SEF chairman, the gradual lifting of those constraints has
allowed Taiwan to push for the normalization of economic and trade ties with
China, which will in time allow Taiwan to boost its economic development and
investment environment.</P>
      <P>"A country's political,  economic and social stability  is essential to
attracting foreign investment, " Chiang said, adding that nobody would want to
risk their investment in an unstable country.</P>
      <P>Asked about the benefits of the direct shipping and air links with China, Chiang
said travelers no longer have to transit in Hong Kong on their way to China,
which has shortened travel times between Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
and Shanghai from five hours to 82 minutes.</P>
      <P>As for the direct shipping links, Chiang said that vessels no longer need to
sail to China via a third territory, which saves an estimated 27 hours per
voyage across the Taiwan Strait and cut shipping costs by 15 percent to 30
percent.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chiang said direct shipping and air links will serve not only to
greatly reduce the cost of transporting people and goods across the Taiwan
Strait, but also to help restore Taiwan's strategic advantage among Asian and
Asia-Pacific economies.</P>
      <P>"Surrounded by the biggest economies in the world, Taiwan is in an economically
vital strategic position in Southeast Asia that better ties with China could
help Taiwan exploit, " Chiang quoted President Ma as saying.</P>
      <P>"We must make good use of this precious advantage," he added.</P>
      <P>Chiang warned, however, that Taiwan cannot afford to lose its competitive edge
in the high-tech and innovation sectors, as Taiwan will face a serious crisis
once China no longer needs to rely on Taiwan to obtain high-tech skills and
products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's SEF and China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) held two rounds of high-level talks June 13 and Nov. 4 last year, at
which they signed six agreements covering weekend charter flights, Chinese
tourist visits to Taiwan, direct air, shipping and postal links, and food
safety.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS serve as semi-official intermediary bodies in the absence of
official contacts between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Chen Ting-fei
questioned Wednesday the purpose and feasibility of a recent proposal by the
government to offer education coupons to unemployed well-educated white collar
workers and urged the Executive Yuan not to "waste taxpayer's money."</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)-proposed
plan is aimed at helping unemployed highly educated white collar workers to
return to school to attend various study programs or to teach at vocational
schools.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference at the Legislative Yuan, Chen described the
education coupons as not only a waste of taxpayers' money but also impractical.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) launched a similar employment
and vocational training plan in 2005 to elevate university students' skills and
abilities to satisfy the needs of the job market, said Chen.</P>
      <P>"Why should our government spend an extra NT$30 billion (US$895 million) on a
plan that will show little or no effect on lowering the unemployment rate?" she
asked.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen went on, the government should not use the money to help the
dozens of poorly operated local universities to increase their student
admittance levels through the education coupons.</P>
      <P>"Instead of giving the highly educated unemployed  workers education coupons,
should our educational system not instead evaluate the reasons why the elite of
the country are losing their jobs? " she asked.</P>
      <P>What the university students and the unemployed need are jobs, not education
coupons, said Chen.</P>
      <P>Ruling  Kuomintang  (KMT)  legislative  caucus  leader Yang Chiung-ying said,
however, that the Executive Yuan has not presented any details of the plan to
the Legislative Yuan, so that any rhetoric about the issue is mere speculation.</P>
      <P>According to government statistics, the jobless rate increased to a high of 5.03
percent last December, with 549,000 people out of work, about 220,000 of whom
were university graduates or higher in terms of education and experience.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan forecast earlier this month that the launch of the education
coupon plan could help drive the unemployment rate down to below 4.5 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said Wednesday that
Taiwan's economic dependence on China is not necessarily bad and that such a
bilateral relationship shows that China still needs Taiwan's highly competitive
high-tech sector.</P>
      <P>During a keynote speech at a seminar on international trade and economy
organized by the Taipei-based China Youth Corps., Chiang told local university
students that there is great interdependence in cross-Taiwan Strait economic
relations, as Taiwanese entrepreneurs need China's abundant supply of cheap
labor while China needs Taiwan's high-tech skills and products.</P>
      <P>"I would not say Taiwan is dependent on China, as both sides depend on each
other, " said Chiang, adding that the economic interdependence between the two
sides is mutually beneficial.</P>
      <P>"In the past, Taiwan's exports relied heavily on the U.S. market, but now that
such exports have been greatly reduced, China has taken over the role as
Taiwan's primary export market, " said Chiang, who added that this role has been
bolstered by the large amount of Taiwanese capital invested in China's economy.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese investors in China import Taiwanese and foreign raw and primary
materials they need to make their products and then export the finished goods to
the European and U.S. markets, " said Chiang.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, the cross-strait economic interdependence is in Taiwan's
favor, as China relies so heavily on Taiwan's high-tech and innovation sectors.</P>
      <P>"A great part of China's economic development success can be attributed to
Taiwanese investors in China, as they have contributed greatly to all sectors of
the Chinese economy over the past 20 years," said Chiang.</P>
      <P>He warned, however, that Taiwan cannot afford to lose its competitive edge in
the high-tech and innovation sectors should China no longer need to rely on
Taiwan for high-tech skills and products.</P>

      <P>The government will set priorities for its policy on liberalizing  the
regulations  governing  China-bound investment, although extensive
liberalization is not an option during the present economic downturn, a Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According  to Fan Liang-tung,  executive secretary  of the Investment Commission
under the ministry,  the first phase of liberalization will target investment
categories with urgent need, as well as those that have little impact on
Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to identify these categories, the MOEA is holding  a
series of seminars  with academics  and industrial representatives to gather
their opinions, Fan said during a meeting with a group of China-based Taiwanese
businessmen.</P>
      <P>Data from the commission shows that among the large number of Chinese investment
categories that remain on a government list of items in which investment is
banned, 101 are related to the manufacturing sector, including IC manufacturing,
mid-level and high-level IC packaging and testing, and the array and cell
processes of thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) panels larger
than four inches.</P>
      <P>In addition, 13 infrastructure projects -- roads, hydraulic facilities, railway
systems, harbors, tap water systems, sewage systems,  airports, subway systems,
garbage incinerators, power plants, power transmission networks, electricity
distribution and industrial parks -- are forbidden areas for investment.</P>
      <P>Four service categories -- postal services, telecom services, financial services
and IC design -- are also off-limits for Taiwanese investors, along with 436
categories in the agriculture sector.</P>

      <P>The 2009 Taipei Lantern Festival will feature a touch of Thai culture, as this
year's event will open with a traditional Thai puppet show.</P>
      <P>The Thai Trade and Economic Office (TTEO) announced Wednesday that the renowned

      <P>"The traditional Thai puppet performance is not only known to every family and
household in Thailand, but is also richly artistic, which makes it a national
treasure, " the TTEO said in a press release.</P>
      <P>The traditional  Thai puppet  show is unlike  most puppet performances, as the
the puppeteers do not remain behind screens during the performance, but rather
are an integral part of the show, according to the TTEO.</P>
      <P>It added that the performance, which will include the epic Indian tale Ramayana
(or Ramakien in Thai), will be laden with all kinds of intriguing plots.</P>
      <P>The Joe Louis puppet theater company, the only troupe of Thai theatrical

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than half of Hong Kong residents responding to a recent opinion poll would
like to see their government give free shopping vouchers to them as Taiwan's
government has done for Taiwanese people, pollsters said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The academic, non-profit Hong Kong Research Association conducted the survey
Jan. 25 - Feb.  1 to gauge Hong Kong residents' expectations on how the Hong
Kong government, faced with an economic downturn, should spend public money this
year.</P>
      <P>Fifty-three percent of the respondents support the idea that Hong Kong emulate
Taiwan to distribute shopping vouchers to all the citizens in the special
administrative region as a means to spur consumption and help revive the
flagging domestic economy, according to the association.</P>
      <P>Another 31 percent of the respondents disagreed with the idea, according to
poll.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the poll found that 32 percent of the respondents hope that the new
budget plan would help enable Hong Kong's economy to continue to flourish; and
21 percent hope that the new year's budget could be spent to help with the
disadvantaged groups.</P>
      <P>Nineteen percent of the respondents hope that the budget will help create jobs;
9 percent hope the budget could be used to support medium- and small-sized
enterprises; and 9 percent hope that the money could be used for educational
purposes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government on Jan. 18 distributed shopping vouchers worth NT$3,600 to
Taiwanese citizens and permanent residents in a NT$85.7 billion program that is

      <P>For the first time in its history, the Taipei International Book Exhibition
(TIBE) -- considered the world's second largest book fair -- is featuring
Thailand as the theme country -- a move which organizers said will help promote
cultural exchanges between Taiwan and the Southeast Asian country.</P>
      <P>National award-winning books, royal classical works, historical books, prize-
winning children's books, and best sellers - all from Thailand - are being
displayed at the Thailand pavilion in the week-long book fair at the Taipei
World Trade Center, said Risuan Aramcharoen, president of the Publishers and
Booksellers Association of Thailand.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan and Thailand have maintained close relations in trade and business
development over the years, Taiwanese people have been relatively underexposed
to Thai literature, according to the TIBE organizer Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Seizing the opportunity to promote its culture as well as its literature,
Thailand opened its pavilion at the book fair Wednesday with a traditional Thai
puppet show.</P>
      <P>Taipei Book Fair Foundation Chairman Linden Lin said that it is meaningful for
Thailand to be selected as the theme country after Taiwan was invited to take
part in the Bangkok International Book Fair as the theme country three years
ago.</P>
      <P>Exchanges of publications between the two countries will help bilateral
relations become closer, Lin said, noting that books telling the history and
culture of Thailand help Taiwanese people better understand their neighboring
country. So far, most Taiwanese people view Thailand mainly as a vacation
destination.</P>
      <P>In addition to the book display, a variety of activities will also be staged at
the Thai pavilion, including cooking and folk handicraft demonstrations,
lectures, and quick Thai language lessons, Risuan said.</P>
      <P>The 2009 TIBE has attracted 578 foreign publishers, 200 more than the previous
year.</P>
      <P>Lin said he expects the number of visitors to grow by 20 percent this year. The
2008 TIBE drew 410,000 visitors.</P>
      <P>The TIBE opens from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Feb. 4-9, with extended opening hours to
10 p.m. from Feb. 6-8, according to the organizer.</P>

      <P>Taipei City is slated to start issuing food coupons to families in urgent need
of economic assistance from March 1, the municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs
announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The bureau is planning to deliver coupons worth NT$5,000 each to about 10,000
households in the initial stage of a program that will last until Dec. 31,
bureau officials said, adding that more families with economic difficulties
could be included in the follow-up stages.</P>
      <P>Families residing in Taipei City, not necessarily those with their households
registered here, would be entitled to receive the food vouchers as long as they
are reported by their local borough chief to the city's civil affairs bureau and
recognized as being "in need of assistance" after family interviews by city
officials and respected social figures.</P>
      <P>Each household is allowed to receive the coupons once.</P>
      <P>The coupons can only be spent on food, such as lunch boxes, bread or rice balls,
at the Family Mart chain convenience stores, which means cigarettes, alcoholic
products or magazines are excluded.</P>
      <P>The ongoing economic downturn has caused many people in Taiwan to lose their
jobs, with parents who have children going to school being the worst affected.</P>

vacation to assist the county's impoverished elementary school and junior high
school students, officials said Wednesday.</P>

      <P>A senior economic policy planner forecast Wednesday that Taiwan's sliding
economy is likely to bottom out in the second quarter of this year, before
beginning a slow recovery.</P>
      <P>Hu Chung-ying, deputy chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) , made the comment after the Hong Kong-based brokerage house
CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets predicted that Taiwan will see a decline of 11 percent
in its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2009.</P>
      <P>Hu described the prediction "a little too much, " saying there is still a chance
that Taiwan would record positive GDP growth this year.</P>
      <P>The official said that he would not be as pessimistic as CLSA in predicting
Taiwan's economic outlook for 2009,  given the the government's launch of a
series of stimulus measures, including the shopping voucher program.</P>
      <P>While he forecast a drop in GDP growth in the first quarter of the year, Hu said
he expects a slow recovery to begin in the third quarter, or in a worst-case
senario, in the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>Hu said that the CLSA forecast was the most pessimistic among all those made by
international institutions.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, the Global Insight forecast in late 2008 predicted that
Taiwan's economy will contract by 1.8 percent in 2009, while the International
Monetary Fund predicted a growth of 2.2 percent. The Citigroup Global Markets
forecast a growth of 1.5 percent, Goldman Sachs forecast a negative growth of 3
percent, and the Economist predicted a negative growth of 2.9 percent, he added.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the latest prediction, which came from the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research on Jan. 23, forecast the economy would grow by 0.89 percent in
2009.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) has
predicted the 2009 economy would grow by 2.12 percent while the CEPD set a 2.5
percent growth rate as the national goal.</P>

      <P>The number of young and middle-aged people applying for unemployment benefits
has increased since the global financial crisis became apparent last September,
the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The CLA said that about half of those who have filed for unemployment benefits
for the first time since September are persons who have college education or
higher, and nearly 70 percent of them are under 40 years old.</P>
      <P>This is largely reflective of the fact that most of the recent layoffs have been
among high- and mid-level white collar workers, according to the CLA.</P>
      <P>The CLA said that some 64,764 people filed for unemployment benefits for the
first time between September and December last year, with the figures showing
almost equal numbers of men and women.</P>
      <P>The largest number of applicants, some 15,135, were in the age group 25-29,
while 44,049 were under 40, accounting for 68 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said that since the government's Employment Insurance Law took
effect in 2003, the applicants for unemployment benefits had been mostly people
with lower education levels and middle-aged or older workers.</P>
      <P>The officials attributed the large number of young and middle-aged workers now
applying for unemployment benefits to the latest round of layoffs mostly in the
high-tech sector.</P>
      <P>Also, young people are generally not the breadwinners in their families and
would not balk at the idea of filing for unemployment benefits, the officials

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) issued a statement Wednesday reiterating
the Republic of China's historical claim to islands and reefs in the South China
Sea, including the Spratlys.</P>
      <P>The MOFA statement came after the two chambers of the Philippine legislature --
the Senate and House of Representatives -- passed bills Jan. 28 and Feb.2,
respectively, to annex some isles and reefs of the Spratly Islands (better known
as Nansha in Chinese) and Macclesfield Bank Islands (known locally as Jhongsha)
as part of the Philippines' territory.</P>
      <P>The MOFA stated that Taiwan's sovereignty claim is beyond doubt and challenge,
stressing that all four groups of islands in the South China Sea -- Nansha,
Jhongsha, Dongsha (Pratas) Islands and Sisha (Paracel) Islands -- and their
surrounding waters are Taiwan's territories  from  a  historical,  geographical,
factual  and international law perspective.</P>
      <P>The ministry further said the ROC government will not recognize any move by any
other country that occupies or claims sovereignty over any of the four island
groups.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the MOFA called on the Philippines to negotiate with Taiwan on the

      <P>A land renewal program to rejuvenate three of Taiwan's export processing zones
was 33.28 percent complete as of the end of December last year, the Export
Processing Zone (EPZ) Administration under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
indicated Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Officials with the EPZ Administration pointed out that the export processing
zones in Kaohsiung, Nanzih, and Taichung are nearly 40 years old, and that most
of the buildings in the three zones cannot meet the needs of high technology
industries.</P>
      <P>The administration started the land renewal program in 2006, and as of the end
of December last year, 98 buildings in the three zones had been renovated and
four others were torn down for reconstruction, representing a 33.28 percent
renewal rate.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the EPZ Administration hopes that the renewal
program will be over 40 percent complete by the end of 2010, with more than 60
percent of the land plots planted with trees and lawns, so that the three zones
will become more attractive to high-tech industries, including the integrated
circuit industry and the liquid crystal display industry.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has nine export processing zones covering 577.2 hectares. Seven of them
are located in southern Taiwan, and all of them are designated tax-bonded zones.</P>
      <P>The oldest one, the Kaohsiung EPZ, was partially opened for use in 1966,
followed by the Nanzih EPZ in suburban Kaohsiung and the Taichung EPZ in Tanzih
township in Taichung County in 1971.</P>
      <P>The Siaogang Air Freight Logistics EPZ in Kaohsiung became operational in 2004
and the Chungkang EPZ was inaugurated in early 2006, while the Pingtung EPZ was
completed at the end of 2007.</P>
      <P>The three smaller ones are Chenggong Logistics EPZ, the Kaohsiung Software Park,

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than half of Hong Kong residents responding to a recent opinion poll would
like to see their government give free shopping vouchers to them as Taiwan's
government has done for Taiwanese people, pollsters said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The academic, non-profit Hong Kong Research Association conducted the survey
Jan. 25 - Feb.  1 to gauge Hong Kong residents' expectations on how the Hong
Kong government, faced with an economic downturn, should spend public money this
year.</P>
      <P>Fifty-three percent of the respondents support the idea that Hong Kong emulate
Taiwan to distribute shopping vouchers to all the citizens in the special
administrative region as a means to spur consumption and help revive the
flagging domestic economy, according to the association.</P>
      <P>Another 31 percent of the respondents disagreed with the idea, according to
poll.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the poll found that 32 percent of the respondents hope that the new
budget plan would help enable Hong Kong's economy to continue to flourish; and
21 percent hope that the new year's budget could be spent to help with the
disadvantaged groups.</P>
      <P>Nineteen percent of the respondents hope that the budget will help create jobs;
9 percent hope the budget could be used to support medium- and small-sized
enterprises; and 9 percent hope that the money could be used for educational
purposes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government on Jan. 18 distributed shopping vouchers worth NT$3,600 to
Taiwanese citizens and permanent residents in a NT$85.7 billion program that is
part of an economic stimulus package to boost domestic consumption.</P>

      <P>For the first time in its history, the Taipei International Book Exhibition
(TIBE) -- considered the world's second largest book fair -- is featuring
Thailand as the theme country -- a move which organizers said will help promote
cultural exchanges between Taiwan and the Southeast Asian country.</P>
      <P>National award-winning books, royal classical works, historical books, prize-
winning children's books, and best sellers - all from Thailand - are being
displayed at the Thailand pavilion in the week-long book fair at the Taipei
World Trade Center, said Risuan Aramcharoen, president of the Publishers and
Booksellers Association of Thailand.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan and Thailand have maintained close relations in trade and business
development over the years, Taiwanese people have been relatively underexposed
to Thai literature, according to the TIBE organizer Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Seizing the opportunity to promote its culture as well as its literature,
Thailand opened its pavilion at the book fair Wednesday with a traditional Thai
puppet show.</P>
      <P>Taipei Book Fair Foundation Chairman Linden Lin said that it is meaningful for
Thailand to be selected as the theme country after Taiwan was invited to take
part in the Bangkok International Book Fair as the theme country three years
ago.</P>
      <P>Exchanges of publications between the two countries will help bilateral
relations become closer, Lin said, noting that books telling the history and
culture of Thailand help Taiwanese people better understand their neighboring
country. So far, most Taiwanese people view Thailand mainly as a vacation
destination.</P>
      <P>In addition to the book display, a variety of activities will also be staged at
the Thai pavilion, including cooking and folk handicraft demonstrations,
lectures, and quick Thai language lessons, Risuan said.</P>
      <P>The 2009 TIBE has attracted 578 foreign publishers, 200 more than the previous
year.</P>
      <P>Lin said he expects the number of visitors to grow by 20 percent this year. The
2008 TIBE drew 410,000 visitors.</P>
      <P>The TIBE opens from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Feb. 4-9, with extended opening hours to
10 p.m. from Feb. 6-8, according to the organizer.</P>

      <P>The number of Chinese tourists who visited Taiwan during the Lunar New Year
holiday from Jan. 24 to Feb. 1 totaled 12,702, a government agency said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the National Immigration Agency (NIA) under the Ministry of the
Interior, the peak days were Jan. 26, 27 and 28, with the number of tourists
from China recorded at 2,695, 2,477 and 2,080, respectively.</P>

      <P>Taipei City is slated to start issuing food coupons to families in urgent need
of economic assistance from March 1, the municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs
announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The bureau is planning to deliver coupons worth NT$5,000 each to about 10,000
households in the initial stage of a program that will last until Dec. 31,
bureau officials said, adding that more families with economic difficulties
could be included in the follow-up stages.</P>
      <P>Families residing in Taipei City, not necessarily those with their households
registered here, would be entitled to receive the food vouchers as long as they
are reported by their local borough chief to the city's civil affairs bureau and
recognized as being "in need of assistance" after family interviews by city
officials and respected social figures.</P>
      <P>Each household is allowed to receive the coupons once.</P>
      <P>The coupons can only be spent on food, such as lunch boxes, bread or rice balls,
at the Family Mart chain convenience stores, which means cigarettes, alcoholic
products or magazines are excluded.</P>
      <P>The ongoing economic downturn has caused many people in Taiwan to lose their
jobs, with parents who have children going to school being the worst affected.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Pingtung County in southern Taiwan will implement a new after-school
program in the new semester and issue food vouchers in the coming summer
vacation to assist the county's impoverished elementary school and junior high
school students, officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In addition to an after school academic assistance program already in place, the
new after-school program will offer free child care for children from
underprivileged families, said Kuo Wen-jui, deputy chief of the county's
education department.</P>
      <P>The new program will also create job opportunities for the unemployed, Kuo

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior economic policy planner forecast Wednesday that Taiwan's sliding
economy is likely to bottom out in the second quarter of this year, before
beginning a slow recovery.</P>
      <P>Hu Chung-ying, deputy chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) , made the comment after the Hong Kong-based brokerage house
CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets predicted that Taiwan will see a decline of 11 percent
in its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2009.</P>
      <P>Hu described the prediction "a little too much, " saying there is still a chance
that Taiwan would record positive GDP growth this year.</P>
      <P>The official said that he would not be as pessimistic as CLSA in predicting
Taiwan's economic outlook for 2009,  given the the government's launch of a
series of stimulus measures, including the shopping voucher program.</P>
      <P>While he forecast a drop in GDP growth in the first quarter of the year, Hu said
he expects a slow recovery to begin in the third quarter, or in a worst-case
senario, in the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>Hu said that the CLSA forecast was the most pessimistic among all those made by
international institutions.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, the Global Insight forecast in late 2008 predicted that
Taiwan's economy will contract by 1.8 percent in 2009, while the International
Monetary Fund predicted a growth of 2.2 percent. The Citigroup Global Markets
forecast a growth of 1.5 percent, Goldman Sachs forecast a negative growth of 3
percent, and the Economist predicted a negative growth of 2.9 percent, he added.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the latest prediction, which came from the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research on Jan. 23, forecast the economy would grow by 0.89 percent in
2009.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) has
predicted the 2009 economy would grow by 2.12 percent while the CEPD set a 2.5
percent growth rate as the national goal.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS is scheduled to review its forecast on Feb. 19.</P>

    <HEADLINE>More young, middle-aged workers applying for unemployment benefits</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of young and middle-aged people applying for unemployment benefits
has increased since the global financial crisis became apparent last September,
the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The CLA said that about half of those who have filed for unemployment benefits
for the first time since September are persons who have college education or
higher, and nearly 70 percent of them are under 40 years old.</P>
      <P>This is largely reflective of the fact that most of the recent layoffs have been
among high- and mid-level white collar workers, according to the CLA.</P>
      <P>The CLA said that some 64,764 people filed for unemployment benefits for the
first time between September and December last year, with the figures showing
almost equal numbers of men and women.</P>
      <P>The largest number of applicants, some 15,135, were in the age group 25-29,
while 44,049 were under 40, accounting for 68 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said that since the government's Employment Insurance Law took
effect in 2003, the applicants for unemployment benefits had been mostly people
with lower education levels and middle-aged or older workers.</P>
      <P>The officials attributed the large number of young and middle-aged workers now
applying for unemployment benefits to the latest round of layoffs mostly in the
high-tech sector.</P>
      <P>Also, young people are generally not the breadwinners in their families and
would not balk at the idea of filing for unemployment benefits, the officials
said.</P>

      <P>The government will be offering bigger incentives to encourage farmers restart
cultivation of fallow lands, the Agriculture and Food Agency under the Cabinet-
level Council of Agriculture (COA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The plan is aimed at securing the country's food supply and stabilizing food
prices on the domestic market in view of the high prices on the world market,
said the agency.</P>
      <P>Officials of the agency said that, with immediate effect, it will guarantee
landowners an income of NT$45,000 (US$1,339) or more per hectare for each
harvest.</P>
      <P>If the owners lease their farmlands for food crop cultivation for three years in
a row, the agency will guarantee an income of over NT$50,000 per hectare for
each harvest, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The agency will also offer a subsidy of NT$20,000 per hectare to farmers who
grow feed corn, while farmers devoted to organic farming will be entitled to
NT$15,000 per hectare.</P>
      <P>Landowners who cannot resume cultivation of their farms or find tenants to lease
them, and instead plant green organic fertilizer, will be granted NT$45,000 per
hectare by the agency, according to the officials.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) issued a statement Wednesday reiterating
the Republic of China's historical claim to islands and reefs in the South China
Sea, including the Spratlys.</P>
      <P>The MOFA statement came after the two chambers of the Philippine legislature --
the Senate and House of Representatives -- passed bills Jan. 28 and Feb.2,
respectively, to annex some isles and reefs of the Spratly Islands (better known
as Nansha in Chinese) and Macclesfield Bank Islands (known locally as Jhongsha)
as part of the Philippines' territory.</P>
      <P>The MOFA stated that Taiwan's sovereignty claim is beyond doubt and challenge,
stressing that all four groups of islands in the South China Sea -- Nansha,
Jhongsha, Dongsha (Pratas) Islands and Sisha (Paracel) Islands -- and their
surrounding waters are Taiwan's territories  from  a  historical,  geographical,
factual  and international law perspective.</P>
      <P>The ministry further said the ROC government will not recognize any move by any
other country that occupies or claims sovereignty over any of the four island
groups.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the MOFA called on the Philippines to negotiate with Taiwan on the
South China Sea sovereignty dispute under the principles and in the spirit of

    <TEXT>
      <P>Pope Benedict XVI said Wednesday he has been paying close attention to the
development of relations across the Taiwan Strait and is pleased with Taiwan's
efforts to promote cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>Benedict made the remarks while meeting with Taiwan's Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng in the Vatican's Paul VI Audience Hall.</P>
      <P>Wang, who arrived in Rome Tuesday on the first leg of a European tour that will
also take him to France and Belgium, is the first ROC legislative head ever to
meet with Pope Benedict.</P>
      <P>ROC Ambassador to the Vatican Larry Wang told the CNA in a telephone interview
that Wang Jin-pyng's meeting with the pope is of great significance to the
country's relations with the Holy See.</P>
      <P>According to the ambassador, Wang Jin-pyng conveyed President Ma Ying-jeou's
regards for Benedict and expressed Taiwan people's gratitude for the pontiff's
long-term blessing for Taiwan and concern for cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Wang Jin-pyng also briefed Benedict on the Ma administration's pragmatic policy
toward cross-strait relations and its strenuous efforts to maintain peace and
stability in the Taiwan Strait and entire Asia.</P>
      <P>Wang further reminded the pope that if he visits Asia in the future, the
itinerary should include a stop in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For his part, Benedict praised the ROC government's efforts to improve relations
with China and to foster cross-strait amity and trust.</P>
      <P>At the end of the meeting, Wang presented a glassware symbolizing peace and joy
to the pontiff.</P>
      <P>Wang was accompanied by Larry Wang and 10 other legislators during the audience
with Benedict.</P>
      <P>Larry Wang said Benedict has consistently kept close tabs on cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>According to the ambassador, the pope took the initiative to publicly commend a
thaw in the once icy cross-strait ties when he met with 177 foreign diplomats
stationed in the Vatican Jan 8.</P>
      <P>The Vatican is the only European country that maintains formal diplomatic ties
with Taiwan. Former President Chen Shui-bian attended the funeral of Pope John
Paul II four years ago, making him the first ROC president to visit the Vatican
since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in 1942.</P>
      <P>On the first day of their current European tour, Wang Jin-pyng and other
lawmakers visited the Italian Senate where they were greeted by thunderous
applause from Italian senators.</P>
      <P>Italian Senate Speaker Renato Schifani held talks with Wang and briefed him on
Italian legislative operations.</P>
      <P>A pro-Taiwan group in the Italian parliament, headed by Valter Zanetta, hosted a
dinner in honor of the ROC legislative delegation.</P>
      <P>Following the Vatican visit, the delegation will travel to Sicily to take part
in religious festive celebrations.</P>
      <P>Later on, Wang will address the European Parliament, which is holding its
plenary session in Strasbourg, France.</P>
      <P>Wang is also expected to call on European Parliament President Hans-Gert
Pottering.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA reaffirms sovereignty over Spratlys in South China Sea</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) issued a statement Wednesday reiterating
the Republic of China's historical claim to islands and reefs in the South China
Sea, including the Spratlys.</P>
      <P>The MOFA statement came after the two chambers of the Philippine legislature --
the Senate and House of Representatives -- passed bills Jan. 28 and Feb.2,
respectively, to annex some isles and reefs of the Spratly Islands (better known
as Nansha in Chinese) and Macclesfield Bank Islands (known locally as Jhongsha)
as part of the Philippines' territory.</P>
      <P>The MOFA stated that Taiwan's sovereignty claim is beyond doubt and challenge,
stressing that all four groups of islands in the South China Sea -- Nansha,
Jhongsha, Dongsha (Pratas) Islands and Sisha (Paracel) Islands -- and their
surrounding waters are Taiwan's territories  from  a  historical,  geographical,
factual  and international law perspective.</P>
      <P>The ministry further said the ROC government will not recognize any move by any
other country that occupies or claims sovereignty over any of the four island
groups.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the MOFA called on the Philippines to negotiate with Taiwan on the
South China Sea sovereignty dispute under the principles and in the spirit of
the United Nations Charter, the U.N. convention on the Law of Sea and the
Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea to resolve the
conflicting claims peacefully.</P>
      <P>The Spratlys consist of about 180 barren islets, reefs and atolls dotting the
world's busiest shipping lanes in the South China Sea. Vietnam, China, Taiwan,
the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei each claim all or part of the low-lying
islands, believed to be rich in oil, gas and fishery resources.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's effective jurisdiction includes the Dongsha Islands and Taiping Island
in the Spratlys.</P>

    <HEADLINE>More young, middle-aged workers applying for unemployment benefits</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of young and middle-aged people applying for unemployment benefits
has increased since the global financial crisis became apparent last September,
the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The CLA said that about half of those who have filed for unemployment benefits
for the first time since September are persons who have college education or
higher, and nearly 70 percent of them are under 40 years old.</P>
      <P>This is largely reflective of the fact that most of the recent layoffs have been
among high- and mid-level white collar workers, according to the CLA.</P>
      <P>The CLA said that some 64,764 people filed for unemployment benefits for the
first time between September and December last year, with the figures showing
almost equal numbers of men and women.</P>
      <P>The largest number of applicants, some 15,135, were in the age group 25-29,
while 44,049 were under 40, accounting for 68 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said that since the government's Employment Insurance Law took
effect in 2003, the applicants for unemployment benefits had been mostly people
with lower education levels and middle-aged or older workers.</P>
      <P>The officials attributed the large number of young and middle-aged workers now
applying for unemployment benefits to the latest round of layoffs mostly in the
high-tech sector.</P>
      <P>Also, young people are generally not the breadwinners in their families and
would not balk at the idea of filing for unemployment benefits, the officials
said.</P>

      <P>The government will be offering bigger incentives to encourage farmers restart
cultivation of fallow lands, the Agriculture and Food Agency under the Cabinet-
level Council of Agriculture (COA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The plan is aimed at securing the country's food supply and stabilizing food
prices on the domestic market in view of the high prices on the world market,
said the agency.</P>
      <P>Officials of the agency said that, with immediate effect, it will guarantee
landowners an income of NT$45,000 (US$1,339) or more per hectare for each
harvest.</P>
      <P>If the owners lease their farmlands for food crop cultivation for three years in
a row, the agency will guarantee an income of over NT$50,000 per hectare for
each harvest, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The agency will also offer a subsidy of NT$20,000 per hectare to farmers who
grow feed corn, while farmers devoted to organic farming will be entitled to
NT$15,000 per hectare.</P>
      <P>Landowners who cannot resume cultivation of their farms or find tenants to lease
them, and instead plant green organic fertilizer, will be granted NT$45,000 per
hectare by the agency, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>The agency is preparing to hold a series of information sessions in different
regions of the country soon to explain the plan to farmers, the officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Three export processing zones in Taiwan being refurbished</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A land renewal program to rejuvenate three of Taiwan's export processing zones
was 33.28 percent complete as of the end of December last year, the Export
Processing Zone (EPZ) Administration under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
indicated Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Officials with the EPZ Administration pointed out that the export processing
zones in Kaohsiung, Nanzih, and Taichung are nearly 40 years old, and that most
of the buildings in the three zones cannot meet the needs of high technology
industries.</P>
      <P>The administration started the land renewal program in 2006, and as of the end
of December last year, 98 buildings in the three zones had been renovated and
four others were torn down for reconstruction, representing a 33.28 percent
renewal rate.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the EPZ Administration hopes that the renewal
program will be over 40 percent complete by the end of 2010, with more than 60
percent of the land plots planted with trees and lawns, so that the three zones
will become more attractive to high-tech industries, including the integrated
circuit industry and the liquid crystal display industry.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has nine export processing zones covering 577.2 hectares. Seven of them
are located in southern Taiwan, and all of them are designated tax-bonded zones.</P>
      <P>The oldest one, the Kaohsiung EPZ, was partially opened for use in 1966,
followed by the Nanzih EPZ in suburban Kaohsiung and the Taichung EPZ in Tanzih
township in Taichung County in 1971.</P>
      <P>The Siaogang Air Freight Logistics EPZ in Kaohsiung became operational in 2004
and the Chungkang EPZ was inaugurated in early 2006, while the Pingtung EPZ was
completed at the end of 2007.</P>
      <P>The three smaller ones are Chenggong Logistics EPZ, the Kaohsiung Software Park,
and the Linguang EPZ.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lawyer hails AIT response to ex-lawmaker's citizenship issue</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5 (CNA)
02/05/09  14:06:24
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The lawyer of former ruling Kuomintang Legislator  Lee Ching-an said Wednesday
that the latest U.S. explanation of its laws concerning loss of citizenship
backs Lee's claim that she legally lost her U.S. citizenship when she took
public office in Taiwan more than a decade ago.</P>
      <P>Lee Yung-jan was referring to a Jan.16 letter from the head office of the
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) that stated loss of U.S. citizenship occurs
when a citizen "voluntarily commits a statutorily defined potentially
expatriating act with the intention of relinquishing U.S. citizenship."</P>
      <P>The AIT is a quasi-official U.S. institution authorized to handle relations with
Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>According to Lee Yung-jan, Lee Ching-an's taking of an oath of allegiance to the
Republic of China when she assumed office as a Taipei city councilor in 1994 and
her use of her ROC passport to enter and exit the United States since then were
concrete acts that proved her intent to give up her U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>"We believe that the latest AIT letter marks a favorable development in the
case," Lee Yung-jan said.</P>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) is scheduled to meet Friday to discuss
Lee's alleged "dual citizenship" and whether her election to public office prior
to 2008 should be nullified.</P>
      <P>It remains to be seen whether the latest AIT explanation will inform the CEC
commissioners' findings on Lee Ching-an's citizenship status before 2008.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-an, who was sworn in for a fourth legislative term Feb. 1, 2008, was
found the following month to have never formally renounced her U.S. citizenship,
even though she had held public office in Taiwan since 1994.</P>
      <P>She resigned Jan. 8 just as opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
politicians were promoting a campaign to recall her and pro-DPP civic groups
were preparing to besiege the legislature to protest the lawmaking body's
failure to act against her.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Nationality Act requires public officials holding dual citizenship to
surrender their foreign citizenship before assuming public office and to obtain
a certificate as proof within one year of taking office.</P>
      <P>The law also requires that those officials who retain foreign citizenship be
removed from their posts.</P>
      <P>Calls for Lee to be formally relieved of her seat mounted after U.S.
authorities, in response to an inquiry from Taiwan, confirmed in late 2008 that
she "has previously been documented as a U.S. citizen with a U.S. passport and
that no subsequent loss of U.S. citizenship has been documented."</P>
      <P>But in a letter dated Nov. 22, 2008 to Taiwan's representative office in
Washington, D.C., AIT Managing Director Barbara Schrage also wrote that U.S.
citizens serving in a foreign government "may have committed an expatriating act
if they do so with the intent to relinquish their U.S. nationality."</P>
      <P>Schrage further wrote that while the U.S. Department of State has not made any
determination regarding loss of citizenship for any individual Taiwanese
lawmaker, "it could do so based on evidence that he or she committed a
potentially expatriating act with the intention of relinquishing U.S.
nationality."</P>
      <P>CEC Secretary-General Teng Tien-yow said earlier this week that the commission
has received a response from the AIT to an inquiry regarding U.S. laws and
regulations on the acquisition and loss of U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>According to Teng, the CEC had asked the U.S. to clarify whether Taiwanese
lawmakers or city councilors would automatically lose their status as U.S.
citizens once they take the oath of office in Taiwan, and whether or not they
need to apply to relinquish their citizenship or have U.S. authorities
invalidate their citizenship.</P>
      <P>Schrage replied in a terse letter Jan. 16 that as stated in her previous letter,
"loss of U.S. citizenship occurs when a citizen voluntarily commits a
statutorily defined potentially expatriating act with the intention of
relinquishing U.S. citizenship," political sources said.</P>
      <P>A group of DPP legislators have filed a complaint with the Taipei District
Prosecutors Office accusing Lee of forgery and fraud.</P>
      <P>The legislators alleged that by holding dual citizenship while in public office,
Lee defrauded the public coffers of over NT$100 million in salary as a Taipei
City councilor between 1994 and 1998 and as a legislator from 1999 to 2009, and
they demanded that she return the "illicit gains."</P>
      <P>Lee has been barred from leaving Taiwan pending prosecutorial investigations
into fraud and forgery allegations against her.</P>

      <P>Brushing off media speculation that the government  has aborted its recently
proposed education coupon program, the country's top economic planning agency
said Thursday that the plan is still alive and its details are being worked out
by the relevant government agencies.</P>
      <P>Liao Yao-tsung, chief secretary of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) , said the Ministry of Education (MOE) is
working on the regulations that will determine eligibility for the benefits
under the two-year plan, which will cost an estimated NT$20 billion (US$525
million) and is being designed exclusively for highly educated white collar
workers who have lost their jobs during the recent economic downturn.</P>
      <P>"We urge the public to be patient and not to make speculations before the
details of the plan are finalized, " said Liao.</P>
      <P>According to Liao, specifics of the program, such as the amount of money to each
recipient and the name of the program, are still being discussed.</P>
      <P>Once the details are finalized, the government will offer subsidies for the re-
training of eligible white-collar workers, but will set a ceiling on the amount
each individual could receive, he added.</P>
      <P>"The plan is part of a special economic stimulus package under which the
government will inject NT$500 billion over the next four years into public
infrastructure projects," said Liao.</P>
      <P>In addition, Liao said that the education plan is not only aimed at helping to
re-train the country's approximately 100,000 unemployed educated white collar
workers, but is also designed to improve the level of education in the country
and nurture a new generation of highly trained professionals.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD, the jobless rate rose to a five-year high of 5.03 percent
last December, which translated into 549,000 jobless people, 220,000 of whom

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Thursday that Taiwan needs to minimize the
threat posed by China in order to uphold the country's best interests.</P>
      <P>In line with this goal, Ma said, the government has adopted a China policy that
is aimed at maintaining cross-Taiwan Strait stability and promoting regional
peace to safeguard the security of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Alongside the recent improvements in relations with China, Ma said, his
administration will seek further progress by encouraging the two sides to
continue to put aside their political differences and work more closely together
to create a "win-win" situation.</P>
      <P>While doing so, Taiwan's military must not relax its vigilance, but rather
should maintain its readiness, Ma said, noting that strong defense preparedness
was what has protected Taiwan from possible attacks by China over the past
decades.</P>
      <P>According to the president, the purpose of defense is to achieve peace, rather
than to wage war.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's efforts to avoid war with China does not mean it is afraid of
war, the president stressed.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's admission to the World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the top decision-making
arm of the World Health Organization -- as an observer would be "a necessary
first step" to safeguarding the health rights of the Taiwanese people, a
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Gaining observer status could also serve as an initial step to Taiwan's
participation in the mechanisms and activities of the WHO, such as meetings of
experts, Paul W. L. Chang, director general of MOFAs Department of International
Organization, said at a press briefing.</P>
      <P>However,  as Taiwan  and China  have not yet held formal negotiations on the
issue, Chang said, the MOFA is under pressure to find a mutually acceptable
resolution before the WHA convenes in May.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan's participation in international organizations in the past has been
achieved by means of "special arrangements, " Chang said the stance of Beijing
officials will again play apivotal role when the WHA issue is raised.</P>
      <P>The ministry is currently studying all possible proposals that would not only
help to achieve the country's goal of joining the WHA this year as an observer,
but would also ensure Taiwan's full rights if it admitted into the assembly, he
added.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA spokesman Henry Chen, the government will first seek to
negotiate with China via non-official channels because the WHA issue is a
political one.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD still working on feasibility study on cross-strait bridge</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) has been
authorized to study the feasibility of building a bridge between Taiwan's
outlying Kinmen island and China's port city of Xiamen, Executive Yuan spokesman
Su Jun-pin said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Su said the CEPD has no timetable to complete the study on the feasibility of
building a bridge connecting Kinmen and the Dadeng Island outside Xiamen City,
and that the results will be publicized when the study is finished.</P>
      <P>Su discounted a United Daily News report on the matter, saying it was false. The
UDN reported that President Ma Ying-jeou directed the Executive Yuan Wednesday
to come up with a plan soon for building the bridge, being called the "Jin-Deng
Bridge."</P>
      <P>Su explained that Ma was just inquiring about progress in the CEPD's feasibility
assessment, but was not pushing for a speedy completion of the study.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng said Ma's directive on the
matter is welcome and inspirational to Kinmen's residents.</P>
      <P>"It demonstrates that Ma is a trusted leader whose campaign promises were not
lip-service and that he attaches equal importance to the development of Taiwan
proper and the offshore areas, " Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee expressed the hope that the CEPD study will be completed sooner rather than
later.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the Kinmen county government in 2004 began to study the
possibility of building of a bridge between Kinmen and Xiamen. The county
government has drafted three plans for the proposed project, he said.</P>
      <P>Plan A is a 10.3-km bridge that would span Wulungshan on the Kinmen's side,
China's Xiaodeng Island and Jiaoyu Isle, and Xiamen's Dadeng Island.</P>
      <P>Plan B is a straight-line 8.6 km-bridge connecting Wulungshan and Dadeng Island,
the shortest structure of the three on the drawing board.</P>
      <P>Plan C is a 11.4-km bridge between Wulungshan and Fujian Province's Lienhe City.</P>
      <P>The costs of the three plans range from NT$12.7  billion (US$377.98 million) to
NT$16.6 billion, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee said the Kinmen county government would suggest that the Cabinet use Plan B
if indeed a cross-strait bridge is to be built, given that the second plan is
the least costly and the bridge is the shortest.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) blasted the cross-
strait bridge proposal by the Ma administration.</P>
      <P>Panning the decision as "premature, " DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said what
the administration should be doing now in the face of global economic recession
is working to revive the flagging domestic economy, rather than bringing Taiwan
into China's fold step-by-step.</P>

      <P>The government's target to attain a 2.5 percent economic growth for 2009 has
remained unchanged despite prevailing pessimism about the economic outlook, the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Liao Yao-tzung, chief secretary of the council, explained that economic targets
are always higher than predictions because they represent objectives that the
government is working toward.</P>
      <P>Liao made the comment in the wake of a media report that the Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), in light of the worsening economic
situation in the country, is likely to revise its economic growth projection
downward when it releases its latest forecast on Feb. 19.</P>
      <P>While the DGBAS has previously predicted that Taiwan's gross domestic product
(GDP) will increase by 2.12 percent in 2009, the report cited a DGBAS official
as saying that growth of over 2 percent has now appeared unlikely and that
actual growth may stand at just over 1 percent.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based brokerage firm CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets recently predicted
that Taiwan's GDP will decline by 11 percent in 2009.</P>
      <P>Liao, however, said forecasts by brokerage firms tend to be "extreme."</P>
      <P>He said the forecast by CLSA was based solely on Taiwan's performance in exports
and private investment, which could be misleading because it did not take into
account efforts made by the government and possible increase in domestic demand.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's electronics manufacturers operating in China are expected to benefit
from the expansion of a subsidy program launched by the Chinese government to
help farmers buy home appliances, the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>In an effort to jumpstart the consumer economy and lift the living standard of
the rural population, China's Ministry of Commerce introduced a scheme Dec. 1,
2008 under which the government is subsidizing 13 percent of the cost of color
TV sets, mobile phones, refrigerators and washing machines purchased by farmers
in 14 provinces.</P>
      <P>The scheme was further expanded this month to include the whole country and four
other products -- computers,  water heaters, motorbikes and air-conditioners.</P>
      <P>According to China's Ministry of Commerce estimates, the subsidy scheme will
generate sales of 150 billion yuan (US$21.99 billion) per year on average, and
the expansion will spur an additional 60 billion yuan in annual sales.</P>
      <P>According to the IDB under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Sampo Corp., one of
Taiwan's main appliance makers, has been cashing in on the policy, as it has won
a big order for the supply of refrigerators.</P>
      <P>The IDB said Taiwan's information technology industry, which is a worldwide
leader, is likely to win the bid to supply computers to China's rural regions.</P>
      <P>In addition,  Taiwan's  contract manufacturers,  with their excellent cost
control ability,  can collaborate  with China's electronics product distributors
to bid for computer manufacturing services in rural China.</P>
      <P>Upstream suppliers of electronics components are also likely to make inroads
into the Chinese market as a result of the policy. Several China TV makers have
already placed orders for LCD panels produced by Taiwan's Chi Mei
Optoelectronics. To date, Chi Mei has obtained 100 percent of the orders for
26-inch LCD TV panels and 60 percent of those for 22-inch panels, under the
program, according to the IDB.</P>
      <P>AU Optronics and Chi Mei have signed supply deals with nine major color TV
manufacturers in China, under which the two major flat-panel makers will supply
more than 12 million units to Chinese companies. This will translate into
NT$72.2 billion in sales revenue, the IDB added.</P>

      <P>The first round of competition in the 2009 Miss Taiwan Beauty Contest will be
launched in April, organizers said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference in Taipei, Lina Pan, president of the  Republic
of China  Beauty  Consultation  and Development Association, said the first
round of competition is scheduled to be held at the beginning of April, while
finals will take place in July at the Grand Hotel in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"We will select suitable candidates during the preliminary stage of the contest
from the northern, central and southern areas of the country," said Pan.</P>
      <P>Aspiring contestants must be between the ages of 18 and 30, taller than 160 cm,
unmarried, must never have given birth, and must have high-school education or
higher, Pan said.</P>
      <P>The organizing committee will accept registrations for the contest until March
15, she said.</P>
      <P>"In the Miss Taiwan Beauty Contest, which is held once every two years, we are
very particular about the transparency of the judging process," said Pan.</P>
      <P>The organizing committee has always done its best to make sure that the judges'
decisions are fair and objective, she added.</P>
      <P>Pan said that in light of the tight economic situation, the organizing committee
has lowered the registration fee for the beauty contest from the usual NT$3,000
(US$90) to NT$1,000.</P>
      <P>According to Pan, in a new segment that has been added to this year's
competition, the contestants will be required to wear a costume that represents
their own heritage.</P>
      <P>"The costumes can range from traditional Chinese dresses to indigenous outfits,"
said Pan, adding that the new category was designed to promote Taiwan's rich and
diverse culture.</P>
      <P>According to the event's organizers, the winner of this year's Miss Taiwan
Beauty Contest will receive a prize of NT$300,000 (US$8,892) and will have a
chance to participate in local and international charity and cultural exchange

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to be listed as a country free from food-and-mouth disease
(FMD) by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) next year, if no new
suspicious cases are reported during this transitional year, the Cabinet-level
Council of Agriculture (COA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Under OIE guidelines, Taiwan is entitled to apply for the status as a FMD-free
country with the OIE before its annual meeting slated for May 2010 should no
more suspicious cases erupt in the country and no vaccines are given to the
animals from now until May of next year, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>As an outbreak of the disease would impact a country's meat exports, the OIE
imposes very strict regulations in approving a country's application to be
listed as a FMD-free country, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Once a country has an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, it could take up to 40
years for it to eventually be listed as a FMD-free country, as was the case in
some European countries, officials noted.</P>
      <P>After the first FMD case broke out in Taiwan on March 20, 1997, Taiwan has been
trying to stamp out the disease as quickly as possible, they added.</P>
      <P>Since then, all pig farms and slaughter houses around Taiwan have continuously
conducted disinfections to maintain a clean environment and prevent the spread
of viruses.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the percentage of pigs at nationwide hog farms receiving anti-
FMD vaccine injections has dropped from 50 percent last November to the current
level of less than 10 percent on average at each farm, moving toward a zero
injection rate so as to meet the OIE's requirements, according to the COA
officials.</P>
      <P>They said the COA will step up efforts to monitor relevant practices regarding
vaccine injections in coming months, and that Taiwan will be able to apply for
the FMD-free status with the OIE in May next year if no fresh suspicious cases
of the disease are reported in Taiwan from the current critical time until next
May.</P>
      <P>Taiwan used to raise as many as 12 million pigs per year in the peak years, with
7 million exported to Japan annually, according to the COA officials. Taiwan now
raises only about 6.4 million pigs a year, mainly for local consumption, the
officials noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Wang Yeu-tzuoo and Chen Ti, both players in transition, will try to
make up for the loss of the country's best player when Taiwan hosts Kazakhstan
in a preliminary Asia/Oceania Zone Group I Davis Cup tie that begins Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's top player Lu Yen-hsun, now ranked a career best 58 after reaching the
third round of the Australian Open, will miss the tie with a knee injury,
dealing a potentially severe blow to the team.</P>
      <P>His absence means Wang, who was ranked as high as 85th in 2006 but has been
sidelined for most of the past year with a persistent wrist injury, and Chen,
who has completely overhauled his game in the past six weeks, including changing
his grip, will play singles for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In Friday's opening matches, beginning at 1 p.m. at the Sinjhuang Gymnasium in
Taipei County, world No. 375 Chen will take on 145th-ranked Mikhail Kukushkin,
followed by Wang against world No. 119 Andrey Golubev, who beat Marat Safin late
last year and is capable of playing with the world's best if he gets hot.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has tentatively paired Yang Tsung-hua, the top-ranked junior in the world
in 2008 and Yi Chu-huan, a doubles specialist added to the lineup after Lu
pulled out, in Saturday's doubles, which also begin at 1 p.m., but that could
change depending on the outcome of Friday's singles matches.</P>
      <P>Both Wang and Chen will likely be rusty, having not played competitively in the
past few months. Wang has played a mere five tournaments since last year's
Australian Open, and only began hitting balls at the end of November when he
felt his wrist was better.</P>
      <P>Chen last played matches in November, but hopes the improvement he has made to
his serve will make up for any lack of match toughness against a foe reputed for
his steadiness.</P>
      <P>Although the tie may not be an attractive match-up on paper, it is full of
intrigue. Kazakhstan has never been known as a tennis power, but the country has
invested heavily in the game recently and enlisted the services of three
Russians, including the 21-year-old Golubev and Kukushkin, to represent it in
international play.</P>
      <P>Taiwan earned promotion to Group I in 2004, but despite the presence of top-100
talents Lu Yen-hsun and Wang, it has failed over the past five years to get a
crack at the World Group playoffs, the gateway to the World Group, the top level
of Davis Cup.</P>
      <P>With both Lu and Wang in their mid-20s and most future ties likely to be played
on the road, this year's competition was seen as the best opportunity for Taiwan
to finally achieve a breakthrough.</P>
      <P>But that was before Lu injured his knee. And being drawn to play Kazakhstan in
the preliminary round, necessary because Group I needed to narrow its nine-team
field to eight, has not helped.</P>
      <P>Taiwan beat Kazakhstan 3-2 in Almaty last year in a relegation round playoff
behind Lu and Chen, but neither Golubev or Kukushkin played in that tie because
they had yet to gain Kazakhstan citizenship.</P>
      <P>Now the stakes are higher and the competition tougher, but if Taiwan beats
Kazakhstan, it will host India March 6-8, when this year's Davis Cup competition
begins in earnest. A win over India and then over either Australia or Thailand
in May would send Taiwan into the World Group playoffs later in the year.</P>

      <P>A Taiwan youth delegation will depart for Japan Friday for a goodwill visit, as
part of efforts by the two countries to further enhance bilateral ties, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a pre-departure press conference, Foreign Minister Francisco H. L.
Ou said that the youth program, part of the Special Taiwan-Japan  partnership
framework for 2009,  will extend the traditional friendship between the two
countries from ayoung stage.</P>
      <P>Ou expressed his hope that the 108 high school students in the delegation, who
will be accompanied by 20 journalists, will serve as competent young diplomats
and introduce Taiwans culture to Japanese youngsters.</P>
      <P>As Japan expanded the size of the delegation invited to visit the country this
year, Ou promised that Taiwan will do the same in return.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ou said, the government will push for the signing of a reciprocal
"working holiday" deal with Japan, which would allow young adults from each
country to travel to the other on working vacations. This, in turn, would
enhance mutual understanding among the younger generations of the two countries,
said Ou.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Saito Masaki, chief representative of the Japan Interchange
Association's Taipei Office, which acts as the de-facto Japanese embassy in
Taiwan, said that in order to maintain good Japan-Taiwan ties, mutual
understanding and trust should be built among young adults of the two countries.</P>
      <P>He hoped that after the visit to Japan, the young delegates will not only gain a
better understanding of the neighboring country, but will also reflect on their
own culture and deepen their knowledge of Taiwan s culture and history.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has designated 2009 as the year for bolstering its special partnership
with Japan, focusing on trade and investment, culture, tourism, student
exchanges and dialogue, according to MOFA.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou conferred the Order of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon
on baseball legend Sadaharu Oh Thursday in recognition of his contributions to
the sport of baseball and to promoting friendship between Taiwanese and Japanese
people.</P>
      <P>Upon receiving the prestigious medal, Oh, known in Taiwan as Wang Chen-chih and
baseball's all-time home run king, said it was the greatest honor of his life to
be decorated by President Ma.</P>
      <P>Oh, who retired from the Yomiuri Giants in 1980 at the age of 40, hit 868 home
runs during his career, the most hit by a player in any professional league
around the world.</P>
      <P>He said he has been involved in baseball for five decades and baseball has left
him a lot of beautiful memories. Because of baseball, Oh has been able to gain
fame and meet famous people from all sectors.</P>
      <P>Oh, the son of a Chinese father and a Japanese mother and a Republic of China
citizen who has never forgotten his Chinese heritage despite spending most of
his life in Japan, said he anticipates spending more time in his retirement to
promote the love of baseball among youths and children.</P>
      <P>Ma also played host to Oh over a luncheon at the Presidential Office Thursday.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Oh paid a courtesy call on ruling Kuomintang Chairman Wu Po-
hsiung, with whom Oh has been well acquainted over the past two decades.</P>
      <P>Wu gave two photos to Oh as souvenirs -- one depicting Oh bringing the torch

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 13,392 foreign workers remain employed in Kaohsiung City in southern
Taiwan, and companies forcing local workers to take unpaid leave will be
targeted by the city to help ease the rising jobless rate, the city's Bureau of
Labor Affairs said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The local manufacturing industry has the largest number of foreign workers,
6,502, followed by the care giving sector with 5,896 employees, according to
statistics compiled by the bureau.</P>
      <P>In terms of nationality, the highest number of foreign workers, 5,666, are from
Indonesia, followed by the Philippines with 5,003, Vietnam with 2,365, and
Thailand with 1,358, the figures show.</P>
      <P>To fight a growing jobless rate brought about by the current economic downturn,
the city's labor affairs bureau has demanded that companies employ more local
workers to fill new job vacancies, and that they repatriate foreign workers upon
expiration of their contracts, bureau deputy director Hsieh Lee-li said.</P>
      <P>Several high-tech companies repatriated their foreign workers at the beginning
of the year, based on this order, Hsieh noted.</P>
      <P>Last year, a total of 10,229 Kaohsiung citizens filed claims for unemployment
benefits.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung is Taiwan's second-largest city and relies heavily on manufacturing
businesses.</P>

      <P>Two more defendants pleaded guilty to helping former President Chen Shui-bian
and his family launder money, as the trial of corruption and money laundering
cases involving the former first family continued Thursday at the Taipei
District Court.</P>
      <P>The latest to plead guilty were Chen Chun-ying, a sister-in-law of former first
lady Wu Shu-jen, and Kuo Chuan-ching, former chairman of Rich Development Inc.,
who allegedly gave bribes to the former first family.</P>
      <P>Prior to this, five others had also pleaded guilty, namely the former president
son's Chen Chih-chung and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching, the former first
lady's elder brother Wu Ching-mao, and her friends Tsai Ming-che and Tsai Ming-
chieh. Their names were all on a long list of intermediaries allegedly used by
Wu to wire and secretly stash huge sums of money overseas.</P>
      <P>Kuo was listed as defendant in the case because he allegedly paid Wu US$2.73
million in kickbacks to help him win a tender to build the Nangang Exhibition
Hall between 2002 and 2003.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors probing the case found that instead of giving the money directly to
Wu, Kuo first deposited the funds in a bank account held by his sister Kuo Shu-
jen before transferring it to another account held by Tsai Ming-che. The money
was later transferred to another account held by Lin Pi-ting, another
intermediary, before it was wired into an overseas account created under the
name of Wu Ching-mao, according to the investigators.</P>
      <P>The former first couple is accused of siphoning off NT$104 million  (US$3.1
million)  from a special Presidential  Office discretionary fund during Chen
Shui-bian's presidency from 2000 to May 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes worth a total of NT$300 million in
connection with a land deal between the Hsinchu Science Park and Dayu
Development Corp.</P>
      <P>The couple is still being probed on suspicion of helping several financial

      <P>It is too early to speculate on the construction of a bridge connecting the
Taiwan-controlled island of Kinmen and the nearby Chinese city of Xiamen,
despite increasing exchanges between the two sides, a Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>MAC Deputy Chairman Liu Teh-hsun said during a routine press conference  that
despite  recent  significant  improvements  in cross-Taiwan Strait relations,
there has been no policy formed on whether or not such a link should be
constructed.</P>
      <P>"The Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) is still
evaluating the feasibility of constructing such a bridge, " Liu said, adding
that the issue has turned out to be more complex than originally expected.</P>
      <P>The bridge would not only be a transport issue but would also be related to the
nation's economy and national defenses, said Liu.</P>
      <P>Commenting on rumors that it was President Ma Ying-jeou who proposed the Kinmen-
Xiamen bridge construction plan, Liu pointed out that the plan was in fact
proposed by the Kinmen county government last August as part of efforts to
promote economic development on the outlying island.</P>
      <P>Ma, Liu went on, adopted an open attitude toward the plan when he inspected the
planned site for the bridge during a visit he made to Kinmen last August.</P>
      <P>"We are optimistic about the plan, " said Liu, adding that once the bridge is
built, it could lure many foreign tourists to visit Kinmen and would also have
important significance on the issue of cross-strait peace.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government reaffirmed the Republic of China's historical
claim to islands and reefs in the South China Sea Thursday, describing them as
having been Chinese territory since the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- A.D. 220).</P>
      <P>Officials from the Kaohsiung Marine Bureau said the ROC's sovereignty claim is
beyond doubt and challenge, adding that all four groups of islands in the South
China Sea -- the Spratly Islands (known as Nansha in Chinese) , the Macclesfield
Bank Islands (known locally as Jhongsha) , the Pratas Islands (Dongsha) and the
Paracel Islands (Sisha) -- along with their surrounding waters, are ROC
territories  from  a  historical,  geographical,  factual  and international law
perspective.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has also issued statements many times to
reiterate ROC sovereignty over these areas, the Marine Bureau officials noted.</P>
      <P>They said the Ministry of the Interior contracted the city government Feb. 24,
1990 to administer Nansha (including Taiping Island) and Dongsha under the
jurisdiction of the city's Cijin district.</P>
      <P>The ROC has stationed personnel on Taiping Island, the largest coral atoll in
the Nansha Islands, since the 1940s, and they rely on supplies from Taiwan for
their operations and daily necessities.</P>
      <P>On March 3, 2007, the city government designated Taiping Island as a breeding
and conservation area for sea turtles, making it a haven for marine wildlife and
marine studies, the officials went on.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks after two chambers of the Philippines legislature -- the
Senate and House of Representatives -- passed bills Jan. 28 and Feb. 2,
respectively, to annex some of the islets and reefs of the Spratly Islands and
Macclesfield Bank Islands as part of the Southeast Asian country's territory.</P>
      <P>The MOFA called on the Philippines Wednesday to negotiate with Taiwan on the
South China Sea sovereignty  dispute under the principles and in the spirit of
the United Nations Charter, the U.N. Convention on the Law of Sea and the
Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea to resolve the
conflicting claims peacefully.</P>
      <P>The Spratlys consist of about 180 barren islets, reefs and atolls dotting the
South China Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. Vietnam, China,
Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei each claim all or part of the low-
lying islands, believed to be rich in oil, gas and fishery resources.</P>

      <P>National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) in Taiwan's Hsinchu City and Shanghai Jiao
Tong University in China have signed an agreement to jointly develop biomedical
engineering technology, an official of the northern Taiwan university said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The agreement was signed during a visit by a delegation led by NCTU President Wu
Chung-yu to the Shanghai university from Feb. 3-4.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, NCTU will provide electronic engineering expertise and send
Taiwan's medical professionals to conduct clinical trials in Shanghai Jiao Tong
University to advance biomedical research, the official said.</P>
      <P>NCTU has been known in the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park and the U.S.
Silicon Valley circles for its expertise in electronic engineering, especially
in the areas of communication, semiconductor, and IC design, but without a
medical school or an affiliated hospital, it is facing a bottleneck in making
fast progress in biomedical engineering, according to the official.</P>
      <P>In comparison, after a merger with Shanghai Second Medical University n 2005,
Shanghai Jiao Tong University at present has 12 affiliated hospitals with 12,000
beds, an outpatient volume of about 600 million people and a surgery volume of
200,000 patients annually, the official said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the two universities decided to work together to develop the
biomedical technology industry by making good use of their respective advantages
and resources.</P>
      <P>In the initial phrase, the two universities will build a certification system
for stem cell tissue banks and laboratories in Taiwan and China and set up a
technology platform for both sides to develop medical implant chips and
components for the use in clinical trials. The Shanghai university will also
provide funding and patients for the trials, the official added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Little Kinmen, or Lieyu, an islet township just west of Taiwan's outlying island
of Kinmen, has decided to hold a referendum in April to allow its residents to
determine whether casinos should be built on their small island, sources from
Kinmen said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Kinmen county government meeting, Lieyu township chief Lin Chin-
liang announced that the referendum will be held April 4 to gauge residents'
opinions on whether the 16.23 square km-islet should be developed into a casino
resort.</P>
      <P>Lin said the number of eligible voters on Lieyu totals about 5,000, who will
cast their referendum ballots at five polling stations around the township.</P>
      <P>If the number of supporters of the motion exceeds half of the ballots cast, the
township office will refer the referendum results to the Kinmen county
government to be used as reference when it considers pushing for casino resort
development on Kinmen, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said he favors the passage of the casino plan in the referendum so that
Lieyu, which has an area about the size of Macao, could be developed into a
"Little Macao."</P>
      <P>He added that his office conducted a public opinion poll among Lieyu residents
last July and found that 92 percent favored the idea of building casinos.</P>
      <P>The legislature passed a draft amendment Jan. 12 legalizing gambling on Taiwan's
outlying islands.</P>
      <P>According to the amendment, referendums should be held on the outlying islands
to allow residents to determine whether casinos should be built in their areas.</P>
      <P>Casino building plans require "yes" votes from over half of the total ballots
cast in the referendums, according to the just-enacted amendment.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng welcomed Lieyu's referendum plan, saying that the
township is following a good administrative tradition by taking residents'
opinions into consideration  when shaping township policies.</P>
      <P>He said the Kinmen county government will render all possible assistance to
facilitate the referendum.</P>
      <P>Lee also suggested during the meeting that more issues should be included in the
referendum to probe opinions on other matters involving the community, including
whether a bridge should be built connecting Kinmen and Lieyu, whether Kinmen
should be completely demilitarized, and whether a bridge should be built between
Lieyu and nearby Xiamen City in China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said Thursday that it has continued to recall a
batch of tainted pet food that recently caused the deaths of a large number of
dogs.</P>
      <P>Hsu Tien-lai,  director of the COA's Department of Animal Husbandry, said stray
dog shelters in Taipei and Kaohsiung counties reported that around 400 dogs have
died since early January after eating dog food contaminated with aflatoxin.</P>
      <P>All the tainted dog food was supplied by a Yunlin County-based company, Jitai
Feed, that allegedly used aflatoxin-contaminated corn from Pakistan in its
production process.</P>
      <P>Aflatoxin is produced by mold and can cause fatal liver damage.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the department last year checked 150 samples of retail pet food,
including some from Jitai Feed, all of which showed levels of aflatoxin below
the specified acceptable 20 ppm limit.</P>
      <P>However, a large number of dogs died earlier this year in Taipei County and the
COA found that all of them had been fed from the batch of pet food produced by
Jitai between October and November using the Pakistani corn as one of its
ingredients.</P>
      <P>Since the deaths, the COA has asked local governments to recall the pet food
produced by Jitai during that period.</P>
      <P>In addition, the COA also asked local governments and relevant agencies to
conduct comprehensive checks on pet foods sold in their localities, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>He added that all 106 samples of pet food tested this year -- 94 dog food and 12
cat food samples -- had aflatoxin content within the acceptable limit.</P>
      <P>Some 300 dogs died at two animal shelters in Taipei County in early January,
while another 100 perished at a shelter in Kaohsiung County during the recent
Chinese New Year holiday after eating the contaminated dog food.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President outlines diplomatic agenda with economy as top priority</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday that Taiwan's pragmatic diplomacy will
focus on economic themes this year in the face of the global economic recession.</P>
      <P>"Seeking niche markets for businesses and removing trade barriers with our major
trading partners will be prioritized in our diplomatic work in the Year of the
Ox, " Ma said at a spring banquet organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
in honor of members of the Taipei Diplomatic Corps at the start of the lunar new
year.</P>
      <P>In addition to beefing up Taiwan's trade and economic relations with other
countries, Ma said, Taiwan's diplomatic agenda will also prioritize aid to
countries that lack resources.</P>
      <P>Since assuming office last May,  Ma went on,  Taiwan has encountered a host of
tests and challenges it has rarely had to face before.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the president said proudly that with concerted efforts from the
public and private sectors, the country has managed to complete many
unprecedented  tasks and to score remarkable achievements on various fronts,
particularly in the diplomatic and national defense fields and in relations
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He cited in particular several prominent events to highlight his
administration's  accomplishments  over the past eight  months, including the
United States' nod to the sale of a package of advanced weapons to Taiwan and a
visit to Taiwan by China's top cross-strait negotiator Chen Yunlin last November
during which four agreements were signed on direct air, shipping and postal
links, and food safety cooperation.</P>
      <P>Last December,  he continued,  Taiwan was admitted to the Government Procurement
Agreement affiliated with the World Trade Organization, while in January, the
country was included in the International Health Regulations mechanism under the
World Health Organization. In addition, the United States also removed Taiwan
from its Special 301 watch list in recognition of the improvements it has made
in intellectual property rights protection.</P>
      <P>Combined, these events showcase the government's achievements in improving
relations with China and maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait
while fostering better bilateral and multilateral relations with countries
around the world, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Even more encouraging is that the government has not compromised on Taiwan's
national sovereignty and dignity in completing those missions, Ma said,
attributing the accomplishments to his "modus vivendi" diplomatic approach.</P>
      <P>Looking forward to the coming year, Ma continued, such a pragmatic diplomatic
approach should carry a new focus.</P>
      <P>"We should expand our detente or reconciliation with China into the arena of
international relations, " Ma said, adding that major countries around the world
have praised the diplomatic truce between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
over the last half-year.</P>
      <P>With sensitive cross-strait relations stabilizing and warming up, Ma said Taiwan
should now devote more energy to practical issues, such as trade, investment,
environmental protection and immigration, which also play vital roles in
international relations and can help cement bilateral amity and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Warning that the continuing economic downturn could herald the rise of
protectionism, Ma quoted from a poem penned by British poet John Donne -- "No
man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent"  --
to emphasize  the necessity  of interdependence, co-existence and co-prosperity
among countries.</P>
      <P>With reinvigorating the economy as a priority task for his administration, Ma
encouraged Taiwan's diplomatic staff to help local enterprises explore new
markets and business opportunities, and to make "promoting bilateral economic
and trade relations part of their work routines."</P>
      <P>Among the guests at the banquet were Burkina Faso Ambassador Jacques Sawadogo
and Masaki Saito, head of the Taipei Office of the Japan Interchange
Association,  senior government officials and prominent business executives.</P>
      <P>This year's spring banquet featured world elements in cuisine, as well as in
music and film presentations, integrating the cultures of Taiwan and those of
various countries on the five continents.</P>

      <P>Some 14.7 percent of 150 Chinese herbal medicine samples tested in 2008 were
found to contain Western drug ingredients, a slightly lower ratio than the
previous year's 15.8 percent, the Consumers' Foundation reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The foundation said it received a total of 167 samples of Chinese herbal
medicines from consumers in February, June and October last year to be tested
for Western medicine or heavy metal content.</P>
      <P>The results of the tests showed that 22 of 150 samples were adulterated with
Western medicine elements, while 71 of the 167 samples totally were found to
contain lead, 61 contained mercury, and 40 contained cadmium, according to the
foundation.</P>
      <P>Martial arts studios around the country were the primary source of Chinese
herbal treatments adulterated with Western medicine, with four out six samples
from those establishments found to contain the elements.</P>
      <P>Seven of the 15 samples of "counterfeit Chinese medicine" were from mainland
China, while five of the 17 adulterated medicines were acquired by consumers
from their friends or relatives, the foundation added.</P>
      <P>According to the foundation, it is also worth noting that some traditional
Chinese medicine products sold at local herbal medicine clinics and pharmacies
and herbal stores were also found to contain western drug ingredients.</P>
      <P>A total of 23 types of such ingredients were detected, including the  anti-
inflammatory  and analgesic  drugs  indomethacin  and acetamiophen, as well as
caffeine, hydrochlorothiazide, thiamine disulfide, and acetaminophen, the
foundation said.</P>
      <P>Warning that an accumulation of heavy metals could cause chronic heavy metal
poisoning, the foundation urged consumers not to buy Chinese herbal medicine of
unknown origin.</P>

      <P>It is too early to speculate on the construction of a bridge connecting the
Taiwan-controlled island of Kinmen and the nearby Chinese city of Xiamen,
despite increasing exchanges between the two sides, a Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>MAC Deputy Chairman Liu Teh-hsun said during a routine press conference  that
despite  recent  significant  improvements  in cross-Taiwan Strait relations,
there has been no policy formed on whether or not such a link should be
constructed.</P>
      <P>"The Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) is still
evaluating the feasibility of constructing such a bridge, " Liu said, adding
that the issue has turned out to be more complex than originally expected.</P>
      <P>The bridge would not only be a transport issue but would also be related to the
nation's economy and national defenses, said Liu.</P>
      <P>Commenting on rumors that it was President Ma Ying-jeou who proposed the Kinmen-
Xiamen bridge construction plan, Liu pointed out that the plan was in fact
proposed by the Kinmen county government last August as part of efforts to
promote economic development on the outlying island.</P>
      <P>Ma, Liu went on, adopted an open attitude toward the plan when he inspected the
planned site for the bridge during a visit he made to Kinmen last August.</P>
      <P>"We are optimistic about the plan, " said Liu, adding that once the bridge is
built, it could lure many foreign tourists to visit Kinmen and would also have
important significance on the issue of cross-strait peace.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government reaffirmed the Republic of China's historical
claim to islands and reefs in the South China Sea Thursday, describing them as
having been Chinese territory since the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- A.D. 220).</P>
      <P>Officials from the Kaohsiung Marine Bureau said the ROC's sovereignty claim is
beyond doubt and challenge, adding that all four groups of islands in the South
China Sea -- the Spratly Islands (known as Nansha in Chinese) , the Macclesfield
Bank Islands (known locally as Jhongsha) , the Pratas Islands (Dongsha) and the
Paracel Islands (Sisha) -- along with their surrounding waters, are ROC
territories  from  a  historical,  geographical,  factual  and international law
perspective.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has also issued statements many times to
reiterate ROC sovereignty over these areas, the Marine Bureau officials noted.</P>
      <P>They said the Ministry of the Interior contracted the city government Feb. 24,
1990 to administer Nansha (including Taiping Island) and Dongsha under the
jurisdiction of the city's Cijin district.</P>
      <P>The ROC has stationed personnel on Taiping Island, the largest coral atoll in
the Nansha Islands, since the 1940s, and they rely on supplies from Taiwan for
their operations and daily necessities.</P>
      <P>On March 3, 2007, the city government designated Taiping Island as a breeding
and conservation area for sea turtles, making it a haven for marine wildlife and
marine studies, the officials went on.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks after two chambers of the Philippines legislature -- the
Senate and House of Representatives -- passed bills Jan. 28 and Feb. 2,
respectively, to annex some of the islets and reefs of the Spratly Islands and
Macclesfield Bank Islands as part of the Southeast Asian country's territory.</P>
      <P>The MOFA called on the Philippines Wednesday to negotiate with Taiwan on the
South China Sea sovereignty  dispute under the principles and in the spirit of
the United Nations Charter, the U.N. Convention on the Law of Sea and the
Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea to resolve the
conflicting claims peacefully.</P>
      <P>The Spratlys consist of about 180 barren islets, reefs and atolls dotting the
South China Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. Vietnam, China,
Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei each claim all or part of the low-
lying islands, believed to be rich in oil, gas and fishery resources.</P>

      <P>National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) in Taiwan's Hsinchu City and Shanghai Jiao
Tong University in China have signed an agreement to jointly develop biomedical
engineering technology, an official of the northern Taiwan university said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The agreement was signed during a visit by a delegation led by NCTU President Wu
Chung-yu to the Shanghai university from Feb. 3-4.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, NCTU will provide electronic engineering expertise and send
Taiwan's medical professionals to conduct clinical trials in Shanghai Jiao Tong
University to advance biomedical research, the official said.</P>
      <P>NCTU has been known in the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park and the U.S.
Silicon Valley circles for its expertise in electronic engineering, especially
in the areas of communication, semiconductor, and IC design, but without a
medical school or an affiliated hospital, it is facing a bottleneck in making
fast progress in biomedical engineering, according to the official.</P>
      <P>In comparison, after a merger with Shanghai Second Medical University n 2005,
Shanghai Jiao Tong University at present has 12 affiliated hospitals with 12,000
beds, an outpatient volume of about 600 million people and a surgery volume of
200,000 patients annually, the official said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the two universities decided to work together to develop the
biomedical technology industry by making good use of their respective advantages
and resources.</P>
      <P>In the initial phrase, the two universities will build a certification system
for stem cell tissue banks and laboratories in Taiwan and China and set up a
technology platform for both sides to develop medical implant chips and
components for the use in clinical trials. The Shanghai university will also
provide funding and patients for the trials, the official added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Little Kinmen, or Lieyu, an islet township just west of Taiwan's outlying island
of Kinmen, has decided to hold a referendum in April to allow its residents to
determine whether casinos should be built on their small island, sources from
Kinmen said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Kinmen county government meeting, Lieyu township chief Lin Chin-
liang announced that the referendum will be held April 4 to gauge residents'
opinions on whether the 16.23 square km-islet should be developed into a casino
resort.</P>
      <P>Lin said the number of eligible voters on Lieyu totals about 5,000, who will
cast their referendum ballots at five polling stations around the township.</P>
      <P>If the number of supporters of the motion exceeds half of the ballots cast, the
township office will refer the referendum results to the Kinmen county
government to be used as reference when it considers pushing for casino resort
development on Kinmen, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said he favors the passage of the casino plan in the referendum so that
Lieyu, which has an area about the size of Macao, could be developed into a
"Little Macao."</P>
      <P>He added that his office conducted a public opinion poll among Lieyu residents
last July and found that 92 percent favored the idea of building casinos.</P>
      <P>The legislature passed a draft amendment Jan. 12 legalizing gambling on Taiwan's
outlying islands.</P>
      <P>According to the amendment, referendums should be held on the outlying islands
to allow residents to determine whether casinos should be built in their areas.</P>
      <P>Casino building plans require "yes" votes from over half of the total ballots
cast in the referendums, according to the just-enacted amendment.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng welcomed Lieyu's referendum plan, saying that the
township is following a good administrative tradition by taking residents'
opinions into consideration  when shaping township policies.</P>
      <P>He said the Kinmen county government will render all possible assistance to
facilitate the referendum.</P>
      <P>Lee also suggested during the meeting that more issues should be included in the
referendum to probe opinions on other matters involving the community, including
whether a bridge should be built connecting Kinmen and Lieyu, whether Kinmen
should be completely demilitarized, and whether a bridge should be built between
Lieyu and nearby Xiamen City in China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said Thursday that it has continued to recall a
batch of tainted pet food that recently caused the deaths of a large number of
dogs.</P>
      <P>Hsu Tien-lai,  director of the COA's Department of Animal Husbandry, said stray
dog shelters in Taipei and Kaohsiung counties reported that around 400 dogs have
died since early January after eating dog food contaminated with aflatoxin.</P>
      <P>All the tainted dog food was supplied by a Yunlin County-based company, Jitai
Feed, that allegedly used aflatoxin-contaminated corn from Pakistan in its
production process.</P>
      <P>Aflatoxin is produced by mold and can cause fatal liver damage.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the department last year checked 150 samples of retail pet food,
including some from Jitai Feed, all of which showed levels of aflatoxin below
the specified acceptable 20 ppm limit.</P>
      <P>However, a large number of dogs died earlier this year in Taipei County and the
COA found that all of them had been fed from the batch of pet food produced by
Jitai between October and November using the Pakistani corn as one of its
ingredients.</P>
      <P>Since the deaths, the COA has asked local governments to recall the pet food
produced by Jitai during that period.</P>
      <P>In addition, the COA also asked local governments and relevant agencies to
conduct comprehensive checks on pet foods sold in their localities, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>He added that all 106 samples of pet food tested this year -- 94 dog food and 12
cat food samples -- had aflatoxin content within the acceptable limit.</P>
      <P>Some 300 dogs died at two animal shelters in Taipei County in early January,
while another 100 perished at a shelter in Kaohsiung County during the recent
Chinese New Year holiday after eating the contaminated dog food.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has the fourth-largest foreign exchange reserves of any country in the
world, trailing only China, Japan and Russia, the Central Bank of the Republic
of China (CBC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign currency reserves stood at US$292.676 billion at the end of
January, up US$969 million over the figure posted at the end of last December,
the CBC said.</P>
      <P>Lin Sun-yuan, director-general of the bank's Department of Foreign Exchange,
attributed the increase to interest earned on foreign exchange reserve
investments.</P>
      <P>China's forex reserve holdings totaled US$1.946 trillion at the end of December,
while Japan's amounted to US$1.003 trillion and Russia's stood at US$406.2

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday that Taiwan's pragmatic diplomacy will
focus on economic themes this year in the face of the global economic recession.</P>
      <P>"Seeking niche markets for businesses and removing trade barriers with our major
trading partners will be prioritized in our diplomatic work in the Year of the
Ox, " Ma said at a spring banquet organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
in honor of members of the Taipei Diplomatic Corps at the start of the lunar new
year.</P>
      <P>In addition to beefing up Taiwan's trade and economic relations with other
countries, Ma said, Taiwan's diplomatic agenda will also prioritize aid to
countries that lack resources.</P>
      <P>Since assuming office last May,  Ma went on,  Taiwan has encountered a host of
tests and challenges it has rarely had to face before.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the president said proudly that with concerted efforts from the
public and private sectors, the country has managed to complete many
unprecedented  tasks and to score remarkable achievements on various fronts,
particularly in the diplomatic and national defense fields and in relations
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He cited in particular several prominent events to highlight his
administration's  accomplishments  over the past eight  months, including the
United States' nod to the sale of a package of advanced weapons to Taiwan and a
visit to Taiwan by China's top cross-strait negotiator Chen Yunlin last November
during which four agreements were signed on direct air, shipping and postal
links, and food safety cooperation.</P>
      <P>Last December,  he continued,  Taiwan was admitted to the Government Procurement
Agreement affiliated with the World Trade Organization, while in January, the
country was included in the International Health Regulations mechanism under the
World Health Organization. In addition, the United States also removed Taiwan
from its Special 301 watch list in recognition of the improvements it has made
in intellectual property rights protection.</P>
      <P>Combined, these events showcase the government's achievements in improving
relations with China and maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait
while fostering better bilateral and multilateral relations with countries
around the world, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Even more encouraging is that the government has not compromised on Taiwan's
national sovereignty and dignity in completing those missions, Ma said,
attributing the accomplishments to his "modus vivendi" diplomatic approach.</P>
      <P>Looking forward to the coming year, Ma continued, such a pragmatic diplomatic
approach should carry a new focus.</P>
      <P>"We should expand our detente or reconciliation with China into the arena of
international relations, " Ma said, adding that major countries around the world
have praised the diplomatic truce between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
over the last half-year.</P>
      <P>With sensitive cross-strait relations stabilizing and warming up, Ma said Taiwan
should now devote more energy to practical issues, such as trade, investment,
environmental protection and immigration, which also play vital roles in
international relations and can help cement bilateral amity and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Warning that the continuing economic downturn could herald the rise of
protectionism, Ma quoted from a poem penned by British poet John Donne -- "No
man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent"  --
to emphasize  the necessity  of interdependence, co-existence and co-prosperity
among countries.</P>
      <P>With reinvigorating the economy as a priority task for his administration, Ma
encouraged Taiwan's diplomatic staff to help local enterprises explore new
markets and business opportunities, and to make "promoting bilateral economic
and trade relations part of their work routines."</P>
      <P>Among the guests at the banquet were Burkina Faso Ambassador Jacques Sawadogo
and Masaki Saito, head of the Taipei Office of the Japan Interchange
Association,  senior government officials and prominent business executives.</P>
      <P>This year's spring banquet featured world elements in cuisine, as well as in
music and film presentations, integrating the cultures of Taiwan and those of
various countries on the five continents.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Consumer price index rises 1.59% in January</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) in January rose 1.59 percent from the same
month of last year but dropped 0.27 percent from the previous month, indicating
continued moderation of inflation, according to a report released Thursday by
the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>Wu Chao-ming, a DGBAS section chief in charge of national statistics, noted that
consumer prices in Taiwan have been decreasing since reaching a peak last July,
while the inflation rate for the year stood at 3.52 percent.</P>
      <P>Wu said consumer prices were slightly lower in January than in December, mainly
because of a fall in vegetable and clothing prices, which were down 5.11 percent
and 2.83 percent month-on-month, respectively.</P>
      <P>Compared with the same month of last year, food prices as well as travel and
babysitting fees were higher in January, resulting in an increase in the CPI,
according to Wu.</P>
      <P>For the same month, the wholesale price index (WPI) went down by 10.43 percent
year-on-year, the greatest contraction recorded since April 1975, the DGBAS
report shows.</P>
      <P>Domestic sales, excluding imports, dropped 10.15 percent, while import and
export prices calculated in new Taiwan dollars were down 11.91 percent and 9.19
percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Wu attributed the sharp fall in wholesale prices to a recent plunge in
international agricultural and industrial commodities.</P>
      <P>However, it could take three to six months for the wholesale price reduction to
be reflected in consumer prices because of the complex production and retail
processes, he said.</P>

      <P>The government's education and training subsidy plan is designed to merely
disguise the high unemployment level and President Ma Ying-jeou's administration
should not try to resolve every problem by throwing vouchers or subsidies at it,
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai said at a news conference before attending a seminar in the central city of
Taichung that Ma should "cool down and stop wasting the country's financial and
human resources on impractical and badly designed policies."</P>
      <P>"The NT$20 billion (US$587 million) plan is a waste of money, and will have
little effect on the soaring unemployment rate" Tsai predicted, adding that Ma's
administration tends to use ill-conceived programs to cover the government's
inability to solve the nation's problems.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, instead of pushing for plausible solutions to save the
nation's ailing economy, the government has continuously found ways to seek
cures without conducting careful planning or evaluation.</P>
      <P>"They think they can solve the unemployment problem by keeping the people who
have lost their jobs or who are about to lose their jobs in school, " said Tsai,
adding that the subsidies will only provide temporary assistance to the
unemployed and fail to tackle the root of the problem.</P>
      <P>The plan is part of a special economic stimulus package under which the
government will inject NT$500 billion over the next four years into public
infrastructure projects.</P>
      <P>According to government statistics, the jobless rate rose to a five-year high of
5.03 percent last December, which translated into 549,000 jobless people,
220,000 of whom were graduates of higher education institutions.</P>
      <P>The government has also promised to create more than 100,000 jobs by focusing on
public construction projects and hopes to keep the unemployment rate below 4.5
percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The nomination of a ruling Kuomintang (KMT) candidate for the year-end election
of the Taipei county magistrate will be based on the result of a party primary,
KMT Vice Chairman Wu Den-yih said in Washington, D.C. Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu, who is leading a Taiwan delegation to attend the U.S. National Prayer
Breakfast slated for Feb. 4-6, said the KMT will have to field the candidate
with the best chance of winning as the party cannot afford to lose the election
in Taipei County, the largest and most representative battlefield in the year-
end city mayoral and county chief elections.</P>
      <P>Wu said that according to KMT election norms, incumbents do not enjoy
preferential treatment, meaning that if incumbent Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei
wants to run for re-election, he will have to take part in the KMT primaries and
seek nomination.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks during a news conference held at the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Representative Office in Washington.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on the U.S. business sector's calls for Taiwan to increase imports of
U.S. meat products and grain as a means to spur U.S. consumption in the face of
the global economic recession, Wu said any imports of food products will be
based on scientific standards. For instance, he noted, if there are still
concerns that mad cow disease still threatens U.S. beef, exports will have to be
monitored via scientific standards.</P>
      <P>Declining to make any promises on the issue, Wu said he will pass the word to
the administration when he returns to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's top representative to the United States, Jason Yuan, supplemented Wu's
remarks by saying that U.S. meat exporters have been pushing for increased sales
of beef on the bone to Taiwan, since boneless beef is already allowed to be
shipped to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During the news conference, Wu said the 2009 U.S. National Prayer Breakfast,
with over 4,000 political and business leaders from 160 countries taking part,
was particularly meaningful as it was the first of its kind in the middle of the
worst global economic crisis since the Great Depression and since the election
of African American Barack Obama as U.S. president.</P>
      <P>Wu's delegation included Wang Yu-ting, minister of the National Youth
Commission, and Yang Tai-shun, a political science professor with Chinese

      <P>The second stage of consumer voucher distribution will start Feb. 7, whereby
eligible people who have not yet received their shopping vouchers can pick them
up at designated post offices around the country, the Ministry of the Interior
(MIO) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The MIO reminded recipients to pick up their vouchers from designated post
offices near their residences.</P>
      <P>Recipients must present their national identification card, personal stamp and

those who do not wish to pick up their vouchers in person can give their ID and
personal stamp to someone else who can collect the vouchers on their behalf.</P>
      <P>Post offices around the nation will issue the vouchers from 1: 30 p.m-5:30 p.m

      <P>Eligible persons can also pick up their consumer vouchers between Feb. 17 and
April 30 at the designated post offices, after which date no more vouchers will
be issued, said the MOI.</P>
      <P>According to the MOI, close to 21 million people received their shopping
vouchers during the first stage distribution process before the Chinese Lunar
New Year.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's total population is close to 23 million, at least 2 million people

vouchers were distributed for the first time Jan. 18 to certain Taiwan

inaugurated the "Tour Taiwan Year 2009."</P>
      <P>Ma said the Executive Yuan will earmark NT$1 billion for the fund this year and
will gradually increase the amount each year to encourage investment in the
tourism industry,</P>
      <P>He said that although the number of foreign visitors to Taiwan is equal to only
16 percent of the country's population, there was a 3.5 percent increase in
visitor arrivals in 2008.</P>
      <P>The growth is encouraging given the fact that departures dropped by 5.5 percent
during the year, Ma said.</P>
      <P>According to the president, after the opening of direct air and shipping links
with China late last year, Taiwan is no longer subject to any restrictions in
terms of its transport and connection to the outside world. Therefore, the
country should take advantage of its favorable geographic position in East Asia
to promote tourism, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma went on, the government is seeking to negotiate with the United

    <TEXT>
      <P>With President Ma Ying-jeou calling for Taiwan's diplomacy to prioritize
economic issues, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Friday it will
create incentives for local businesses to invest in countries that do not have
diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a banquet for members of the diplomatic corps Thursday, Ma said that
Taiwan's pragmatic diplomacy will focus on economic themes this year in the face
of the global economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>The president also encouraged Taiwan's diplomats to help local enterprises
explore new markets and business opportunities, and make "promoting bilateral
economic and trade relations part of their work routines.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou told the Central News Agency that Ma's new
foreign policy focus made sense in the face of challenges resulting from the
global financial crisis, and said his agency will inform all foreign offices of
the shift in emphasis.</P>
      <P>The present diplomatic policy not only includes consolidating friendship with
diplomatic allies but should also involve developing economic and trade
relations with non allies,Ou said.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister said that if diplomats can create a good investment
environment and deepen friendships with countries that do not have diplomatic
relations with Taiwan, Taiwanese businesses would then have the incentive and
willingness to invest in those places.</P>
      <P>Given the global recession and improved cross-Taiwan Strait ties, now is a great
time for Taiwan to cultivate economic and trade relations with non-allied
countries,  especially  those in the Association of Southeast Asian NationsOu
said.</P>
      <P>According to existing law, however, incentives are provided only to Taiwanese
businesses investing in allied nations, and Ou said the foreign ministry will
try to amend the law to include investment in non-allied  countries in the
incentive program to reflect the administration's new diplomatic approach.</P>
      <P>Echoing Ou's view, a high-level MOFA official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that it is a matter of course to focus the country's diplomacy
on commercial issues, as the two are inseparable.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministry's role will only become less and less important if we only
focus on political issues, the official said, citing Australia's Department of
Foreign Affairs and Trade and South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
Trade as examples of other government's efforts to combine diplomatic and
economic affairs.</P>
      <P>Very often the government does not have to spend money when it comes to
conducting diplomatic affairs, but rather can play a role as a matchmaker,the
official said.</P>
      <P>The government can assist Taiwanese businesses tap into new markets and help
them seek better benefits from local governments to create a win-win-win
situation,he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run petroleum refiner CPC Corp., Taiwan (CPC) announced Friday that it
will increase the wholesale price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) by NT$3.1
(US$0.09) per kilogram with effect from Saturday.</P>
      <P>As a result, the retail price of household LPG will be raised by NT$62 per 20kg
cylinder. This will translate into an increased cost of NT$93 per month to the
average family, based on an estimated consumption of 1.5 cylinders of LPG per
month.</P>
      <P>Currently the retail LPG price was at around NT$620 per cylinder.</P>
      <P>The price hike is expected to heavily affect street food vendors, most of whom
use LPG for cooking. It is estimated that each food stand uses an average five
cylinders of LPG per month.</P>
      <P>The CPC said in a statement that the international LPG contract price rose to
US$505 per ton in February -- a hike of US$125 per ton, or 32.9 percent, from
the previous month.</P>
      <P>According to the company's calculation, the domestic price of LPG would have be
increased  by NT$5.15  per kg to reflect  the international cost. However, in
light of the economic slump, the domestic price will be adjusted to reflect only
60 percent of the international cost, in consideration of the effect on people's
lives, CPC said.</P>
      <P>It is the second consecutive month that the price of household LPG has
increased, with the hike over the last two months averaging 17.36 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the CPC statement, the pre-tax wholesale price of LPG will be
raised to NT$20.96 per kg, which nonetheless will be lower than in South Korea
where the cost is NT$37.91 per kg.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CPC will also raise the price of LPG for vehicles by NT$1.7 per
liter.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu sought subsidies from the central government for the
holding of the Kaohsiung 2009 World Games during a visit to the Executive Yuan
Friday, according to a city official.</P>
      <P>Under the city government's plan, it will earmark NT$1.98 billion (US$58.67
million) for the international sports event slated to open on July 26, with the
central and local governments each sharing half of the cost, the official said.</P>
      <P>However, the central government has yet to pay NT$730 million to meet its share,
according to the official.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Chen paid a visit to Premier Liu Chao-shiuan to brief him on the
city's budget allocation and preparation for the event and urged the Cabinet to
pay the remaining amount, the official added.</P>
      <P>Emily Cho-chuan Hsu, chief executive officer of the World Games 2009 Kaohsiung
Organizing Committee (KOC) , and many other KOC staff members were also present
at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Of the total budget for the Games, the KOC plans to spend NT$520 million on
promoting local culture and tourism, NT$330 million on sports competitions,
NT$310 million for promotion  and public relations affairs, NT$280 million for
logistics support, and NT$210 million for management affairs, the official said.</P>
      <P>The KOC estimated that some NT$23 million will be generated from the sales of
advertisements and tickets related to the World Games. Other revenues would
include NT$78 million from donations, NT$9.3 million from relevant products,
NT$5.02 million from royalty or licence fees, and other business incomes of
NT$22 million, the official added.</P>
      <P>According to the KOC rule, all countries will participate in the World Games on
the status of non-state entities without the use of their national anthem, flag
or official name, the official said.</P>
      <P>Around 3,200 athletes from nearly 100 countries are expected to participate in
the World Games, the official said, adding that the KOC will reserve  25 hotels
in the city to accommodate  the participants and prepare 200 buses to transport
them.</P>
      <P>The city government has set up a special task force for anti-terrorism and will
mobilize 33,000 policemen to maintain order during the event, the official
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA looking to establish offices in Sapporo, Istanbul</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Friday that as part of its work of
reviewing the functions and performance of its foreign representative offices,
it expects to open new offices in Sapporo, Japan and Istanbul, Turkey in the
first half of the year.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou told the Central News Agency that his
ministry is also considering  closing underperforming overseas offices, such as
the one in Bangladesh.</P>
      <P>The Republic  of China  currently  has 122 embassies  and representative offices
around the world, which require staffing by a relatively large number of
diplomats compared to the number posted abroad by South Korea and Singapore,
according to the foreign ministry.</P>
      <P>"In light of Taiwan's frequent people-to-people exchanges with Japan and Turkey,
the MOFA is considering establishing offices in Sapporo and Istanbul," Ou said.</P>
      <P>In principle, the Japan and Turkey governments have both agreed to the idea,"
the foreign minister said. "As far as the administrative process is concerned,
the Executive Yuan is hoping that the MOFA will first look at the required
budget and the size of the diplomatic staff for the proposed offices, but the
foreign ministry estimates that the plan will be realized within the first half
of the year."</P>
      <P>Ou said that setting up new representative offices and assigning diplomatic
service personnel abroad not only require the consent of the host governments,
but must also consider the actual needs of the host countries and their ties
with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Given that bilateral relations between Taiwan and China are improving, the
establishment of new representative offices abroad should now be smoother," the
foreign minister predicted.</P>
      <P>As for closing underperforming representative offices, Ou said the Foreign
Ministry is being very cautious, as it takes considerable effort to set up new
offices, and closing them without careful review might impact negatively on
bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>"However, people have to understand that diplomatic resources are limited and
the ministry needs to ensure that every penny is spent wisely," the foreign
minister said.</P>
      <P>According to Ou, the MOFA will evaluate whether to close representative offices
based on factors such as whether the ministry already has too many offices in
one country and whether the countries in question are friendly toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Any decision  to close representative  offices would have absolutely nothing to
do with a 'diplomatic truce' (with China), but rather would be made after
careful evaluation," Ou stressed.</P>

      <P>With more and more workers in Taiwan seeing their livelihoods threatened by
rising unemployment, entrepreneurship is being seen as a new way out, according
to the results of arecent survey released Friday by the online employment broker
104 Job Bank.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 81.6 percent of workers are interested in starting a
business, 7.6 percent of whom are determined to do so.</P>
      <P>Of these potential entrepreneurs, 15.2 percent said they are thinking of making
a change because their employment situation is not good. However, the two
reasons the respondents mentioned most frequently for wanting to start a
business were a desire to live the life they want and to realize their dreams.</P>
      <P>The results showed that older workers, especially those in their 50s,  are most
likely to turn to entrepreneurship because of unemployment, with 26.6 percent of
workers in this age group saying that losing their jobs was what gave them the
urge to start a business.</P>
      <P>Some 23.3 percent of respondents interested in entrepreneurship plan to move in
that direction within one year, 22.5 percent intend to do so in one to two
years, 19.9 percent in two to three years, and 34.4 percent in three years or
more, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The survey also revealed that older workers tend to be more proactive in trying
to put the idea into practice.</P>
      <P>More than 53 percent of respondents in their 40s and 40 percent of those in
their 50s are planning to start a business within one year, compared to 24.6
percent of those in their 30s and 15.1 percent of those in their 20s.</P>
      <P>On average, the potential entrepreneurs would require NT$565,300 in startup
funds, the survey found.</P>
      <P>As to the kinds of business they what to run, 39.4 percent expressed interest in
coffee shops, restaurants or snack bars, and 39.1 percent indicated a preference
for operating an online business such as an online auction or online store.</P>
      <P>Nearly 40 percent of the potential entrepreneurs are optimistic that they can
make a profit in six to 12 months after start-up, and 23.7 percent expect a gain
within six months.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, among the respondents who have no desire to go into business, 61.5
percent think starting a venture in times of economic recession is a risky
undertaking.</P>
      <P>Other reasons mentioned by this group of respondents included a lack of capital,
lack of personal qualities to run a business, and lack of any special expertise.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted Jan. 19-23 among 7,632 members of the job bank. It had
a margin of error of 1.12 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Bridge talks again bring Kinmen in spotlight</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/06/09  19:28:21</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>Renewed talk of building a bridge to connect Taiwan-held Kinmen Island with
China's port city of Xiamen has put the sparsely populated island county in the
spotlight, as it fights to promote a project that seems to have little if any
support from the central government or the opposition.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper reported on Thursday that President  Ma Ying-jeou had given
the order to start the project, but presidential spokesman Wang Yu-chi clarified
that Ma had simply asked about the progress of a feasibility assessment on
building the bridge.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet spokesman later said there was no timetable to complete the
feasibility study, a clear indication the government is in no rush to move
forward on the ambitious project.</P>
      <P>Even  ruling  Kuomintang  legislators  worry  the  bridge's construction would
divert local taxpayer funds to help China develop Xiamen.</P>
      <P>And if the government appears less than enthusiastic about building a bridge to
China, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party downright hates the idea,
branding it as another step to send Taiwan into China's fold.</P>
      <P>Yet Kinmen's residents want their island, Taiwan's former front line against
China during the Cold War, to be transformed into a new frontier for peace by
building a road link to China.</P>
      <P>Support for the project, called the Kindeng Bridge, is especially strong among
those over 60 who experienced the month-long artillery bombardment of the island
by the Chinese army in 1958 that killed over 600 servicemen and civilians and
injured more than 2,600.</P>
      <P>Most of those baptized under fire now dream of "driving a car from Kinmen to
Xiamen in a day, " said Yen Chung-cheng, a Kinmen native who once served as a
vice commander-in-chief of the Republic of China Army.</P>
      <P>During his stint as Fukien governor, a now-defunct position once responsible for
Kinmen and Matsu, another Taiwan-held island off China's coast, Yen listed the
building of a bridge connecting Kinmen and Xiamen as one of the three major
"projects of hope" in the region.</P>
      <P>According to a public opinion poll conducted by the National Kinmen Institute of
Technology in April 2007, building a bridge to Xiamen was the issue of second
greatest concern to the county's residents, trailing only the need for improved
health and emergency care.</P>
      <P>The 83.9 percent of respondents who felt it was an important issue believed it
was necessary to further cement ties with China, around which many of the lives
of the 50,000 people who reside in Kinmen revolve.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng is firmly behind the project, saying
Kinmen has served as a bridge connecting the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
since direct ferry services to Xiamen and other Chinese ports were launched in
early 2001.</P>
      <P>"The building of the Kindeng Bridge will not only help hone Taiwan's bridge
building technologies, it will also help boost development in Kinmen itself,"
Lee said.</P>
      <P>"The Kindeng Bridge will facilitate the building of water pipes and electricity
transmission cables between Kinmen and Xiamen, allowing Kinmen to import fresh
water and electricity from China -- moves that would also manifest Taiwan's
sincerity in pursuing peace and co-prosperity with China," he added.</P>
      <P>According to the Kinmen County government,  974,000 people traveled between
Kinmen and Xiamen in 2008, up from the 21,000 who used the ferry service in its
inaugural year, an indication, it says, of the island county's crucial role as a
gateway to China.</P>
      <P>Yet that role has been threatened since direct air and sea links were opened
between Taiwan and China last December, prompting Kinmen residents to seek
further breakthroughs in its ties with China, particularly Xiamen,  said Kinmen
County Council Speaker Hsieh Yi-chang.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the Kinmen County government began studying the possibility of
building of a bridge between Kinmen and Xiamen in 2004 and has since proposed
three different projects.</P>
      <P>Plan A is a 10.3-kilometer bridge that would connect Wulongshan in Kinmen, to
Jiaoyu and Xiaodeng islets and on to Dadeng Island, which sits west-northwest of
Xiamen Island and northeast of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Plan B, the Kindeng Bridge plan, would span 8.6 kilometers and directly connect
Wulongshan and Dadeng Island.</P>
      <P>Plan C is a 11.4-km bridge between Wulongshan and Fujian province's Lianhe,
which lies further north of Xiamen.</P>
      <P>The costs of the three plans range from NT$12.7  billion (US$377.98 million) to
NT$16.6 billion, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee said Kinmen County prefers the second option because it is the most direct
and the least costly.</P>
      <P>If the bridge were built, it would take less than 30 minutes to drive from
Kinmen to the island on which the center of Xiamen lies, by way of Dadeng, a
land bridge to Xiangan north of Xiamen and then a tunnel currently under
construction from Xiangan to Xiamen, County Speaker Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>A bridge would only further tie the Taiwan-held island to the major Chinese port
city. Even with slower ferry service, Kinmen residents visit Xiamen as casually
as taking a stroll outside after dinner.</P>
      <P>An increasing number of Kinmen youths have also chosen to attend schools in
Xiamen rather than traveling to Taiwan proper for studies after the ferry
service was opened.</P>
      <P>Moreover, as their children went to Xiamen to get an education, parents in
Kinmen began to purchase houses or invest in real estate in Xiamen.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Cheng-huan, formerly president of the Junior Chamber
International Kinmen and now owner of a realty company in Xiamen, Kinmen
residents have purchased at least 7,600 homes in Xiamen and many more in the
nearby Chinese cities of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou.</P>
      <P>"Have you bought a house in Xiamen yet? " has now become a greeting phrase when
Kinmen people meet on the streets, Chen said jokingly.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen County Council speaker says the bridge will turn Kinmen into a Xiamen
suburb, giving Kinmen residents more convenient links to their big city.</P>
      <P>"A genuine one-day traffic zone between Kinmen and Xiamen would be created,"
Hsieh said.</P>

      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said
Friday that May 19 -- the first year anniversary of President Ma Ying-jeou
taking office -- is the best time to assess Mas administration, indicating that
the DPP will decide then whether to try and unseat Ma, based on the results of
the examination.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks in Taichung at the regional preparation meeting for the
2009 Taiwan Citizen Conference on National Affairs, in which she said that the
DPP will fully examine Mas performance from political and economic aspects by
holding the conference to examine his administration's policies and its ability
to execute them.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  main  opposition  party  will also make concrete suggestions on
policies, Tsai added.</P>
      <P>The DPP has been concerned about and criticizing a series of measures Ma has
taken to improve relations with China after assuming office on May 20, 2008.
These measures include the signing of four agreements to open up direct air and
sea links with China and adopting the practice ofdiplomatic truceto end the
longstanding tug-of-war with Beijing to win over each othersallies.</P>
      <P>DPP officials and lawmakers have accused the Ma administration of sacrificing
Taiwans national interests.</P>
      <P>Citizen Conference on National Affairs can truthfully reflect the voice of the
people, Tsai said.President Ma and Premier Liu Chao-shiuan should attend the
conference to listen to what people have to say and if they do not do so, they
would be turning the peoplesvoice down.</P>
      <P>Tsai contended that all citizens are obligated to assemble civil organizations
and to expand such organizations to a kind of social force to check and balance
Mas administration.</P>
      <P>At Fridays preparatory meeting, a total of 24 people took the podium to
criticize Ma and his policies and contended that concrete actions should be
taken to fight against Ma. However, some also argued that the DPP should reflect
on itself so that it will not make the same mistakes when it retakes the reins
of government.</P>
      <P>The DPP came into power in 2000 after half a century of dominance by the
Kuomintang (KMT), but lost its political power to the KMT last year due to
widespread public dissatisfaction over the state of the economy, and the
corruption scandals plaguing the former President Chen Shui-bians

      <P>The MOTC said in a press statement that the one-year license for Star Cruises
was issued on a case-by-case basis in terms of the regulations governing direct
cross-strait shipping links.</P>
      <P>According to a schedule listed in the Star Cruises application, the largest
cruise line in the Asia-Pacific will launch direct cruise service between
Keelung Harbor in northern Taiwan and Xiamen in the southeastern Chinese
province of Fujian in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>Despite Taiwan's nod, MOTC officials said Star Cruises will still have to obtain
China's consent before the proposed Keelung-Xiamen service can begin.</P>
      <P>Star Cruises filed the application with the Keelung Harbor Bureau in December
last year to serve the route, but the screening process has turned out to be a
frustrating experience for the company, as government officials and the cruise
line's executives disagree over the nature of the service.</P>
      <P>MOTC officials believed then that that regular cruises between Keelung and
Xiamen would amount to marine passenger services, which only Taiwanese vessels
or vessels owned by Taiwanese-Chinese joint ventures are allowed to operate
under local regulations.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Star Cruises contended, however,  that ordinary people are
unlikely to use expensive cruises as "passenger services."</P>
      <P>At one point, the company said it might consider withdrawing from the Taiwan
market if Taiwanese authorities rejected its application to operate direct
Keelung-Xiamen cruise services.</P>
      <P>Star Cruises entered Taiwan's maritime tourism market in 1997, sailing primarily
between Keelung and Japan's Okinawa. The cruise line stopped sailing this route
in October 2005, but resumed the service in June 2007.</P>
      <P>The company has been the major player in Taiwan's cruise market, taking local
tourists on cruises to the Japanese islands of Okinawa, Ishigaki and Yonaguri,
Taiwan's Penghu islands and Hong Kong.  When the weather turns cold, its ships
leave Taiwan to serve Star Cruises' other Asian routes.</P>
      <P>At the time when Star Cruises resumed homeporting in Keelung, Star Cruises'
Taiwan manager Andy Lew openly indicated that from a long-term point of view,
Star Cruises wanted to launch services from Taiwan to Shanghai and Xiamen -- two
of China's port cities.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China reached agreements last November to lift a six-decade ban on
direct sea and postal links between the two sides and expand air links.</P>
      <P>Foreign cruise ships visiting Taiwan now no longer need to sail to a third
territory, usually Hong Kong, before they can visit a Chinese port, or vice
versa.</P>
      <P>Star Cruises contributes at least NT$7 million (US$207,715) in harbor fees ayear
to the Keelung Harbor Bureau from its homeporting on 80 cruises between March
and September.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Scholar calls for law to protect coral reefs</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6 (CNA)
02/06/09  21:25:02
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An Academia Sinica researcher suggested Friday that the government introduce
legislation to protect the country's coral reefs,  which he said are the largest
marine structures and are more important than pandas.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-lun, an associate research fellow at the Biodiversity Research Center,
made the call while releasing the findings of a 2008 research project on the
state of Taiwan's coral reefs.</P>
      <P>Chen warned that Taiwan's coral reefs are being threatened by the so-called
"black disease, " or attacks from a kind of black sponge that co-exists with
algae.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, he said the development of the coral-centered marine ecology
was found to be seriously  unbalanced  due to over-fishing.</P>
      <P>Researchers failed to find any large coral reef fish like groupers, parrotfish,
lobsters or large sea snails called triton in Taiwan's coastal waters, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, coral plays a far more important role in the ecologic system
than "star animals" like pandas and whales. Coral reefs should be protected by
law, especially as there is no legislation banning the harvesting of marine life
or prohibiting human activities that might threaten their survival, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The marine biologist suggested that coral reefs should be regarded as a life
form, instead of as rocks or stones.</P>
      <P>In addition, "coral reef fish and sea snails should be listed as protected wild
animals, instead of seafood," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen also suggested that the government pay attention to the threat to Taiwan's
coral reefs posed by global climate change, and advised swifter action to cut
carbon dioxide emissions in order to slow down the impact of global warming on
coral reefs.</P>
      <P>The whole marine ecology would be destroyed if coral reefs vanished from the
sea, he warned.</P>
      <P>The research on coral reefs in Taitung county, southeastern Taiwan, and the
Penghu archipelago off southwestern Taiwan proper was launched in 2008 by the
non-profit  Taiwan Marine Environment Education Promotion Association (TAMEE)
and the Taiwan Environmental Information Association.</P>
      <P>The report stated that a kind of black sponge that co-exists with algae is
attacking coral reefs around the islets of Green Island and Lanyu off
southeastern Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>"The coral dies once it is covered by the sponge, " said Yang Sung-ying, an
assistant to Chen.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, currently little is known in academic circles about the
sponge, except that it is spreading fast and posing a serious threat to the
marine ecology.</P>
      <P>The findings of the survey around Green Island showed that the sponge grew by 20
percent in the 2007-2008 period, he said. In Lanyu, the divers working on the
survey project found signs of black sponge at almost every dive location, he
added.</P>
      <P>The coverage was 10 percent on average, with the greatest spread reaching  26
percent,  the scholar said,  adding that further investigation is needed to
determine what is causing the spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in the marine areas that were surveyed, including waters off
Taitung's Shanyuan and Penghu's Dongyuping where the coral reef coverage is 70
percent, there were few signs of reef fish, he said.</P>
      <P>This means that "while the marine ecology appears healthy, actually it is not, "
Chen said, expressing worry that any further negative impact on the reefs would
be "the straw that breaks the camel's back."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan, Kazakhstan even on controversial Davis Cup opening day</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  6  (CNA)
02/06/09  21:28:59
(By Luke Sabatier)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>For the better part of two sets, Kazakhstan's Mikhail Kukushkin grumbled about
some of the line calls that were going against him.</P>
      <P>But it was Taiwan's Chen Ti who had the biggest reason to gripe about dubious
officiating during a heartbreaking 6-7 (9), 5-7, 6-1, 7-5, 6-4 loss to the
former Russian in the opening match of the Asia/Ocean Zone Group I tie in
Sinjhuang Gymnasium on Friday.</P>
      <P>Fortunately for the host, Wang Yeu-tzuoo brushed off plenty of rust and spotty
play to overcome Kazakhstan's top-ranked player, Andrey Golubev in surprisingly
easy fashion, 7-6 (4), 6-3, 6-2, to even the tie at one.</P>
      <P>Wang and Chen, who came into the tie with question marks hanging over them, were
forced to carry the load against Kazakhstan's Russian imports because Taiwan's
top player, Lu Yen-hsun pulled out of the encounter earlier in the week with a
knee injury.</P>
      <P>As truly remarkable as Wang's win was, considering he had been sidelined for
most of the past year with a wrist injury and did not seriously hit balls until
late November, the sheer drama and intensity of the day's opening match proved
even more memorable.</P>
      <P>The 375th-ranked  Chen had not played competitively  since November, preferring
to spend six weeks at a tennis academy in Florida to overhaul his game.</P>
      <P>The worked clearly paid off, as against an opponent ranked 230 places higher
than him, Chen showed off a more fluid serve that was actually a weapon rather
than a liability, and unprecedented passion for attacking tennis.</P>
      <P>He saved two set points in an 11-9 tiebreaker to win the first set and two break
points in the final game of the second set to take a two set to none lead.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kukushkin, who complained repeatedly about line calls and held a
healthy ongoing conversation with himself the first two sets, suddenly turned on
his powerful serve and forehand to run away with the third set.</P>
      <P>The Russian who became a Kazakhstan citizen last year then broke Chen's serve at
5-5 in the fourth and held serve easily to even the match.</P>
      <P>Chen hurt the right side of his abdomen and needed treatment before double
faulting on the final point in the fourth set's pivotal 11th game, and his
movement was clearly hindered in the deciding set.</P>
      <P>Yet Chen held his first two service games and seemed to be regaining some of his
earlier momentum against the tiring Kukushkin when the match's Indian referee
decided to cast his shadow over the affair with a decision that left the 25
-year-old Taiwanese incensed.</P>
      <P>Serving at 2-2 and 30-15, Chen won a rally to go up 40-15, but the referee
penalized Chen a point for unsportsmanlike conduct, apparently for motioning
with his racket that a ball was out before it was called.</P>
      <P>The incredibly rare call came after Chen had been given an earlier warning for
such behavior and reverted the game score to 30-30. Unable to regain his poise,
the agitated 25-year-old Taiwanese lost the next two points and the game.</P>
      <P>Kukushkin made the break stand up, winning his final three service games with
relative ease to clinch the match.</P>
      <P>Chen was again left furious, however, when, with Kukushkin serving at 30-0 in
the match's final game, the chair umpire overturned an out call on a serve that
television replays showed landed beyond the service line.</P>
      <P>The normally mild-mannered Chen was so angry that he did not show up for the
post match press conference.</P>
      <P>In the nightcap, Wang showed some of the form that propelled him to a ranking of
85 in 2006, but Golubev, reputed to be a big hitter who can be somewhat erratic,
helped with an impatient hit-or-miss strategy that saw him spray the ball around
the court without any consistency.</P>
      <P>After taking the first set tiebreaker with relative ease, Wang was rarely
troubled and effectively allowed the world No. 119, who also became a Kazakhstan
citizen last year, to self-destruct.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has tentatively scheduled the top ranked junior in 2008, Yang Tsung-hua,
to partner with doubles specialist Yi Chu-huan against Kazakhstan's Yuri Schukin
and Alexey Kedryuk in Saturday's pivotal doubles.</P>
      <P>The team captains can change the pairings up until one hour before the 1 p.m.
starting time.</P>
      <P>The tie is a preliminary Davis Cup encounter that will narrow Asia/Oceania Zone
Group I to eight teams. The winner of this weekend's tie, which will also
feature two singles matches on Sunday, will face India March 6-8, when Davis Cup
competition begins in earnest.</P>

      <P>There is no reason to be optimistic over the development of economic relations
with China in the first half of the year, a top security official suggested
Friday.</P>
      <P>Kao Chang, deputy secretary-general of the National Security Council, made the
remarks in an article on the outlook of the development of cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, which appeared in the latest edition of a monthly journal published
by the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), a quasi-official body set up to deal
with China in the absence of formal ties.</P>
      <P>"China's own economic situation and its policy toward Taiwan are the key factors
affecting the development of cross-strait economic relations," Kao said.</P>
      <P>"We have no reason to be optimistic in the first half of the year due to the
global financial crisis and China's economic slowdown," he said.</P>
      <P>"The development of the economic development in the second half will depend on
the global situation and China's economic situation, " he added.</P>
      <P>Kao said that China, in response to changes at home and abroad, has unveiled
since the beginning of 2007 new financial measures such as the Enterprise Tax
Law and Labor Contract Law, which he said has raised costs for Taiwanese
businessmen operating in China and squeezed their margins.</P>
      <P>Some Taiwanese businessmen have been forced to relocate or close their plants,
he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the global economic slowdown has yet to bottom out, and the
situation could even be exacerbated by the re-emergence of protectionism.</P>
      <P>"Since both Taiwan and China are export-oriented economies, they will not be
immune from the global economic slowdown," he added.</P>
      <P>Kao said that both Taiwan and China have taken a slew of measures to mitigate
the impact of the global economic tsunami.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China have signed six major agreements, including opening Taiwan to
more Chinese tourists and direct passenger and cargo charter flights, but the
impact of those deals will still be influenced by the world economic situation,
he added.</P>

      <P>The Taipei County government said Friday it will provide free shuttle bus
service on weekends from Feb. 7 to March 1 to take visitors to the Taipei Zoo to
six scenic areas in the county.</P>
      <P>The free shuttle bus program is apparently intended to take advantage of the
"panda fever" generated by a pair of giant pandas, "Tuan Tuan" and "Yuan Yuan,"
-- a gift to Taiwan from China -- to boost local tourism.</P>
      <P>Since Jan. 26, the first day of the Lunar New Year -- the Year of the Ox --
nearly 20,000 visitors from around Taiwan have flocked to the Taipei Zoo each
day to see the pair of giant pandas.</P>
      <P>To encourage the zoo visitors to see scenic spots in Taipei County after seeing
the pandas, the county government will offer free shuttle bus services to take
them to six popular destinations: Shenkeng, Shihding, Pingsi, Pinglin, Wulai and
Bitan (Green Lake) in Sindian City.</P>
      <P>Shenkeng is a small town of 50,000 people located south of Taipei City. It is
famous for a variety of tofu dishes and snacks.</P>
      <P>Shihding is a scenic mountain township in southern Taipei County. It is renowned
for hot springs, tea drinking, and a clean, beautiful river flowing through the
town.</P>
      <P>The rural township of Pingsi lies in the eastern part of Taipei County and is
served by the Pingsi Line of the Taiwan Railway Administration. The scenic area
has gained fame for the annual release of sky lanterns that takes place there,
but it is also well-known for tea drinking and the delicacies in local
restaurants.</P>
      <P>Pinglin, another rural township located in a mountainous area in southeastern
Taipei County, is the most famous place in Taiwan for producing Pouchong tea and
has the world's largest tea museum.</P>
      <P>Wulai is a mountain town in southern Taipei County renowned for its hot springs,
beautiful sceneries and aboriginal culture.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung county government has recently opened a "caddie training camp" as
part of its efforts to find jobless people in the county work and began
accepting applications for the program Friday.</P>
      <P>The training camp, which will be held from March 2 to April 9, was founded in
cooperation with private golf course operators in the southern Taiwan county.</P>
      <P>Those who participate in the training program and are certified will be offered
work at the courses, according to a county government statement released Friday.
There are currently 20 vacancies at five golf courses in the county.</P>
      <P>The trainees who perform well in the five-week training program will be able to
begin work immediately at the golf course they live closest to upon graduation,
the statement said.</P>
      <P>New caddies normally have to accept training for one or two months before
starting paid work at a salary of between NT$25,000 (US$741) and NT$35,000 per
month, the statement said. Senior caddies can earn up to NT$45,000 per month.</P>
      <P>Those who sign up for the camp only have to pay NT$2,989 for the course, with
the government subsidizing the balance of NT$14,947 in training fees.</P>
      <P>The trainees will be taught golf etiquette and the rules of the game and will
learn about golf courses, golf clubs, and how to keep physically fit.</P>
      <P>Unemployed individuals with a household registration in the county are eligible
to apply for the caddie training program, the statement said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ex-lawmaker's elections formally annulled over citizenship issue</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) formally revoked Friday its declarations
of former Kuomintang Legislator Lee Ching-an's previous election wins after
determining that she held dual citizenship between 1991 and Feb. 1, 2005.</P>
      <P>The commission revoked its declaration of Lee's election as a member of the
seventh Taipei City Council and of the fourth, fifth and sixth Legislative Yuan
and annulled all relevant election certificates she received.</P>
      <P>CEC commissioners met in the afternoon to discuss Lee's suspected "dual
citizenship" and whether her election to public offices prior to 2008 should be
nullified.</P>
      <P>According to CEC Secretary-General Teng Tien-yow, commissioners were divided on
Lee's citizenship status and a vote was held as the last resort, in which eight
commissioners voted against Lee and three voted otherwise.</P>
      <P>As to whether the CEC will ask the city council and the legislature to demand
Lee return to the national coffers over NT$100 million she received in
compensation, Teng said the CEC is not authorized to do so and that the issue
should be left to the two institutions to decide.</P>
      <P>Teng further said that if Lee disagrees with the CEC's ruling, she is entitled
to seek administrative remedies.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-an, who was sworn in for a fourth legislative term Feb. 1, 2008, was
found the following month to have never formally renounced her U.S. citizenship,
even though she had held public office in Taiwan since 1994.</P>
      <P>She resigned Jan. 8 as a member of the seventh Legislative Yuan just as
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) politicians were promoting a
campaign to recall her and pro-DPP civic groups were preparing to besiege the
legislature to protest the lawmaking body's failure to act against her.</P>
      <P>In addition to obtaining U.S. documents related to Lee's U.S. citizenship, Teng
said the CEC also asked the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)  about U.S.  laws
and regulations concerning the acquisition and loss of U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Teng said, the CEC asked the U.S. Department of State through the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in December about Lee's U.S. citizenship status and
the ministry passed the State Department's response to the CEC Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Teng,  the State Department has completed an administrative
screening of Lee's status as a U.S. citizen and concluded that Lee did not
fulfill her obligation of committing an expatriating  act with the intent  of
relinquishing  her U.S. citizenship when she first assumed public office in
Taiwan back in 1994.</P>
      <P>At Friday's meeting, the CEC presented all three documents to commissioners for
reference.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-an's lawyer Lee Yung-jan attended the CEC meeting, in which he
reiterated his client's claim that her U.S. citizenship was automatically
canceled when she took the oath of allegiance to the Republic of China by
assuming the post of Taipei City councilor in 1994.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lee Yung-jan argued that the CEC is not eligible to nullify Lee's
previous election certificates because her previous terms of office already
expired. The attorney insisted that only judicial authorities are entitled to
judge on the controversy over Lee's citizenship dispute.</P>
      <P>Calls for Lee to be formally relieved of her seat mounted after U.S.
authorities, in response to an inquiry from Taiwan, confirmed in late 2008 that
Lee "has previously been documented as a U.S. citizen with a U.S. passport and
that no subsequent loss of U.S. citizenship has been documented."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Nationality Act requires public officials holding dual citizenship to
surrender their foreign citizenship before assuming public office and to obtain
a certificate as proof within one year of taking office.</P>
      <P>The law also requires that those officials who retain foreign citizenship be
removed from their posts.</P>
      <P>A group of DPP legislators have filed a complaint with the Taipei District
Prosecutors Office accusing Lee of forgery and fraud.</P>
      <P>The legislators alleged that by holding dual citizenship while in public office,
Lee defrauded the public coffers of over NT$100 million in salary as a Taipei
City councilor between 1994 and 1998 and as a legislator from 1999 to 2009, and
they demanded that she return the "illicit gains."</P>
      <P>Lee has been barred from leaving Taiwan pending prosecutorial investigations
into fraud and forgery allegations against her.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet expects to create more jobs this year to help combat the rising
number of the unemployed, an economic planning official said Friday.</P>
      <P>San Gee, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development,
said the number of created jobs will be increased to 330,000 this year as he
unveiled the details of a new economic stimulus plan discussed in a meeting
presided over by Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung.</P>
      <P>San noted that the Cabinet has mapped out its economic stimulus plan based on
four considerations -- reducing layoffs, increasing employment and domestic
demand, and caring for the underprivileged.</P>
      <P>"Under the economic stimulus plan, the Cabinet is expected to spend NT$715.1
billion between 2009 and 2012, " San said, with spending in 2009 set at NT$330
billion.</P>
      <P>The 2009 funding will be primarily earmarked for new public construction
projects,  short-term jobs,  consumption vouchers, subsidies for low wage
earners, tax cuts and training courses for those on unpaid leave.</P>
      <P>The estimated outlay for increased public construction projects will be NT$133.1
billion.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet recently said that its economic stimulus plan can create 150,000
additional job opportunities, but the number was increased to 330,000 Friday.</P>
      <P>San said a program to cultivate superior manpower will add 69,000 new jobs
alone.</P>
      <P>"The program is aimed at solving the unemployment problem for college
graduates," he added.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, college graduates will receive training in enterprises,
conduct research projects and take part in public services.</P>
      <P>The program will offer 35,000 internships in local enterprises for unemployed
college graduates who got their degrees between 2006 and 2008, at a monthly
salary ranging from NT$22,000 to NT$35,000.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs and the National Science Council will offer the
same monthly pay to college graduates serving as assistants in research
projects.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet expects to create more jobs this year to help combat the rising
number of the unemployed, an economic planning official said Friday.</P>
      <P>San Gee, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development,
said the number of created jobs will be increased to 330,000 this year as he
unveiled the details of a new economic stimulus plan discussed in a meeting
presided over by Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung.</P>
      <P>San noted that the Cabinet has mapped out its economic stimulus plan based on
four considerations -- reducing layoffs, increasing employment and domestic
demand, and caring for the underprivileged.</P>
      <P>"Under the economic stimulus plan, the Cabinet is expected to spend NT$715.1
billion between 2009 and 2012, " San said, with spending in 2009 set at NT$330
billion.</P>
      <P>The 2009 funding will be primarily earmarked for new public construction
projects,  short-term jobs,  consumption vouchers, subsidies for low wage
earners, tax cuts and training courses for those on unpaid leave.</P>
      <P>The estimated outlay for increased public construction projects will be NT$133.1
billion.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet recently said that its economic stimulus plan can create 150,000
additional job opportunities, but the number was increased to 330,000 Friday.</P>
      <P>San said a program to cultivate superior manpower will add 69,000 new jobs
alone.</P>
      <P>"The program is aimed at solving the unemployment problem for college
graduates," he added.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, college graduates will receive training in enterprises,
conduct research projects and take part in public services.</P>
      <P>The program will offer 35,000 internships in local enterprises for unemployed
college graduates who got their degrees between 2006 and 2008, at a monthly
salary ranging from NT$22,000 to NT$35,000.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs and the National Science Council will offer the

society in which men must pretend to possess what they really do not possess;
pretend to have plenty, when they have really nothing; and pretend to be in
affluence when they are in actual want -- in such a state of society, it is
difficult to be even a scrupulous man."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Ex-lawmaker's elections formally annulled over citizenship issue</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6 (CNA)
02/07/09  11:54:24

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) formally revoked Friday its declarations
of former Kuomintang Legislator Lee Ching-an's previous election wins after
determining that she held dual citizenship between 1991 and Feb. 1, 2005.</P>
      <P>The commission revoked its declaration of Lee's election as a member of the
seventh Taipei City Council and of the fourth, fifth and sixth Legislative Yuan
and annulled all relevant election certificates she received.</P>
      <P>CEC commissioners met in the afternoon to discuss Lee's suspected "dual
citizenship" and whether her election to public offices prior to 2008 should be
nullified.</P>
      <P>According to CEC Secretary-General Teng Tien-yow, commissioners were divided on
Lee's citizenship status and a vote was held as the last resort, in which eight
commissioners voted against Lee and three voted otherwise.</P>
      <P>As to whether the CEC will ask the city council and the legislature to demand
Lee return to the national coffers over NT$100 million she received in
compensation, Teng said the CEC is not authorized to do so and that the issue
should be left to the two institutions to decide.</P>
      <P>Teng further said that if Lee disagrees with the CEC's ruling, she is entitled
to seek administrative remedies.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-an, who was sworn in for a fourth legislative term Feb. 1, 2008, was
found the following month to have never formally renounced her U.S. citizenship,
even though she had held public office in Taiwan since 1994.</P>
      <P>She resigned Jan. 8 as a member of the seventh Legislative Yuan just as
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) politicians were promoting a
campaign to recall her and pro-DPP civic groups were preparing to besiege the
legislature to protest the lawmaking body's failure to act against her.</P>
      <P>In addition to obtaining U.S. documents related to Lee's U.S. citizenship, Teng
said the CEC also asked the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)  about U.S.  laws
and regulations concerning the acquisition and loss of U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Teng said, the CEC asked the U.S. Department of State through the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in December about Lee's U.S. citizenship status and
the ministry passed the State Department's response to the CEC Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Teng,  the State Department has completed an administrative
screening of Lee's status as a U.S. citizen and concluded that Lee did not
fulfill her obligation of committing an expatriating  act with the intent  of
relinquishing  her U.S. citizenship when she first assumed public office in
Taiwan back in 1994.</P>
      <P>At Friday's meeting, the CEC presented all three documents to commissioners for
reference.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-an's lawyer Lee Yung-jan attended the CEC meeting, in which he
reiterated his client's claim that her U.S. citizenship was automatically
canceled when she took the oath of allegiance to the Republic of China by
assuming the post of Taipei City councilor in 1994.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lee Yung-jan argued that the CEC is not eligible to nullify Lee's
previous election certificates because her previous terms of office already
expired. The attorney insisted that only judicial authorities are entitled to
judge on the controversy over Lee's citizenship dispute.</P>
      <P>Calls for Lee to be formally relieved of her seat mounted after U.S.
authorities, in response to an inquiry from Taiwan, confirmed in late 2008 that
Lee "has previously been documented as a U.S. citizen with a U.S. passport and
that no subsequent loss of U.S. citizenship has been documented."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Nationality Act requires public officials holding dual citizenship to
surrender their foreign citizenship before assuming public office and to obtain
a certificate as proof within one year of taking office.</P>
      <P>The law also requires that those officials who retain foreign citizenship be
removed from their posts.</P>
      <P>A group of DPP legislators have filed a complaint with the Taipei District
Prosecutors Office accusing Lee of forgery and fraud.</P>
      <P>The legislators alleged that by holding dual citizenship while in public office,
Lee defrauded the public coffers of over NT$100 million in salary as a Taipei
City councilor between 1994 and 1998 and as a legislator from 1999 to 2009, and
they demanded that she return the "illicit gains."</P>
      <P>Lee has been barred from leaving Taiwan pending prosecutorial investigations
into fraud and forgery allegations against her.</P>

      <P>There is no reason to be optimistic over the development of economic relations
with China in the first half of the year, a top security official suggested
Friday.</P>
      <P>Kao Chang, deputy secretary-general of the National Security Council, made the
remarks in an article on the outlook of the development of cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, which appeared in the latest edition of a monthly journal published
by the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), a quasi-official body set up to deal
with China in the absence of formal ties.</P>
      <P>"China's own economic situation and its policy toward Taiwan are the key factors
affecting the development of cross-strait economic relations," Kao said.</P>
      <P>"We have no reason to be optimistic in the first half of the year due to the
global financial crisis and China's economic slowdown," he said.</P>
      <P>"The development of the economic development in the second half will depend on
the global situation and China's economic situation, " he added.</P>
      <P>Kao said that China, in response to changes at home and abroad, has unveiled
since the beginning of 2007 new financial measures such as the Enterprise Tax
Law and Labor Contract Law, which he said has raised costs for Taiwanese
businessmen operating in China and squeezed their margins.</P>
      <P>Some Taiwanese businessmen have been forced to relocate or close their plants,
he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the global economic slowdown has yet to bottom out, and the
situation could even be exacerbated by the re-emergence of protectionism.</P>
      <P>"Since both Taiwan and China are export-oriented economies, they will not be
immune from the global economic slowdown," he added.</P>
      <P>Kao said that both Taiwan and China have taken a slew of measures to mitigate
the impact of the global economic tsunami.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China have signed six major agreements, including opening Taiwan to
more Chinese tourists and direct passenger and cargo charter flights, but the
impact of those deals will still be influenced by the world economic situation,
he added.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung county government has recently opened a "caddie training camp" as
part of its efforts to find jobless people in the county work and began
accepting applications for the program Friday.</P>
      <P>The training camp, which will be held from March 2 to April 9, was founded in
cooperation with private golf course operators in the southern Taiwan county.</P>
      <P>Those who participate in the training program and are certified will be offered
work at the courses, according to a county government statement released Friday.
There are currently 20 vacancies at five golf courses in the county.</P>
      <P>The trainees who perform well in the five-week training program will be able to
begin work immediately at the golf course they live closest to upon graduation,
the statement said.</P>
      <P>New caddies normally have to accept training for one or two months before
starting paid work at a salary of between NT$25,000 (US$741) and NT$35,000 per
month, the statement said. Senior caddies can earn up to NT$45,000 per month.</P>
      <P>Those who sign up for the camp only have to pay NT$2,989 for the course, with
the government subsidizing the balance of NT$14,947 in training fees.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's representative to the European Union and Belgium called on the group
Friday to support Taiwan's bid to take part in the World Health Organization
(WHO) and allow the country to contribute its part to the international
community.</P>
      <P>Making the call during a speech to the Association of European Journalists, Shen
Lyushun said Taiwan should at least be granted observer status in the WHO in
order to substantiate its "meaningful participation" in the world body.</P>
      <P>Shen told his audience that despite its small size, Taiwan's gross domestic
product (GDP) is half as much as that of Canada.</P>
      <P>Its GDP is also one-eighth that of China, despite China being many times larger
than Taiwan, he noted.</P>
      <P>Further pointing to Taiwan's role in international trade, Shen said Taiwan is
the 13th-largest trade partner of the European Union behind South Africa and
EU's 12th-largest source of imports behind India.</P>
      <P>According to Shen, following the recent improvement in Taiwan's relations with
China and the establishment of several important agreements between them, Taiwan
can play a role in helping the Europen Union advance its ties with China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which enjoys preferential trade treatment from China in certain areas
and is very familiar with China's way of doing business, can also provide
assistance to EU enterprises intending to do business in China, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shen stressed his mission is to build up mutual trust and mutual
understanding between Taiwan and the European Union, rather than causing trouble
between the European Union and China.</P>

      <P>The "Ma La Sun" millet wine made famous by Taiwan's blockbuster hit "Cape No. 7"
has made inroads into China's market even before the movie opens there on Feb.
14.</P>
      <P>The millet wine producer, the Shinyi Hsiang Farmers' Association from Nantou
County in central Taiwan, has already begun exporting the liquor to a Xiamen-
based trading company that is serving as its exclusive distributor in China.</P>
      <P>Jin Jun, the deputy general manager of the trading company, told the Central
News Agency Saturday that the company hopes "Cape No. 7," which recounts the
unwavering pursuit of music, dreams and love and showcases the breathtaking
landscape of southern Taiwan, can also rock the hearts of Chinese audiences.</P>
      <P>The Ma La Sun millet wine went on sale in China on Jan. 8 and proved to be a hit
in the market over the traditional Lunar New Year holiday, Jin said.</P>
      <P>The limited number of available bottles triggered panic buying among local
stores and enterprises, he said, and he hoped that the movie's premiere in China
on Feb. 14 would launch a second wave of demand.</P>
      <P>The popular millet wine, a traditional beverage among Taiwan's indigenous
people, costs 380 yuan (NT$1,870 or US$55.6) per 500 ml bottle.</P>
      <P>The low-budget Cape No. 7 unexpectedly became the most popular Taiwanese-
produced movie in history, pulling in more than NT$530 million in Taiwan's
theaters.</P>

Goethe Institute, said that under the "Book Translation Grant, publishers will
receive subsidies of 50 percent to 90 percent of their translation costs for
translations of German books published in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although all types of books are welcome, he stressed that contemporary German
literature and topics such as contemporary German history, cultural aspects of
the ongoing European unification and current regional and global issues will
receive preference when considering grants.</P>
      <P>Whether the authors of the chosen books enjoy fame in Germany and whether they
can be distributed in Hong Kong and China will also be taken into consideration,
Hasse said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the import of German literature into Taiwan, Hasse said the
export of Taiwan's literary culture to Germany is equally important and can
happen through means such as inviting Taiwanese writers to visit the European
country for a cultural dialogue.</P>
      <P>According to the German Cultural Center, the Goethe Institute's representative
in Taiwan, four German books have been translated and introduced to the local
market under the program over the past two years, including the workSchilf, "
written by Juli Zeh and translated by Wei Tang.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based German Cultural Center encourages publishers who are interested
in applying for the grant to log onto the Web site

      <P>Taiwan's women held on to their position in the Federation Cup's Asia/Oceania
Group I Saturday after defeating India 3-0 in a relegation battle.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Hwang I-hsuan defeated Rushmi Chakravarthi 6-2, 7-5 in the day's
opening singles and Chan Chin-wei clinched the victory with a 7-5, 6-1 thumping
of Ankita Bhambri.</P>
      <P>In the inconsequential doubles match, Chan and Chuang Chia-jung easily toppled
Ankita Bhambri and her sister Sanaa 6-4, 6-2 to complete the whitewash.</P>
      <P>With the loss, India will be relegated to the Fed Cup's Asia/Oceania Group II in
next year's competition, while Taiwan will remain in Group I, where it has
resided every year but one (1996) since the competition adopted its current
structure in 1992.</P>
      <P>Much like the Davis Cup, the Federation Cup is divided into tiers, with
countries vying for promotion to a higher tier on a yearly basis in the hope of
reaching the competition's highest level, the World Group, and the second
highest level, World Group II.</P>
      <P>Asia/Oceania Group 1, composed of eight teams, was divided into two groups this
past week in Perth, Australia, with each four-country group playing round
robins.</P>
      <P>The winners of the two groups then battled Saturday for a chance to advance to
the World Group II playoffs, while the losers faced a relegation battle.</P>
      <P>Having lost 3-0 to Thailand and Australia and 2-1 to South Korea in Group B
round robin play, Taiwan needed to defeat India, the last-place finisher in
Group A, to remain in Asia/Oceania Group I.</P>
      <P>Both Taiwan and India were missing their top players, with Chan Yung-jan and
Hsieh Su-wei pulling out with injuries for Taiwan, and Sania Mirza and Sunitha
Rao missing for India.</P>
      <P>In the group winners final, Australia beat New Zealand 3-0 to advance to the
World Group II playoffs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ex-legislator to appeal CEC ruling on her dual citizenship status</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
02/07/09  17:24:56

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Kuomintang Legislator Lee Ching-an will appeal the Central Election
Commission's (CEC's) recent ruling to annul four of her previous election wins
because she held dual citizenship, Lee's attorney said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lawyer Lee Yung-jan argued that the ruling was "illegal" because only a court,
rather than the CEC, has the jurisdiction to make a judgment on a dual
citizenship dispute involving an elected official.</P>
      <P>On a demand by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that Lee Ching-
an be ordered to return the compensation she received during her time in public
office, her lawyer argued that this was not an issue because the money was paid
for her services in office, not "illicit gains" as the opposition has claimed.</P>
      <P>On Friday, the CEC revoked its declaration of Lee Ching-an's election as a
member of the seventh Taipei City Council and of the fourth, fifth and sixth
Legislative Yuan and annulled all relevant election certificates she received
from 1994 to 2005.</P>
      <P>The CEC action, however, did not cover her election to the seventh Legislative
Yuan in 2008, a post she resigned amid mounting public pressure on Jan. 8, 2009
-- nearly one year after it was discovered that she had never formally
relinquished  her U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Nationality Act requires those holding dual citizenship to surrender
their foreign citizenship before assuming public office.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-an insisted that she was awaiting a retroactive ruling by U.S.
authorities on her status, after contending that holding public office in
another country was an expatriating act that automatically nullified her U.S.
citizenship.</P>
      <P>A group of DPP legislators have filed a complaint with the Taipei District
Prosecutors Office accusing Lee of forgery and fraud.</P>
      <P>The legislators alleged that by holding dual citizenship while in public office,
Lee defrauded public coffers of over NT$100 million in salary as a Taipei City
councilor between 1994 and 1998 and as a legislator from 1999 to 2009, and they
demanded that she return the "illicit gains."</P>
      <P>Lee has been barred from leaving Taiwan pending prosecutorial investigations.</P>
      <P>Lai Ching-te, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, said Saturday that his
caucus will continue to press the Legislative Yuan to reclaim Lee's salary based
on the CEC ruling.</P>
      <P>However, Yang Chiung-ying, a leader of the KMT caucus that holds a two-thirds
majority in the lawmaking body, argued that the Legislative Yuan is not in a
position to deal with the matter now that Lee Ching-an is no longer a
legislator.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei City Council Speaker Wu Pi-chu said the council will not take
the initiative to reclaim the salary Lee Ching-an received while serving in that
body more than a decade ago.</P>
      <P>The council would do so only if the Executive Yuan, based on the CEC ruling,
decided that the salary should be returned and requested the council to help
recover the sum, Wu said.</P>

      <P>Youth -- and a helpful line umpire -- overcame experience Saturday as Taiwan
moved to within one win of taking a preliminary round Davis Cup Asia/Oceania
Zone Group I tie against Kazakhstan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's 21-year-old Yi Chu-huan and 17-year-old Yang Tsung-hua, with a combined
six Davis Cup matches between them, held off the stubborn challenge of veteran
Alexey Kedryuk, who was playing in his 98th Davis Cup match, and 29-year-old
Russian import Yuri Schukin, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (6), 7-6 (4), 6-4.</P>
      <P>The rare doubles win, only Taiwan's second in nine Davis Cup ties since 2005,
gives the host a huge advantage ahead of Sunday's reverse singles, in which it
will only have to take one of the two matches to capture the best-of-five match
tie.</P>
      <P>On a fast surface that clearly favored the server, Saturday's match was decided
by a brilliant performance from Yi, who aside from losing two points on his
serve in the first tiebreaker, delivered at crucial moments.</P>
      <P>Yi was only on the squad as a replacement for the injured Lu Yen-hsun, but team
captain Lien Yu-hui made him responsible for leading the younger Yang through
the match, a responsibility Yi welcomed.</P>
      <P>"I focused hard on every single point, " said the normally easily distracted Yi,
none more so than with Taiwan down 2-5 in the second set tiebreaker and the
match seemingly sliding away.</P>
      <P>After getting a huge gift when Schukin pushed out an easy forehand volley that
would have given the Kazakhs four set points, Yi hit a service winner and then
pulled his side even with a gorgeous topspin lob that froze the Kazakhs at the
net.</P>
      <P>Kedryuk then gave the visitors a set point with an overhead, but two consecutive
winners at the net by an aggressive Yi reversed the tide, and Taiwan took the
set when Schukin could not handle an Yi return of serve.</P>
      <P>"At that point in the second set, I figured we had nothing to lose and just
decided to go for it, " said Yi, who has endured a frustrating two years of poor
results, in part because of a lack of dedication, and is hoping Saturday's win
will get his young career back on track.</P>
      <P>But after Kazakhstan lost the third set tiebreaker, it seemed ready to reverse
the momentum by putting pressure on Yang's serve in the first game of the
ensuing set.</P>
      <P>Facing his second break point in the game, Yang sent a backhand passing shot
that seemed to hit just beyond the baseline according to television replays, but
the ball was called in, giving Taiwan's duo new life.</P>
      <P>An agitated Kedryuk immediately protested to the chair umpire that Yang's shot
was out by a foot -- about an 11 1/2 inch exaggeration -- but the chair umpire
did not overturn the call.</P>
      <P>Considering that there had been no breaks of serve and only four break points to
that point in the match, the call was a huge blow to Kazakhstan, and left the
team outraged, similar to Taiwan's Chen Ti aday earlier after being done in by
an unusual penalty point against him.</P>
      <P>Still, the Kazakhs earned another break opportunity in the game, saved by Yang
with a blistering serve that Schukin could not return.</P>
      <P>It was not until the final game of the match that either team had its serve
broken.</P>
      <P>Kedryuk, who surpassed the talent for histrionics displayed by teammate Mikhail
Kukushkin a day earlier with his accomplished racket throwing and gestures of
anguish at every missed shot, was broken at love when Schukin volleyed a return
by Yi long.</P>
      <P>In Sunday's reverse singles, beginning at 1 p.m. at Sinjhuang Gymnasium in
Taipei County, Wang Yeu-tzuoo will face Kukushkin. If he does not win, it will
be up to Chen Ti to come through against world No. 119 Andrey Golubev, who was
wildly erratic against Wang on Friday.</P>
      <P>The winner of the tie will face India in March.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's representative to Singapore on Saturday expressed the hope that
Taiwanese businessmen in the city state will return to Taiwan to invest there.</P>
      <P>Vanessa Yea-ping Shih noted that President  Ma Ying-jeou's administration has
announced a series of policies to ease trade restrictions with China, which has
led to a thaw in cross-Taiwan Strait ties that grew chilly under the previous
administration.</P>
      <P>Ma's administration has also implemented several pro-business policies and
measures to encourage investment, Shih said, and she expressed the hope that the
businessmen would relocate and set up their headquarters in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks when she met with Taiwanese expatriates during  a spring

      <P>The former head of the Government Information Office lauded the expatriates for
serving as "unofficial diplomats" in promoting bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>On the diplomatic front, Shih said that she would adopt a "pragmatic and
positive" manner in strengthening bilateral ties between Taiwan and Singapore.</P>
      <P>She also handed out red envelopes with a written greeting from President Ma

    <HEADLINE>Once a local god, Master Handan now a protected cultural asset</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
02/07/09  19:30:02

    <TEXT>
      <P>There are many unverifiable legends to explain why Taitung County people
celebrate the annual Lantern Festival by throwing firecrackers at a shirtless
man playing "Master Handan, " but what is certain is that the ritual has evolved
into a tresured cultural event.</P>
      <P>The county government registered the ritual of "bombarding Master Handan" --
held to coincide with the Lantern Festival -- as an intangible cultural asset in
2008, after it was recognized as a local folk activity that contributes
significantly to tourism.</P>
      <P>Taitung's firecracker blitzkrieg has become one of the most representative
traditional ceremonies marking the end of the Lunar New Year season in Taiwan,
along with the launch of sky lanterns in Taipei County's Pingsi township and the
setting off of a beehive of firecrackers in Yanshuei township in Tainan County.</P>
      <P>What is known is that shirtless locals have been bombarded with firecrackers
since the Japanese colonial era, but how the ritual gained traction is the stuff
of legend.</P>
      <P>One version claims that it grew popular by helping rid Taitung of infectious
diseases plaguing the area during that time.</P>
      <P>After Master Handan was brought out at Lantern Festival time to expel evil
spirits while offering blessings to believers, the epidemics came under control,
leading to the yearly ritual worshiping of the deity.</P>
      <P>Scientists believe that the heat and thick smoke filling the sky from the
bombardment of firecrackers may have actually stemmed the spread of dangerous
bacteria.</P>
      <P>But who is Master Handan?</P>
      <P>According to some cultural historians, Handan is a god of wealth who cannot
resist the cold. Throwing firecrackers at him can drive the chill from his body
during his procession, and the more firecrackers onlookers set off, the more
successful and wealthy they will become.</P>
      <P>During the ceremony, a chosen person (normally a male) dressed up as Master
Handan but bare-chested, stands on a sedan chair in a parade, waiting for
worshipers to throw firecrackers at him. The man can only use a banyan branch to
protect himself.</P>
      <P>Another version of history suggests Master Handan was the god of gangsters and
hooligans, who used firecrackers to demonstrate his power.</P>
      <P>In the 1970s and 1980s, the Handan role was often assumed by a local organized
crime head, with some suggesting that the "bombarding Handan" ritual actually
turned into a contest among leaders of rival factions to decide who would become
the big boss.</P>
      <P>Whoever endured the bombardment the longest took over as gang leader.</P>
      <P>That practice, however, drew Taitung police to ban the ritual in 1984, and
leaders of local gangs were then sent to jail during raids on organized crime
syndicates.</P>
      <P>In 1989, then Legislator Yao Eng-chi pushed to revive the traditional
celebration, and since then, the ceremony has been transformed from a power
struggle among gangsters into an economic indicator.</P>
      <P>Business owners have used the activity to demonstrate the success of their
enterprise over the past year, with some spending up to NT$200,000 on
firecrackers used to bombard Master Handan when he passes their stores.</P>
      <P>Now one of Taitung County's main draws, the unique ceremony has had diverse
meanings in different eras, but the ceremony itself has remained the same over
time, making it one of Taiwan's most enduring displays of local folklore.</P>

      <P>Winning an election is very important, but candidates should not pursue victory
at the cost of their characters, Kuomintang Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at a Chinese New Year reception hosted by the party's Taipei
Chapter at a time when five KMT Taipei City councilors are vying for the party's
nomination in a legislative by-election in the city's Daan District.</P>
      <P>Three of the five hopefuls showed up at the reception to solicit votes in the
party's primary, which will be held Sunday to help choose the party's nominee.</P>
      <P>The notable absentee was Councilor Ching Li-fan, who has had a libel complaint
filed against her by KMT colleague Lin Yi-hua after Ching claimed that Lin
engaged in vote-buying during the primary campaign.</P>
      <P>Wu urged the party members to unite together in the by-election, and urged them
not to "do anything to the detriment of your beloved and to the pleasure of your
foes."</P>
      <P>"Taipei voters are quiet knowledgeable and won't buy dirty tricks. We can't
afford to win the election at the cost of our characters." Wu said.</P>
      <P>After a political career spanning several decades, Wu said he had seen many
candidates betrayed by their selfishness and evil in fierce election campaigns.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that he was forced to give up his attempt to run for the post of Taiwan
provincial governor in 1994 after the KMT fielded party bigwig James Soong in
the race, "but I have kept my friendship with James Soong intact."</P>
      <P>Soong who was elected governor that year, was widely believed to have earned the
KMT nomination because of behind the scenes support from then-KMT Chairman Lee
Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Soong later fell out of Lee's graces and ran against Lee's hand-picked
successor, Lien Chan, in the 2000 presidential election, only to yield victory
to DPP candidate Chen Shui-bian by splitting KMT supporters.</P>
      <P>"Now, I'm not any worse off than he is, " Wu said, referring to Soong who left
the KMT to found his own People First Party after 2000 and quit politics after
2008 after incorporating his party into the KMT.</P>
      <P>Pan Jia-sen, chief of the KMT Taipei Chapter, urged the party members at the
reception to "forgive whatever grief which might have been caused during the
primary campaign and unite behind the candidate who emerges victorious.</P>
      <P>Sunday's primary vote will only account for 30 percent of the candidates'
overall support in the selection of the KMT nominee, with the other 70 percent
decided by an opinion pole carried out between Feb. 5-7.</P>
      <P>The winner will be announced by the KMT Taipei Chapter on Feb. 9 and will be
nominated on Feb. 11 after being approved by the party authorities.</P>
      <P>The by-election, to be held on March 28, will choose a lawmaker to fill the
vacancy left by KMT Legislator Lee Ching-an, who quit her post on Jan. 8 after
she was reported to hold U.S. citizenship. Elected officials in Taiwan are not
allowed to hold dual nationality.</P>
      <P>Given that Daan District is a traditional KMT stronghold, whoever wins the
nomination will be a heavy favorite on election day.</P>

attracting over 300 fans.</P>
      <P>In the speech, Yen described Taiwan as one of the most civilized Chinese

20 percent of the knowledge and proper training in school that will make them a

understanding."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>New private investment in 2008 beats target: economics ministry</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>New investment commitments from the private sector last year exceeded the
government target of NT$1.08 trillion (US$32.09 billion) by 0.76 percent, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>As of the end of last December, a total of 1,427 new investment projects worth
NT$1.0882 trillion were approved by the ministry for the whole of 2008,
according to the MOEA.</P>
      <P>Some NT$1.13 trillion in investment projects were actually completed during the
year, part of that from ventures committed to in 2007.</P>
      <P>The government has set a slightly lower target for new private investment in
2009 at NT$1.001 trillion, hoping measures approved last year to relax
investment restrictions and increase incentives for new ventures will spur
private investment amid a weak economy, MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has promoted 12 major national development projects in
the past year that the government also hopes will stimulate private sector
investment and sustain growth to help Taiwan snap out of the recession.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan promotes tourism at New York Times Travel Show</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  Feb. 7 (CNA)

(By Lillian Lin and Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is hoping that its presence at the 2009 New York Times Travel Show, being
held until Feb. 8 at Jacob K. Javits Convention  Center,  will help counter  a
slowdown  in international travel that is hurting the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Held in early-February every year, the show is one of the most important travel
exhibitions in the world. This year, it has brought together exhibitors from
more than 100 countries to man over 500 booths.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications has a
presence at the show, showcasing Taiwan's tourist attractions in three booths
covering 100 square feet.</P>
      <P>To give viewers an insight into Taiwan's culture, the bureau has arranged
special events during the show, including a folk dance performance and
demonstrations of tea brewing and paper cutting.</P>
      <P>A group of New York-based Taiwanese teenagers is slated to stage a dance on Feb.
7 and Feb. 8, respectively, to help attract visitors to the Taiwan booths.</P>
      <P>With unique souvenirs from around the world a main attraction for many show
visitors, the bureau has also prepared 100 ox-shaped lanterns marking the Year
of the Ox as giveaways.</P>
      <P>Local carriers China Airlines and EVA Airways and major tour operators Asia
Pacific Delight Tours, Celebrity Tours and SITA World Tours are also offering a
wide array of travel packages and discounts to catch the attention of visitors.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the Tourism Bureau's New York office has invited U.S. travel columnist
Barry Goldsmith, who just concluded a visit to Taiwan, to share his experience
and introduce Taiwan's arts, natural beauty, folklore, customs and cuisine in a
Q&amp;A format.</P>
      <P>The World Tourism Organization reported last week that global tourism could
decline by up to 2 percent in 2009 amid the global slowdown. It said tourist
arrivals worldwide during 2008 rose to 924 million, 2 percent higher than the
previous year.</P>
      <P>The downturn nonetheless had a negative effect on the sector in 2008 as the 2
percent growth rate fell far below the 7 percent average annual growth seen
between 2004 and 2007, according to the organization.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP names Taipei City councilor to run in by-election</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 8 (CNA)
02/08/09  17:07:30
(By Deborah Ku)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) announced Sunday that Taipei
City Councilor Chou Po-ya will represent the party in a legislative by-election
to fill the seat vacated by a ruling Kuomintang (KMT)  legislator over a dual
citizenship controversy.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said Chou, who is well versed on education and
financial issues,  is the right choice for the legislative by-election in Taipei
City's Daan district,  where education and financial issues have been key points
of debate and attention.</P>
      <P>Tsai said she appreciated Chou's personality traits, pointing out that he is
"constantly progressive, " concerned about human rights and environmental
protection, and always keeps up with changes, but never blindly follows a crowd.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chou said he feels honored to be nominated by the DPP but
considers it a major responsibility.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP does not hold any of the eight seats representing Taipei
City in the legislature, Chou said the Daan district by-election comes at a
crucial juncture for the DPP and gives Taipei residents a chance to make a new,
fresh choice.</P>
      <P>He contended that in the face of the KMT's one-party dominance in the
legislature, the DPP must "stand out" courageously and not miss any chance to
optimize the DPP's influence as an opposition party.</P>
      <P>If Chou wins the by-election, he will increase the number of DPP seats in the
legislature to 28.</P>
      <P>There are currently 111 legislators in the lawmaking body. A by-election will be
held on March 14 in Miaoli County to fill a seat vacated by a KMT legislator
convicted of vote buying.</P>
      <P>Once Lee's former seat is filled in the March 28 by-election, the legislature
will be returned to its full complement  of 113 lawmarkers.</P>
      <P>The ruling KMT is holding a primary this weekend to determine its candidate to
oppose Chou in the pro-KMT stronghold.</P>
      <P>Lee,  a KMT legislator from 1999 to 2009,  announced her resignation from the
legislature Jan. 8, citing the dispute over her alleged dual citizenship.</P>
      <P>Her resignation came after DPP politicians promoted a campaign to recall her and
pro-DPP civic groups prepared  to besiege the legislature to protest the
lawmaking body's failure to act against her.</P>
      <P>According to the current Public Officials Election and Recall Law, a by-election
has to be held in Taipei City's Daan district within three months to elect a
replacement to fill the position vacated by Lee.</P>
      <P>Lee, who was sworn in for a fourth legislative term Feb. 1, 2008, was found the
following month to have never formally renounced her U.S. citizenship, even
though she had held public office in Taiwan since 1994.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Nationality Act requires public officials holding dual citizenship to
surrender their foreign citizenship before assuming public office and to obtain
a certificate as proof within one year of taking office.</P>
      <P>The law also requires that those officials who retain foreign citizenship be
removed from their posts.</P>
      <P>Lee has been barred from leaving Taiwan pending an investigation into fraud and
forgery allegations against her.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President pushes to boost tourism in Taiwan's indigenous areas</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Concerned over the development of tourism in Taiwan's indigenous areas,
President Ma Ying-jeou asked government agencies Sunday to work with travel
agents and arrange for more Chinese tourists to visit local tribes.</P>
      <P>Ma instructed the Cabinet-level Council of Indigenous Peoples and the Tourism
Bureau under the Ministry  of Transportation  and Communications to help
Taiwan's indigenous tribes incorporate their unique and colorful designs and
cultural elements  in tourism facilities, such as inns and restaurants, to lure
more visitors, including those from China.</P>
      <P>He asked the Tourism Bureau to organize a meeting in Taipei with representatives
of indigenous peoples and travel agents to explore ways to achieve the goal.</P>
      <P>Ma issued the call while attending a seminar at the Sun Moon Lake National
Scenic Area Administration in central Taiwan's Nantou County after
representatives from the local Thao, Bunun and Sediq tribes complained that
indigenous areas had not benefited from last year's expansion of transportation
and tourism links with China.</P>
      <P>Chuan Wen-sheng, a former legislator from the Bunun Tribe, suggested authorities
include indigenous villages near Sun Moon Lake into the area's development plan
to help boost tourism in indigenous areas.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he fully supports indigenous tribes' keen desire to boost local
tourism, the president said he would set a deadline to push relevant authorities
to come up with concrete plans and strategies through close monitoring.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Kung Wen-chi urged the central government to
work on the issue, as so far none of the Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan had
visited or purchased handicraft items in any tribal areas across the country.</P>
      <P>Sun Moon Lake is one of Taiwan's top tourist destinations that enjoy widespread
popularity among Chinese visitors. Several tribes, including the Thaos, reside
in the adjacent areas to the lake.</P>
      <P>Apart from Sun Moon Lake, famous Hsitou Forest Recreation Park, Shanlinshi
Forest Recreation Park, Yushan National Park, Mt. HeHuan and DongPu Hot Spring
Scenic Spot are also located in Nantou County.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Consumer vouchers boost sales of energy-saving appliances: BOE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Shopping vouchers distributed by the government have significantly boosted the
purchase of locally made energy-saving electric appliances, the Bureau of Energy
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The MOEA launched a program last October that provides an NT$2,000 subsidy to
local consumers when purchasing Taiwan-made appliances bearing energy-saving
labels, such as washing machines, air conditioners, and refrigerators.</P>
      <P>Before the consumer vouchers were issued on Jan. 18, the MOEA had received
99,178 applications for the NT$2,000 subsidy, but in just three days after the
launching of the shopping vouchers program, another 12,759 applications had been
received, according to bureau figures.</P>
      <P>That translates to 4,253 applications per day, a stark contrast to the 910
requests per day received prior to the issuing of the shopping vouchers, bureau
figures indicate.</P>
      <P>"Consumers have made good use of the two policies that have been designed by the
government to boost domestic consumption, " the bureau said in a statement,
adding that it was happy to see consumers so eager to replace old appliances
with far more energy-saving devices.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, air conditioners, refrigerators and washing machines
with its energy-saving label, can save 20.8 percent, 19.1 percent, and 43.5
percent of energy respectively, compared to conventional domestic electrical
appliances.</P>
      <P>The government's NT$530 million (US$15.8 million) plan hopes to boost the sales
of domestically  produced househould  electric appliances from 122,000 units to
265,000 units in six months, which will represent an estimated NT$9 billion in
domestic spending.</P>
      <P>The energy-saving appliances subsidy program is expected to last until March 31
this year.</P>
      <P>The energy-saving label is granted by the bureau for products with energy
efficiencies that are 10 percent to 50 percent higher than normal standards.</P>

      <P>Three young Chinese women attempting to transit through Taiwan to the United
States using fake Republic of China passports were nabbed at Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport Saturday, the National Immigration Agency (NIA) said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The three Chinese women, all aged over 18, were discovered at an airport gate
using bogus ROC passports and fake boarding passes carrying counterfeit
departure stamps, the agency said.</P>
      <P>After a preliminary investigation, airport police discovered that the three flew
to Taiwan from Hong Kong Saturday with travel documents indicating they were
transiting to Palau on holiday.</P>
      <P>The police found that the three canceled their airplane tickets for Palau
immediately upon landing in Taiwan, and were given the fake passports and travel
documents for flights destined for the United States by intermediaries.</P>
      <P>Believing that the Chinese women were supported by a "snake head" human
trafficking ring, NIA officials have referred them to the Taoyuan District

last year to allow them to ride out financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>The borrowers, however, repaid NT$300 million to the temple, Ma was told, and
the president saluted the honesty and gratitude demonstrated by the borrowers,
saying the traits are important values of the country.</P>
      <P>After being repaid with interest by the borrowers, the temple authorities then
used the extra money to bolster its charity and public interest drives,
including giving out scholarships and subsidies to youths from low-income
families, financially supporting care for the elderly, and other social
programs.</P>

      <P>The Shoushan Zoo in the southern port city of Kaohsiung said Sunday it is
scheduled to close Monday for a renovation project that is planned to take half
a year to complete, but denied it was related to housing two white tigers from
China.</P>
      <P>The zoo has appropriated NT$150 million (US$3.45 million) to fund the renovation
project aimed at revamping the entire facility, including parking lots, zoo
authorities said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the zoo needs an overhaul after having not been revamped for 30

    <HEADLINE>Most anti-smoking violations in workplace: foundation</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The non-profit John Tung Foundation has received 142 complaints since a law
banning smoking in public indoor areas took effect nearly a month ago, the anti-
smoking group said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the foundation's headquarters, foundation CEO
Yao Shi-yuan said that to many people's surprise, as many as 80 percent of the
alleged cases, or 110, took place in the workplace,  including in offices of
superiors,  stairwells  or bathrooms.</P>
      <P>According to Yao, the finding confounded the expectations of foundation workers,
who thought most violations would occur at coffee shops,  restaurants,  bus or
train stations and outdoor areas surrounding hospitals.</P>
      <P>Yao blamed the Bureau of Health Promotion under the Cabinet-level Department of
Health (DOH) -- the agency in charge of enforcing the anti-smoking amendment --
and its misguided interpretation of the law and lax law enforcement for the high
rate of violations.</P>
      <P>Under an amendment to the Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act, which took effect Jan.
11, smoking is forbidden in offices manned by three or more people as well as in
the indoor areas of most public premises, including roofed transportation
stations, KTV parlors, passageways, and staircases.</P>
      <P>Only four kinds of establishments -- hotels,  restaurants, shopping malls and
nursing homes for the elderly -- are allowed to set up smoking rooms under
certain strict requirements.</P>
      <P>The law stipulates a fine of up to NT$10,000 (US$300) for those who smoke in
facilities where it is prohibited and up to NT$50,000 for the owners of these
premises.</P>
      <P>Under the law, the only public places in which smoking is allowed indoors are
night clubs or bars that do not admit patrons under the age of 18 and open after
9 p.m.</P>
      <P>According to Sun Lee-chun, the chairman of the monthly Consumers News magazine,
the public's participation is the most important factor in stamping out smoking
in places where smoking is banned.</P>
      <P>Sun suggested that all city and county governments provide incentives to people
for reporting unlawful smokers as they have done to encourage citizens to crack
down on cigarette littering.</P>
      <P>To date, 21 out of Taiwan's 25 cities and counties are offering rewards of 5
percent to 50 percent of the fines imposed on violators to people  who report
illegal  cigarette  littering  to local authorities, he noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taekwondo athlete promotes her first book at TIBE 2009</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's outstanding taekwondo athlete Su Li-wen introduced her new book, "The
Undefeatable Child, " at the 2009 Taipei International Book Exhibition on
Tuesday, hoping to share her experiences as a taekwondo Olympian with Taiwanese
youth.</P>
      <P>Despite being defeated by Croatia's Martina Zubcic 4-5 in the 2008 Beijing
Olympic Games bronze medal match in the women's under 57 kilogram class, Su's
preseverance drew praise and cheers from people in both Beijing and Taipei.</P>
      <P>The highly determined  athlete  refused  to give up after crumbling to the
ground in agony 11 times during the three bouts she fought because the left knee
she injured in her first bout could not support her weight.</P>
      <P>"I had never dreamed of being able to write a book about my past experiences, "
said Su, but after being encouraged by her family and friends, she decided to
share her experiences as a female taekwondo athlete.</P>
      <P>Su said an athlete's attitude is vital to the outcome of any competition, and
that at the most trying moments during her bronze medal bout, all she could
think of was winning a medal for Taiwan and her father.</P>
      <P>"I made a deal with my father before departing for the 2008 Beijing Olympic
Games, " Su said. She promised her father that she would do her very best to
bring home a medal if her father was willing to continue fighting his gradually
worsening oral cancer.</P>
      <P>According to Su, her father played a vital role in her career as a taekwondo
athlete,  as he taught  her  the importance  of self-confidence, self-discipline
and determination.</P>
      <P>Asked if she ever thought about quitting during her Olympic bouts, Su proudly
said that giving up is against the core value of any athlete who respects
himself, adding that it would have been an honor to "fight to the death at the
Olympic Games."</P>
      <P>Encouraging Taiwan's youth, Su stressed that, "you must never give up in order
to succeed, no matter what your profession is, as the key elements for success
are universally similar."</P>
      <P>Asked if she intends to represent Taiwan again in future international
competitions, Su said she is very happy with her teaching position at National
Taiwan Sport University.</P>
      <P>"I don't want to speculate about the possibility of participating in future
events as I'm still recovering from the injuries I sustained at last year's
Olympic Games, " she said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Chi Cheng,  who won  a bronze  medal  in the 80-meter  low  hurdles
in  the  1968  Summer  Olympics  and obliterated, 44 Asian and 10 world records,
said that she broke into tears when she saw Su fall during the bronze medal bout
in Beijing.</P>
      <P>"She is definitely one of the best athletes in Taiwan's history," said Chi,
adding that Su's spirit and undying determination had much greater meaning than
that of an Olympic gold medal to Taiwanese citizens.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chi urged the public to continue supporting outstanding athletes
like Su in order to help promote a better environment for molding and training
future professional athletes.</P>
      <P>Su won the gold medal at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, the 2007 World University
Games in Bangkok and the 2008 Asian Taekwondo Championship.</P>
      <P>Before the opening of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Su was the only Taiwanese
athlete predicted to win a gold medal at the Games by the United States-based
Sports Illustrated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan overcomes Kazakhstan behind unheralded Chen in Davis Cup</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Bring on India!</P>
      <P>During a week when the absence of Taiwan's top player Lu Yen-hsun and
Kazakhstan's three top-200 Russian imports threatened to become the main
storylines of their Asia/Oceania Zone Group I Davis Cup tie, unheralded Chen Ti
had the last laugh.</P>
      <P>Playing an unexpected foe who defeated him last year in five sets in a Davis Cup
tie in Almaty, Chen returned the favor Sunday, defeating world No. 180 Yuri
Schukin 4-6, 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (3), 6-1 to give Taiwan an unassailable 3-1 lead in a
4-1 victory over the visitors.</P>
      <P>"When I played Schukin last year, I saw he was ranked pretty high and figured he
would be tough to beat. But this time I played knowing I could win, " the world
No. 375 Chen said. "I never thought I would lose at any point during the match."</P>
      <P>Chen won the deciding point in a 3-2 win over Pakistan in February 2006, but he
had never played such an impressive match under pressure against such a high-
ranked opponent.</P>
      <P>"You don't get many chances to shine on a big stage, so I wanted to take
advantage of the opportunity," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The victory was a nice birthday present to Wang Yeu-tzuoo, who turned 24 on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wang, trying to relaunch his career this weekend after sitting out most of 2008,
was spared the pressure of a best-of-five set match and defeated world No. 145
Mikhail Kukushkin 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 to complete Taiwan's 4-1 triumph.</P>
      <P>Taiwan needs to win two more ties if it hopes to reach the World Group playoffs,
the gateway to the Davis Cup's top tier, for the first time in its history.</P>
      <P>It will host India on March 6-8, and a win there would pit it against the winner
of either Australia or Thailand.</P>
      <P>Taiwan entered Sunday needing only to win one of the day's two reverse singles.</P>
      <P>Chen was supposed to play world No. 119 Andrey Golubev in Sunday's opener, but
Kazakhstan went with Schukin instead of Golubev, who was wildly erratic in a
straight set loss to Wang Friday.</P>
      <P>For three sets, it appeared to be a good move, as the 29-year-old Schukin's
consistency, angled shots from the baseline and accurate passing shots kept Chen
off balance.</P>
      <P>Chen seemed to pick up momentum after breaking Schukin at love to take a 4-3
lead in the fourth set, but gave it back three games later when he was broken
serving for the set.</P>
      <P>Another two games later, down 5-6 and serving to stay in the match, Chen faced
his biggest test.</P>
      <P>An ace that would have put him up 40-30 was overturned by the chair umpire after
Schukin complained the line umpire signaled the ball out.</P>
      <P>The 25-year-old Taiwanese, who completely lost his cool in a similar situation
in the fifth set of his loss to Kukushkin Friday, this time accepted the call,
and prompted by a roar of encouragement from the crowd, defiantly pounded two
service winners to clinch the game.</P>
      <P>"I vowed before the match not to let any decision by the umpires bother me. And
when the crowd got into it, it really pumped me up, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>Helped by two Schukin unforced errors, Chen slammed an overhead and made two
winning forays to net to take a 5-2 lead in the tiebreaker and then sent the
crowd into a frenzy with a half volley off a Schukin overhead that trickled over
the net out of his stunned opponent's reach.</P>
      <P>Two points later, he clinched the tiebreaker with a big serve.</P>
      <P>Once Chen broke a tiring Schukin in the second game of the final set, victory
seemed assured, a victory that gave Chen newfound confidence that he could
finally rise beyond his career best 255 ranking, accomplished in 2005.</P>
      <P>"Staying with guys ranked in the 100s this weekend was important, because if I
hadn't been able to, I would have asked myself what the point was of continuing
to compete on tour, " said Chen.</P>
      <P>After two strong performances this weekend, he no longer has to ask.</P>

      <P>A veteran Taipei city councilor won a five-way race Sunday to become ruling
Kuomintang's (KMT's) nominee in a legislative by-election to fill the seat
vacated by a KMT legislator over a dual citizenship controversy.</P>
      <P>Chiang Nai-hsin, a seven-term city councilor, beat four other contenders in not
only a primary vote by KMT members residing in the capital city's Daan district
held Sunday but also in two rounds of public opinion polls conducted between
Feb. 5-7.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT primary regulations, the vote accounted for 30 percent of
the candidates' support and the opinion poll accounted for the other 70 percent.</P>
      <P>Chiang defeated the other four fellow city councilors in both the vote and the
opinion polls by comfortable margins.</P>
      <P>In the primary vote, Chiang garnered 1,221 ballots or 54.815 percent of the
total valid votes, far surpassing the 518 ballots won by runner-up Lin Yi-hua,
also a city councilor.</P>
      <P>According to KMT Taipei City chapter data, 6,261 party members were eligible to
vote in the primary, but only 2,198 valid ballots were cast at five polling
stations erected in the district for a voter turnout of 35.32 percent.</P>
      <P>The results of public opinion polls conducted by Shih Hsin University and TVBS
public opinion survey centers showed Chiang with 54.3 percent support, well
ahead of Lin's 21.2 percent.</P>
      <P>The public support rates for the three other contenders -- Lee Ching-yuan, Chin
Li-fang and Lee Hsin -- were 10.9 percent, 7.8 percent and 5.2 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>After disclosing the results of the vote and opinion polls at a news conference,
Pan Chia-sen, head of the KMT Taipei chapter, announced that Chiang will
represent the KMT in the March 28 legislative by-election.</P>
      <P>Three losing contestants -- Lee Ching-yuan, Lee Hsin and Chin Li-fang -- showed
up at the KMT Taipei City office to throw their support behind Chiang, who
rushed to the office after learning of his primary win.</P>
      <P>Chiang, 59, who has served as a city councilor for 28 years, said he will pay a
visit to Lin Yi-hua, the only loser who was absent from the post-primary morale-
boosting gathering.</P>
      <P>Lin campaigned fiercely in the primary and was accused of vote-buying by Chin.</P>
      <P>As Daan district is a KMT stronghold, Chiang is widely seen as a heavy favorite
in the by-election now that he has won the KMT nomination.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chiang said he will still need the united support of KMT
politicians and rank-and-file members to claim a final victory in the by-
election.</P>
      <P>Chiang will face another veteran Taipei City councilor, Chou Po-ya of the main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party, in the by-election.</P>
      <P>There are currently 111 legislators in the lawmaking body. A by-election will be
held on March 14 in Miaoli County to fill a seat vacated by Lee E-ting, a KMT
legislator convicted of vote buying.</P>
      <P>Once Lee Ching-an's former seat is filled in the March 28 by-election, the
legislature will be returned to its full complement of 113 lawmarkers.</P>
      <P>Lee,  a KMT legislator from 1999 to 2009,  announced her resignation from the
legislature Jan. 8, citing the dispute over her alleged dual citizenship. Her
resignation came after DPP politicians promoted a campaign to recall her and
pro-DPP civic groups prepared to besiege the legislature to protest the
lawmaking body's failure to act against her.</P>
      <P>According to the current Public Officials Election and Recall Law, a by-election
has to be held in Taipei City's Daan district within three months to elect a
replacement to fill the position vacated by Lee.</P>
      <P>Lee, who was sworn in for a fourth legislative term Feb. 1, 2008, was found the
following month to have never formally renounced her U.S. citizenship, even
though she had held public office in Taiwan since 1994.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Nationality Act requires public officials holding dual citizenship to
surrender their foreign citizenship before assuming public office and to obtain
a certificate as proof within one year of taking office.</P>
      <P>The law also requires that those officials who retain foreign citizenship be
removed from their posts.</P>
      <P>Calls for Lee to be formally relieved of her seat mounted after U.S.
authorities, in response to an inquiry from Taiwan, confirmed in late 2008 that
Lee "has previously been documented as a U.S. citizen with a U.S. passport and
that no subsequent loss of U.S. citizenship has been documented."</P>
      <P>In a recent response to an inquiry by Taiwan's Central Election Commission, the
U.S. State Department further concluded that Lee did not fulfill her obligation
of committing an expatriating act with the intent of relinquishing her U.S.
citizenship when she first assumed public office in Taiwan back in 1994.</P>
      <P>Lee has been barred from leaving Taiwan pending an investigation into fraud and
forgery allegations against her.</P>

      <P>A 127-member Chinese tourism delegation, headed by Li Yabai, director of the
Travel and Tourism Bureau of Henan Province in China, arrived in Taipei Sunday
to see for themselves colorful Lantern Festival celebrations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to local tour promoters, the delegation is the largest of its kind
since Beijing authorities allowed more Chinese citizens to make sightseeing
trips to Taiwan late last year.</P>
      <P>Attracted by Taiwan's now internationally  renowned Lantern Festival
celebrations, Li said the group will travel to Yilan City on northeastern coast
Monday where a series of festive activities will be launched in the evening to
celebrate the festival, which falls on the 15th day of the first lunar month.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is known to be versed in merging tradition and innovation in organizing
traditional festive activities and we hope to learn more about Taiwan's
achievements in this regard during our current visit," Li said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Li said, the group, composed of provincial tourism officials and
travel service operators, will tour major signseeing spots to appreciate
Taiwan's natural scenery.</P>
      <P>During its eight-day stay, the delegation will also visit local institutions in
charge of travel promotion and service quality certification as well as relevant
administrative agencies.</P>
      <P>In addition to the central government-organized Taiwan Lantern Festival
activities in Yilan City, many other festive events that integrate tradition and
innovation will also take place in many other parts of the country to celebrate
the Lantern Festival.</P>
      <P>Local tourist officials said they will introduce special features of those
activities to the Chinese delegation for their reference in organizing tour
packages for ordinary Chinese tourists in the future.</P>
      <P>The most special celebration activities include the firecracker blitzkrieg known
as "bombarding Master Handan" in Taitung County, the release of airborne paper
lanterns known as "sky lanterns" in Pingsi township in Taipei County and the
setting-off of a beehive of firecrackers in Yanshuei township in Tainan County,

NT$50,000 (US$1,483.68) in subsidy.</P>
      <P>A recent survey by the online job broker 104 Job Bank found that 81.6 percent of

    <HEADLINE>President pushes to boost tourism in Taiwan's indigenous areas</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Concerned over the development of tourism in Taiwan's indigenous areas,
President Ma Ying-jeou asked government agencies Sunday to work with travel
agents and arrange for more Chinese tourists to visit local tribes.</P>
      <P>Ma instructed the Cabinet-level Council of Indigenous Peoples and the Tourism
Bureau under the Ministry  of Transportation  and Communications to help
Taiwan's indigenous tribes incorporate their unique and colorful designs and
cultural elements  in tourism facilities, such as inns and restaurants, to lure
more visitors, including those from China.</P>
      <P>He asked the Tourism Bureau to organize a meeting in Taipei with representatives
of indigenous peoples and travel agents to explore ways to achieve the goal.</P>
      <P>Ma issued the call while attending a seminar at the Sun Moon Lake National
Scenic Area Administration in central Taiwan's Nantou County after
representatives from the local Thao, Bunun and Sediq tribes complained that
indigenous areas had not benefited from last year's expansion of transportation
and tourism links with China.</P>
      <P>Chuan Wen-sheng, a former legislator from the Bunun Tribe, suggested authorities
include indigenous villages near Sun Moon Lake into the area's development plan
to help boost tourism in indigenous areas.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he fully supports indigenous tribes' keen desire to boost local
tourism, the president said he would set a deadline to push relevant authorities
to come up with concrete plans and strategies through close monitoring.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Kung Wen-chi urged the central government to
work on the issue, as so far none of the Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan had

    <HEADLINE>Consumer vouchers boost sales of energy-saving appliances: BOE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Shopping vouchers distributed by the government have significantly boosted the
purchase of locally made energy-saving electric appliances, the Bureau of Energy
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The MOEA launched a program last October that provides an NT$2,000 subsidy to
local consumers when purchasing Taiwan-made appliances bearing energy-saving
labels, such as washing machines, air conditioners, and refrigerators.</P>
      <P>Before the consumer vouchers were issued on Jan. 18, the MOEA had received
99,178 applications for the NT$2,000 subsidy, but in just three days after the
launching of the shopping vouchers program, another 12,759 applications had been
received, according to bureau figures.</P>
      <P>That translates to 4,253 applications per day, a stark contrast to the 910
requests per day received prior to the issuing of the shopping vouchers, bureau
figures indicate.</P>
      <P>"Consumers have made good use of the two policies that have been designed by the
government to boost domestic consumption, " the bureau said in a statement,
adding that it was happy to see consumers so eager to replace old appliances
with far more energy-saving devices.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, air conditioners, refrigerators and washing machines
with its energy-saving label, can save 20.8 percent, 19.1 percent, and 43.5
percent of energy respectively, compared to conventional domestic electrical
appliances.</P>
      <P>The government's NT$530 million (US$15.8 million) plan hopes to boost the sales
of domestically  produced househould  electric appliances from 122,000 units to
265,000 units in six months, which will represent an estimated NT$9 billion in
domestic spending.</P>
      <P>The energy-saving appliances subsidy program is expected to last until March 31
this year.</P>
      <P>The energy-saving label is granted by the bureau for products with energy
efficiencies that are 10 percent to 50 percent higher than normal standards.</P>

      <P>Three young Chinese women attempting to transit through Taiwan to the United
States using fake Republic of China passports were nabbed at Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport Saturday, the National Immigration Agency (NIA) said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The three Chinese women, all aged over 18, were discovered at an airport gate
using bogus ROC passports and fake boarding passes carrying counterfeit
departure stamps, the agency said.</P>
      <P>After a preliminary investigation, airport police discovered that the three flew
to Taiwan from Hong Kong Saturday with travel documents indicating they were
transiting to Palau on holiday.</P>
      <P>The police found that the three canceled their airplane tickets for Palau
immediately upon landing in Taiwan, and were given the fake passports and travel
documents for flights destined for the United States by intermediaries.</P>
      <P>Believing that the Chinese women were supported by a "snake head" human
trafficking ring, NIA officials have referred them to the Taoyuan District
Prosecutors Office for further investigation.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Sunday praised the people of Taiwan for showing their
thanks to those who have helped them in time of need.</P>
      <P>Traveling to the Jhushan township in the landlocked county of Nantou, Ma praised
Taiwan's people during a visit to Zinan Temple, a Taoist shrine famous for
having loaned cash to followers in need.</P>
      <P>The manager of the temple told Ma that more than 430,000 people borrowed a total
of NT$250 million (US$7.42 million) from the land god worshipped at Zinan Temple
last year to allow them to ride out financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>The borrowers, however, repaid NT$300 million to the temple, Ma was told, and
the president saluted the honesty and gratitude demonstrated by the borrowers,
saying the traits are important values of the country.</P>
      <P>After being repaid with interest by the borrowers, the temple authorities then
used the extra money to bolster its charity and public interest drives,
including giving out scholarships and subsidies to youths from low-income

      <P>Zinan Temple, a shrine-like place with a small area of less than 33 square

      <P>The Shoushan Zoo in the southern port city of Kaohsiung said Sunday it is
scheduled to close Monday for a renovation project that is planned to take half
a year to complete, but denied it was related to housing two white tigers from
China.</P>
      <P>The zoo has appropriated NT$150 million (US$3.45 million) to fund the renovation
project aimed at revamping the entire facility, including parking lots, zoo
authorities said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the zoo needs an overhaul after having not been revamped for 30
years, they denied that the renovation will be carried out to create a new place
to house two white tigers that the zoo plans to import from China in June.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kaohsiung City Tourism Bureau Director Lin Kun-shan said it is still
unclear whether the Shoushan Zoo will bring in the white tigers from Guangzhou,
adding that the city government is still assessing the possibility.</P>
      <P>The official's denial contradicted what another city official said last December
concerning the tiger import plan.</P>
      <P>Tang Cheng-juei, director of the Kaohsiung City Scenic Area Administration, said
Dec. 17, 2008 that a pair of white tigers are scheduled to be placed in the

      <P>Tang said the rare animals are a gift of the Guangzhou Xiangjiang Safari Park in
southern China to promote friendship between Guangzhou and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The zoo has appropriated NT$118 million to fund a renovation project aimed at
creating a space at the zoo to house the two white tigers, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Most anti-smoking violations in workplace: foundation</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The non-profit John Tung Foundation has received 142 complaints since a law
banning smoking in public indoor areas took effect nearly a month ago, the anti-
smoking group said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the foundation's headquarters, foundation CEO
Yao Shi-yuan said that to many people's surprise, as many as 80 percent of the
alleged cases, or 110, took place in the workplace,  including in offices of
superiors,  stairwells  or bathrooms.</P>
      <P>According to Yao, the finding confounded the expectations of foundation workers,
who thought most violations would occur at coffee shops,  restaurants,  bus or
train stations and outdoor areas surrounding hospitals.</P>
      <P>Yao blamed the Bureau of Health Promotion under the Cabinet-level Department of
Health (DOH) -- the agency in charge of enforcing the anti-smoking amendment --
and its misguided interpretation of the law and lax law enforcement for the high
rate of violations.</P>
      <P>Under an amendment to the Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act, which took effect Jan.
11, smoking is forbidden in offices manned by three or more people as well as in
the indoor areas of most public premises, including roofed transportation
stations, KTV parlors, passageways, and staircases.</P>
      <P>Only four kinds of establishments -- hotels,  restaurants, shopping malls and
nursing homes for the elderly -- are allowed to set up smoking rooms under
certain strict requirements.</P>
      <P>The law stipulates a fine of up to NT$10,000 (US$300) for those who smoke in
facilities where it is prohibited and up to NT$50,000 for the owners of these
premises.</P>
      <P>Under the law, the only public places in which smoking is allowed indoors are
night clubs or bars that do not admit patrons under the age of 18 and open after
9 p.m.</P>
      <P>According to Sun Lee-chun, the chairman of the monthly Consumers News magazine,
the public's participation is the most important factor in stamping out smoking
in places where smoking is banned.</P>
      <P>Sun suggested that all city and county governments provide incentives to people
for reporting unlawful smokers as they have done to encourage citizens to crack
down on cigarette littering.</P>
      <P>To date, 21 out of Taiwan's 25 cities and counties are offering rewards of 5
percent to 50 percent of the fines imposed on violators to people  who report
illegal  cigarette  littering  to local authorities, he noted.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's outstanding taekwondo athlete Su Li-wen introduced her new book, "The
Undefeatable Child, " at the 2009 Taipei International Book Exhibition on
Tuesday, hoping to share her experiences as a taekwondo Olympian with Taiwanese
youth.</P>
      <P>Despite being defeated by Croatia's Martina Zubcic 4-5 in the 2008 Beijing
Olympic Games bronze medal match in the women's under 57 kilogram class, Su's
preseverance drew praise and cheers from people in both Beijing and Taipei.</P>
      <P>The highly determined  athlete  refused  to give up after crumbling to the
ground in agony 11 times during the three bouts she fought because the left knee
she injured in her first bout could not support her weight.</P>
      <P>"I had never dreamed of being able to write a book about my past experiences, "
said Su, but after being encouraged by her family and friends, she decided to
share her experiences as a female taekwondo athlete.</P>
      <P>Su said an athlete's attitude is vital to the outcome of any competition, and
that at the most trying moments during her bronze medal bout, all she could
think of was winning a medal for Taiwan and her father.</P>
      <P>"I made a deal with my father before departing for the 2008 Beijing Olympic
Games, " Su said. She promised her father that she would do her very best to
bring home a medal if her father was willing to continue fighting his gradually
worsening oral cancer.</P>
      <P>According to Su, her father played a vital role in her career as a taekwondo
athlete,  as he taught  her  the importance  of self-confidence, self-discipline
and determination.</P>
      <P>Asked if she ever thought about quitting during her Olympic bouts, Su proudly
said that giving up is against the core value of any athlete who respects
himself, adding that it would have been an honor to "fight to the death at the
Olympic Games."</P>
      <P>Encouraging Taiwan's youth, Su stressed that, "you must never give up in order
to succeed, no matter what your profession is, as the key elements for success
are universally similar."</P>
      <P>Asked if she intends to represent Taiwan again in future international
competitions, Su said she is very happy with her teaching position at National
Taiwan Sport University.</P>
      <P>"I don't want to speculate about the possibility of participating in future
events as I'm still recovering from the injuries I sustained at last year's
Olympic Games, " she said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Chi Cheng,  who won  a bronze  medal  in the 80-meter  low  hurdles
in  the  1968  Summer  Olympics  and obliterated, 44 Asian and 10 world records,
said that she broke into tears when she saw Su fall during the bronze medal bout
in Beijing.</P>
      <P>"She is definitely one of the best athletes in Taiwan's history," said Chi,
adding that Su's spirit and undying determination had much greater meaning than
that of an Olympic gold medal to Taiwanese citizens.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chi urged the public to continue supporting outstanding athletes
like Su in order to help promote a better environment for molding and training
future professional athletes.</P>
      <P>Su won the gold medal at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, the 2007 World University
Games in Bangkok and the 2008 Asian Taekwondo Championship.</P>
      <P>Before the opening of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Su was the only Taiwanese
athlete predicted to win a gold medal at the Games by the United States-based
Sports Illustrated.</P>

      <P>Bring on India!</P>
      <P>During a week when the absence of Taiwan's top player Lu Yen-hsun and
Kazakhstan's three top-200 Russian imports threatened to become the main
storylines of their Asia/Oceania Zone Group I Davis Cup tie, unheralded Chen Ti
had the last laugh.</P>
      <P>Playing an unexpected foe who defeated him last year in five sets in a Davis Cup
tie in Almaty, Chen returned the favor Sunday, defeating world No. 180 Yuri
Schukin 4-6, 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (3), 6-1 to give Taiwan an unassailable 3-1 lead in a
4-1 victory over the visitors.</P>
      <P>"When I played Schukin last year, I saw he was ranked pretty high and figured he
would be tough to beat. But this time I played knowing I could win, " the world
No. 375 Chen said. "I never thought I would lose at any point during the match."</P>
      <P>Chen won the deciding point in a 3-2 win over Pakistan in February 2006, but he
had never played such an impressive match under pressure against such a high-
ranked opponent.</P>
      <P>"You don't get many chances to shine on a big stage, so I wanted to take
advantage of the opportunity," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The victory was a nice birthday present to Wang Yeu-tzuoo, who turned 24 on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wang, trying to relaunch his career this weekend after sitting out most of 2008,
was spared the pressure of a best-of-five set match and defeated world No. 145
Mikhail Kukushkin 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 to complete Taiwan's 4-1 triumph.</P>
      <P>Taiwan needs to win two more ties if it hopes to reach the World Group playoffs,
the gateway to the Davis Cup's top tier, for the first time in its history.</P>
      <P>It will host India on March 6-8, and a win there would pit it against the winner
of either Australia or Thailand.</P>
      <P>Taiwan entered Sunday needing only to win one of the day's two reverse singles.</P>
      <P>Chen was supposed to play world No. 119 Andrey Golubev in Sunday's opener, but
Kazakhstan went with Schukin instead of Golubev, who was wildly erratic in a
straight set loss to Wang Friday.</P>
      <P>For three sets, it appeared to be a good move, as the 29-year-old Schukin's
consistency, angled shots from the baseline and accurate passing shots kept Chen
off balance.</P>
      <P>Chen seemed to pick up momentum after breaking Schukin at love to take a 4-3
lead in the fourth set, but gave it back three games later when he was broken
serving for the set.</P>
      <P>Another two games later, down 5-6 and serving to stay in the match, Chen faced
his biggest test.</P>
      <P>An ace that would have put him up 40-30 was overturned by the chair umpire after
Schukin complained the line umpire signaled the ball out.</P>
      <P>The 25-year-old Taiwanese, who completely lost his cool in a similar situation
in the fifth set of his loss to Kukushkin Friday, this time accepted the call,
and prompted by a roar of encouragement from the crowd, defiantly pounded two
service winners to clinch the game.</P>
      <P>"I vowed before the match not to let any decision by the umpires bother me. And
when the crowd got into it, it really pumped me up, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>Helped by two Schukin unforced errors, Chen slammed an overhead and made two
winning forays to net to take a 5-2 lead in the tiebreaker and then sent the
crowd into a frenzy with a half volley off a Schukin overhead that trickled over
the net out of his stunned opponent's reach.</P>
      <P>Two points later, he clinched the tiebreaker with a big serve.</P>
      <P>Once Chen broke a tiring Schukin in the second game of the final set, victory
seemed assured, a victory that gave Chen newfound confidence that he could
finally rise beyond his career best 255 ranking, accomplished in 2005.</P>
      <P>"Staying with guys ranked in the 100s this weekend was important, because if I
hadn't been able to, I would have asked myself what the point was of continuing
to compete on tour, " said Chen.</P>
      <P>After two strong performances this weekend, he no longer has to ask.</P>

      <P>In the primary vote, Chiang garnered 1,221 ballots or 54.815 percent of the
total valid votes, far surpassing the 518 ballots won by runner-up Lin Yi-hua,
also a city councilor.</P>
      <P>According to KMT Taipei City chapter data, 6,261 party members were eligible to
vote in the primary, but only 2,198 valid ballots were cast at five polling
stations erected in the district for a voter turnout of 35.32 percent.</P>
      <P>The results of public opinion polls conducted by Shih Hsin University and TVBS
public opinion survey centers showed Chiang with 54.3 percent support, well
ahead of Lin's 21.2 percent.</P>
      <P>The public support rates for the three other contenders -- Lee Ching-yuan, Chin
Li-fang and Lee Hsin -- were 10.9 percent, 7.8 percent and 5.2 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>After disclosing the results of the vote and opinion polls at a news conference,
Pan Chia-sen, head of the KMT Taipei chapter, announced that Chiang will
represent the KMT in the March 28 legislative by-election.</P>
      <P>Three losing contestants -- Lee Ching-yuan, Lee Hsin and Chin Li-fang -- showed
up at the KMT Taipei City office to throw their support behind Chiang, who
rushed to the office after learning of his primary win.</P>
      <P>Chiang, 59, who has served as a city councilor for 28 years, said he will pay a
visit to Lin Yi-hua, the only loser who was absent from the post-primary morale-
boosting gathering.</P>
      <P>Lin campaigned fiercely in the primary and was accused of vote-buying by Chin.</P>
      <P>As Daan district is a KMT stronghold, Chiang is widely seen as a heavy favorite
in the by-election now that he has won the KMT nomination.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chiang said he will still need the united support of KMT
politicians and rank-and-file members to claim a final victory in the by-
election.</P>
      <P>Chiang will face another veteran Taipei City councilor, Chou Po-ya of the main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party, in the by-election.</P>
      <P>There are currently 111 legislators in the lawmaking body. A by-election will be
held on March 14 in Miaoli County to fill a seat vacated by Lee E-ting, a KMT
legislator convicted of vote buying.</P>
      <P>Once Lee Ching-an's former seat is filled in the March 28 by-election, the
legislature will be returned to its full complement of 113 lawmarkers.</P>
      <P>Lee,  a KMT legislator from 1999 to 2009,  announced her resignation from the
legislature Jan. 8, citing the dispute over her alleged dual citizenship. Her
resignation came after DPP politicians promoted a campaign to recall her and
pro-DPP civic groups prepared to besiege the legislature to protest the
lawmaking body's failure to act against her.</P>
      <P>According to the current Public Officials Election and Recall Law, a by-election
has to be held in Taipei City's Daan district within three months to elect a
replacement to fill the position vacated by Lee.</P>
      <P>Lee, who was sworn in for a fourth legislative term Feb. 1, 2008, was found the
following month to have never formally renounced her U.S. citizenship, even
though she had held public office in Taiwan since 1994.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Nationality Act requires public officials holding dual citizenship to
surrender their foreign citizenship before assuming public office and to obtain
a certificate as proof within one year of taking office.</P>
      <P>The law also requires that those officials who retain foreign citizenship be
removed from their posts.</P>
      <P>Calls for Lee to be formally relieved of her seat mounted after U.S.
authorities, in response to an inquiry from Taiwan, confirmed in late 2008 that
Lee "has previously been documented as a U.S. citizen with a U.S. passport and
that no subsequent loss of U.S. citizenship has been documented."</P>
      <P>In a recent response to an inquiry by Taiwan's Central Election Commission, the
U.S. State Department further concluded that Lee did not fulfill her obligation
of committing an expatriating act with the intent of relinquishing her U.S.
citizenship when she first assumed public office in Taiwan back in 1994.</P>
      <P>Lee has been barred from leaving Taiwan pending an investigation into fraud and
forgery allegations against her.</P>

      <P>A 127-member Chinese tourism delegation, headed by Li Yabai, director of the
Travel and Tourism Bureau of Henan Province in China, arrived in Taipei Sunday
to see for themselves colorful Lantern Festival celebrations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to local tour promoters, the delegation is the largest of its kind
since Beijing authorities allowed more Chinese citizens to make sightseeing
trips to Taiwan late last year.</P>
      <P>Attracted by Taiwan's now internationally  renowned Lantern Festival
celebrations, Li said the group will travel to Yilan City on northeastern coast
Monday where a series of festive activities will be launched in the evening to
celebrate the festival, which falls on the 15th day of the first lunar month.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is known to be versed in merging tradition and innovation in organizing
traditional festive activities and we hope to learn more about Taiwan's
achievements in this regard during our current visit," Li said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Li said, the group, composed of provincial tourism officials and
travel service operators, will tour major signseeing spots to appreciate
Taiwan's natural scenery.</P>
      <P>During its eight-day stay, the delegation will also visit local institutions in
charge of travel promotion and service quality certification as well as relevant
administrative agencies.</P>
      <P>In addition to the central government-organized Taiwan Lantern Festival
activities in Yilan City, many other festive events that integrate tradition and
innovation will also take place in many other parts of the country to celebrate
the Lantern Festival.</P>
      <P>Local tourist officials said they will introduce special features of those
activities to the Chinese delegation for their reference in organizing tour
packages for ordinary Chinese tourists in the future.</P>
      <P>The most special celebration activities include the firecracker blitzkrieg known
as "bombarding Master Handan" in Taitung County, the release of airborne paper
lanterns known as "sky lanterns" in Pingsi township in Taipei County and the
setting-off of a beehive of firecrackers in Yanshuei township in Tainan County,

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is planning to offer financial subsidies
to help wage earners launch their own ventures by joining retail franchises, an

      <P>According to the official, the ministry plans to offer each new franchise store
NT$50,000 (US$1,483.68) in subsidy.</P>
      <P>A recent survey by the online job broker 104 Job Bank found that 81.6 percent of

      <P>If the program succeeds in inspiring entrepreneurship, the official said it will
be able to help increase private investment by an estimated NT$18.4 billion,

and comes to me for advice, I accept his present reformation without inquiring
what his past life has been. I am satisfied if I find that, for the present, he
has really reformed, without being able to guarantee that he will not relapse
again. But why should one be too severe?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>About 100,000 workers and operators at the Hsinchu Science Park (HSP) --
Taiwan's "Silicon Valley" -- are being sent on unpaid leave days each week as a
result of the global economic recession, the HSP Administration said Monday.</P>
      <P>A survey conducted by the HSP Administration at the beginning of February found
that 56 companies in HSP, or 12 percent of the total number of companies
operating in HSP, have given more than 100,000 workers total unpaid days off
since late last year.</P>
      <P>The 100,000 employees constitute 76 percent of the total number of workers and
operators in the whole HSP, according to the park administration.</P>
      <P>Of the 56 companies, 49 have asked all of their employees to take unpaid days
off, while the other seven companies have asked some of their staff to do so.</P>
      <P>The number of unpaid leave days averages one to two days per week, the survey
found.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  according  to  tallies  compiled  by  the  HSP Administration, 1,050
HSP employees were laid off in January, representing a decline of 46 percent
from December 2008, when 1,950 workers were retrenched.</P>
      <P>The figure, however, was a steep increase of 5.56 times the number in January
2008.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
reported in January that the number of unemployed people in Taiwan totaled
549,000 in December 2008, the highest since October 2003.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economics before politics remains Taiwan's cross-strait policy: SEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
02/09/09  13:46:51
(By Luis Yu &amp; S. J. Kang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has not changed its "economy first, politics later" stance in its cross-
Taiwan Strait policy, Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang
Pin-kung said in an interview carried Monday in Singapore newspaper, Lianhe
Zaobao.</P>
      <P>However, Chiang said in the interview conducted in Taipei before the Chinese New
Year that despite the Taiwanese government's hopes to tackle economic issues
before political  ones,  some political controversies with China may surface
sooner or later in the process of building closer cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, at this time, the discussion of some less sensitive issues with
China may not necessarily result in a political standoff in Taiwan, he added,
noting that, for example, the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) both want Taiwan to participate in this
year's World Healthy Assembly (WHA) as an observer.</P>
      <P>As for the fears expressed by the DPP that negotiations and the closer ties with
China will jeopardize Taiwan's sovereignty, Chiang said that there only two ways
to consolidate Taiwan's sovereignty. The first is through the adoption and
practice of democracy, and the second is through stable and prosperous economic
development, he said.</P>
      <P>Saying that actions speak louder than words, Chiang expressed the view that the
opposition party cannot protect Taiwan's sovereignty just by advocating
independence for the island.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan can one day become a highly democratic country, a free and just
nation ruled by the law, governed by the people, a country that is free of any
violent and radical activities, I am sure that the people of China will not only
respect us but will also envy our political maturity." Chiang said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan must achieve economic prosperity before it can hope to
provide assistance to the developing nations of the world</P>
      <P>or to obtain the support and approval of the international community, he
suggested.</P>
      <P>"The main goals of the KMT and the DPP are similar, as both parties hope to
provide a stable and harmonious living environment for Taiwan's people," Chiang
said.</P>
      <P>However, while the two parties share similar goals, they have chosen different
ways to achieve them, Chiang noted. The KMT has chosen to maintain the status
quo in cross-strait relations, while the DPP has insisted that the only way to
achieve harmony and stability in the society is by establishing a new nation
free of any ties to China, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's SEF and China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) serve as semi-official intermediary bodies in the absence of official
contact between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>City, county integration plan hinges on law amendment: official</HEADLINE>

02/09/09  15:32:14
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The realization of a plan to merge Taichung city and county into special
municipality hinges on the passage of an amendment to the existing Law on Local
Government Systems, a Ministry of the Interior (MOI) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang Li-hsing, director of the MOI Department of Civil Affairs, said that the
amendment should be passed into law before April so as to provide a legal basis
for the integration of Taichung city and county in central Taiwan as a
municipality by the end of 2010.</P>
      <P>"If the amendment is passed before April, it would also have less of an impact
on candidates running in the upcoming mayoral and county chief elections slated
for the end of the year," Huang added.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Liao Liou-yi has said that the Taichung integration
plan is a complicated political process involving several issues such as the
terms of the magistrate and mayor and the status of village and township chiefs
in the proposed special municipality.</P>
      <P>However, Liao said, the plan will be nothing but empty talk if the relevant
legislation is not passed.</P>
      <P>Under the law amendment, Taichung city and county will become the first
adjoining city and county to merge into a larger administrative district. The
merger will also serve as a litmus test for similar plans in northern and
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A government plan also proposes that Taipei city, county and the neighboring
Keelung city be integrated into a special municipality in northern Taiwan and
that Kaohsiung city and county in southern Taiwan be merged into a third special
municipality in the country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu confirmed Monday that he had traveled
with Taichung County Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng to Taipei City several days
ago to seek the support of ruling Kuomintang (KMT)  Chairman Wu Po-hsiung for
the passage of the proposed amendment. The KMT holds over two-thirds seats of
the legislature.</P>

      <P>Taichung City has collected more than 183,800 lots from shopping voucher users
since it began a series of lucky draws last month to encourage consumption in
the central Taiwan city, a local government official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chu Huei-lan,  head of the city's department  of economic development affairs,
said in a briefing to Taichung Mayor Jason Hu that the value of the shopping
voucher consumption in Taichung had reached nearly NT$820 million (US$24.4
million) as of Saturday.</P>
      <P>Expressing delight with the result, Hu said nevertheless that he hoped the Feb.
2-15 Lantern Festival celebrations will attract even more visitors to the city.</P>
      <P>The city is offering a variety of luxury prizes for winners of the lucky draws,
including a luxury apartment, three SUVs and five round-trip flight tickets
between Taichung and the Chinese city of Hangzhou.</P>
      <P>Anyone spending at least NT$3,000-worth of vouchers in the city is eligible to
take part in the draws that began Feb. 2 and will be held again Feb. 15, March
1, March 15, March 22 and March 29.</P>
      <P>The winner of the top prize -- the apartment -- will be announced March 29,
according to the city government.</P>
      <P>The vouchers were distributed Jan. 18 to various categories of resident, with
each receiving NT$3,600-worth of vouchers, as part of a NT$85.7 billion economic
stimulus package intended to boost consumer spending and spur economic growth in
the face of the current economic downturn.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EU Center to open in May: EETO head</HEADLINE>

      <P>The top European Union representative in Taiwan announced Monday that the first
European Union Center (EU Center) will open in Taipei in May in a collaborative
effort by Taiwan's top academic institutions to promote Taiwan-EU relations.</P>
      <P>Guy Ledoux, head of the Taipei-based European Economic and Trade Office (EETO),
told the Central News Agency in an exclusive interview that the contract to set
up the EU Center was signed Dec. 31, 2008 between National Taiwan University
(NTU) and the EETO, which serves as the de facto EU embassy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He added that an inaugural conference of the EU Center is scheduled to be held
in May to celebrate both the opening of the center and the fall of the Berlin
Wall 20 years ago, which made possible the 2004 expansion of the EU to include
10 new member states.</P>
      <P>The EU Center network in the Asia Pacific region spans South Korea, Japan,
Australia and New Zealand. Taiwan will be the third East Asian country to join
the network.</P>
      <P>This is the third cycle (2005-2008) of the EU Centers program, which was
launched in 1998. The EU Centers program will help create a foothold for EU
studies in Taiwan's higher education circles and serve as an information
resource for a broad Taiwan audience.</P>
      <P>Noting that NTU will lead a group of six other universities to jointly operate
the EU Center in Taiwan, Ledoux said it is a very "interesting" and "unique"
arrangement, as there are no other EU Centers in the world that are run by seven
universities.</P>
      <P>"It's very unique because it launched the basis for a better understanding in
the new generation of Taiwanese about the EU, " Ledoux said.</P>
      <P>"It is useful that Taiwanese students and Taiwanese scholars can better
understand what the EU is about and the influence the EU has on international
affairs," he added.</P>
      <P>According to Ledoux, in addition to a grant of NT$47 million (US$1.4 million)
that the EU has agreed to provide over the next four years, NTU, along with
National Chengchi University, National Chung Hsing University, National Sun Yat-
sen University, National Dong Hwa University, Tamkang University and Fu Jen
Catholic University, will contribute another NT$19 million to the program.</P>
      <P>The top EU representative in Taiwan said that other than the inaugural seminar
in May, the main activities of the EU Center during the first year will include
regular workshops and seminars on EU policies and summer school for high school
teachers to learn more about the EU and thus help younger Taiwanese  gain a
better understanding of the EU.</P>
      <P>All seven universities will also launch their own EU study programs, whether at
the bachelor's or master's level, he added.</P>
      <P>Ledoux said that with the general work plan already approved by Brussels, an
advisory committee will be assembled, and that he, a representative of the
presidency of the EU, and representatives of the seven universities will fine
tune the details of each program.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei and Shanghai are slated to jointly organize a "twin city" forum in Taipei
in July, Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-bin announced Monday.</P>
      <P>As the two cities have had similar development experience and both have the need
to boost their high-tech industries, they share a lot of common ground for joint
collaboration, said Hau during a meeting with visiting Shanghai Deputy Mayor
Tang Dengjie on a tour of the Neihu Industry Park in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>With Taipei set to hold an international flower exhibition in 2010 and Shanghai
to host the 2010 world exposition, the forum will serve as a platform that will
allow the two cities to learn from each other  and sharpen  competitiveness  to
increase  their global visibility, Hau contended.</P>
      <P>With direct air links established between Taipei and Shanghai last year, two-way
trade,  cultural, commercial and technology exchanges will become even closer,
he added.</P>
      <P>Hau also asked Tang to relay an invitation to Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng to join
the forum in Taipei in June. The Taipei mayor visited Shanghai in June last
year.</P>
      <P>Agreeing that there is ample room for the two sides to step up bilateral
cooperation, Tang responded positively to Hau's proposals and said that Han had
been preparing to take part in the forum.</P>
      <P>Han told an international news conference in January that he would like to visit
Taiwan as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Tang arrived in Taipei Sunday, at the head of a 13-member delegation,  for a
week-long visit at the invitation  of the Taipei-based Chinese National
Federation of Industries.</P>
      <P>The Chinese delegation will also travel to Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Miaoli, Tainan and

      <P>Minister of Education Cheng Jei-cheng said Monday that 2009 will be a busy year
for the Ministry of Education (MOE) with some NT$20 billion (US$595 million)
allocated by the Cabinet  for  the  ministry's  implementation  of  various
education-related programs.</P>
      <P>The ministry is obligated to use the NT$20 billion to fund a variety of programs
this year, including revamping or rebuilding old or dilapidated school
buildings, strengthening the environment for digital education, creating
9,000-10,000 short-term jobs in the education sector and helping those students
to return to school who have dropped out or are planning to do so because of
their parents' economic situations, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>He asked for assistance from local government officials in charge of education
affairs to help the MOE make decisions on whether and how much extra budget
should be allocated to the local governments so that the programs can be
implemented.</P>
      <P>Other priority programs that the ministry will push this year include bolstering
international education in elementary and junior high schools, improving
teaching quality in rural areas, integrating kindergarten and nursery operations
and providing computerization for the special education sector, Cheng added.</P>
      <P>The NT$20 billion plan is part of a special economic stimulus package under

    <HEADLINE>English testing to be included in most civil service exams</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA)
02/09/09  17:55:21
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Starting from next year, all civil service exams apart from a few will include
English proficiency tests, the top official in charge of the civil service
system said Monday.</P>
      <P>John Kuan, president of the Examination Yuan, made the remarks during a spring
gathering with the media along with the top officials of the Examination Yuan.</P>
      <P>The move is aimed at ensuring that the country's civil servants embrace the
world and possess an international viewpoint, Kuan said.</P>
      <P>"English proficiency tests will be one of the priority tasks this year, " he
said, adding that from next January, the tests will start being included in
civil service exams in stages.</P>
      <P>"If you can't use English, you will be constrained in many ways and your ability
to absorb new information will be limited, " Kuan said.</P>
      <P>Minister of Examination Yung Chaur-shin noted that except for three kinds of
civil service exams -- for the disabled, aborigines and  the lowest-ranking
civil  servants  in the Ministry  of Transportation and Communications -- which
will have their English proficiency tests postponed to a later date, all other
civil service exams will include the tests.</P>
      <P>Kuan noted that the inclusion of English proficiency tests is a continuation of
existing government policy.</P>
      <P>"To upgrade their competitive edge and their knowledge of world affairs, 22 out
of the 30 kinds of civil service exams have included English proficiency tests
over the past three years," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>The remaining eight exams, apart from the three categories already mentioned,
will also include English proficiency tests from next January, he said.</P>
      <P>He added that the assessment system for the performance of civil servants will
be revised over the next year and that those who have performed well will be
rewarded, while those who have performed poorly will be phased out.</P>
      <P>He noted that the assessment system for civil servants has been no more than a
formality in past years, with many considering that a civil servant position is
a well-protected "iron rice bowl" job with no fear of being sacked.</P>
      <P>Although Kuan did not specify the ratio of civil servants that should be phased
out, he stressed that "the direction is set," adding that "without the phase-out
mechanism, the civil service will be like a stagnant pond, and this is something
we do not wish to see continue."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>One of Taiwan's economic stimulus measures, the distribution of shopping
vouchers to citizens, was lauded by the top European Union (EU) representative
in Taiwan Monday as a non-discriminatory and non-protectionist program.</P>
      <P>Noting that governments all over the world have instituted fiscal packages to
stimulate domestic consumption, Guy Ledoux, head of the Taipei-based European
Economic and Trade Office (EETO) , told the Central News Agency in an exclusive
interview that the danger is that some stimulus packages could include
protectionist elements.</P>
      <P>However, Ledoux said that he was pleased to see that Taiwan's consumption
voucher program does not specify the purchase of locally produced goods over
imported products.</P>
      <P>"I welcome the fact that it isn't discriminatory. It's not a protectionist
measure," Ledoux said. "Taiwanese can go to a Taiwanese restaurant or buy a
Gucci bag if they want."</P>
      <P>Some 91 percent of eligible Taiwan citizens had picked up their NT$3, 600
(US$107) worth of vouchers by Jan. 18. The vouchers are the business end of an
NT$85.7 billion program that is part of the government's economic stimulus
package.</P>
      <P>Some critics have expressed worry that the global financial crisis might give
rise to trade protectionism, as many countries are trying to protect their
domestic markets and industries.</P>
      <P>The concerns escalated when the U.S. House of Representatives last month passed
a US$819 billion economic stimulus package, which included a "Buy American"
clause that requires public works projects that receive money from the package
to use U.S.-made iron, steel and manufactured goods.</P>
      <P>Noting that 70 percent of Taiwan's GDP is export-oriented and has been suffering
as a result of the steep drop in export demand, Ledoux said the shopping voucher
program is "certainly the right measure, " as expanding the domestic market and
continuing  to stimulate consumption are what should be done when the export
market is shrinking.</P>
      <P>Taiwan enjoys an edge over other economies, as its financial sector has not been
drastically affected by the global economic downturn and it has the fourth-
largest foreign exchange reserves in the world,  trailing  only China,  Japan
and Russia,  the EU representative noted.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's financial situation is very secure -- it can afford to continue its
stimulus packages without putting the economy at risk, " he said.</P>
      <P>As to the prospects of the global economy in 2009, Ledoux said that "everybody
hopes that sometime in the very near future, we will see the end of the tunnel
and the economy will pick up again."</P>
      <P>The EETO serves as the de facto embassy in Taiwan, promoting bilateral economic
and trade exchanges with Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic relations.</P>

      <P>More than 17,000 Chinese members of the global direct sales company Amway will
arrive in Taichung in March and April for a major conference - providing the
central Taiwanese city a chance to earn tourist revenue, officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>Anna Wang,  director  of the city government's  Industrial Development and
Investment Promotion Committee, confirmed that more than 17,000 sales
representatives and other members of Chinese Amway (China) Co., Limited are
slated to visit Taiwan from mid-March in eight groups.</P>
      <P>Taichung City edged out other cities, including those in Japan, Singapore and
South Korea, to host the large number of Chinese visitors, thanks to its large
conference centers and outdoor squares, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu on Monday expressed hope that the city's success in
winning this opportunity to host such a high number of visitors would help
inject greater momentum into Taichung's local economy.</P>
      <P>Wang said the precedent is set to mark a major breakthrough that could help the
city win the chance to host similar large-scale conferences and incentive tours
in the future.</P>
      <P>Three other Chinese companies have shown a high degree of interest in organizing
overseas conferences and travel for their workers in Taiwan, Wang added.</P>
      <P>For the upcoming event, all walks of life in Taichung City will launch full
preparations to seize handsome business opportunities expected to be worth more
than NT$ 100 million that would arise from the Chinese visitors, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The Amway (China) employees will arrive from Shanghai in eight groups on board
cruise ships and will first make a stop at Keelung Harbor in northern Taiwan and
then proceed to Haulien Harbor in eastern Taiwan before finally reaching
Taichung Harbor in central Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The Taipei-based National Palace Museum (NPM) announced Monday that it will send
a delegation to visit China's Palace Museum in Beijing Saturday, marking the
first official contact between the two museums in 60 years.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Lunar New Year luncheon, NPM Director Chou Kung-shin said that
under the "cross-Taiwan Strait Palace Museum scheme, " the NPM and its Beijing
counterpart will discuss the possibility of cooperation in the areas of
exhibition arrangements, publicity campaigns and publications, as well as
academic and staff exchanges. The NPM delegation will also visit the Shanghai
Museum for similar discussions during the trip, she added.</P>
      <P>With politics set aside, Chou expressed hope that through such cultural
exchanges, people from both sides of the Taiwan Strait will gain a better
understanding of each other so that mutual trust can be built.</P>
      <P>In the area of joint exhibitions, Chou said that while the NPM has prepared 180
items chosen from its own collection for an exhibition on Emperor Yung-cheng --
the fourth ruler of the Ching Dynasty -- which is slated to open in Taiwan in
October, she will discuss with Beijing the possibility of borrowing some
artifacts relating to the emperor.</P>
      <P>She said Beijing's exhibits in Taiwan will be guaranteed a safe return under the
country's 1992 Statute on Encouraging and Rewarding Cultural and Art
Enterprises, which stipulates that foreign art and cultural  objects  will be
exempt from seizure  or any legal entanglement over ownership.</P>
      <P>She added, however, that before any of Taiwan's treasures can be displayed in
China, a similar statute has to be put in place by the other side of the strait
to grant the same protection.</P>
      <P>Similar guarantees have been practiced worldwide over the past 20 years for
exhibit exchanges, she went on, adding that highlights of the NPM's collection
have been showcased in the United States, France,  Germany and Austria thanks to
agreements  with those countries.</P>
      <P>It is also the lack of legislative protection that hinders the NPM lending
exhibits to Belgium and Japan, although both those nations have expressed strong
interest in cooperation, she added.</P>
      <P>Chou said that in keeping with the increasing cross-strait tourism exchanges,
she will discuss cooperation with the Beijing museum on launching publicity
campaigns in the hope of attracting more visitors to both museums.</P>
      <P>In addition, as personnel from the two museums enjoy advantages in different
research fields, she said cooperation in academic exchanges will also result in
benefits for both sides.</P>
      <P>She mentioned  that there will not be any agreements  or memorandums of
understanding signed during the trip, as the main purpose of the visit is to
exchange views.</P>
      <P>The delegation, which is comprised of Chou, NPM Deputy Director Feng Ming-chu
and other museum officials, will depart for Beijing Feb. 14 and continue on to
Shanghai three days later, returning to Taiwan Feb. 19.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the Shanghai Museum will pay a return visit in late February,
while Beijing museum officials will do so in early March.</P>
      <P>The NPM -- one of the world's most famous museums -- has the world's largest
collection of Chinese historical artifacts totaling 650,000 pieces.</P>

Taiwan in its efforts to improve cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said in an interview carried Monday in
the Lianhe Zaobao, a Singapore newspaper.</P>
      <P>"Singapore is one of the few nations in the international community to have made
great contributions to the recent improved cross-strait ties," said Chiang.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, Singapore played a vital role and served as a
communications channel before cross-strait dialogue was interrupted by Taiwan's
assertions that Taiwan and China were separate states beginning in the 1990s.</P>
      <P>However, asked if Singapore will continue to serve as a platform or channel of
communication for future cross-strait negotiations, Chiang said the city-state's
role in cross-strait relations will diminish, as Taiwan's SEF and China's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) have already re-
opened cross-strait dialogues.</P>
      <P>Chiang said it is more important for Taiwan and Singapore to look ahead and find
ways to combat the worsening effects of the global economic crisis.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, Taiwan will continue to do its best to contribute to
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait relations tend to be much more complex and delicate than those
between other countries or regions, but Taiwan will continue to have dialogue
with China to seek peace and stability in the area, said the SEF chairman.</P>
      <P>He also promised that the SEF will continue to keep Singapore informed about the
newest developments in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"We are extremely grateful for the high level of support Singapore has given us,
and when the right time comes Taiwan also hopes to promote closer ties with
Singapore and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)," Chiang noted.</P>
      <P>"Bilateral relations between Taiwan and Singapore have always been close and we
should try to maintain this kind of cooperation in the future," he said.</P>
      <P>Asked if the future negotiations between the SEF and the ARATS will be held in a
third country, Chiang said the chances are slim, as the negotiation mechanism
between the two sides has already been re-established.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS serve as semi-official intermediary bodies responsible for
cross-strait affairs in the absence of official contact between the two sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan is no longer a U.S. liability: President Ma</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that Taiwan is no longer a liability to the
United States as the recent improvement in relations with China have contributed
to peace and stability in the region and led to liberalization in trade and
commerce.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the 2009 Lunar New Year Reception organized by local commercial and
industrial associations held in Taipei, Ma asserted that closer ties with China
has allowed Taiwan to be less reliant on the United States, reducing the
pressure on Washington.</P>
      <P>"At a time when the situation in the Korean Peninsula is worsening, the
improvement in cross-Taiwan Strait ties with China has significantly reduced the
burden of the United States in the region," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Lauding the benefits of closer cross-strait ties, Ma said that the U.S
government approved arms sales to Taiwan last September due to Taiwan's
determination to become a problem solver instead of a troublemaker on issues
related to China.</P>
      <P>Also,  in recognition  of Taiwan's  efforts  to seek  the normalization of
cross-strait economic ties in the spirit of trade liberalization advocated by
the World Trade Organization (WTO) , the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative
(USTR) removed Taiwan from the Special 301 Watch List on Jan. 16, Ma contended.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the president explained that the launching of direct sea and air
links will gradually  improve Taiwan's investment environment  and boost the
country's economic development  and competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Lowering tensions with China has also allowed Taiwan to play a more active role
in the international arena, having been admitted in recent months to the WTO's
Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) , and the World Health Organization's
(WHO) International Health Regulations (IHR).</P>
      <P>As for the recent rapid rise in unemployement, Ma said that the government  has
already adopted various measures  to help the unemployed, and pledged that the
government would continue to seek methods to assist those who have fallen on
hard times.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the government's plans to reduce unemployment and combat the
recent economic downturn has had a positive impact on the nation's economy.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is defeating the economic downturn, " Ma quoted the U.S.-based magazine
Global Finance as saying.</P>
      <P>Ma said that Taiwan successfully survived the first and second oil crises, the
1997 Asian Financial Crisis and the bursting of the dot. com bubble at the
beginning of this decade and expressed confidence that by uniting the will and
power of the government, the private sector and the people, Taiwan will prevail
in its attempts to ride out the current global economic storm.</P>

      <P>A turtle-shaped piece of solid gold weighing over 8 kilograms raised annual
Lantern Festival celebrations to a fever pitch in Penghu County Monday, with
locals hoping for a chance to take the golden turtle home in the belief it will
bring them wealth.</P>
      <P>Every year for over two centuries, residents of the island archipelago off
Taiwan's southwestern coast had prayed that they would win a turtle-shaped cake
-- a charm believed to bring good luck and a peaceful new year -- at local
temples on the 15th day of the first month on the lunar calendar.</P>
      <P>To bring the turtle-shaped cake home, worshipers had to receive the approval of
the god enshrined in the temple through the successful throwing a pair of half-
moon shaped divinatory blocks.</P>
      <P>The tradition required that those blessed by the gods and allowed to take the
cakes home had to bring back bigger ones to their respective temples the
following year.</P>
      <P>In one particular temple in Magong City, the tradition got out of hand.  The
cake made of rice flour,  sugar and maltose grew increasingly enormous every
year until 1988, when one man sought a compromise after winning a super turtle
rice cake weighing 7,680 kilograms.</P>
      <P>He eventually agreed with the temple to return the following year with a golden
turtle worth more than it would have cost to make an 8-ton cake.</P>
      <P>It marked the end of the "rice turtle cake competition" and began a "golden
turtle age" that other temples emulated, according to local cultural historian
Wang Wen-lian.</P>
      <P>The 8-kg "golden turtle king, " won last year by Weng Chin-lai at another Magong
temple and now worth NT$8.5 million, was the biggest prize sought after by
Penghu residents Monday.</P>
      <P>Weng's wife said their business improved after winning the turtle last year, and
Weng displayed it in his store Sunday, giving other villagers the chance to
touch it and hope some of its luck rubbed off on them before a new winner was
found a day later.</P>
      <P>Forced to bring a bigger turtle back to the temple this year, Weng decided to
return the "golden turtle king" and another golden turtle weighing 750 grams.</P>
      <P>For those Lantern Festival worshipers who do not come away with the big prize,
they will still be able to win smaller turtle-shaped rice cakes.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's famed National Palace Museum (NPM) is aiming to become the country's
engine for developing cultural and creative  industries,  starting  with the
establishment  of an educational center in the near future, an NPM official said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a New Years luncheon, NPM Director Chou Kung-shin said that prior to
the centers planned operation in 2012, the museum, with its rich cultural
heritage, will first launch a series of initiatives to boost the countrys
capacity in the area.</P>
      <P>For instance, she said that the NPM will engage firms that have business
ventures with it to provide weekly training courses starting in the middle of
the year for their design teams on how to transform the museums numerous
collection items into creative products and maximize their potential business
values.</P>
      <P>Taiwans creative industry as a whole will benefit from the program, Chou said,
adding that the image of those companies and the quality of their products will
also be elevated.</P>
      <P>In addition to courses, workshops and hardware facilities such as showcase rooms
and digital classrooms, the center will also come equipped with a hotel, a
restaurant and a tea house, all adorned in the classical Chinese style, Chou
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she said the NPM is also considering launching an exhibition  on the
Ching Dynastys  Kang-hsi emperor and his contemporary European counterpart Louis
XIV in a collaborative effort with Frances Versailles Museum in the near future.</P>
      <P>Other areas that the NPM is working on, she explained, include a renovation plan
slated to begin in April to re-design the visiting order of the museums
galleries as well as to lower the noise level observed in them, making the
museum an even more pleasant place to visit.</P>
      <P>The museum is also crafting  various educational  programs targeting different
age groups, Chou added. For example, it has launched a volunteer camp for
youngsters after the Chinese New Year, in the hope of fostering the ability to
appreciate arts in the countrys younger generation, she said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three Wei Chuan Corp. infant formulas tested by the Department of Health (DOH)
were not tainted with a lethal bacteria that China said was present in infant
formulas exported by the company to southern China last year, a government
official announced Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang Che-chiao, spokesman for the Cabinet-level DOH, said the three infant
formulas that Wei Chuan produced at its Douliou plant in Yunlin County, southern
Taiwan were determined to be free from the bacteria Enterobacter sakasakii
following an in-depth analysis by the DOH.</P>
      <P>Wang indicated, however, that the DOH will soon officially demand that Taiwan's
food producers include tests for the bacteria in their quality control processes
to ease consumer concern over food safety.</P>
      <P>Yunlin County officials collected samples of Wei Chuan's S1, S2 and S3 infant
formulas produced by its Douliou plant Feb. 3, a day after local media reported
that three different kinds of infant formula shipped by Wei Chuan from its
Douliou plant were found by Chinese customs agents in Shenzhen on Oct. 30 to be
contaminated with the bacteria Enterobacter sakazakii.</P>
      <P>The shipment of 200 cartons totaling 9.264 tons of the three infant formulas
exclusively sold in the Chinese market was said to be destroyed on the spot by
Chinese inspectors that same day, making it impossible for local officials to
verify the Chinese claims.</P>
      <P>According to Wei Chuan executives, the three exported infant formulas were not
sold in Taiwan, but operations at the company's Douliou plant were suspended
pending the result of the DOH tests.</P>
      <P>Before receiving the DOH's confirmation Monday, Yunlin County officials
previously said on Feb. 3 that the county's tests had not found any evidence
that the company's raw materials, finished products, or manufacturing facilities
were contaminated with the bacteria.</P>
      <P>The rod-shaped Enterobacter sakazakii bacteria is capable of causing meningitis
and enteritis and has a fatality rate of more than 50 percent when infecting
newborns.</P>
      <P>From 1998-2005, there were only 46 such infection cases around the world, DOH
officials said, citing data provided by the U. S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.</P>
      <P>Wei Chuan, one of Taiwan's biggest food processing companies, has been trying to
penetrate the Chinese market and exported the suspect shipment in October
through an agent in Hong Kong.</P>

      <P>The Taipei International Book Exhibition (TIBE) closed Monday after drawing
500,000 visitors since it opened Feb. 4, Taipei Book Fair Foundation Chairman
Linden Lin said, attributing the strong turnout to the government's shopping
voucher program.</P>
      <P>Lin said the vouchers' impact was especially noticeable in the stationary,
children's book and comic book pavilions that were constantly packed with young
visitors and reported sales growth.</P>
      <P>According to the foundation, 906 publishers from Taiwan and 41 other countries
joined the 2009 book fair held at the Taipei World Trade Center. During the six-
day fair, 300 seminars and new book launch sessions took place.</P>
      <P>The number of visitors to the fair far exceeded the 410,000 people who showed up
last year and the 400,000 who attended the fair in 2007, said foundation CEO Lin
Wen-chih.</P>
      <P>Unlike previous years, the 2009 fair featured national themes, arranging
publishers by nationality. The strategy proved successful, Lin said, noting that
the U.S. pavilion alone attracted 25,000 visitors, and drew 210 publishers
seeking to obtain publication copyrights.</P>
      <P>At the closing ceremony, Lin touted the book fair -- the world's second largest
-- as playing a unique role in international cultural exchanges. He said Brazil,
which was absent from this year's fair, has already asked to participate next
year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the TIBE arranged for the Munich-based Goethe Institute to
cooperate with Taiwan's Council for Cultural Affairs in translating German works
into Chinese, Lin added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Labor officials admitted Monday that they are powerless to stop the increasingly
common practice of forcing workers to take unpaid leave taken by private
enterprises to lower their costs during the global economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>The officials at the Department of Labor Standards under the Cabinet-level
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) told reporters that although they have been busy
handling complaints about unpaid leave since the fourth quarter of 2008, they
have not been able to nail any businesses for violating the labor law.</P>
      <P>"It is extremely difficult to establish whether a specific case of unpaid leave
amounts to a violation of the labor law," said one official who declined to be
named.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, many employees sent home on unpaid leave signed
agreements on the arrangement under pressure from their employers because they
feared that failure to do so might cost them their jobs.</P>
      <P>Once an employee has inked the document agreeing to taking unpaid leave, it is
impossible to accuse the employer of forcing him or her to take mandatory unpaid
leave, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The results of a survey conducted recently by the Cabinet-level Council of Labor
Affairs showed that among those enterprises that have a workforce of over 200
people, 18 percent have resorted to unpaid leave, affecting more than 200,000
workers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the administration in charge of the Hsinchu Science Park -- Taiwan's
"Silicon Valley" -- reported that some 100,000 employees, accounting for 76
percent of the total number of workers in the park, were being affected by
unpaid leave.</P>
      <P>Earlier statistics compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) showed that as of late December 2008, 741,000 people were
affected by unpaid leave nationwide.</P>
      <P>In addition to those on unpaid leave, unemployment is also on the rise. The
number of unemployed in Taiwan rose to 549,000 in December 2008, the highest
level since October 2003, DGBAS figures showed.</P>

      <P>Former first lady Wu Shu-jen will apologize to the public for her role in a
corruption and money-laundering case implicating the former first family after
her appearance in a pre-trial court session Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The wheelchair-bound former first lady will be accompanied by her son Chen Chih-
chung, who was also indicted in the same case, a staff member of former
President Chen Shui-bian's office said Monday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that Wu had a cold, but it would not affect her appearance at
the Taipei District Court Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Wu will issue a statement after her appearance in court, expressing  her sorrow
for causing  social  disturbances  and confrontation in the wake of the high-
profile case," he said.</P>
      <P>"Whether she will read the statement herself or ask others to read it on her
behalf will hinge on her physical condition at that time," he added.</P>
      <P>The former first lady was indicted in November  2006 for misappropriating
NT$14.8 million (US$440,000) in "state affairs funds" at the discretionary use
of then-president Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Wu, however, nearly fainted during a break on the trial's first day on Dec. 15,
2006 and was rushed to the hospital. She has since missed 17 consecutive hearing
dates despite repeated summons.</P>
      <P>Tuesday's pre-trial session will focus on new indictments against her and the
former first family, on charges of embezzling NT$104.15 million from the state
affairs fund, taking bribes in a land deal and an exhibition hall tender and
laundering nearly half a billion Taiwan dollars in ill-gotten funds overseas.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, National Taiwan University Hospital said it has prepared one
ambulance and four medical professionals at the request of the Taipei District
Court for Wu's court session.</P>
      <P>A hospital spokesman said the Taipei District Court will foot the bill for the
presence of the health care workers and the ambulance. Based on previous
experience, the cost of the mission will be around NT$20,000, he added.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung mass rapid transit system lost NT$2.2 billion (US$63.58 million)
in 2008 due to weak passenger demand, an official of the company responsible for
the subway system's operations said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yen Pang-chieh, president of the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp., noted that
actual losses were NT$100 million less than the originally estimated NT$2.3
billion.</P>
      <P>He noted that since the inauguration of the Red and Orange lines of the rapid
transit system in March and September last year, the operation's finances have
suffered because of low passenger volume.</P>
      <P>"To make up the financial shortfall, the company plans to increase passenger
volume by 30 percent and cut operating costs by 10 percent," he added.</P>
      <P>The company has estimated that it has annual costs, including personnel
expenses, interest payments and depreciation, of between NT$4.5 billion and
NT$4.7 billion, while revenues from ticket sales and related businesses are
around NT$2.4 billion.</P>

      <P>The Netherlands representative to Taiwan led a group of Dutch expatriates to
visit two indigenous communities in the southernmost county of Pingtung Monday
to meet with descendants of Dutch and indigenous Rukai people who married
centuries ago.</P>
      <P>Menno Goedhart, head of the Netherlands Trade and Investment Office (NTIO) in
Taipei, said he has planned to organize the trip since he came to learn four
years ago that there were intermarriages between the Dutch and Rukais back in
the 17th century when Taiwan was under Holland's colonial rule.</P>
      <P>The group, composed of members of 14 Dutch families in Taiwan as well NTIO's
Taiwanese staff and wives of the Danish and Czech Republic representatives to
Taipei, visited the mountainous townships of Wutai and Jilu, home to the Rukai
tribe.</P>
      <P>Jilu residents, all of whom are older than 60, decked out and staged a series of
traditional rituals, including killing a pig and presenting head jewelry and
tribal costumes, to welcome the guests. They also performed tribal dances to
show their hospitality.</P>
      <P>In addition, Rukai elders allowed Goedhart and his wife to perform a "strike and
feel pottery teapot" rite to symbolize their acceptance by Rukai ancestors.
Traditionally, only Rukai chieftans are eligible to perform the rite.</P>
      <P>Goedhard, who is writing a book to introduce Taiwan's indigenous tribes and
their cultures to foreign readers, said the root-seeking trip was inspired by a
story he heard during a visit to Sandimen, another indigenous community in
Pingtung County, three months ago.</P>
      <P>At the time, he came to learn that the owner of a Sandimen restaurant where he
was having lunch, identified as Yen Mei-kuei, was a fifth generation descendant
of a Dutch man and a Rukai princess.</P>
      <P>More than 100 years ago, the Dutch man met the Rukai princess in Wutai township
and they later married. The man later left Taiwan and returned to the
Netherlands, leaving the Rukai princess to raise their son on her own.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Yen Mei-kuei presented three photos of the son of the Dutch man to
Goedhart as a souvenir.</P>
      <P>Rukai elders said that for years Jilu residents were unwilling to have Yen
disclose her family's Dutch origin. As times have changed, they said, the
residents finally came to believe that the taboo should be broken.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Rukai elders said they looked forward to the Dutch visitors'
assistance in spreading Rukai culture to the world and help foreigners better
understand Taiwan's indigenous people and their history, customs and cultural
traditions.</P>
      <P>The Dutch guests presented 50 quilts as well as stationery, toys and other
articles to Jilu residents, but he was surprised to find that the village didn't
have any children as the young people had all emigrated to cities.</P>

touch it and hope some of its luck rubbed off on them before a new winner was
found a day later.</P>
      <P>Forced to bring a bigger turtle back to the temple this year, Weng decided to
return the "golden turtle king" and another golden turtle weighing 750 grams.</P>
      <P>For those Lantern Festival worshipers who do not come away with the big prize,
they will still be able to win smaller turtle-shaped rice cakes.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's famed National Palace Museum (NPM) is aiming to become the country's
engine for developing cultural and creative  industries,  starting  with the
establishment  of an educational center in the near future, an NPM official said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a New Years luncheon, NPM Director Chou Kung-shin said that prior to
the centers planned operation in 2012, the museum, with its rich cultural
heritage, will first launch a series of initiatives to boost the countrys
capacity in the area.</P>
      <P>For instance, she said that the NPM will engage firms that have business
ventures with it to provide weekly training courses starting in the middle of
the year for their design teams on how to transform the museums numerous
collection items into creative products and maximize their potential business
values.</P>
      <P>Taiwans creative industry as a whole will benefit from the program, Chou said,
adding that the image of those companies and the quality of their products will
also be elevated.</P>
      <P>In addition to courses, workshops and hardware facilities such as showcase rooms
and digital classrooms, the center will also come equipped with a hotel, a
restaurant and a tea house, all adorned in the classical Chinese style, Chou
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she said the NPM is also considering launching an exhibition  on the
Ching Dynastys  Kang-hsi emperor and his contemporary European counterpart Louis
XIV in a collaborative effort with Frances Versailles Museum in the near future.</P>
      <P>Other areas that the NPM is working on, she explained, include a renovation plan
slated to begin in April to re-design the visiting order of the museums
galleries as well as to lower the noise level observed in them, making the
museum an even more pleasant place to visit.</P>
      <P>The museum is also crafting  various educational  programs targeting different
age groups, Chou added. For example, it has launched a volunteer camp for
youngsters after the Chinese New Year, in the hope of fostering the ability to
appreciate arts in the countrys younger generation, she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Wei Chuan infant formulas safe: Department of Health</HEADLINE>

      <P>Three Wei Chuan Corp. infant formulas tested by the Department of Health (DOH)
were not tainted with a lethal bacteria that China said was present in infant
formulas exported by the company to southern China last year, a government
official announced Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang Che-chiao, spokesman for the Cabinet-level DOH, said the three infant
formulas that Wei Chuan produced at its Douliou plant in Yunlin County, southern
Taiwan were determined to be free from the bacteria Enterobacter sakasakii
following an in-depth analysis by the DOH.</P>
      <P>Wang indicated, however, that the DOH will soon officially demand that Taiwan's
food producers include tests for the bacteria in their quality control processes
to ease consumer concern over food safety.</P>
      <P>Yunlin County officials collected samples of Wei Chuan's S1, S2 and S3 infant
formulas produced by its Douliou plant Feb. 3, a day after local media reported
that three different kinds of infant formula shipped by Wei Chuan from its
Douliou plant were found by Chinese customs agents in Shenzhen on Oct. 30 to be
contaminated with the bacteria Enterobacter sakazakii.</P>
      <P>The shipment of 200 cartons totaling 9.264 tons of the three infant formulas
exclusively sold in the Chinese market was said to be destroyed on the spot by
Chinese inspectors that same day, making it impossible for local officials to
verify the Chinese claims.</P>
      <P>According to Wei Chuan executives, the three exported infant formulas were not
sold in Taiwan, but operations at the company's Douliou plant were suspended
pending the result of the DOH tests.</P>
      <P>Before receiving the DOH's confirmation Monday, Yunlin County officials
previously said on Feb. 3 that the county's tests had not found any evidence
that the company's raw materials, finished products, or manufacturing facilities
were contaminated with the bacteria.</P>
      <P>The rod-shaped Enterobacter sakazakii bacteria is capable of causing meningitis
and enteritis and has a fatality rate of more than 50 percent when infecting
newborns.</P>
      <P>From 1998-2005, there were only 46 such infection cases around the world, DOH
officials said, citing data provided by the U. S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.</P>
      <P>Wei Chuan, one of Taiwan's biggest food processing companies, has been trying to
penetrate the Chinese market and exported the suspect shipment in October
through an agent in Hong Kong.</P>

      <P>The Taipei International Book Exhibition (TIBE) closed Monday after drawing
500,000 visitors since it opened Feb. 4, Taipei Book Fair Foundation Chairman
Linden Lin said, attributing the strong turnout to the government's shopping
voucher program.</P>
      <P>Lin said the vouchers' impact was especially noticeable in the stationary,
children's book and comic book pavilions that were constantly packed with young
visitors and reported sales growth.</P>
      <P>According to the foundation, 906 publishers from Taiwan and 41 other countries
joined the 2009 book fair held at the Taipei World Trade Center. During the six-
day fair, 300 seminars and new book launch sessions took place.</P>
      <P>The number of visitors to the fair far exceeded the 410,000 people who showed up
last year and the 400,000 who attended the fair in 2007, said foundation CEO Lin
Wen-chih.</P>
      <P>Unlike previous years, the 2009 fair featured national themes, arranging
publishers by nationality. The strategy proved successful, Lin said, noting that
the U.S. pavilion alone attracted 25,000 visitors, and drew 210 publishers
seeking to obtain publication copyrights.</P>
      <P>At the closing ceremony, Lin touted the book fair -- the world's second largest
-- as playing a unique role in international cultural exchanges. He said Brazil,
which was absent from this year's fair, has already asked to participate next
year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the TIBE arranged for the Munich-based Goethe Institute to
cooperate with Taiwan's Council for Cultural Affairs in translating German works
into Chinese, Lin added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Labor officials admitted Monday that they are powerless to stop the increasingly
common practice of forcing workers to take unpaid leave taken by private
enterprises to lower their costs during the global economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>The officials at the Department of Labor Standards under the Cabinet-level
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) told reporters that although they have been busy
handling complaints about unpaid leave since the fourth quarter of 2008, they
have not been able to nail any businesses for violating the labor law.</P>
      <P>"It is extremely difficult to establish whether a specific case of unpaid leave
amounts to a violation of the labor law," said one official who declined to be
named.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, many employees sent home on unpaid leave signed
agreements on the arrangement under pressure from their employers because they
feared that failure to do so might cost them their jobs.</P>
      <P>Once an employee has inked the document agreeing to taking unpaid leave, it is
impossible to accuse the employer of forcing him or her to take mandatory unpaid
leave, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The results of a survey conducted recently by the Cabinet-level Council of Labor
Affairs showed that among those enterprises that have a workforce of over 200
people, 18 percent have resorted to unpaid leave, affecting more than 200,000
workers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the administration in charge of the Hsinchu Science Park -- Taiwan's
"Silicon Valley" -- reported that some 100,000 employees, accounting for 76
percent of the total number of workers in the park, were being affected by
unpaid leave.</P>
      <P>Earlier statistics compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) showed that as of late December 2008, 741,000 people were
affected by unpaid leave nationwide.</P>
      <P>In addition to those on unpaid leave, unemployment is also on the rise. The
number of unemployed in Taiwan rose to 549,000 in December 2008, the highest
level since October 2003, DGBAS figures showed.</P>

      <P>Former first lady Wu Shu-jen will apologize to the public for her role in a
corruption and money-laundering case implicating the former first family after
her appearance in a pre-trial court session Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The wheelchair-bound former first lady will be accompanied by her son Chen Chih-
chung, who was also indicted in the same case, a staff member of former
President Chen Shui-bian's office said Monday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that Wu had a cold, but it would not affect her appearance at
the Taipei District Court Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Wu will issue a statement after her appearance in court, expressing  her sorrow
for causing  social  disturbances  and confrontation in the wake of the high-
profile case," he said.</P>
      <P>"Whether she will read the statement herself or ask others to read it on her
behalf will hinge on her physical condition at that time," he added.</P>
      <P>The former first lady was indicted in November  2006 for misappropriating
NT$14.8 million (US$440,000) in "state affairs funds" at the discretionary use
of then-president Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Wu, however, nearly fainted during a break on the trial's first day on Dec. 15,
2006 and was rushed to the hospital. She has since missed 17 consecutive hearing
dates despite repeated summons.</P>
      <P>Tuesday's pre-trial session will focus on new indictments against her and the
former first family, on charges of embezzling NT$104.15 million from the state
affairs fund, taking bribes in a land deal and an exhibition hall tender and
laundering nearly half a billion Taiwan dollars in ill-gotten funds overseas.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, National Taiwan University Hospital said it has prepared one
ambulance and four medical professionals at the request of the Taipei District
Court for Wu's court session.</P>
      <P>A hospital spokesman said the Taipei District Court will foot the bill for the
presence of the health care workers and the ambulance. Based on previous
experience, the cost of the mission will be around NT$20,000, he added.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung mass rapid transit system lost NT$2.2 billion (US$63.58 million)
in 2008 due to weak passenger demand, an official of the company responsible for
the subway system's operations said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yen Pang-chieh, president of the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp., noted that
actual losses were NT$100 million less than the originally estimated NT$2.3
billion.</P>
      <P>He noted that since the inauguration of the Red and Orange lines of the rapid
transit system in March and September last year, the operation's finances have
suffered because of low passenger volume.</P>
      <P>"To make up the financial shortfall, the company plans to increase passenger
volume by 30 percent and cut operating costs by 10 percent," he added.</P>
      <P>The company has estimated that it has annual costs, including personnel
expenses, interest payments and depreciation, of between NT$4.5 billion and
NT$4.7 billion, while revenues from ticket sales and related businesses are
around NT$2.4 billion.</P>
      <P>The KRTC estimated passenger volume on the two lines since their inaugurations
at 30.57 million, and hoped the number would rise to 40 million this year.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung MRT was constructed on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis at a
total cost of NT$181.3 billion.</P>
      <P>Covering a total of 42.7 kilometers, the MRT system in the southern Taiwan port
city is comprised of two lines -- the east-west Orange Line and the north-south

    <HEADLINE>Dutch diplomat makes root-seeking visit to indigenous communities</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Netherlands representative to Taiwan led a group of Dutch expatriates to
visit two indigenous communities in the southernmost county of Pingtung Monday
to meet with descendants of Dutch and indigenous Rukai people who married
centuries ago.</P>
      <P>Menno Goedhart, head of the Netherlands Trade and Investment Office (NTIO) in
Taipei, said he has planned to organize the trip since he came to learn four
years ago that there were intermarriages between the Dutch and Rukais back in
the 17th century when Taiwan was under Holland's colonial rule.</P>
      <P>The group, composed of members of 14 Dutch families in Taiwan as well NTIO's
Taiwanese staff and wives of the Danish and Czech Republic representatives to
Taipei, visited the mountainous townships of Wutai and Jilu, home to the Rukai
tribe.</P>
      <P>Jilu residents, all of whom are older than 60, decked out and staged a series of
traditional rituals, including killing a pig and presenting head jewelry and
tribal costumes, to welcome the guests. They also performed tribal dances to
show their hospitality.</P>
      <P>In addition, Rukai elders allowed Goedhart and his wife to perform a "strike and
feel pottery teapot" rite to symbolize their acceptance by Rukai ancestors.
Traditionally, only Rukai chieftans are eligible to perform the rite.</P>
      <P>Goedhard, who is writing a book to introduce Taiwan's indigenous tribes and
their cultures to foreign readers, said the root-seeking trip was inspired by a
story he heard during a visit to Sandimen, another indigenous community in
Pingtung County, three months ago.</P>
      <P>At the time, he came to learn that the owner of a Sandimen restaurant where he
was having lunch, identified as Yen Mei-kuei, was a fifth generation descendant
of a Dutch man and a Rukai princess.</P>
      <P>More than 100 years ago, the Dutch man met the Rukai princess in Wutai township
and they later married. The man later left Taiwan and returned to the
Netherlands, leaving the Rukai princess to raise their son on her own.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Yen Mei-kuei presented three photos of the son of the Dutch man to
Goedhart as a souvenir.</P>
      <P>Rukai elders said that for years Jilu residents were unwilling to have Yen
disclose her family's Dutch origin. As times have changed, they said, the
residents finally came to believe that the taboo should be broken.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Rukai elders said they looked forward to the Dutch visitors'
assistance in spreading Rukai culture to the world and help foreigners better
understand Taiwan's indigenous people and their history, customs and cultural
traditions.</P>
      <P>The Dutch guests presented 50 quilts as well as stationery, toys and other
articles to Jilu residents, but he was surprised to find that the village didn't
have any children as the young people had all emigrated to cities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Dutch diplomat makes root-seeking visit to indigenous communities</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.9 (CNA)
02/10/09  12:26:01
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Netherlands representative to Taiwan led a group of Dutch expatriates to
visit two indigenous communities in the southernmost county of Pingtung Monday
to meet with descendants of Dutch and indigenous Rukai people who married
centuries ago.</P>
      <P>Menno Goedhart, head of the Netherlands Trade and Investment Office (NTIO) in
Taipei, said he has planned to organize the trip since he came to learn four
years ago that there were intermarriages between the Dutch and Rukais back in
the 17th century when Taiwan was under Holland's colonial rule.</P>
      <P>The group, composed of members of 14 Dutch families in Taiwan as well NTIO's
Taiwanese staff and wives of the Danish and Czech Republic representatives to
Taipei, visited the mountainous townships of Wutai and Jilu, home to the Rukai
tribe.</P>
      <P>Jilu residents, all of whom are older than 60, decked out and staged a series of
traditional rituals, including killing a pig and presenting head jewelry and
tribal costumes, to welcome the guests. They also performed tribal dances to
show their hospitality.</P>
      <P>In addition, Rukai elders allowed Goedhart and his wife to perform a "strike and
feel pottery teapot" rite to symbolize their acceptance by Rukai ancestors.
Traditionally, only Rukai chieftans are eligible to perform the rite.</P>
      <P>Goedhard, who is writing a book to introduce Taiwan's indigenous tribes and
their cultures to foreign readers, said the root-seeking trip was inspired by a
story he heard during a visit to Sandimen, another indigenous community in
Pingtung County, three months ago.</P>
      <P>At the time, he came to learn that the owner of a Sandimen restaurant where he
was having lunch, identified as Yen Mei-kuei, was a fifth generation descendant
of a Dutch man and a Rukai princess.</P>
      <P>More than 100 years ago, the Dutch man met the Rukai princess in Wutai township
and they later married. The man later left Taiwan and returned to the
Netherlands, leaving the Rukai princess to raise their son on her own.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Yen Mei-kuei presented three photos of the son of the Dutch man to
Goedhart as a souvenir.</P>
      <P>Rukai elders said that for years Jilu residents were unwilling to have Yen
disclose her family's Dutch origin. As times have changed, they said, the
residents finally came to believe that the taboo should be broken.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Rukai elders said they looked forward to the Dutch visitors'
assistance in spreading Rukai culture to the world and help foreigners better
understand Taiwan's indigenous people and their history, customs and cultural
traditions.</P>
      <P>The Dutch guests presented 50 quilts as well as stationery, toys and other
articles to Jilu residents, but he was surprised to find that the village didn't
have any children as the young people had all emigrated to cities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Low passenger volume leads to NT$2.2 billion in KRTC losses</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung mass rapid transit system lost NT$2.2 billion (US$63.58 million)
in 2008 due to weak passenger demand, an official of the company responsible for
the subway system's operations said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yen Pang-chieh, president of the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp., noted that
actual losses were NT$100 million less than the originally estimated NT$2.3
billion.</P>
      <P>He noted that since the inauguration of the Red and Orange lines of the rapid
transit system in March and September last year, the operation's finances have
suffered because of low passenger volume.</P>
      <P>"To make up the financial shortfall, the company plans to increase passenger
volume by 30 percent and cut operating costs by 10 percent," he added.</P>
      <P>The company has estimated that it has annual costs, including personnel
expenses, interest payments and depreciation, of between NT$4.5 billion and
NT$4.7 billion, while revenues from ticket sales and related businesses are
around NT$2.4 billion.</P>
      <P>The KRTC estimated passenger volume on the two lines since their inaugurations
at 30.57 million, and hoped the number would rise to 40 million this year.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung MRT was constructed on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis at a
total cost of NT$181.3 billion.</P>
      <P>Covering a total of 42.7 kilometers, the MRT system in the southern Taiwan port
city is comprised of two lines -- the east-west Orange Line and the north-south
Red Line.</P>

      <P>Former first lady Wu Shu-jen will apologize to the public for her role in a
corruption and money-laundering case implicating the former first family after
her appearance in a pre-trial court session Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The wheelchair-bound former first lady will be accompanied by her son Chen Chih-
chung, who was also indicted in the same case, a staff member of former
President Chen Shui-bian's office said Monday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that Wu had a cold, but it would not affect her appearance at
the Taipei District Court Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Wu will issue a statement after her appearance in court, expressing  her sorrow
for causing  social  disturbances  and confrontation in the wake of the high-
profile case," he said.</P>
      <P>"Whether she will read the statement herself or ask others to read it on her
behalf will hinge on her physical condition at that time," he added.</P>
      <P>The former first lady was indicted in November  2006 for misappropriating
NT$14.8 million (US$440,000) in "state affairs funds" at the discretionary use
of then-president Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Wu, however, nearly fainted during a break on the trial's first day on Dec. 15,
2006 and was rushed to the hospital. She has since missed 17 consecutive hearing
dates despite repeated summons.</P>
      <P>Tuesday's pre-trial session will focus on new indictments against her and the
former first family, on charges of embezzling NT$104.15 million from the state
affairs fund, taking bribes in a land deal and an exhibition hall tender and
laundering nearly half a billion Taiwan dollars in ill-gotten funds overseas.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, National Taiwan University Hospital said it has prepared one
ambulance and four medical professionals at the request of the Taipei District
Court for Wu's court session.</P>
      <P>A hospital spokesman said the Taipei District Court will foot the bill for the
presence of the health care workers and the ambulance. Based on previous
experience, the cost of the mission will be around NT$20,000, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Labor officials admit they are powerless on unpaid leave issue</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
02/10/09  12:27:07

    <TEXT>
      <P>Labor officials admitted Monday that they are powerless to stop the increasingly
common practice of forcing workers to take unpaid leave taken by private
enterprises to lower their costs during the global economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>The officials at the Department of Labor Standards under the Cabinet-level
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) told reporters that although they have been busy
handling complaints about unpaid leave since the fourth quarter of 2008, they
have not been able to nail any businesses for violating the labor law.</P>
      <P>"It is extremely difficult to establish whether a specific case of unpaid leave
amounts to a violation of the labor law," said one official who declined to be
named.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, many employees sent home on unpaid leave signed
agreements on the arrangement under pressure from their employers because they
feared that failure to do so might cost them their jobs.</P>
      <P>Once an employee has inked the document agreeing to taking unpaid leave, it is
impossible to accuse the employer of forcing him or her to take mandatory unpaid
leave, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The results of a survey conducted recently by the Cabinet-level Council of Labor
Affairs showed that among those enterprises that have a workforce of over 200
people, 18 percent have resorted to unpaid leave, affecting more than 200,000
workers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the administration in charge of the Hsinchu Science Park -- Taiwan's
"Silicon Valley" -- reported that some 100,000 employees, accounting for 76
percent of the total number of workers in the park, were being affected by
unpaid leave.</P>
      <P>Earlier statistics compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) showed that as of late December 2008, 741,000 people were
affected by unpaid leave nationwide.</P>
      <P>In addition to those on unpaid leave, unemployment is also on the rise. The
number of unemployed in Taiwan rose to 549,000 in December 2008, the highest
level since October 2003, DGBAS figures showed.</P>

      <P>The Taipei International Book Exhibition (TIBE) closed Monday after drawing
500,000 visitors since it opened Feb. 4, Taipei Book Fair Foundation Chairman
Linden Lin said, attributing the strong turnout to the government's shopping
voucher program.</P>
      <P>Lin said the vouchers' impact was especially noticeable in the stationary,
children's book and comic book pavilions that were constantly packed with young
visitors and reported sales growth.</P>
      <P>According to the foundation, 906 publishers from Taiwan and 41 other countries
joined the 2009 book fair held at the Taipei World Trade Center. During the six-
day fair, 300 seminars and new book launch sessions took place.</P>
      <P>The number of visitors to the fair far exceeded the 410,000 people who showed up
last year and the 400,000 who attended the fair in 2007, said foundation CEO Lin
Wen-chih.</P>
      <P>Unlike previous years, the 2009 fair featured national themes, arranging
publishers by nationality. The strategy proved successful, Lin said, noting that
the U.S. pavilion alone attracted 25,000 visitors, and drew 210 publishers
seeking to obtain publication copyrights.</P>
      <P>At the closing ceremony, Lin touted the book fair -- the world's second largest
-- as playing a unique role in international cultural exchanges. He said Brazil,
which was absent from this year's fair, has already asked to participate next
year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the TIBE arranged for the Munich-based Goethe Institute to
cooperate with Taiwan's Council for Cultural Affairs in translating German works
into Chinese, Lin added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee Ching-an apologized to the public Tuesday
for the turmoil triggered by a dispute over her dual citizenship status as she
was again summoned  by prosecutors  for  questioning  as part  of their
investigation into the case.</P>
      <P>Also, Lee told the media that she was sorry about the harm caused to her
supporters and the KMT.</P>
      <P>Lee said she will cooperate with prosecutors in the hope that the judiciary will
help prove her innocence.</P>
      <P>The former lawmaker refused to say, however, if she will return the compensation
she received during her time in public office, now that four of her election
wins to public office have been nullified by the Central Election Commission
(CEC).</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that she took her past public service very seriously and will
devote the rest of her life to helping more needy individuals.</P>
      <P>Last Friday, the CEC revoked its declaration of Lee's election as a member of
the seventh Taipei City Council and of the fourth, fifth and sixth Legislative
Yuans and annulled all relevant election certificates she received from 1994 to
2005, after determining that she held U.S. citizenship during that period.</P>
      <P>The CEC action did not cover her election to the seventh Legislative Yuan in
2008, a post she resigned amid mounting public pressure on Jan. 8, 2009, nearly
one year after it was discovered that she had never formally relinquished her
U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Nationality Act requires those holding dual citizenship to surrender
their foreign citizenship before assuming public office.</P>
      <P>Lee insisted that she was awaiting a retroactive ruling by U.S. authorities on
her status, after contending that holding public office in another country was
an expatriating act that automatically nullified her U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors are conducting an investigation into alleged forgery and corruption
involving Lee, based on a complaint filed by a group of Democratic Progressive
Party legislators in March 2008.</P>
      <P>The legislators alleged that by holding dual citizenship while in public office,
Lee defrauded public coffers of over NT$100 million in salary as a Taipei City
councilor between 1994 and 1998 and as a legislator from 1999 to 2009, and they
demanded that she return the "illicit gains."</P>

    <HEADLINE>EU representative praises Taiwan's EU visa waiver program</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The top European Union (EU) representative in Taiwan said Taiwan'se-Passportsand
broadened visa exemptions for some EU member countries provide a good foundation
on which the EU can initiate a discussion on making a reciprocal offer to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Guy Ledoux, head of the Taipei-based European Economic and Trade Office (EETO) ,
made the remarks in an exclusive interview with the Central News Agency Monday,
the same day the British government announced that starting March 3, holders of
Republic of China (Taiwan) passports are eligible for visa-free entry to the
United Kingdom for a maximum stay of six months.</P>
      <P>Ledoux, who serves as the de facto EU ambassador in Taiwan in the absence of
formal diplomatic relations, said the EU very much welcomed the steps taken by
Taiwan last year to eliminate visa requirements for citizens of some EU member
states and issue electronic passports, which are difficult to forge.</P>
      <P>These two steps will certainly help put in place an appropriate background to
launch a discussion on this issue in Europe, Ledoux said.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministry began issuing e-Passports Dec. 30, 2008, making Taiwan the
60th country in the world to do so. The electronic passport contains a
contactless chip and antenna embedded in its back cover, with the bearer's
biographical data and facial image stored on the chip.</P>
      <P>On visa exemptions, the foreign ministry on Oct. 1, 2008 extended visa waivers
to citizens of Poland and Slovakia for a maximum stay of 30 days, and holders of
passports from Hungary were also given visa-free entry starting Nov. 1, 2008.</P>
      <P>At present, 23 of the EU's 27 member countries are included in Taiwan's visa
waiver program, with Slovenia scheduled to be included Feb. 15, according to
Anne Hung, director-general of the ministry's Department of European Affairs.</P>
      <P>Noting that the EU has faced an influx of illegal immigrants from many parts of
the world that makes granting visa-free entry a very sensitive issue, Ledoux
said no meeting has been scheduled yet to discuss reciprocal treatment for
Taiwanese travelers to the EU, even if illegal immigrants arenot an issuewith
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the UK's decision to grant Taiwanese visa-free entry could serve
as a reference for the United States' visa waiver program, American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) spokesman Thomas Hodges remained non-committal.</P>
      <P>He told the CNA Tuesday that his agency's position on the issue remains the same
as remarks made by AIT Director Stephen Young in his biannual press conference
last November and the speech he made in a luncheon held by the American Chamber
of Commerce last December.</P>
      <P>Young said that while the U.S. is well aware of Taiwan's interest in a visa
waiver and recognizes that Taiwanese are law-biding travelers, there remained a
number of issues that needed to be resolved before Taiwan could be considered
for the visa waiver program.</P>
      <P>One issue he mentioned was that Taiwan needed to enhance efforts to ensure that
its passports are issued only to those qualified to obtain them.</P>

      <P>Considering her physical condition, the court will allow a 10-minute break after
questioning her for 30 minutes. The prosecutors will also shorten the time they
devote to their statements to allow the former first lady more time to state her
case.</P>
      <P>Tuesday's pre-trial session will focus on new indictments against her and the
former first family that charge them with embezzling NT$104.15 million from the
state affairs fund, taking bribes in a land deal and an exhibition hall tender
and laundering nearly half a billion Taiwan dollars in ill-gotten funds
overseas.</P>
      <P>Wu was previously indicted in 2006 for embezzling over NT$10 million from the

      <P>"Ai-Mei, " the first ever German-Taiwanese collaboration on a film about
lesbians, drew a capacity crowd of 600 at its world premiere  as an official
entry  in the Berlin International Film Festival's Panorama section in Berlin
Feb. 7.</P>
      <P>The feature film, also known as "Ghosted, " which tells of a mysterious love
story between two lesbians in Hamburg and Taipei, is the latest project of
German director Monika Treut, who is highly regarded for treatment of lesbian
and gender issues on the big screen.</P>
      <P>After the film's screening, Treut said that aside from her attempt to explore
the differences between the two cultures through the main characters' emotional
connections, her fascination with Taiwanese culture was also another important
motivation behind the production of the film.</P>
      <P>Noting that the project was inspired by Taiwanese ghost myths, the feminist
filmmaker said her curiosity was piqued by the German version of Taiwan novelist
Li Ang's novel "the Invisible Ghost."</P>
      <P>The novel compelled her to try to make a movie based on the concept of using a
doppelgaenger, or ghostly double of a living person.</P>
      <P>The cast includes German film and theater actress Inga Busch, who played the
role of the German artist Sophie Schmitt, and Taiwan's Ke Huan-ru,  who acted as
Schmitt's  Taiwanese  lover,  and Ke's doppelgaenger Judy Hu.</P>
      <P>Drawing a stark contrast between Taiwan and Germany, the film juxtaposes
Taiwan's colorful religious rituals,  strong family cohesion, a respect for the
dead and natural beauty with images of coldness and loneliness in Germany and
alienation among family members.</P>
      <P>Treut said "the fear of death" mind-set is widespread across Europe, and for
most Europeans, visiting tombs is a solemn affair.</P>
      <P>To her astonishment, however, Taiwanese people customarily burn a considerable
amount of paper money as offerings to the dead during Ghost Month -- the seventh
lunar month of every year -- and often hold a dialogue with the dead during
religious rituals, she added.</P>
      <P>The director also described Taiwan as an amazing nation where modern and
traditional elements as well as Chinese, American and Japanese cultures co-
exist.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan would be crowded with tourists if they were aware of such a place," she
added.</P>
      <P>The two leading actresses from Taiwan, Ke Huan-ru and Judy Hu, were also present
at the premiere.</P>
      <P>Hu said she was surprised by Treut's in-depth understanding of Taiwan, which
enabled her to portray matters related to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With the support of Filmfoerderung Hamburg GmbH, the German Federal Government
and Taiwan's Government Information Office, "Ai Mei, " was co-produced by
Treut's production company Hyena Films in Hamburg and Zweites Deutsches
Fernsehen (Second German Television) and Taiwan's Chi &amp; Company and Taiwan
Public Television Service.</P>
      <P>Treut previously  directed two documentaries  on Taiwan -- Tigerwomen Grow
Wings, about three generations of women, and Made in Taiwan, a portrait of a 17
-year-old dance student.</P>
      <P>The two films reflect growing tensions between parents and children during a
period of rapid social and political change in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Morgan Stanley says Taiwan's economy to shrink by 6% in 2009</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Morgan Stanley Taiwan predicted Tuesday that Taiwan will continue to be battered
by the global economic slowdown in 2009, with the economy contracting by 6
percent and exports falling by 23 percent.</P>
      <P>The gloomy forecast was the second in the last week by a multinational
investment firm,  after CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets predicted Feb. 4 that Taiwan's
economy would contract by 11 percent because of a major slump in exports.</P>
      <P>The forecasts contrast sharply with an estimate issued by Taiwan's Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics last Nov. 20 pegging Taiwan's 2009
economic growth at 2.12 percent. The agency is expected to issue a revised
forecast Feb. 19.</P>
      <P>Morgan Stanley Taiwan, which had previously pegged Taiwan's economic growth at
0.5 percent for 2009, said the country's gross domestic product (GDP) would
contract by between 1.5 percent and 8.8 percent for the year, and expected GDP
to decline another 2.2 percent in 2010.</P>
      <P>Global investment firms' recent reports contend that Taiwan's export-oriented
economy will not be able to maintain positive growth in the face of a severe
drop-off in exports caused by the global recession.</P>
      <P>In Tuesday's report, Morgan Stanley Taiwan predicted the Taiwan's exports would
shrink by 23 percent in 2009. On Monday, the country reported a fall of 44.1
percent drop in exports in January due to the nine-day Lunar New Year holiday,
the biggest monthly decline in history.</P>
      <P>The firm also predicted that Taiwan's benchmark stock exchange index, the Taiex,
would fluctuate between 3,350 points and 5,400 points in the coming 12 months,
with the most likely level 4,200 points.</P>
      <P>It advised  investors  to increase  their  investments  in telecommunications,
domestic consumption, and blue chip technology shares.</P>
      <P>In response to the forecast, the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) reiterated that the government has proposed and carried out many measures
to pump up the economy to try and maintain economic growth in 2009 at 2.5
percent.</P>
      <P>The economic situation should not be as dire as the foreign firm's prediction
indicates, a CEPD official said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>180,000 workers on unpaid leave: labor council</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 10 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>At least 180,000 workers across Taiwan are on unpaid leave, with those in the
high-tech sector the most likely to be given extra days off, the Cabinet-level
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The council said the estimate is based on reports on unpaid leave practices
submitted to the CLA from more than 400 companies across the country between
Dec. 23 and Jan. 31, with the aggregate number of affected workers totaling
around 180,000.</P>
      <P>The CLA has required local enterprises since January to report the number of
their workers on unpaid leave, to better monitor the impact of falling exports
on Taiwan's labor market.</P>
      <P>The CLA acknowledged that some companies with workers on unpaid leave may not
have reported their situation to the council, but because the 180,000 worker
estimate is similar to the result of an earlier survey conducted in last
December, the council believes compliance with the reporting system is quite
high.</P>
      <P>Based on a random survey of companies with over 200 workers conducted in
December, the council estimated that 202,000 workers were being forced by
management to take an average of four days of unpaid leave in that month alone.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of workers on full or partial unpaid leave in the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park in northern Taiwan has reached over 100,000,
accounting for 77 percent of the park's total work force.</P>
      <P>Amid a global economic tsunami that has battered enterprises across the world,
companies in Taiwan's high-tech, financial and conventional sectors have all
been hard hit, with many forced to scale down or shut down their operations.</P>
      <P>Some companies, however, have withstood the strain and tried hard to retain
their work forces, using flexible measures such as cutting salaries and forcing
workers to take paid or unpaid leave instead of laying them off.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) called the public attention Tuesday to what it
said was a worrying trend of drug abuse among Taiwan students beginning at
younger ages, even as early as in senior year of elementary school.</P>
      <P>Also, unlike in the past when drug abuse was mainly found among students with
more pocket money, the problem has now spread to those from disadvantaged
families who have no pocket money, said Wang Fu-lin, head of the ministry's
Department of Military Training Education.</P>
      <P>The findings by the MOE revealed that instead of buying drugs with their own
money,  these students gain access to illicit substances because their
unemployed parents have turned to drug use to try to lighten their moods, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>He reminded teachers to pay closer attention to any students who appear
unusually ecstatic or lethargic or who doze off frequently in classes.</P>
      <P>Due to the ministry's efforts to step up its monitoring of drug abuse among
students, a total of 815 offenders were found in 2008, a sharp increase from the
294 recorded the previous year, he said.</P>

      <P>A full supply of fertilizer for spring cultivation will be available soon, so
that rice farmers can begin planting,  the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yu Sheng-feng, deputy director-general of the COA's Agriculture and Food Agency,
said the agency has been coordinating with fertilizer companies and grassroots
farmers' associations to ensure a full supply of ammonium sulfate -- an
inorganic chemical compound commonly used as a fertilizer in spring rice
cultivation.</P>
      <P>With some 159,000 hectares of rice paddies across the country expected be plowed
to plant the crop in the coming peak season in March -- a similar acreage as
last year -- it is estimated that about 90,000 metric tons of ammonium sulfate
will be needed, agency officials said, noting that as much as 100,000 metric
tons of the fertilizer will be in supply.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the agency announced last week that with immediate effect, it will be
offering bigger incentives to encourage farmers to restart cultivation of fallow
lands.</P>
      <P>The plan is aimed at securing the country's food supply and stabilizing food
prices on the domestic market in view of the high prices on the world market,
said the agency.</P>
      <P>The agency will guarantee landowners an income of NT$45,000 (US$1,339) or more
per hectare for each harvest.</P>
      <P>If the owners lease their farmlands for food crop cultivation for three years in
a row, the agency will guarantee an income of over NT$50,000 per hectare for
each harvest, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The agency will also offer a subsidy of NT$20,000 per hectare to farmers who
grow feed corn, while farmers devoted to organic farming will be entitled to
NT$15,000 per hectare.</P>
      <P>Landowners who cannot resume cultivation of their farms or find tenants to lease
them, and instead plant green organic fertilizer, will be granted NT$45,000 per
hectare by the agency, according to the officials.</P>

      <P>The Taipei County government began distributing more than 80,000 masks to
elementary schools around the county Tuesday to prevent influenza outbreaks,
after the county's first case of severe influenza was reported, a county
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The local government took the step after it was confirmed that a 27-year-old
woman, surnamed Lee,  in Sanchung City had severe complicated influenza,
according to Lin Kuo-ning, an official of the county's Public Health Bureau.</P>
      <P>The woman sought medical treatment at a local hospital after falling ill and
showing symptoms of lack of appetite, fever, sore throat, and difficulty
breathing, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The case was identified by the Department of Health's Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) as the county's first severe flu infection this year, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Lee did not get an influenza vaccine last year, and her mother who lives with
her also developed mild flu symptoms, according to the bureau's investigation.</P>
      <P>As of Feb. 6, 11 cases of severe influenza had been reported in the county for
the year, a sharp increase compared with five cases recorded in the same period
of last year, according to statistics compiled by the bureau.</P>
      <P>The CDC data also shows a continuing rise in the number of emergency room visits
for parainfluenza around the country, Lin added.</P>
      <P>With the winter break about to end, the county's Public Health Bureau began
handing out 86,800 masks to 217 schools in the county for use by school children
who have flu symptoms, in an effort to reduce the risk of influenza virus
infections on campuses, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Given that young children are at high risk for influenza complications, such as
pneumococcal lung infection, Lin urged that children aged 2-5 who have been
registered as county residents and have not had the pneumococcal vaccine be
urgently taken to health centers and medical institutions for free flu shots.</P>
      <P>He also reminded people who have parainfluenza symptoms, such as a fever, cough
and sore throat, to immediately seek medical treatment and get plenty of rest to
avoid developing serious, life-threatening complications such as pneumonia and
encephalitis.</P>

      <P>Former first lady Wu Shu-jen pleaded guilty to forgery, and not guilty to the
other charges against her during a court hearing Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu, who showed up at the Taipei District Court after missing 17 consecutive
court hearings over 785 days, admitted that she used invoices from other people
to claim reimbursement from a government fund set aside for the use of her
husband, former President Chen Shui-bian, during his term as head of state.</P>
      <P>However, she denied that she embezzled public funds and said she was not guilty
of the other charges against her.</P>
      <P>Wu was first indicted along with three of Chen's former aides on Nov. 3, 2006
for siphoning off NT$14.8 million from the state affairs fund.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors brought additional charges of corruptions money laundering
against her, her husband, her son Chen Chih-chung, her daughter-in-law Huang
Jui-ching, the three aides above and seven others on Dec. 12, 2008.</P>
      <P>She fainted during her first appearance in court during the trial on Dec. 15,
2006, and missed all the subsequent hearings, despite being summoned by the
court. She claimed that her fragile physical condition would not allow her to
stand trial.</P>
      <P>In preparation for Wu's appearance in court, an ambulance and a team of four
medial workers from National Taiwan University Hospital remained on standby at
the court Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu admitted she received money from some businessmen and stashed it in overseas
bank accounts, as the prosecutors stated in their indictment against her, but
said that the funds were political donations rather than bribes, and were much
less than the amount stated in the indictment.</P>
      <P>Among the donations was a sum of US$2.2 million -- not NT$2.7 million as the
prosecutors claimed in their indictment -- from a contractor who won a
government contract to build an exhibition hall in Nangang, Taipei City thanks
to her influence, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Also the money she wired overseas was her family's private funds rather than
public funds, and her husband had no knowledge of her management of the money,
she said.</P>
      <P>The hearing lasted for about two hours and the presiding judge granted Wu's
request to postpone Wednesday's hearing to March 3 and 5 because she cannot
physically hold up in court for two days in a row.</P>
      <P>After the hearing, Wu read a statement to journalists waiting outside the court
room, apologizing for implicating "so many innocent people" in the case and for
stirring up so much social turmoil.</P>
      <P>"I will face trial and investigation openly, and will appear before the court or
prosecutors whenever I am summoned, as long as my physical condition allows." Wu
said.</P>
      <P>Of the 14 defendants, only the former president is still being held in custody.</P>
      <P>Many of these indicted, including Wu's son Chen chih-chung and her daughter-in-
law Huang Jui-ching, have pleaded guilty to money laundering charges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA welcomes Taiwan's acceptance to U.K.'s visa-free program</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Tuesday welcomed the U.K. government's
decision to include Taiwan in its visa-waiver program with effect from early
March, saying this will help expand exchanges between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The U.K. office in Taiwan announced earlier in the day that Taiwanese passport
holders who wish to visit the European country for less than six months for
business, study or tourism will no longer require visas, beginning March 3.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference, Deputy Foreign Minister David Lin noted that the
U.K. will become the first western powerhouse to lift visa requirements for
Taiwanese citizens. He expressed the hope that the U.K.'s decision will
influence the other European Union countries, the United States and Canada to
move in a similar direction.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the inclusion in the British visa waiver program will put
Taiwan on a better footing to push for admission to other visa-free programs,
especially in the Commonwealth countries such as Australia and New Zealand, he
added.</P>
      <P>With the U.K allowing Taiwanese six-month visa-free access for the purposes of
tourism, business, study and family visits, this is Taiwan's most favorable
visa-free treatment to date, compared to similar privileges granted by other
countries, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>Lo Yu-chung, director general of the ministry's Bureau of Consular Affairs
(BOCA) , said that the U.K.'s decision demonstrated that Taiwan's efforts to
prevent passport fraud by issuing ePassports late last year have been
recognized, as this has greatly reduced the number of bogus Republic of China
(R.O.C.) passports used by mainland Chinese.</P>
      <P>It also showed that Taiwanese crime and overstaying rates in the U.K. is low, as
this would have been part of the strict evaluation criteria for the visa waiver
program, he added.</P>
      <P>Based on statistics that showed over 40,000 Taiwanese visited the U.K. last
year, it is estimated that Taiwan will save up to NT$300 million (US$8.83
million) in British visa fees alone, Lo said, adding that several administrative
procedures such as fingerprinting will also be simplified.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently allows 30-day visa-free entry for British nationals visiting
the island, but the BOCA will consider providing reciprocal visa treatment for
them in light of the U.K.'s visa waiver decision, he said.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA, 31 countries worldwide, including Japan, South Korea and
Singapore, currently allow visa-free entry to Taiwan passport holders.</P>
      <P>In 2007, the U.K. was Taiwan's third largest trading partner in Europe and 17th
biggest in the world, according to MOFA.</P>
      <P>There are around 15,000 Taiwanese students currently studying in the European
country, the ministry added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corp.

a decline in business revenue in January.</P>
      <P>TSMC's consolidated revenue in January totaled about NT$13.13 billion (US$387
million), representing a 9 percent decrease from the previous month, and a big
drop of 57.8 percent year-on-year. The figure marked a new record low since the
company began to publish reports on its consolidated revenue, according to a
report released by the company.</P>
      <P>UMC reported that its revenue in January declined by 31.6 percent from the
previous  month to NT$3.15  billion,  setting a new monthly low over a period of
nearly nine years and representing a plunge of 61.62 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>TSMC also forecast a big drop in its consolidated revenue for February and
March. The average revenue for the two months is projected at between NT$9.44

      <P>UMC Chief Executive Sun Shih-wei forecast at a news briefing Tuesday that the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of jobless college and university graduates has hit 400,000 amid the
global recession that has battered Taiwan's export-oriented economy, opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Youth Director Chao Tian-lin said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chao made the claim at a workshop organized by the DPP, in which 1111 Job Bank
Vice General Manager Ryan Wu, Dean Ray Dawn of the Taipei-based China University
of Technology College of Business and representatives of unemployed young people
were invited to discuss the current situation of jobless young graduates.</P>
      <P>According to Chao, the vast unemployment figure was worked out based on both the
government statistics and 1111 Job Bank survey results.</P>
      <P>He said that while official tallies show 220,000 graduates are jobless, the 1111
Job Bank's survey results suggest that there are another 150,000 youths who have
failed to find a job within a year of graduation, while others have found only
temporary work.</P>
      <P>Citing 1111 Job Bank tallies, Wu said 45 percent of college and university
graduates did not join the labor insurance system last year.</P>
      <P>Based on the fact that Taiwan produces 320,000 graduates every year, they
speculated that about 150,000 graduates have never worked since graduation.</P>
      <P>Those people are in the group of the "invisible unemployed," said Wu, adding his
personal opinion that the nationwide unemployed population might have reached
nearly 1.3 million.</P>
      <P>Criticizing  the  government's  plan  to subsidize  private enterprises to hire
people who have been jobless for at least three months as a failed policy, Wu
claimed it is not possible for the government to lower the unemployment rate to
below 4.5 percent this year.</P>
      <P>At the workshop, Mai Chung-chiang, a student at the Department of Finance of
Taipei County-based Jinwen University of Science and Technology, complained that
he sent out over 200 job applications over the past six months, none of which
were answered.</P>
      <P>His financial straits forced him to drop out of school, Mai added.</P>
      <P>Huang Chung-you, who is studying at National Taiwan University's Graduate
Institute of National Development,  said most of his classmates are worried that
they will not be able to find work after graduation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BTCO head confident that Taiwan can combat passport fraud</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In the wake of London's announcement Monday that Taiwanese visitors will be
granted visa-free entry to the United Kingdom,  the top British representative
in Taiwan on Tuesday expressed confidence in the Taiwan authorities' ability to
combat the problem of fraudulent documentation.</P>
      <P>David Campbell, who assumed office a week ago as the director of the Taipei-
based British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) , told the Central News Agency
that the problem of false documentation is a worldwide one. The U.K. addresses
that issue by maintaining very close links with immigration authorities around
the world, including in Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>"We have very good and regular contacts with the immigration authorities here,
and I would expect that only to further strengthen with the announcement
yesterday," said Campbell, who is the de facto British ambassador to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Following Britain's first global review of visa requirements for travel there,
British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced in a statement Monday that
starting March 3, holders of Republic of China (Taiwan) passports will be
eligible for visa-free entry to the United Kingdom for a maximum stay of six
months.</P>
      <P>Britain is the first major Western country to include Taiwan in its visa waiver
program.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the British government is worried that Taiwanese passports will
become an attractive tool for Chinese gangsters, Campbell said that as Taiwan
has taken a number of steps, such as the introduction of electronic passports,
to combat misuse of documentation, his office is confident that "the risks as
such can be managed."</P>
      <P>The new BTCO director said that the visa waiver decision will benefit the
economic, trade and people-to-people exchanges between the U.K. and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was the only country to be granted visa exemption in the U.K.'s two-year
visa review, while stricter requirements will</P>
      <P>now be introduced for visitors from Bolivia, Lesotho, South Africa,</P>
      <P>Swaziland and Venezuela.</P>
      <P>The BTCO received over 28,000 visa applications in 2008. After March 3, that
figure is expected to fall to 6,000-8,000 a year, according to the BTCO, which
serves as the de facto British embassy in Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic relations.</P>

      <P>The campaign subsidies received by former Kuomintang Legislator Lee Ching-an
between 1994 and 2005 will not be reclaimed, even though her election to public
office during that period have been nullified due to her illegally holding dual
citizenship, the Central Election Commission (CEC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the CEC, the Public Officials Election and Recall Act does not
forbid those with dual citizenship from running for public office, although they
are required to surrender their foreign citizenship before assuming office.</P>
      <P>A campaign subsidy of NT$30 per vote is provided to any eligible candidate,
regardless of whether they are elected or not, the CEC said.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 6, the CEC revoked its declaration of Lee's election as a member of the
seventh Taipei City Council and of the fourth, fifth and sixth Legislative yuans
and annulled all relevant election certificates she received from 1994 to 2005,
after determining that she held U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>The CEC action does not cover Lee's election to the seventh Legislative Yuan in
2008, because the jurisdiction for handling dual citizenship involving a
legislator was transferred to the Legislative Yuan following a 2007 amendment to
the Public Officials Election and Recall Law.</P>
      <P>Although Lee had held public office in Taiwan for so many years, it was not
until March 2008 that she was found to have never relinquished her U.S.
citizenship. She resigned from her latest legislative post amid mounting public
pressure Jan. 8, following confirmation by the U.S. authorities in late 2008
that she "has previously been documented as a U.S. citizen with a U.S. passport
and that no subsequent loss of U.S. citizenship has been documented."</P>

      <P>As part of the 2009 Taiwan International Festival, Spain's Compania Nacional de
Danza (CND) will perform the work "Alas" at Taipei's National Theater Concert
Hall (NTCH) March 3-8, NTCH artistic director Liu Chung-shu announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"We are highly anxious to experience the visual flair and passion of Spain's
most celebrated dance company and would like to urge Taiwan's dance lovers to
take advantage of this rare opportunity," said Liu.</P>
      <P>Alas, which means wings in Spanish, is the first collaborative work between
CND's acclaimed director Nacho Duato and Slovenian theater director Tomas
Pandur, said Liu.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, Alas is a deeply poetic and visually stunning mediation on one
of the most influential films of the 20th century.</P>
      <P>"Alas was inspired by the Wim Wenders 1987 film, 'Wings of Desire,' which is the
story of an angel wandering in post-war Berlin, who wishes for mortality in
order to experience the joys of everyday life." Liu said.</P>
      <P>For his text, Pandur chooses short fragments of Peter Handke's script for the
film, said Liu, adding that nevertheless, Duato's choreography does not
explicitly parallel the movie.</P>
      <P>Liu said one of the highlights of the presentation is that Duarto himself dances
and recites a series of monologues in the central role of Damiel, the ever
watchful angel.</P>
      <P>The collaboration between the two artists is a match made in heaven, as Pandur
uses his bold sense of theater to reinforce Duato's choreography, said Liu.</P>
      <P>The music will be original compositions by Pedro Alcalde and Sergio Caballero,
both of whom have previously composed for CND, Liu added.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Duato will also work with a long-time collaborator, Brad Fields, who
is responsible for lighting, said Liu.</P>
      <P>According to the information provided by the CND, having worked under Jiri
Kylian at Nederlands Dans Theater, Nacho Duato has developed a modern style
based on classical ballet that challenges contemporary dance trends.</P>
      <P>Considered one of the most internationally renowned scenic contemporary
creators, Duato has created dramatically charged works of overwhelming beauty,
it stated.</P>

      <P>Parliamentary supervision can contribute to the consolidation of often-imperfect
democratic mechanisms, visiting Swedish Chief Parliamentary Ombudsman Mats Melin
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>During a speech titled "200 Years of Parliament" delivered at the Control Yuan,
Melin said that according to Sweden's experience, parliamentary supervision can
fortify a nation's democracy and help its development.</P>
      <P>Parliamentary  supervision  promotes  an  excellent  social environment,  said
Melin,  adding that in recognition  of its importance, Sweden will launch a
series of activities to celebrate the 200th  anniversary  of the establishment
of the Swedish Parliamentary Ombudsmen.</P>
      <P>Melin said that his main job is to supervise judges and government officials and
to expose public servants who have committed crimes or who have failed to
fulfill their responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Control  Yuan chief  Wang Chien-shien  said the government supervision mechanism
is like a "preservative" that prevents government departments and agencies from
"rotting."</P>
      <P>In recognition of Melin's status in the international arena, Wang presented him
with a First Class Supervision medal.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the Control Yuan will send representatives to participate in
the ninth international ombudsman institute world conference, which will be held
in the Swedish capital of Stockholm June 9-12.</P>
      <P>Melin, who is visiting Taiwan Feb. 10-14, will also meet with President Ma Ying-
jeou to share his experience in parliamentary supervision.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan has the powers of impeachment, censure and audit.  In addition,
it can take corrective measures against government departments and agencies.</P>

through voucher spending.</P>
      <P>"We want to provide more business opportunities to the 3C industry amid the

      <P>According to the TCA, unlike the other major computer exhibitions in Taiwan,
this one will offer a variety of attractive deals to consumers who purchase 3C

      <P>"This is the first time the government has issued shopping vouchers and we do
not want to miss the opportunity to exploit the great business opportunities

      <P>The Taichung Drug Abuse Treatment Center has succeeded in using violin lessons
over the past six months to help with the treatment and rehabilitation of 40
drug abusers, center director Chou Hui-huang said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, the violin class was first offered last July. Under the
guidance of violinist Wu Wen-tung, a former conductor of the Chi Mei Mandolin
Orchestra, 20 drug abusers attended a three-hour class every week and learned
the rudiments of the instrument in three months.</P>
      <P>The students gave a successful concert at the end of the program and the
overwhelming public response to the music therapy program prompted the center to
invite the teacher to conduct a second class, taking on 20 more drug abusers
undergoing rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>The students in the second class marked the conclusion of their three months of
training with a concert Tuesday and family members were elated to see the
results  and share the joy in their achievements.</P>
      <P>Chou said that in learning how to play the violin, the drug abusers have built

      <P>A group of Chinese visitors left Taiwan Tuesday after staging a protest at the
airport and getting a combined NT$1.7 million (US$50,000) -- equivalent to their
combined tour fee -- paid by a local travel agent for what they described as a
fraud scheme they encountered while in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Before taking a flight back to China from the Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport, the 34 Chinese visitors refused to board but instead staged a noisy
protest against the swindle to which they were subjected.</P>
      <P>The tourists entered Taiwan Feb. 5 and were scheduled to leave Feb. 10. They
visited Sun Moon Lake and Alishan Mountain in central and southern Taiwan during
their six-day stay.</P>
      <P>The results of an initial investigation by airport police show that the Chinese
visitors were apparently cheated into participating in a so-called "global
Chinese art contest" held at a technology company in Taipei City, because an
invitation card that the Chinese visitors showed to them was apparently fake.</P>
      <P>Huang Yen, one of the tourists, said they felt cheated as they did not get any
cash award from the contest and because their itinerary in Taiwan was not the
same as the one listed on their contracts.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, they reported the case to police in Taipei County, but they
refused to handle the case, telling them instead that the case was "not
established."</P>
      <P>"We want our rights to be served before we leave Taiwan and we want those in
charge to return our tour fees," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Each of the 34 tourists paid from 8,100-8,800 Chinese yuan for the tour.</P>
      <P>The travel agency that hosted the tourists claimed to know nothing about the
contest and said the deal was brokered through a local man surnamed Cheng.</P>
      <P>Taipei city government spokesman Yang Siao-dong later confirmed that the
invitation card given to the tourists was forged.</P>
      <P>Yang expressed regret over the incident and said it might hobble cross-Taiwan
Strait exchanges at a time when Taiwan and China are committed to bolstering
two-way activity.</P>
      <P>He urged local organizations and individuals to be on guard against similar
cases and to verify any such invitations with the city government before
accepting them.</P>

      <P>The Export Processing Zone Administration under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) said Tuesday that it has completed the screening of a plan to establish a
new industrial park in the southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Officials at the EPZ Administration said the MOEA will submit the plan to the
Cabinet in March for approval.</P>
      <P>They added that under the plan, all infrastructure projects in the park will be
completed by mid-2010 in order to allow high-tech industries to move in.</P>
      <P>The 8.48-hectare tract of land for the proposed park is the site of a former
Veterans Plastics Work factory opposite the Nanzih Export Processing Zone in
Kaohsiung's Nanzih district. The project to develop the park will cost about
NT$1.8 billion (US$31.81 million).</P>
      <P>According to the officials, once the park is completed, it is expected to
attract investment totaling NT$10 billion from high-tech industrial companies
and create some 2,700 jobs, with an annual business turnover of NT$15 billion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the EPZ Administration is continuing with a land renewal program that
started in 2006 to rejuvenate three 40-year-old export processing zones in
Kaohsiung, Nanzih and Taichung to meet the needs of high technology industries,
including the integrated circuit industry and the liquid crystal display
industry.</P>
      <P>As of the end of last year, 98 buildings in the three zones had been renovated

    <HEADLINE>Morgan Stanley says Taiwan's economy to shrink by 6% in 2009</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Morgan Stanley Taiwan predicted Tuesday that Taiwan will continue to be battered
by the global economic slowdown in 2009, with the economy contracting by 6
percent and exports falling by 23 percent.</P>
      <P>The gloomy forecast was the second in the last week by a multinational
investment firm,  after CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets predicted Feb. 4 that Taiwan's
economy would contract by 11 percent because of a major slump in exports.</P>
      <P>The forecasts contrast sharply with an estimate issued by Taiwan's Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics last Nov. 20 pegging Taiwan's 2009
economic growth at 2.12 percent. The agency is expected to issue a revised
forecast Feb. 19.</P>
      <P>Morgan Stanley Taiwan, which had previously pegged Taiwan's economic growth at
0.5 percent for 2009, said the country's gross domestic product (GDP) would
contract by between 1.5 percent and 8.8 percent for the year, and expected GDP
to decline another 2.2 percent in 2010.</P>
      <P>Global investment firms' recent reports contend that Taiwan's export-oriented
economy will not be able to maintain positive growth in the face of a severe
drop-off in exports caused by the global recession.</P>
      <P>In Tuesday's report, Morgan Stanley Taiwan predicted the Taiwan's exports would
shrink by 23 percent in 2009. On Monday, the country reported a fall of 44.1
percent drop in exports in January due to the nine-day Lunar New Year holiday,
the biggest monthly decline in history.</P>
      <P>The firm also predicted that Taiwan's benchmark stock exchange index, the Taiex,
would fluctuate between 3,350 points and 5,400 points in the coming 12 months,
with the most likely level 4,200 points.</P>
      <P>It advised  investors  to increase  their  investments  in telecommunications,
domestic consumption, and blue chip technology shares.</P>
      <P>In response to the forecast, the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) reiterated that the government has proposed and carried out many measures
to pump up the economy to try and maintain economic growth in 2009 at 2.5
percent.</P>
      <P>The economic situation should not be as dire as the foreign firm's prediction
indicates, a CEPD official said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>At least 180,000 workers across Taiwan are on unpaid leave, with those in the
high-tech sector the most likely to be given extra days off, the Cabinet-level
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The council said the estimate is based on reports on unpaid leave practices
submitted to the CLA from more than 400 companies across the country between
Dec. 23 and Jan. 31, with the aggregate number of affected workers totaling
around 180,000.</P>
      <P>The CLA has required local enterprises since January to report the number of
their workers on unpaid leave, to better monitor the impact of falling exports
on Taiwan's labor market.</P>
      <P>The CLA acknowledged that some companies with workers on unpaid leave may not
have reported their situation to the council, but because the 180,000 worker
estimate is similar to the result of an earlier survey conducted in last
December, the council believes compliance with the reporting system is quite
high.</P>
      <P>Based on a random survey of companies with over 200 workers conducted in
December, the council estimated that 202,000 workers were being forced by
management to take an average of four days of unpaid leave in that month alone.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of workers on full or partial unpaid leave in the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park in northern Taiwan has reached over 100,000,
accounting for 77 percent of the park's total work force.</P>
      <P>Amid a global economic tsunami that has battered enterprises across the world,
companies in Taiwan's high-tech, financial and conventional sectors have all
been hard hit, with many forced to scale down or shut down their operations.</P>
      <P>Some companies, however, have withstood the strain and tried hard to retain
their work forces, using flexible measures such as cutting salaries and forcing
workers to take paid or unpaid leave instead of laying them off.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) called the public attention Tuesday to what it
said was a worrying trend of drug abuse among Taiwan students beginning at
younger ages, even as early as in senior year of elementary school.</P>
      <P>Also, unlike in the past when drug abuse was mainly found among students with
more pocket money, the problem has now spread to those from disadvantaged
families who have no pocket money, said Wang Fu-lin, head of the ministry's
Department of Military Training Education.</P>
      <P>The findings by the MOE revealed that instead of buying drugs with their own
money,  these students gain access to illicit substances because their
unemployed parents have turned to drug use to try to lighten their moods, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>He reminded teachers to pay closer attention to any students who appear
unusually ecstatic or lethargic or who doze off frequently in classes.</P>
      <P>Due to the ministry's efforts to step up its monitoring of drug abuse among
students, a total of 815 offenders were found in 2008, a sharp increase from the
294 recorded the previous year, he said.</P>

      <P>A full supply of fertilizer for spring cultivation will be available soon, so
that rice farmers can begin planting,  the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yu Sheng-feng, deputy director-general of the COA's Agriculture and Food Agency,
said the agency has been coordinating with fertilizer companies and grassroots
farmers' associations to ensure a full supply of ammonium sulfate -- an
inorganic chemical compound commonly used as a fertilizer in spring rice
cultivation.</P>
      <P>With some 159,000 hectares of rice paddies across the country expected be plowed
to plant the crop in the coming peak season in March -- a similar acreage as
last year -- it is estimated that about 90,000 metric tons of ammonium sulfate
will be needed, agency officials said, noting that as much as 100,000 metric
tons of the fertilizer will be in supply.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the agency announced last week that with immediate effect, it will be
offering bigger incentives to encourage farmers to restart cultivation of fallow
lands.</P>
      <P>The plan is aimed at securing the country's food supply and stabilizing food
prices on the domestic market in view of the high prices on the world market,
said the agency.</P>
      <P>The agency will guarantee landowners an income of NT$45,000 (US$1,339) or more
per hectare for each harvest.</P>
      <P>If the owners lease their farmlands for food crop cultivation for three years in
a row, the agency will guarantee an income of over NT$50,000 per hectare for
each harvest, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The agency will also offer a subsidy of NT$20,000 per hectare to farmers who
grow feed corn, while farmers devoted to organic farming will be entitled to
NT$15,000 per hectare.</P>
      <P>Landowners who cannot resume cultivation of their farms or find tenants to lease
them, and instead plant green organic fertilizer, will be granted NT$45,000 per
hectare by the agency, according to the officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei County provides schools with 80,000 masks against flu</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Taipei County government began distributing more than 80,000 masks to
elementary schools around the county Tuesday to prevent influenza outbreaks,
after the county's first case of severe influenza was reported, a county
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The local government took the step after it was confirmed that a 27-year-old
woman, surnamed Lee,  in Sanchung City had severe complicated influenza,
according to Lin Kuo-ning, an official of the county's Public Health Bureau.</P>
      <P>The woman sought medical treatment at a local hospital after falling ill and
showing symptoms of lack of appetite, fever, sore throat, and difficulty
breathing, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The case was identified by the Department of Health's Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) as the county's first severe flu infection this year, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Lee did not get an influenza vaccine last year, and her mother who lives with
her also developed mild flu symptoms, according to the bureau's investigation.</P>
      <P>As of Feb. 6, 11 cases of severe influenza had been reported in the county for
the year, a sharp increase compared with five cases recorded in the same period
of last year, according to statistics compiled by the bureau.</P>
      <P>The CDC data also shows a continuing rise in the number of emergency room visits
for parainfluenza around the country, Lin added.</P>
      <P>With the winter break about to end, the county's Public Health Bureau began
handing out 86,800 masks to 217 schools in the county for use by school children
who have flu symptoms, in an effort to reduce the risk of influenza virus
infections on campuses, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Given that young children are at high risk for influenza complications, such as
pneumococcal lung infection, Lin urged that children aged 2-5 who have been
registered as county residents and have not had the pneumococcal vaccine be
urgently taken to health centers and medical institutions for free flu shots.</P>
      <P>He also reminded people who have parainfluenza symptoms, such as a fever, cough
and sore throat, to immediately seek medical treatment and get plenty of rest to
avoid developing serious, life-threatening complications such as pneumonia and
encephalitis.</P>

      <P>Former first lady Wu Shu-jen pleaded guilty to forgery, and not guilty to the
other charges against her during a court hearing Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu, who showed up at the Taipei District Court after missing 17 consecutive
court hearings over 785 days, admitted that she used invoices from other people
to claim reimbursement from a government fund set aside for the use of her
husband, former President Chen Shui-bian, during his term as head of state.</P>
      <P>However, she denied that she embezzled public funds and said she was not guilty
of the other charges against her.</P>
      <P>Wu was first indicted along with three of Chen's former aides on Nov. 3, 2006
for siphoning off NT$14.8 million from the state affairs fund.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors brought additional charges of corruptions money laundering
against her, her husband, her son Chen Chih-chung, her daughter-in-law Huang
Jui-ching, the three aides above and seven others on Dec. 12, 2008.</P>
      <P>She fainted during her first appearance in court during the trial on Dec. 15,
2006, and missed all the subsequent hearings, despite being summoned by the
court. She claimed that her fragile physical condition would not allow her to
stand trial.</P>
      <P>In preparation for Wu's appearance in court, an ambulance and a team of four
medial workers from National Taiwan University Hospital remained on standby at
the court Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu admitted she received money from some businessmen and stashed it in overseas
bank accounts, as the prosecutors stated in their indictment against her, but
said that the funds were political donations rather than bribes, and were much
less than the amount stated in the indictment.</P>
      <P>Among the donations was a sum of US$2.2 million -- not NT$2.7 million as the
prosecutors claimed in their indictment -- from a contractor who won a
government contract to build an exhibition hall in Nangang, Taipei City thanks
to her influence, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Also the money she wired overseas was her family's private funds rather than
public funds, and her husband had no knowledge of her management of the money,
she said.</P>
      <P>The hearing lasted for about two hours and the presiding judge granted Wu's
request to postpone Wednesday's hearing to March 3 and 5 because she cannot
physically hold up in court for two days in a row.</P>
      <P>After the hearing, Wu read a statement to journalists waiting outside the court
room, apologizing for implicating "so many innocent people" in the case and for
stirring up so much social turmoil.</P>
      <P>"I will face trial and investigation openly, and will appear before the court or
prosecutors whenever I am summoned, as long as my physical condition allows." Wu
said.</P>
      <P>Of the 14 defendants, only the former president is still being held in custody.</P>
      <P>Many of these indicted, including Wu's son Chen chih-chung and her daughter-in-
law Huang Jui-ching, have pleaded guilty to money laundering charges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA welcomes Taiwan's acceptance to U.K.'s visa-free program</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Tuesday welcomed the U.K. government's
decision to include Taiwan in its visa-waiver program with effect from early
March, saying this will help expand exchanges between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The U.K. office in Taiwan announced earlier in the day that Taiwanese passport
holders who wish to visit the European country for less than six months for
business, study or tourism will no longer require visas, beginning March 3.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference, Deputy Foreign Minister David Lin noted that the
U.K. will become the first western powerhouse to lift visa requirements for
Taiwanese citizens. He expressed the hope that the U.K.'s decision will
influence the other European Union countries, the United States and Canada to
move in a similar direction.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the inclusion in the British visa waiver program will put
Taiwan on a better footing to push for admission to other visa-free programs,
especially in the Commonwealth countries such as Australia and New Zealand, he
added.</P>
      <P>With the U.K allowing Taiwanese six-month visa-free access for the purposes of
tourism, business, study and family visits, this is Taiwan's most favorable
visa-free treatment to date, compared to similar privileges granted by other
countries, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>Lo Yu-chung, director general of the ministry's Bureau of Consular Affairs
(BOCA) , said that the U.K.'s decision demonstrated that Taiwan's efforts to
prevent passport fraud by issuing ePassports late last year have been
recognized, as this has greatly reduced the number of bogus Republic of China
(R.O.C.) passports used by mainland Chinese.</P>
      <P>It also showed that Taiwanese crime and overstaying rates in the U.K. is low, as
this would have been part of the strict evaluation criteria for the visa waiver
program, he added.</P>
      <P>Based on statistics that showed over 40,000 Taiwanese visited the U.K. last
year, it is estimated that Taiwan will save up to NT$300 million (US$8.83
million) in British visa fees alone, Lo said, adding that several administrative
procedures such as fingerprinting will also be simplified.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently allows 30-day visa-free entry for British nationals visiting
the island, but the BOCA will consider providing reciprocal visa treatment for
them in light of the U.K.'s visa waiver decision, he said.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA, 31 countries worldwide, including Japan, South Korea and
Singapore, currently allow visa-free entry to Taiwan passport holders.</P>
      <P>In 2007, the U.K. was Taiwan's third largest trading partner in Europe and 17th
biggest in the world, according to MOFA.</P>
      <P>There are around 15,000 Taiwanese students currently studying in the European
country, the ministry added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corp.
(UMC), Taiwan's two biggest contract chip manufacturers, on Tuesday both posted
a decline in business revenue in January.</P>
      <P>TSMC's consolidated revenue in January totaled about NT$13.13 billion (US$387
million), representing a 9 percent decrease from the previous month, and a big
drop of 57.8 percent year-on-year. The figure marked a new record low since the
company began to publish reports on its consolidated revenue, according to a
report released by the company.</P>
      <P>UMC reported that its revenue in January declined by 31.6 percent from the
previous  month to NT$3.15  billion,  setting a new monthly low over a period of
nearly nine years and representing a plunge of 61.62 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>TSMC also forecast a big drop in its consolidated revenue for February and
March. The average revenue for the two months is projected at between NT$9.44
billion and NT$10.94 billion.</P>
      <P>UMC Chief Executive Sun Shih-wei forecast at a news briefing Tuesday that the
company's sales will continue to slide in February but the downturn will bottom
out in the first quarter. Sun said according to the report, the company's
consolidated revenue is expected to rebound in March and reach NT$4 billion by
that time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Unemployment among college graduates hits 400,000: DPP</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of jobless college and university graduates has hit 400,000 amid the
global recession that has battered Taiwan's export-oriented economy, opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Youth Director Chao Tian-lin said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chao made the claim at a workshop organized by the DPP, in which 1111 Job Bank
Vice General Manager Ryan Wu, Dean Ray Dawn of the Taipei-based China University
of Technology College of Business and representatives of unemployed young people
were invited to discuss the current situation of jobless young graduates.</P>
      <P>According to Chao, the vast unemployment figure was worked out based on both the
government statistics and 1111 Job Bank survey results.</P>
      <P>He said that while official tallies show 220,000 graduates are jobless, the 1111
Job Bank's survey results suggest that there are another 150,000 youths who have
failed to find a job within a year of graduation, while others have found only
temporary work.</P>
      <P>Citing 1111 Job Bank tallies, Wu said 45 percent of college and university
graduates did not join the labor insurance system last year.</P>
      <P>Based on the fact that Taiwan produces 320,000 graduates every year, they
speculated that about 150,000 graduates have never worked since graduation.</P>
      <P>Those people are in the group of the "invisible unemployed," said Wu, adding his
personal opinion that the nationwide unemployed population might have reached
nearly 1.3 million.</P>
      <P>Criticizing  the  government's  plan  to subsidize  private enterprises to hire
people who have been jobless for at least three months as a failed policy, Wu
claimed it is not possible for the government to lower the unemployment rate to
below 4.5 percent this year.</P>
      <P>At the workshop, Mai Chung-chiang, a student at the Department of Finance of
Taipei County-based Jinwen University of Science and Technology, complained that
he sent out over 200 job applications over the past six months, none of which
were answered.</P>
      <P>His financial straits forced him to drop out of school, Mai added.</P>
      <P>Huang Chung-you, who is studying at National Taiwan University's Graduate
Institute of National Development,  said most of his classmates are worried that
they will not be able to find work after graduation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BTCO head confident that Taiwan can combat passport fraud</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In the wake of London's announcement Monday that Taiwanese visitors will be
granted visa-free entry to the United Kingdom,  the top British representative
in Taiwan on Tuesday expressed confidence in the Taiwan authorities' ability to
combat the problem of fraudulent documentation.</P>
      <P>David Campbell, who assumed office a week ago as the director of the Taipei-
based British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) , told the Central News Agency
that the problem of false documentation is a worldwide one. The U.K. addresses
that issue by maintaining very close links with immigration authorities around
the world, including in Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>"We have very good and regular contacts with the immigration authorities here,
and I would expect that only to further strengthen with the announcement
yesterday," said Campbell, who is the de facto British ambassador to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Following Britain's first global review of visa requirements for travel there,
British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced in a statement Monday that
starting March 3, holders of Republic of China (Taiwan) passports will be
eligible for visa-free entry to the United Kingdom for a maximum stay of six
months.</P>
      <P>Britain is the first major Western country to include Taiwan in its visa waiver
program.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the British government is worried that Taiwanese passports will
become an attractive tool for Chinese gangsters, Campbell said that as Taiwan
has taken a number of steps, such as the introduction of electronic passports,
to combat misuse of documentation, his office is confident that "the risks as
such can be managed."</P>
      <P>The new BTCO director said that the visa waiver decision will benefit the
economic, trade and people-to-people exchanges between the U.K. and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was the only country to be granted visa exemption in the U.K.'s two-year
visa review, while stricter requirements will</P>
      <P>now be introduced for visitors from Bolivia, Lesotho, South Africa,</P>
      <P>Swaziland and Venezuela.</P>
      <P>The BTCO received over 28,000 visa applications in 2008. After March 3, that
figure is expected to fall to 6,000-8,000 a year, according to the BTCO, which
serves as the de facto British embassy in Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic relations.</P>

      <P>The campaign subsidies received by former Kuomintang Legislator Lee Ching-an
between 1994 and 2005 will not be reclaimed, even though her election to public
office during that period have been nullified due to her illegally holding dual
citizenship, the Central Election Commission (CEC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the CEC, the Public Officials Election and Recall Act does not
forbid those with dual citizenship from running for public office, although they
are required to surrender their foreign citizenship before assuming office.</P>
      <P>A campaign subsidy of NT$30 per vote is provided to any eligible candidate,
regardless of whether they are elected or not, the CEC said.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 6, the CEC revoked its declaration of Lee's election as a member of the
seventh Taipei City Council and of the fourth, fifth and sixth Legislative yuans
and annulled all relevant election certificates she received from 1994 to 2005,
after determining that she held U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>The CEC action does not cover Lee's election to the seventh Legislative Yuan in
2008, because the jurisdiction for handling dual citizenship involving a
legislator was transferred to the Legislative Yuan following a 2007 amendment to
the Public Officials Election and Recall Law.</P>
      <P>Although Lee had held public office in Taiwan for so many years, it was not
until March 2008 that she was found to have never relinquished her U.S.
citizenship. She resigned from her latest legislative post amid mounting public
pressure Jan. 8, following confirmation by the U.S. authorities in late 2008
that she "has previously been documented as a U.S. citizen with a U.S. passport
and that no subsequent loss of U.S. citizenship has been documented."</P>

      <P>As part of the 2009 Taiwan International Festival, Spain's Compania Nacional de
Danza (CND) will perform the work "Alas" at Taipei's National Theater Concert
Hall (NTCH) March 3-8, NTCH artistic director Liu Chung-shu announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"We are highly anxious to experience the visual flair and passion of Spain's
most celebrated dance company and would like to urge Taiwan's dance lovers to
take advantage of this rare opportunity," said Liu.</P>
      <P>Alas, which means wings in Spanish, is the first collaborative work between
CND's acclaimed director Nacho Duato and Slovenian theater director Tomas
Pandur, said Liu.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, Alas is a deeply poetic and visually stunning mediation on one
of the most influential films of the 20th century.</P>
      <P>"Alas was inspired by the Wim Wenders 1987 film, 'Wings of Desire,' which is the
story of an angel wandering in post-war Berlin, who wishes for mortality in
order to experience the joys of everyday life." Liu said.</P>
      <P>For his text, Pandur chooses short fragments of Peter Handke's script for the
film, said Liu, adding that nevertheless, Duato's choreography does not
explicitly parallel the movie.</P>
      <P>Liu said one of the highlights of the presentation is that Duarto himself dances
and recites a series of monologues in the central role of Damiel, the ever
watchful angel.</P>
      <P>The collaboration between the two artists is a match made in heaven, as Pandur
uses his bold sense of theater to reinforce Duato's choreography, said Liu.</P>
      <P>The music will be original compositions by Pedro Alcalde and Sergio Caballero,
both of whom have previously composed for CND, Liu added.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Duato will also work with a long-time collaborator, Brad Fields, who
is responsible for lighting, said Liu.</P>
      <P>According to the information provided by the CND, having worked under Jiri
Kylian at Nederlands Dans Theater, Nacho Duato has developed a modern style
based on classical ballet that challenges contemporary dance trends.</P>
      <P>Considered one of the most internationally renowned scenic contemporary
creators, Duato has created dramatically charged works of overwhelming beauty,
it stated.</P>

Melin said that according to Sweden's experience, parliamentary supervision can
fortify a nation's democracy and help its development.</P>

to expose public servants who have committed crimes or who have failed to
fulfill their responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Control  Yuan chief  Wang Chien-shien  said the government supervision mechanism
is like a "preservative" that prevents government departments and agencies from

guidance of violinist Wu Wen-tung, a former conductor of the Chi Mei Mandolin
Orchestra, 20 drug abusers attended a three-hour class every week and learned
the rudiments of the instrument in three months.</P>
      <P>The students gave a successful concert at the end of the program and the
overwhelming public response to the music therapy program prompted the center to
invite the teacher to conduct a second class, taking on 20 more drug abusers
undergoing rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>The students in the second class marked the conclusion of their three months of
training with a concert Tuesday and family members were elated to see the
results  and share the joy in their achievements.</P>
      <P>Chou said that in learning how to play the violin, the drug abusers have built
new values in life and have found the spiritual strength to help them overcome
drug addiction.</P>
      <P>He added that the center will continue to use violin lessons to help with the
rehabilitation of drug abusers.</P>

      <P>A group of Chinese visitors left Taiwan Tuesday after staging a protest at the
airport and getting a combined NT$1.7 million (US$50,000) -- equivalent to their
combined tour fee -- paid by a local travel agent for what they described as a
fraud scheme they encountered while in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Before taking a flight back to China from the Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport, the 34 Chinese visitors refused to board but instead staged a noisy
protest against the swindle to which they were subjected.</P>
      <P>The tourists entered Taiwan Feb. 5 and were scheduled to leave Feb. 10. They
visited Sun Moon Lake and Alishan Mountain in central and southern Taiwan during
their six-day stay.</P>
      <P>The results of an initial investigation by airport police show that the Chinese
visitors were apparently cheated into participating in a so-called "global
Chinese art contest" held at a technology company in Taipei City, because an
invitation card that the Chinese visitors showed to them was apparently fake.</P>
      <P>Huang Yen, one of the tourists, said they felt cheated as they did not get any
cash award from the contest and because their itinerary in Taiwan was not the
same as the one listed on their contracts.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, they reported the case to police in Taipei County, but they
refused to handle the case, telling them instead that the case was "not
established."</P>
      <P>"We want our rights to be served before we leave Taiwan and we want those in
charge to return our tour fees," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Each of the 34 tourists paid from 8,100-8,800 Chinese yuan for the tour.</P>
      <P>The travel agency that hosted the tourists claimed to know nothing about the
contest and said the deal was brokered through a local man surnamed Cheng.</P>
      <P>Taipei city government spokesman Yang Siao-dong later confirmed that the
invitation card given to the tourists was forged.</P>
      <P>Yang expressed regret over the incident and said it might hobble cross-Taiwan
Strait exchanges at a time when Taiwan and China are committed to bolstering
two-way activity.</P>
      <P>He urged local organizations and individuals to be on guard against similar
cases and to verify any such invitations with the city government before
accepting them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Export-oriented currency depreciation might trigger protectionism</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Irrational depreciation of currencies by countries hoping to boost exports might
trigger protectionism and global disputes, the head of a nonprofit training and
research foundation warned Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shea Jia-dong, chairman of the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance, said that
in the face of the global economic recession, government efforts to stimulate
the economy by accelerating exports is not a commendable practice.</P>
      <P>"Competing to depreciate currencies as a means to drive up exports will not only
unleash international disputes, it might also trigger protectionism, which will
do the faltering world economy a great disservice eventually," Shea said.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's exports have slumped significantly over the past several
months, and with the prospects for exports bleak in 2009, many outside observers
are pessimistic about the country's economic growth because Taiwan's economy is
heavily dependent on exports.</P>
      <P>Amid the onslaught of the global financial "tsunami, " exports have been the
hardest-hit sector," Shea said.</P>
      <P>"Yet Taiwan is not a hopeless cause if it strives to stimulate economic growth
by bolstering domestic consumption, " Shea commented, adding that the
administration has been active in this area.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's exports to China have slid noticeably, China still maintains
the world's highest economic growth rate while continuing to shore up domestic
consumption, observed Shea, who suggested that Taiwanese companies still have a
competitive edge over others in exploiting China's market.</P>

      <P>Tax revenues received by the government amounted to NT$74.7 billion (US$2.2
billion) in January, a decrease of 40.1 percent from the same month of last
year, according to statistics released Tuesday by the Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>The fall, the largest monthly decline since March 2007, was mainly the result of
the economic downturn and a decrease in work days because of the Lunar New Year
holiday, said Lin Li-chen, chief of the ministry's Department of Statistics.</P>
      <P>All forms of tax revenue plunged in January. Sales tax revenue fell NT$25.2
billion, or 53.7 percent, year-on-year, securities transaction tax revenue
declined by NT$6.9 billion, or 67.9 percent, and excise tax revenue was down
NT$6.6 billion, or 60.7 percent.</P>
      <P>Revenue from income tax fell by NT$5.1 billion, or 17.6 percent; and property
value increment tax revenue slid by NT$3.3 billion, or 55.8 percent, Lin said.</P>
      <P>If NT$17.1 billion in sales tax revenue and NT$3.2 billion in excise tax revenue
that was collected  but not added to the government's accounts because of the
Lunar New Year holiday are included, the decrease in the two categories of
revenue will narrow to 17.2 percent and 31.2 percent, respectively, she said.</P>
      <P>If these revenues were included in the monthly total, the January year-on-year
drop-off would have been 23.8 percent. Instead, the uncounted revenues will be
added to the government's February accounts.</P>

      <P>Young men and women in southern Taiwan still maintain the conventional concept
that boys should take the initiative when dating, and 37 percent said they hope
to start a relationship, according to the results of a poll published Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The survey, which polled students at 6 Tainan City high schools and vocational
schools and 7 colleges and universities on their views toward love and
relationships,  found that 37 percent of the respondents hoped to build a
relationship because they wanted to be loved by someone.</P>
      <P>As many as 90 percent, however, said they did not know how to interact with the
person they were interested in.</P>
      <P>After beginning a relationship, 60 percent of the students surveyed cited a
"change of heart" or "cheating" as the leading reason behind couple breakups,
the poll found.</P>
      <P>However, 31 percent said they would be willing to resume the relationship if the
problem is resolved.</P>
      <P>More than 70 percent said they would not carry on relationships with two people
at the same time, while some 70 percent of female students said they would not
build a relationship with someone living far away.</P>
      <P>As many as 96 percent of the women responding to the poll said they cared about
the height of their boyfriends, saying their boyfriends should be taller than
they are.</P>
      <P>When on a date, 30 percent of the respondents said the spending should be evenly
split, while 48 percent believed that it depended on the situation. But 80
percent of the male students said they should foot the bill.</P>
      <P>Sixty-four percent of both male and female students agreed that a married couple
should rear children, while some of them said they would sign a pre-marital
agreement to guarantee priority issues in their marriages.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by Tainan City's family education center between Jan. 1-10,

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number two man of China's intermediary body for negotiations with Taiwan,
who was mobbed and suffered slight injuries during a trip to southern Taiwan
last October, is undecided on whether he will visit Tainan City for a court
hearing slated for April on the incident.</P>
      <P>Zhang Mingqing, vice president of the Beijing-based semi-official Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , said during a telephone
interview with CNA recently that he had not made a decision on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Tainan District Court announced Monday that a pre-trial hearing on the
incident will be held April 8, when Wang Ting-yu, a Tainan City councilor of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party, who has been indicted as the person who
fomented the attack, along with six other people, will be summoned to appear at
the hearing.</P>
      <P>The court has also written to Zhang -- who cut short his visit to Taiwan Oct.
21, 2008 after he was humiliated by the Tainan mob -- to ask whether he would be
interested in coming back to Tainan City to attend the hearing or in taking part
via teleconference, according to Tainan District Court spokesman Chen Hsien-
jung.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Fan Liqing, spokeswoman of the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's
State Council, called on Taiwan at a regular news conference Wednesday to handle
the incident impartially so as to help maintain normal exchanges across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Fan said that Zhang has fully expressed his feelings and opinions on the
incident during his stay in Taiwan, adding that the violent attack was not only
witnessed in person by many of the Tainan public but was also documented by the
media.</P>
      <P>She skirted questions from reporters as to whether Zhang will go to the hearing.</P>
      <P>Zhang fell to the ground while being besieged by a melee of pro-independence
protesters in the southern city. He fell as he was being grabbed and jostled by
the demonstrators during a visit last Oct. 21 to the city's Confucius Temple.</P>
      <P>Zhang arrived in Taiwan Oct. 19 at the head of a 22-member delegation to take

`iron rice bowl' and that they must keep moving forward, " Ma said while
receiving a group of civil servant representatives selected for their excellent
performance.</P>
      <P>The president urged civil servants to increase their efficiency to help achieve
the implementation of government policies and upgrade the government's public
image.</P>
      <P>He also encouraged them to do as much as they can in the interests of the people
and not to be afraid of innovation.</P>
      <P>The proposal to reform the performance evaluation system for civil servants was
first unveiled Monday by Examination  Yuan President John Kuan, who argued that
government employees will be like a "pool of stagnant water" unless a mechanism
is set up whereby poorly performing ones can be ejected from the service,
traditionally seen as a "safe" occupation with very little chance of being
fired.</P>
      <P>According to officials, a draft plan being reviewed in the Ministry of Civil
Service would require any civil servant who gets a "C" rating for two
consecutive years to be dismissed or forced to retire.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) is committed to planting trees on
60,000 hectares of flat land across Taiwan in eight years, COA Minister Chen Wu-
hsiung announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference to mark an annual "tree-planting month" activity,
Chen said the COA is planning to capitalize on its forestation program from 2009
as part of its efforts to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and create job
opportunities.</P>
      <P>Under the program, Chen said, the COA will this year invite residents of 400
communities to help plant trees on 5,060 hectares of land and to adopt 56,686
hectares of forest to make Taiwan greener.</P>
      <P>Owners of sloping or flat lands who participate in the program will receive a
subsidy of NT$120,000 (US$3,529) per hectare in the first year, according to the
COA.</P>
      <P>People who join the tree plantation program for flat lands will be entitled to
NT$210,000 per hectare in subsidies in the first year, it said.</P>
      <P>Last year, a total of 459 residential communities participated in the tree-
planting activity with the help of COA subsides, completing plantation of
1,558.5 hectares of land and adopting 58,815 hectares of forest.</P>
      <P>The COA estimated that if each of Taiwan's 23 million citizens plants at least
one tree in his or her lifetime, the forestation program would help create a
green space of 10.7 square meters for each person in 10 years' time and generate
business revenue worth NT$30 billion in 20 years.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Forestry Bureau is planning to build three large ecology
recreational parks over 1,000 hectares in southern Taiwan's Chiayi and Pingtung
counties as well as in Hualien County in eastern Taiwan over the coming four
years.</P>

      <P>More and more victims are emerging from the turmoil of the 2008 global recession
that has battered not only three state-run science parks -- Taiwan's major
economic pillars -- but also students attending expensive private colleges.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the National Science Council (NSC)
Wednesday, the total turnover generated by the high-tech parks it administers
contracted by 6.55 percent to NT$1.84 trillion (US$54 billion) in 2008 compared
with the previous year, marking the first drop in business volume since 2001.</P>
      <P>The NSC pointed out in a statement that the parks still enjoyed an average
growth of 3.62 percent in turnover as of the end of last October, but like a
roller coaster ride, the turnover fell suddenly and sharply in the following two
months due to a sudden contraction in global economic growth caused by the
financial storm.</P>
      <P>Among the six major industrial sectors in the science parks -- which are home to
most of the country's leading manufacturers -- the integrated circuit industry
generated the highest turnover of NT$922 billion in 2008, accounting for 50.06
percent of the total and representing an annual decline of 6.54 percent.</P>
      <P>The opto-electronics industry registered NT$752.4 billion in turnover, a slide
of 6.74 percent from the previous year, while the computer and peripheral
products manufacturing sector reported a turnover of NT$79.1 billion,
representing a drop of 17.52 percent.</P>
      <P>The communications industry sector recorded turnover of NT$34.8 billion, showing
a year-on-year drop of 10.31 percent, according to the NSC statement.</P>
      <P>However, the precision machine manufacturing sector reported turnover of NT$40.5
billion, representing growth of 26.96 percent last year, despite the global
recession, while the biotechnology industry recorded turnover of NT$7.4 billion,
representing yearly growth of 10.31 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the NSC, as of last Dec. 31 there were a total of 699 businesses
operating in the NSC-run industrial parks in Hsinchu, Taichung and Tainan, 95 of
which were foreign companies.</P>
      <P>In 2008, the parks attracted 86 new investors, whose investments totalled
NT$51.89 billion, while 66 existing tenants increased their investments, the NSC
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Chen-kuei, president of the Taichung-based Ling Tung University,
said Wednesday that the school began its summer term Feb. 5 but that so far, 20
percent of the students have failed to pay their tuition.</P>
      <P>Chen, who also serves as chairman of the Association of Private Universities and
Colleges of Technology, revealed that similar cases have occurred in other
private schools and noted that the university management has launched measures
to help students in financial straits to stay in school.</P>
      <P>Chen said many of the 550,000 students studying in the country's 73 private
universities and colleges of technology are often socially disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>In normal times, there are usually around 10 percent of students unable to
afford the expensive tuition fees, and these often receive assistance from the
their school, including offering part-time work at the school or allowing them
to pay their tuition in installments.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the number of such students has increased this year as a
result of the recession.</P>

      <P>Former Taipei Deputy Mayor King Pu-tsung has reportedly been invited by the
founder of Next Media, the largest listed media company in Hong Kong, to
establish a new television station in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Jimmy Lai, founder of Next Media and Giordano, one of Asia's largest clothing
retailers, said in a report carried in the latest issue of the Taiwan edition of
Next Magazine that King is well-versed in mass media operations and norms and
that with his management talent and ability, is set to unveil a new era in
Taiwan's TV sector.</P>
      <P>Lai noted that there are already many TV stations in Taiwan but said that the
best ones would cost a great deal of money to acquire.</P>
      <P>"We will acquire two at most and hope that the new channel will become
operational by the end of this year or early next year, " Lai was quoted as
saying in the report.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-chien, head of the Taiwan Next Magazine, confirmed Wednesday that Lai, a
billionaire entrepreneur ranked 962 on the Forbes billionaires list, has decided
to expand his publishing empire into the arena of television,  and he confirmed
the Lai-King engagement.</P>
      <P>Yeh confirmed during an interview with CNA that Lai and Next Magazine have
talked with executives of several Taiwanese cable TV stations about the
acquisition plan.</P>
      <P>"Some have no intention of selling and some are priced too high. If necessary,
Next Magazine will establish a new TV station on its own," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>King, who served as former Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's deputy from 2004-2007, was one
of the top brains in Ma's presidential election campaign, but he had sworn that
he would not serve in Ma's administration nor at the Presidential Office after
Ma was elected president in March 2008.</P>
      <P>Instead, he traveled to Hong Kong in the summer of 2008 to take up a six-month
teaching position at a Hong Kong university as a visiting professor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan should never let down guard against China: U.S. scholars</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two noted American scholars expressed confidence  Wednesday in President Ma
Ying-jeou's  handling of cross-Taiwan Strait affairs, but advised that the Ma
administration should never let down its guard against China's intention to
reunite with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Christopher C. DeMuth and Arthur C. Brooks, respectively the former and
incumbent presidents of the renowned U.S. think tank American Enterprise
Institute (AEI) , made the remarks at a media seminar in Taipei that wrapped up
their four-day visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that it is a "wonderful thing" for Taiwan and China to build closer links
through commercial, cultural and people-to-people exchanges, DeMuth urged Taiwan
not to "ever to put down your guard because we know how the People's Republic of
China (PRC) wants this to end."</P>
      <P>He suggested that the Taiwan government take advantage of all opportunities and
look for ways to build closer ties with Beijing, but to be also very wary of
China's intentions to do things that are harmful and would restrict Taiwan's
freedom.</P>
      <P>"I think he (Ma) is highly cognizant of the reality of the kind of the
government that exists over there, " DeMuth said when asked whether he thinks Ma
is aware of the PRC's intentions.</P>
      <P>"I think that he has no intention of letting his country fall under the sway of
a government such as that, " added the respected scholar who served as AEI
president for 22 years.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the AEI is concerned about the Ma administration leaning too much
toward China by entering into a truce with Beijing to end the long-standing
diplomatic tug-of-war between the two sides as some critics and the opposition
parties have charged, DeMuth said that the AEI is not concerned about that.</P>
      <P>Brooks said that positions are not important,  but rather principles are, and
that is the basis of successful diplomacy.</P>
      <P>He added that the government needs to bear in mind what Taiwan wants, noting
that according to Ma, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and
everybody else, "peace, prosperity and freedom" are the goals.</P>
      <P>"If something helps prosperity, it should be entertained," Brooks said. "Staying
free is also important and that's where the balance lies, not losing autonomy
just for the sake of trade, but not passing up opportunities for people to
become more prosperous."</P>
      <P>Asked if Taiwan has anything to worry about with the scheduled visit of the
newly appointed U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to Asia, both scholars
said that the U.S. government does not give enough attention to Taiwan and does
too little for the country.</P>
      <P>Brooks said that Taiwan should always be worried when anybody from the U.S.
State Department is talking to the PRC about Taiwan because the State Department
is strongly biased toward big powerful important countries and the status quo
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"Our State Department has given far too little attention to the strategic
importance of Taiwan and far too much attention to simply the convenience of the
people across the table from them who are from the PRC," he said.</P>
      <P>DeMuth said that the U.S. has not done as much as it should have to help Taiwan
defend itself against the buildup of military threats from the PRC.</P>
      <P>"What should we do to help make sure that Taiwan can defend itself... we have
not done nearly as much in terms of providing you with important defensive
weaponry," he said.</P>
      <P>They both urged that the American government lift the ban on visits by high-
level military officials to the U.S. because there is no reason to do the job
indirectly and inefficiently, adding that the U.S. should stand up for its
principles and help its ally.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Control Yuan, the country's supreme watchdog body, asked Wednesday for two
prosecutors to be removed from the Special Investigation Division under the
Supreme Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>In a corrective measure passed earlier that day, the Control Yuan said Chu Chao-
liang and Wu Wen-chung should be dropped from the division, which is probing the
alleged corruption of former President Chen Shui-bian and members of his family.</P>
      <P>Control Yuan member Li Ful-dien said the leading reason behind the measure is
that both of them had private contacts with Chen when the division's probe into
the ex-president was still ongoing, meeting with him during a memorial service
for a Buddhist master at a temple in Miaoli July 27 last year.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Lee went on, Chu had seven telephone conversations about the Chen
case with a woman who claimed to be a friend of the former head of state, and
the woman let Chen talk directly with Chu during at least one of the calls.</P>
      <P>Although the Control Yuan is not in a position to disclose the contents of the
phone conversations,  they were confirmed  by Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming
in a Feb. 5 interview as having taken place, Lee said.</P>
      <P>"The two obviously violated the guidelines for prosecutors' work," he said.</P>
      <P>In the same corrective measure, the Control Yuan also asked the Supreme
Prosecutors Office -- which is currently operating at half-strength with only
eight prosecutors -- to fill the remaining eight vacancies.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan's corrective  measure runs counter to an investigation
conducted by the Supreme Prosecutors Office last Dec. 12 in which the office
said Chu and Wu had broken no laws or regulations.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Prosecutors Office said in its investigation that the meeting
between the two prosecutors and Chen took place during a social occasion and
that the investigation was not mentioned.</P>
      <P>Local press had speculated that the meeting was premeditated by Chen, whose aide
even took a picture of it and released it afterward in an attempt to discredit
Chu and Wu, who are leading members of the investigation against Chen.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division has not yet completed its investigation of
the ex-president, although it indicted Chen, various members of his family and
several former aides on charges of corruption and money laundering Dec. 12.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA to come up with DRAM industry consolidation package soon</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will come up with a DRAM industry
consolidation initiative by the end of February, an official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
package in the works will allow the consolidated DRAM industry to stay
competitive in the global market.</P>
      <P>As the DRAM industry  plays  a crucial  role in Taiwan's semiconductor supply
chain, the official said, the government has consistently kept close tabs on the
problems faced by local DRAM makers amid the current worldwide economic
recession.</P>
      <P>In addition to coordinating relevant agencies to assist DRAM makers in acquiring
bailout funds, the MOEA has also been working on a plan to help them integrate
with their foreign cooperative partners in the long run, the official added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the local DRAM industry does not have home-grown key technology, the
official said establishing a self-sufficient DRAM industry is the top goal of
the government's bailout move.</P>
      <P>"The government intends to inject bailout funds into the local DRAM industry
under two conditions -- some industry consolidation should occur and makers must
show their commitment to home-grown technological development, " the official
explained. From the government's standpoint, the rescue project is aimed at
sharing benefits between Taiwan's DRAM makers and their international partners,
since the former lack self-developed technologies and the latter are in need of
new capital sources, the official added.</P>
      <P>According to the official, local DRAM makers' foreign partners, including
Japan's Elpida, the U.S.-based Micron and South Korea's Hynix,  have  approached
the MOEA  on possible  collaboration opportunities.</P>
      <P>Major domestic DRAM makers, such as Nanya Technology, Inotera Memories,
Powerchip, Rexchip, ProMOS and Winbond, have also presented various integration
initiatives or proposals, the official said.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 6, the official said, the Formosa Plastics Group's Nanya Technology,
Inotera Memories and their U.S. partner Micron presented a plan to the MOEA on
Taiwan's DRAM industry development.</P>
      <P>"The MOEA has begun assessing the feasibility of the project, " the official
said, adding that if all goes well, the ministry will unveil a DRAM industry
consolidation and development package at the end of this month.</P>

testing service providers, employing 15,000 people. It held a business
presentation Wednesday that attracted many mutual fund managers and

sector to drop by between 15 percent and 30 percent this year, and that the IC
packaging industry will see a similar decline of output value due to the global
recession.</P>
      <P>The general IC packaging sector could expect a drop in production value of
between 15 percent and 35 percent in the first quarter of the year, Lin
forecast.</P>
      <P>The entrepreneur also predicted that computer output will fall by 10 percent
this year, and the output of mobile phones will also post a decline of 10
percent in 2009.</P>

      <P>A total of 115 Chinese tour groups, composed of 2,992 members, had visited

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that the two peaceful transitions of power
in Taiwan demonstrated that the Taiwanese people have learned to overcome
differences  through tolerance and conciliation,  which are not only applicable
to relations with China but are also important in reconciling different
political views within the country.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at a function hosted by the non-governmental Lincoln Society
and co-sponsored by the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the American
Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of
Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States.</P>
      <P>Ma said that in the last decade there were two peaceful transitions of powers in
Taiwan, which showed that people in Taiwan have, to some degree, come to
understand the need to learn how to co-exist through tolerance and conciliation.</P>
      <P>"This principle of tolerance and conciliation is applicable not only to cross-
strait relations but also to internal political party relations in Taiwan
today," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He said that conflicts and disagreements may be inevitable but playing on them
is not the way to establish a national identity.</P>
      <P>Since Ma assumed office May 20, 2008, he has take a number of steps to improve
relations with China -- an approach criticized by the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party and pro-independent groups as sacrificing Taiwan's sovereignty
and national interests.</P>
      <P>Describing Lincoln as a "giant in the history of democracy, " Ma paid homage to
late U.S. president's political legacy of government of the people, by the
people and for the people.</P>
      <P>"I believe this is the true meaning of power in a democratic system," the
president said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Lincolns philosophy was an inspiration to Dr. Sun Yat-sen in setting
out the principles on which the Republic of China (ROC) was founded, Ma said
that newly established democracies like the Republic of China on Taiwan can
learn a truly valuable lesson from the United States.</P>
      <P>"America's experience in building a democratic state tells us one thing -- we
must seek consensus in the spirit of tolerance and conciliation," he said.</P>
      <P>The Lincoln Society is a non-political organization founded in Taipei in 1984 by
a group of retired ROC ambassadors and U.S. expatriates to foster the democratic

      <P>A group of over 400 worshipers of Matsu -- known as the Chinese Goddess of Sea
or Empress of Heaven to believers around the world -- will sail directly from
Budai Port in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County to Meizhou Island in China's
Fujian Province Thursday.</P>
      <P>The pilgrimage, organized by the Tienhou Temple in Chiayi City, dedicated to
Matsu, will take the visitors to the Tienhou Temple in Meizhou Island, which is
the ancestral temple for the large number of Matsu followers across the globe,
including those in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A big ceremony to offer sacrifices to the sea was slated to be held at Budai
Port at 9: 00 p.m. Thursday, before the worshipers set sail. The ship from Budai
will sail into Meizhou Port in a traditional ritual on a trip of about six and a
half hours.</P>
      <P>It will be the first religious pilgrimage between Budai Port and the Chinese
side since direct cross-Taiwan Strait air and shipping links were opened in
December last year.</P>
      <P>Wang Kuang-li, a manager of Chiayi's Tienhou Temple, said the direct voyage will
help save a lot of travel time compared to the past when most Taiwanese
worshipers had to sail via one of Taiwan's offshore islands, Kinmen, to China on
what is known as "the mink links." A trip between Taiwan and Fujian Province's
Meizhou via the mini links takes at least one day, Wang noted.</P>
      <P>At the same time, some 200 other Matsu worshipers will board a flight from
Kaohsiung International Airport to Fujian's Xiamen airport en route to Meizhou.</P>
      <P>The two groups of over 600 Matsu believers from 26 temples across Taiwan will
meet in Meizhou and then proceed to the Tienhou Temple in Quangzhou in Fujian
Province to worship Matsu through Feb. 18.</P>
      <P>Meizhou is the native land where Matsu, whose given name was Lin Mo-liang, was
born over 1,000 years ago. After her death, the people began to pray to her as
they would to a deity. Matsu gradually became one of the most important folk
deities for people living in China's coastal regions and Taiwan. It is estimated
that half of Taiwan's 23 million people are worshipers of the Chinese Goddess of
the Sea, and it is believed that her prayers guide ships safely though the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to unofficial estimates, Taiwanese make more than 100,000 visits to
Meizhou's Tienhou Temple every year.</P>

cabbage and Chinese cabbage -- two of the most widely grown leafy vegetable
crops in Taiwan -- in order to stabilize their prices.</P>
      <P>Farmers who are willing to join the program are entitled to a subsidy of
NT$70,000 (US$2,056) per hectare in compensation for their losses, according to
the officials.</P>
      <P>The program will continue until Feb. 13, with the aim of shredding 80 hectares
of cabbage and 30 hectares of Chinese cabbage and convert the crops into organic
fertilizer.</P>
      <P>The program is intended to protect the interests of the farmers by preventing a
glut of the produce that could cause a market collapse, the officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Japanese tourist arrivals forecast to grow 4% to 5%</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.11  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the current global economic downturn, the number of Japanese tourist
arrivals is expected to increase by 4 percent to 5 percent this year, Tourism
Bureau Director General Janice Lai said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the steep appreciation of the Japanese yen has made it cheaper
to travel to Taiwan on pleasure trips.</P>
      <P>Moreover, she said, the fuel oil surcharge has fallen from a high of 20,000 yen
(US$222.10) last year to the current 8,000 yen and may further drop to 3,000 yen
in March.</P>
      <P>All these advantages, coupled with geographic proximity and the Taiwanese
people's hospitality, will help to attract more Japanese tourists to Taiwan, Lai
explained.</P>
      <P>Japan has been Taiwan's most important tourism source. Affected by skyrocketing
fuel oil surcharges last year and a global financial tsunami, the number of
Japanese tourist arrivals fell to 1.08 million in 2008, marking a 6.8 percent
year-on-year decline.</P>
      <P>Lai made the remarks after signing an agreement with Nippon Travel Agency, the
fourth largest Japanese travel agency,  on attracting more Japanese people to
make sightseeing trips to Taiwan in 2009.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, Lai said, the Japanese travel agency promises to send
40,000 holidaymakers to Taiwan this year, up 33 percent from the 30,000 figure
recorded in 2008.</P>
      <P>Lai said the Tourism Bureau plans to sign similar pacts with four other top
Japanese travel agencies to organize more Japanese tour groups to Taiwan. If the
Japanese signatories reach their service targets, the Tourism Bureau will offer
advertising and manpower training subsidies in line with the contract terms.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Japan's JTB travel agency sent a 1,300-member tour group to
Taipei. All of the visitors are diamond-class managing members of the noted
Japanese direct sale cosmetic brand Pola and are known for their luxury
purchasing power.</P>
      <P>All the Pola tour group members will attend a citation ceremony at the Taipei
International Convention Center Thursday where they will be honored for their
outstanding sales records over the past year. Starting Saturday, they will split
up into smaller groups and tour duty-free shops and visit major tourist
attractions in suburban Taipei, including the National Palace Museum, Danshui
and Wulai.</P>
      <P>Given their deep pockets, the group is expected to bring an estimated NT$50
million-worth of business opportunities to local luxury good stores and tourism-
related services, Lai said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tycoon involved in Rebar Group embezzlement case released on bail</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Eastern Multimedia Group Chairman Gary Wang who has been found guilty of
collaborating with his father to embezzle funds from the family's publicly
listed Rebar Asia Pacific Group, was released on NT$350 million (US$10.29
million) bail Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang was taken back into custody Jan. 21, three weeks after he was found guilty
by the Taipei District Court of collaborating with his father to siphon off
funds from the Rebar group.</P>
      <P>On Feb.9, the Taiwan High Court revoked the lower court decision and demanded
that it return a new ruling, pointing out that the lower court had not summoned
a former lawmaker, who was key figure in the matter, to testify.</P>
      <P>In response, a collegial panel of judges at the district court decided  to
release Wang on bail Wednesday  after the former legislator, Tsai Hau, testified
before the court that he had no intention of helping Wang flee Taiwan from
Penghu, as was rumored.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wang is barred from changing his residence or leaving Taiwan. He
is also required to report to a police station every evening and to the district
court every Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang was first taken into custody by prosecutors in June 2007 following the
exposure of the Rebar Group's financial woes and was released in May 2008 on
NT$350 million (US$10.45 million) bail, the highest in Taiwan's judicial
history.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 31, 2008, the district court sentenced Wang to 18 years in jail and
fined him NT$700 million. He has appealed his case in the Taiwan High Court,
which has not yet begun hearing the matter.</P>
      <P>Six of Gary Wang's  siblings  were also found guilty  of collaborating with
their father -- Rebar Group founder Wang You-theng -- to loot funds from various
of the conglomerate's subsidiaries.</P>
      <P>Wang You-theng has remained on the run since he fled overseas in December 2006,
soon after the Rebar Group applied for bankruptcy protection.</P>
      <P>Aside from Wang and his siblings, another 116 individuals were convicted of
various offenses in the court's mammoth 4,000-page verdict.</P>
      <P>The major irregularities identified by the court included the hollowing out of
Chia Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co., Great Chinese Bills Finance Corp. and
Asia Pacific Broadband Telecom Co. (APBT) ; illegal lending by The Chinese Bank
and Union Insurance Co.; and a fake transaction to siphon off funds between the
Eastern Multimedia Group and APBT.</P>
      <P>The total amount of funds siphoned off from the group was estimated at more than
NT$42.78 billion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou expressed support Wednesday for a proposed civil service
reform that is aimed at weeding out government employees who perform poorly.</P>
      <P>Ma said such reform is essential to enhancing the competitiveness of civil
servants and thus Taiwan's global competitiveness.</P>
      <P>"We will make government employees realize that the civil service is not an
`iron rice bowl' and that they must keep moving forward, " Ma said while
receiving a group of civil servant representatives selected for their excellent
performance.</P>
      <P>The president urged civil servants to increase their efficiency to help achieve
the implementation of government policies and upgrade the government's public
image.</P>
      <P>He also encouraged them to do as much as they can in the interests of the people
and not to be afraid of innovation.</P>
      <P>The proposal to reform the performance evaluation system for civil servants was
first unveiled Monday by Examination  Yuan President John Kuan, who argued that
government employees will be like a "pool of stagnant water" unless a mechanism
is set up whereby poorly performing ones can be ejected from the service,
traditionally seen as a "safe" occupation with very little chance of being
fired.</P>
      <P>According to officials, a draft plan being reviewed in the Ministry of Civil
Service would require any civil servant who gets a "C" rating for two
consecutive years to be dismissed or forced to retire.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) is committed to planting trees on
60,000 hectares of flat land across Taiwan in eight years, COA Minister Chen Wu-
hsiung announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference to mark an annual "tree-planting month" activity,
Chen said the COA is planning to capitalize on its forestation program from 2009
as part of its efforts to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and create job
opportunities.</P>
      <P>Under the program, Chen said, the COA will this year invite residents of 400
communities to help plant trees on 5,060 hectares of land and to adopt 56,686
hectares of forest to make Taiwan greener.</P>
      <P>Owners of sloping or flat lands who participate in the program will receive a
subsidy of NT$120,000 (US$3,529) per hectare in the first year, according to the
COA.</P>
      <P>People who join the tree plantation program for flat lands will be entitled to
NT$210,000 per hectare in subsidies in the first year, it said.</P>
      <P>Last year, a total of 459 residential communities participated in the tree-
planting activity with the help of COA subsides, completing plantation of
1,558.5 hectares of land and adopting 58,815 hectares of forest.</P>
      <P>The COA estimated that if each of Taiwan's 23 million citizens plants at least
one tree in his or her lifetime, the forestation program would help create a
green space of 10.7 square meters for each person in 10 years' time and generate
business revenue worth NT$30 billion in 20 years.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Forestry Bureau is planning to build three large ecology
recreational parks over 1,000 hectares in southern Taiwan's Chiayi and Pingtung
counties as well as in Hualien County in eastern Taiwan over the coming four
years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Global recession impact affecting science parks, schools</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More and more victims are emerging from the turmoil of the 2008 global recession
that has battered not only three state-run science parks -- Taiwan's major
economic pillars -- but also students attending expensive private colleges.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the National Science Council (NSC)
Wednesday, the total turnover generated by the high-tech parks it administers
contracted by 6.55 percent to NT$1.84 trillion (US$54 billion) in 2008 compared
with the previous year, marking the first drop in business volume since 2001.</P>
      <P>The NSC pointed out in a statement that the parks still enjoyed an average
growth of 3.62 percent in turnover as of the end of last October, but like a
roller coaster ride, the turnover fell suddenly and sharply in the following two
months due to a sudden contraction in global economic growth caused by the
financial storm.</P>
      <P>Among the six major industrial sectors in the science parks -- which are home to
most of the country's leading manufacturers -- the integrated circuit industry
generated the highest turnover of NT$922 billion in 2008, accounting for 50.06
percent of the total and representing an annual decline of 6.54 percent.</P>
      <P>The opto-electronics industry registered NT$752.4 billion in turnover, a slide
of 6.74 percent from the previous year, while the computer and peripheral
products manufacturing sector reported a turnover of NT$79.1 billion,
representing a drop of 17.52 percent.</P>
      <P>The communications industry sector recorded turnover of NT$34.8 billion, showing
a year-on-year drop of 10.31 percent, according to the NSC statement.</P>
      <P>However, the precision machine manufacturing sector reported turnover of NT$40.5
billion, representing growth of 26.96 percent last year, despite the global
recession, while the biotechnology industry recorded turnover of NT$7.4 billion,
representing yearly growth of 10.31 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the NSC, as of last Dec. 31 there were a total of 699 businesses
operating in the NSC-run industrial parks in Hsinchu, Taichung and Tainan, 95 of
which were foreign companies.</P>
      <P>In 2008, the parks attracted 86 new investors, whose investments totalled
NT$51.89 billion, while 66 existing tenants increased their investments, the NSC
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Chen-kuei, president of the Taichung-based Ling Tung University,
said Wednesday that the school began its summer term Feb. 5 but that so far, 20
percent of the students have failed to pay their tuition.</P>
      <P>Chen, who also serves as chairman of the Association of Private Universities and
Colleges of Technology, revealed that similar cases have occurred in other
private schools and noted that the university management has launched measures
to help students in financial straits to stay in school.</P>
      <P>Chen said many of the 550,000 students studying in the country's 73 private
universities and colleges of technology are often socially disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>In normal times, there are usually around 10 percent of students unable to
afford the expensive tuition fees, and these often receive assistance from the
their school, including offering part-time work at the school or allowing them
to pay their tuition in installments.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the number of such students has increased this year as a
result of the recession.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Former deputy mayor to organize new TV station for Next Media</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Taipei Deputy Mayor King Pu-tsung has reportedly been invited by the
founder of Next Media, the largest listed media company in Hong Kong, to
establish a new television station in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Jimmy Lai, founder of Next Media and Giordano, one of Asia's largest clothing
retailers, said in a report carried in the latest issue of the Taiwan edition of
Next Magazine that King is well-versed in mass media operations and norms and
that with his management talent and ability, is set to unveil a new era in
Taiwan's TV sector.</P>
      <P>Lai noted that there are already many TV stations in Taiwan but said that the
best ones would cost a great deal of money to acquire.</P>
      <P>"We will acquire two at most and hope that the new channel will become
operational by the end of this year or early next year, " Lai was quoted as
saying in the report.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-chien, head of the Taiwan Next Magazine, confirmed Wednesday that Lai, a
billionaire entrepreneur ranked 962 on the Forbes billionaires list, has decided
to expand his publishing empire into the arena of television,  and he confirmed
the Lai-King engagement.</P>
      <P>Yeh confirmed during an interview with CNA that Lai and Next Magazine have
talked with executives of several Taiwanese cable TV stations about the
acquisition plan.</P>
      <P>"Some have no intention of selling and some are priced too high. If necessary,
Next Magazine will establish a new TV station on its own," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>King, who served as former Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's deputy from 2004-2007, was one
of the top brains in Ma's presidential election campaign, but he had sworn that
he would not serve in Ma's administration nor at the Presidential Office after
Ma was elected president in March 2008.</P>
      <P>Instead, he traveled to Hong Kong in the summer of 2008 to take up a six-month
teaching position at a Hong Kong university as a visiting professor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan should never let down guard against China: U.S. scholars</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11 (CNA)
02/11/09  18:54:29
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two noted American scholars expressed confidence  Wednesday in President Ma
Ying-jeou's  handling of cross-Taiwan Strait affairs, but advised that the Ma
administration should never let down its guard against China's intention to
reunite with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Christopher C. DeMuth and Arthur C. Brooks, respectively the former and
incumbent presidents of the renowned U.S. think tank American Enterprise
Institute (AEI) , made the remarks at a media seminar in Taipei that wrapped up
their four-day visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that it is a "wonderful thing" for Taiwan and China to build closer links
through commercial, cultural and people-to-people exchanges, DeMuth urged Taiwan
not to "ever to put down your guard because we know how the People's Republic of
China (PRC) wants this to end."</P>
      <P>He suggested that the Taiwan government take advantage of all opportunities and
look for ways to build closer ties with Beijing, but to be also very wary of
China's intentions to do things that are harmful and would restrict Taiwan's
freedom.</P>
      <P>"I think he (Ma) is highly cognizant of the reality of the kind of the
government that exists over there, " DeMuth said when asked whether he thinks Ma
is aware of the PRC's intentions.</P>
      <P>"I think that he has no intention of letting his country fall under the sway of
a government such as that, " added the respected scholar who served as AEI
president for 22 years.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the AEI is concerned about the Ma administration leaning too much
toward China by entering into a truce with Beijing to end the long-standing
diplomatic tug-of-war between the two sides as some critics and the opposition
parties have charged, DeMuth said that the AEI is not concerned about that.</P>
      <P>Brooks said that positions are not important,  but rather principles are, and
that is the basis of successful diplomacy.</P>
      <P>He added that the government needs to bear in mind what Taiwan wants, noting
that according to Ma, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and
everybody else, "peace, prosperity and freedom" are the goals.</P>
      <P>"If something helps prosperity, it should be entertained," Brooks said. "Staying
free is also important and that's where the balance lies, not losing autonomy
just for the sake of trade, but not passing up opportunities for people to
become more prosperous."</P>
      <P>Asked if Taiwan has anything to worry about with the scheduled visit of the
newly appointed U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to Asia, both scholars
said that the U.S. government does not give enough attention to Taiwan and does
too little for the country.</P>
      <P>Brooks said that Taiwan should always be worried when anybody from the U.S.
State Department is talking to the PRC about Taiwan because the State Department
is strongly biased toward big powerful important countries and the status quo
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"Our State Department has given far too little attention to the strategic
importance of Taiwan and far too much attention to simply the convenience of the
people across the table from them who are from the PRC," he said.</P>
      <P>DeMuth said that the U.S. has not done as much as it should have to help Taiwan
defend itself against the buildup of military threats from the PRC.</P>
      <P>"What should we do to help make sure that Taiwan can defend itself... we have
not done nearly as much in terms of providing you with important defensive
weaponry," he said.</P>
      <P>They both urged that the American government lift the ban on visits by high-
level military officials to the U.S. because there is no reason to do the job
indirectly and inefficiently, adding that the U.S. should stand up for its
principles and help its ally.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Control Yuan asks for removal of two prosecutors from probe panel</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Control Yuan, the country's supreme watchdog body, asked Wednesday for two
prosecutors to be removed from the Special Investigation Division under the
Supreme Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>In a corrective measure passed earlier that day, the Control Yuan said Chu Chao-
liang and Wu Wen-chung should be dropped from the division, which is probing the
alleged corruption of former President Chen Shui-bian and members of his family.</P>
      <P>Control Yuan member Li Ful-dien said the leading reason behind the measure is
that both of them had private contacts with Chen when the division's probe into
the ex-president was still ongoing, meeting with him during a memorial service
for a Buddhist master at a temple in Miaoli July 27 last year.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Lee went on, Chu had seven telephone conversations about the Chen
case with a woman who claimed to be a friend of the former head of state, and
the woman let Chen talk directly with Chu during at least one of the calls.</P>
      <P>Although the Control Yuan is not in a position to disclose the contents of the
phone conversations,  they were confirmed  by Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming
in a Feb. 5 interview as having taken place, Lee said.</P>
      <P>"The two obviously violated the guidelines for prosecutors' work," he said.</P>
      <P>In the same corrective measure, the Control Yuan also asked the Supreme
Prosecutors Office -- which is currently operating at half-strength with only
eight prosecutors -- to fill the remaining eight vacancies.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan's corrective  measure runs counter to an investigation
conducted by the Supreme Prosecutors Office last Dec. 12 in which the office
said Chu and Wu had broken no laws or regulations.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Prosecutors Office said in its investigation that the meeting
between the two prosecutors and Chen took place during a social occasion and
that the investigation was not mentioned.</P>
      <P>Local press had speculated that the meeting was premeditated by Chen, whose aide
even took a picture of it and released it afterward in an attempt to discredit
Chu and Wu, who are leading members of the investigation against Chen.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division has not yet completed its investigation of
the ex-president, although it indicted Chen, various members of his family and
several former aides on charges of corruption and money laundering Dec. 12.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA to come up with DRAM industry consolidation package soon</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will come up with a DRAM industry
consolidation initiative by the end of February, an official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
package in the works will allow the consolidated DRAM industry to stay
competitive in the global market.</P>
      <P>As the DRAM industry  plays  a crucial  role in Taiwan's semiconductor supply
chain, the official said, the government has consistently kept close tabs on the
problems faced by local DRAM makers amid the current worldwide economic
recession.</P>
      <P>In addition to coordinating relevant agencies to assist DRAM makers in acquiring
bailout funds, the MOEA has also been working on a plan to help them integrate
with their foreign cooperative partners in the long run, the official added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the local DRAM industry does not have home-grown key technology, the
official said establishing a self-sufficient DRAM industry is the top goal of
the government's bailout move.</P>
      <P>"The government intends to inject bailout funds into the local DRAM industry
under two conditions -- some industry consolidation should occur and makers must
show their commitment to home-grown technological development, " the official
explained. From the government's standpoint, the rescue project is aimed at
sharing benefits between Taiwan's DRAM makers and their international partners,
since the former lack self-developed technologies and the latter are in need of
new capital sources, the official added.</P>
      <P>According to the official, local DRAM makers' foreign partners, including
Japan's Elpida, the U.S.-based Micron and South Korea's Hynix,  have  approached
the MOEA  on possible  collaboration opportunities.</P>
      <P>Major domestic DRAM makers, such as Nanya Technology, Inotera Memories,
Powerchip, Rexchip, ProMOS and Winbond, have also presented various integration
initiatives or proposals, the official said.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 6, the official said, the Formosa Plastics Group's Nanya Technology,
Inotera Memories and their U.S. partner Micron presented a plan to the MOEA on
Taiwan's DRAM industry development.</P>
      <P>"The MOEA has begun assessing the feasibility of the project, " the official
said, adding that if all goes well, the ministry will unveil a DRAM industry
consolidation and development package at the end of this month.</P>

packaging industry will see a similar decline of output value due to the global
recession.</P>
      <P>The general IC packaging sector could expect a drop in production value of
between 15 percent and 35 percent in the first quarter of the year, Lin
forecast.</P>

this year, and the output of mobile phones will also post a decline of 10
percent in 2009.</P>
      <P>The SPIL announced Wednesday that its revenue for the fourth quarter of 2008 was

      <P>A total of 115 Chinese tour groups, composed of 2,992 members, had visited
Taiwan for sightseeing via the country's three outlying islands as of the end of
last year, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>As part of the Taiwan government's efforts to normalize personnel and commercial
exchanges and shipping services across the Taiwan Strait, Chinese people have
been allowed to visit Taiwan proper via its outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu
since early last September.</P>
      <P>Since then, Chinese citizens have also been permitted to make pleasure trips to
Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu, another of Taiwan's outlying islands, with the use of
landing visas or multiple entry/exit permits.</P>
      <P>Thanks to these open-door measures, the MAC said in a statement, the number of
Chinese tourists who traveled to Taiwan via direct ferry services -- commonly
known as the mini-three links" -- between Taiwan-held Kinmen/Matsu and
Xiamen/Mawei in China's southeastern Fujian Province has continued to increase
and had hit 2,992 as of the end of 2008.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the statement said, another 3,330 Chinese citizens made sightseeing
trips to Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu with landing visas or multiple entry/exit
permits during the same four-month period.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that the two peaceful transitions of power
in Taiwan demonstrated that the Taiwanese people have learned to overcome
differences  through tolerance and conciliation,  which are not only applicable
to relations with China but are also important in reconciling different
political views within the country.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at a function hosted by the non-governmental Lincoln Society
and co-sponsored by the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the American
Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of
Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States.</P>
      <P>Ma said that in the last decade there were two peaceful transitions of powers in
Taiwan, which showed that people in Taiwan have, to some degree, come to
understand the need to learn how to co-exist through tolerance and conciliation.</P>
      <P>"This principle of tolerance and conciliation is applicable not only to cross-
strait relations but also to internal political party relations in Taiwan
today," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He said that conflicts and disagreements may be inevitable but playing on them
is not the way to establish a national identity.</P>
      <P>Since Ma assumed office May 20, 2008, he has take a number of steps to improve
relations with China -- an approach criticized by the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party and pro-independent groups as sacrificing Taiwan's sovereignty
and national interests.</P>
      <P>Describing Lincoln as a "giant in the history of democracy, " Ma paid homage to
late U.S. president's political legacy of government of the people, by the
people and for the people.</P>
      <P>"I believe this is the true meaning of power in a democratic system," the
president said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Lincolns philosophy was an inspiration to Dr. Sun Yat-sen in setting
out the principles on which the Republic of China (ROC) was founded, Ma said
that newly established democracies like the Republic of China on Taiwan can
learn a truly valuable lesson from the United States.</P>
      <P>"America's experience in building a democratic state tells us one thing -- we
must seek consensus in the spirit of tolerance and conciliation," he said.</P>
      <P>The Lincoln Society is a non-political organization founded in Taipei in 1984 by
a group of retired ROC ambassadors and U.S. expatriates to foster the democratic
and humanitarian ideals of Lincoln.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Matsu worshipers to sail from Chiayi to Meizhou in Fujian</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 11 (CNA)
02/11/09  21:46:06
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of over 400 worshipers of Matsu -- known as the Chinese Goddess of Sea
or Empress of Heaven to believers around the world -- will sail directly from
Budai Port in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County to Meizhou Island in China's
Fujian Province Thursday.</P>
      <P>The pilgrimage, organized by the Tienhou Temple in Chiayi City, dedicated to
Matsu, will take the visitors to the Tienhou Temple in Meizhou Island, which is
the ancestral temple for the large number of Matsu followers across the globe,
including those in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A big ceremony to offer sacrifices to the sea was slated to be held at Budai
Port at 9: 00 p.m. Thursday, before the worshipers set sail. The ship from Budai
will sail into Meizhou Port in a traditional ritual on a trip of about six and a
half hours.</P>
      <P>It will be the first religious pilgrimage between Budai Port and the Chinese
side since direct cross-Taiwan Strait air and shipping links were opened in
December last year.</P>
      <P>Wang Kuang-li, a manager of Chiayi's Tienhou Temple, said the direct voyage will
help save a lot of travel time compared to the past when most Taiwanese
worshipers had to sail via one of Taiwan's offshore islands, Kinmen, to China on
what is known as "the mink links." A trip between Taiwan and Fujian Province's
Meizhou via the mini links takes at least one day, Wang noted.</P>
      <P>At the same time, some 200 other Matsu worshipers will board a flight from
Kaohsiung International Airport to Fujian's Xiamen airport en route to Meizhou.</P>
      <P>The two groups of over 600 Matsu believers from 26 temples across Taiwan will
meet in Meizhou and then proceed to the Tienhou Temple in Quangzhou in Fujian
Province to worship Matsu through Feb. 18.</P>
      <P>Meizhou is the native land where Matsu, whose given name was Lin Mo-liang, was
born over 1,000 years ago. After her death, the people began to pray to her as
they would to a deity. Matsu gradually became one of the most important folk
deities for people living in China's coastal regions and Taiwan. It is estimated
that half of Taiwan's 23 million people are worshipers of the Chinese Goddess of
the Sea, and it is believed that her prayers guide ships safely though the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to unofficial estimates, Taiwanese make more than 100,000 visits to
Meizhou's Tienhou Temple every year.</P>

      <P>The government has set a target of turning the crops of cabbage and Chinese
cabbage crops on 110 hectares of farmland around Taiwan into green fertilizer in
a bid to prevent overproduction, agriculture officials disclosed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The officials at the Agriculture and Food Agency under the Cabinet-level Council
of Agriculture said the measure is necessary to curb an imminent oversupply of
cabbage and Chinese cabbage -- two of the most widely grown leafy vegetable
crops in Taiwan -- in order to stabilize their prices.</P>
      <P>Farmers who are willing to join the program are entitled to a subsidy of
NT$70,000 (US$2,056) per hectare in compensation for their losses, according to
the officials.</P>
      <P>The program will continue until Feb. 13, with the aim of shredding 80 hectares
of cabbage and 30 hectares of Chinese cabbage and convert the crops into organic
fertilizer.</P>
      <P>The program is intended to protect the interests of the farmers by preventing a
glut of the produce that could cause a market collapse, the officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Japanese tourist arrivals forecast to grow 4% to 5%</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the current global economic downturn, the number of Japanese tourist
arrivals is expected to increase by 4 percent to 5 percent this year, Tourism
Bureau Director General Janice Lai said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the steep appreciation of the Japanese yen has made it cheaper
to travel to Taiwan on pleasure trips.</P>
      <P>Moreover, she said, the fuel oil surcharge has fallen from a high of 20,000 yen
(US$222.10) last year to the current 8,000 yen and may further drop to 3,000 yen
in March.</P>
      <P>All these advantages, coupled with geographic proximity and the Taiwanese
people's hospitality, will help to attract more Japanese tourists to Taiwan, Lai
explained.</P>
      <P>Japan has been Taiwan's most important tourism source. Affected by skyrocketing
fuel oil surcharges last year and a global financial tsunami, the number of
Japanese tourist arrivals fell to 1.08 million in 2008, marking a 6.8 percent
year-on-year decline.</P>
      <P>Lai made the remarks after signing an agreement with Nippon Travel Agency, the
fourth largest Japanese travel agency,  on attracting more Japanese people to
make sightseeing trips to Taiwan in 2009.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, Lai said, the Japanese travel agency promises to send
40,000 holidaymakers to Taiwan this year, up 33 percent from the 30,000 figure
recorded in 2008.</P>
      <P>Lai said the Tourism Bureau plans to sign similar pacts with four other top
Japanese travel agencies to organize more Japanese tour groups to Taiwan. If the
Japanese signatories reach their service targets, the Tourism Bureau will offer
advertising and manpower training subsidies in line with the contract terms.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Japan's JTB travel agency sent a 1,300-member tour group to
Taipei. All of the visitors are diamond-class managing members of the noted
Japanese direct sale cosmetic brand Pola and are known for their luxury
purchasing power.</P>
      <P>All the Pola tour group members will attend a citation ceremony at the Taipei
International Convention Center Thursday where they will be honored for their
outstanding sales records over the past year. Starting Saturday, they will split
up into smaller groups and tour duty-free shops and visit major tourist
attractions in suburban Taipei, including the National Palace Museum, Danshui
and Wulai.</P>
      <P>Given their deep pockets, the group is expected to bring an estimated NT$50
million-worth of business opportunities to local luxury good stores and tourism-
related services, Lai said.</P>

      <P>Former Eastern Multimedia Group Chairman Gary Wang who has been found guilty of
collaborating with his father to embezzle funds from the family's publicly
listed Rebar Asia Pacific Group, was released on NT$350 million (US$10.29
million) bail Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang was taken back into custody Jan. 21, three weeks after he was found guilty
by the Taipei District Court of collaborating with his father to siphon off
funds from the Rebar group.</P>
      <P>On Feb.9, the Taiwan High Court revoked the lower court decision and demanded
that it return a new ruling, pointing out that the lower court had not summoned
a former lawmaker, who was key figure in the matter, to testify.</P>
      <P>In response, a collegial panel of judges at the district court decided  to
release Wang on bail Wednesday  after the former legislator, Tsai Hau, testified
before the court that he had no intention of helping Wang flee Taiwan from
Penghu, as was rumored.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wang is barred from changing his residence or leaving Taiwan. He
is also required to report to a police station every evening and to the district
court every Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang was first taken into custody by prosecutors in June 2007 following the
exposure of the Rebar Group's financial woes and was released in May 2008 on
NT$350 million (US$10.45 million) bail, the highest in Taiwan's judicial
history.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 31, 2008, the district court sentenced Wang to 18 years in jail and
fined him NT$700 million. He has appealed his case in the Taiwan High Court,
which has not yet begun hearing the matter.</P>
      <P>Six of Gary Wang's  siblings  were also found guilty  of collaborating with
their father -- Rebar Group founder Wang You-theng -- to loot funds from various
of the conglomerate's subsidiaries.</P>
      <P>Wang You-theng has remained on the run since he fled overseas in December 2006,
soon after the Rebar Group applied for bankruptcy protection.</P>
      <P>Aside from Wang and his siblings, another 116 individuals were convicted of
various offenses in the court's mammoth 4,000-page verdict.</P>
      <P>The major irregularities identified by the court included the hollowing out of
Chia Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co., Great Chinese Bills Finance Corp. and
Asia Pacific Broadband Telecom Co. (APBT) ; illegal lending by The Chinese Bank
and Union Insurance Co.; and a fake transaction to siphon off funds between the
Eastern Multimedia Group and APBT.</P>
      <P>The total amount of funds siphoned off from the group was estimated at more than
NT$42.78 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Japanese tourist arrivals forecast to grow 4% to 5%</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.11  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the current global economic downturn, the number of Japanese tourist
arrivals is expected to increase by 4 percent to 5 percent this year, Tourism
Bureau Director General Janice Lai said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the steep appreciation of the Japanese yen has made it cheaper
to travel to Taiwan on pleasure trips.</P>
      <P>Moreover, she said, the fuel oil surcharge has fallen from a high of 20,000 yen
(US$222.10) last year to the current 8,000 yen and may further drop to 3,000 yen
in March.</P>
      <P>All these advantages, coupled with geographic proximity and the Taiwanese
people's hospitality, will help to attract more Japanese tourists to Taiwan, Lai
explained.</P>
      <P>Japan has been Taiwan's most important tourism source. Affected by skyrocketing
fuel oil surcharges last year and a global financial tsunami, the number of
Japanese tourist arrivals fell to 1.08 million in 2008, marking a 6.8 percent
year-on-year decline.</P>
      <P>Lai made the remarks after signing an agreement with Nippon Travel Agency, the
fourth largest Japanese travel agency,  on attracting more Japanese people to
make sightseeing trips to Taiwan in 2009.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, Lai said, the Japanese travel agency promises to send
40,000 holidaymakers to Taiwan this year, up 33 percent from the 30,000 figure
recorded in 2008.</P>
      <P>Lai said the Tourism Bureau plans to sign similar pacts with four other top
Japanese travel agencies to organize more Japanese tour groups to Taiwan. If the
Japanese signatories reach their service targets, the Tourism Bureau will offer
advertising and manpower training subsidies in line with the contract terms.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Japan's JTB travel agency sent a 1,300-member tour group to
Taipei. All of the visitors are diamond-class managing members of the noted
Japanese direct sale cosmetic brand Pola and are known for their luxury
purchasing power.</P>
      <P>All the Pola tour group members will attend a citation ceremony at the Taipei
International Convention Center Thursday where they will be honored for their
outstanding sales records over the past year. Starting Saturday, they will split
up into smaller groups and tour duty-free shops and visit major tourist
attractions in suburban Taipei, including the National Palace Museum, Danshui
and Wulai.</P>
      <P>Given their deep pockets, the group is expected to bring an estimated NT$50
million-worth of business opportunities to local luxury good stores and tourism-
related services, Lai said.</P>

      <P>The government has set a target of turning the crops of cabbage and Chinese
cabbage crops on 110 hectares of farmland around Taiwan into green fertilizer in
a bid to prevent overproduction, agriculture officials disclosed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The officials at the Agriculture and Food Agency under the Cabinet-level Council
of Agriculture said the measure is necessary to curb an imminent oversupply of
cabbage and Chinese cabbage -- two of the most widely grown leafy vegetable
crops in Taiwan -- in order to stabilize their prices.</P>
      <P>Farmers who are willing to join the program are entitled to a subsidy of
NT$70,000 (US$2,056) per hectare in compensation for their losses, according to
the officials.</P>
      <P>The program will continue until Feb. 13, with the aim of shredding 80 hectares
of cabbage and 30 hectares of Chinese cabbage and convert the crops into organic
fertilizer.</P>
      <P>The program is intended to protect the interests of the farmers by preventing a
glut of the produce that could cause a market collapse, the officials said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng called for closer ties between
his country and the European Union Wednesday during his first visit to the
European Parliament headquarters in the Belgian capital of Brussels.</P>
      <P>In particular, Wang suggested that the European Parliament help push for Taiwan
citizens to have visa-free access to EU countries to further bilateral
cooperation and exchanges.</P>
      <P>Belgium is the final leg of Wang's current European trip that has taken him to
Italy and the Vatican. Wang last visited the European Parliament seven years ago
at its official seat in Strasbourg, France.</P>
      <P>During this latest visit, Wang was invited to deliver a speech on Taiwan's
relations with the European Union and with China, at a luncheon hosted by the
European Parliament-Taiwan Friendship Group in the parliament building.</P>
      <P>Wang told his audience that since the inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou
last May, the new government has adopted a flexible and pragmatic approach
toward foreign and cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Such an approach has effectively improved the originally tense relations between
Taiwan and China over the past eight months, with the two sides having signed
six important agreements, including those on the launch of direct cross-strait
air and shipping links, to pave the way for expanded exchanges and cooperation,
Wang noted.</P>
      <P>Wang stressed that through continued dialogue with China under the new
administration led by President Ma, Taiwan has emerged as a contributor to world
peace, rather than a troublemaker.</P>
      <P>The EU integration experience, in which countries respect each other and pursue
common goals, sets a good example for the two governments across the Taiwan
Strait, he said.</P>
      <P>As far as Taiwan's foreign relations are concerned, Wang said participating in
international organizations such as the World Health Organization remains one of
the government's priorities, and he expressed gratitude to the European
Parliament for adopting an amendment last week in support of Taiwan's observer
status in global groups such as the International Labor Organization.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, pointing out that Taiwan and the European Union maintain close trade
ties and share a common desire for world peace and stability, Wang urged the
European Union to offer substantive support for Taiwan by assisting the country
in broadening its international participation.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that the two sides could enhance their exchanges and
cooperation in the areas of energy development, global warming and ecological
conservation.</P>
      <P>To further promote trade, cultural exchanges, investment and tourism, Wang
urged, the European Parliament should support visa waivers for Taiwanese
citizens, who make approximately 260,000 trips to Europe each year.</P>
      <P>At the end of the speech, Georg Jarzembowski, head of the European Parliament-
Taiwan Friendship Group, presented an award to Wang, who is also chairman of
Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, in recognition of his contribution to promoting
Taiwan's democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>In return, Wang conferred a medal on Jarzembowski to honor his contribution to
promoting parliamentary diplomacy with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A similar medal was later presented on a separate occasion to Graham Watson,
leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, who is known for
his long-term support for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Watson has announced his bid to run for the presidency of the European
Parliament, which will be re-elected in June.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, during a separate meeting with incumbent European Parliament
President Hans-Gert Pottering, Wang again expressed his appreciation to the
lawmaking body for its support of Taiwan's bid to participate in international
organizations.</P>
      <P>Also, he repeated his proposal that the European Parliament help promote visa
waiver treatment for Taiwanese citizens.</P>
      <P>Wang is scheduled to return to Taiwan Friday after wrapping up his European
visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Temple painting a fading art as artists' links with gods severed</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/12/09  14:52:45</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On a recent sunny winter morning, Huang Yo-chien, one of the few remaining
traditional temple painters in Taiwan, was filled with nostalgia as he began
painting door gods on the main entrance to the Dongjia Beijhih Temple in
Taiwan's outlying archipelago Penghu.</P>
      <P>It was at this centuries-old temple that the 77-year-old painter of temple wall
and door decorations began his career 60 years ago, as an apprentice to his
artisan father.</P>
      <P>The temple in the Dongjia district of Magong, Penghu County's capital, was
undergoing a major renovation at the time, and his father, Huang Wen-hua, was in
charge of the temple's decorations, including paintings and carvings.</P>
      <P>Six decades later, Huang is doing the same work as his father -- painting door
gods on the temple's main entrance and refreshing the colors of its paintings --
but there are few left to carry on this highly respected traditional art form
that painters like Huang have seen as a way of respecting local gods.</P>
      <P>Driven by pressures to earn more money and complete jobs quickly, fewer young
people are entering the profession, even if the 11,651 temples in Taiwan are
still places of central importance in Taiwanese society.</P>
      <P>The art of temple painting was once learned through patience and years of
practice, said Chiang Shao-ying, a professor at Taipei National University of
the Arts.</P>
      <P>But the current business environment deters the meticulous learning of the
craft, as temple paintings and decorations have become  just another  component
in bids for complete  temple construction projects.</P>
      <P>With project budgets cut to the bone, contractors often allocate only a tiny
share of the overall budget for the paintings, leaving artisans unwilling to do
the painstaking work of their predecessors, Chiang lamented.</P>
      <P>Temple painters were once relatively well paid compared to other professions,
but nowadays, they may earn only NT$200,000 (US$5,935) to NT$300,000 for each
project, which normally takes weeks or even months to complete.</P>
      <P>The lower budgets have also spurred changes in temple decoration techniques that
have discouraged the cultivation of temple artists.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, nearly all newly-built temples in Taiwan have been adorned
with bas reliefs, with door gods cut into the surface of their wooden gates by
machines rather than being painted, shortening construction time and saving
touch-up costs.</P>
      <P>As the nature of the business and the work has changed, so has the attitude of
the painters.</P>
      <P>While once truly devoted  to their profession  and seeing themselves as
fulfilling a commitment to the gods, today they are mere contractors without any
spiritual or emotional attachment to the job they have been hired to do.</P>
      <P>That attachment compelled masters of the trade like Huang and his father to take
an uncompromising approach to their work, but Huang also  credits  his father's
open-mindedness  for his artistic development.</P>
      <P>"He allowed his apprentices to develop innovative painting skills and foster
their own styles, " Huang remembered.</P>
      <P>His father, he said, accepted his experimentation with Western oil painting and
incorporating oil painting techniques into temple painting, innovative
techniques that enabled him to stand out and start a new trend in the field.</P>
      <P>Now considered one of the most renowned door god painters in Penghu and Taiwan,
Huang's works can be seen throughout Taiwan -- including at Sanfu Wangye Temple
in Keelung's Hepingdao and Yitien Templ in Taipei County's Sanchung -- but his
main body of work is in Penghu, which boasts Taiwan's highest temple density.</P>
      <P>At least 70 percent of Penghu's roughly 200 temples are decorated with Huang's
character paintings.</P>
      <P>The most difficult part of temple painting lies with painting the door gods,
whose role is to protect the temple and its worshippers from evil spirits, and
their facial expressions.</P>
      <P>"If your master dares to allow you to paint a door god's face, it means that
your professional skills have reached a level of maturity and that your
apprenticeship may come to an end," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Wang Wen-liang, a fine arts teacher at Magong Senior High School who is versed
in Penghu's temple art development, said Huang is a master at capturing door
gods' facial expressions, the eyes in particular.</P>
      <P>"The details of his craftsmanship and the vividness of the expressions of the
characters in his works demonstrate Huang's extraordinary artistry, " Wang said.
"Each character painted by him usually has a unique and interesting facial
expression."</P>
      <P>Huang himself is most satisfied with his work at Chenghuang Temple in Magong.
The gestures of the pair of door gods on the temple's  front gate are filled
with power and their facial expressions and postures express strong heroism.</P>
      <P>Huang regrets that the temple painting profession is fading fast in Penghu and
even in Taiwan, especially as there is nobody to follow in his footsteps and
Dongjia Beijhih Temple will be forced to contract artisans from Taiwan proper
for door and wall painting work in the future.</P>
      <P>Huang says age has caught up with him, and the Dongjia Beijhih Temple door gods
will be his last work.</P>
      <P>"I'll retire when it is completed, " said Huang, who estimates he has painted
more than 150 temples over his six-decade-long career.</P>
      <P>It is a fitting final assignment for Huang, as his career started and will end
at one of Taiwan's oldest temples that bears witness to the long history and
development of the art form.</P>
      <P>A temple official said Huang was a natural choice for the job.</P>
      <P>"The door gods on the main gate were painted by Huang Yo-chien's father when the
temple underwent a major facelift 60 years ago. His son's redoing the temple
symbolizes a continuation of the temple's history," the official said.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan in its weekly meeting Thursday approved a special four-year
budget of NT$500 billion (US$14.7 billion) for a public work expansion program
as part of its stimulus package to pull the economy out of its current slump.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan urged all government agencies to do their best to push

    <HEADLINE>Export woes drive NT dollar to 4-year low</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 12 (CNA)
02/12/09  15:58:17
(By Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar fell past the 34 mark against the U.S. dollar to a four-
year low of 34.001 Wednesday as Taiwan's central bank tried to maintain a weaker
currency and low domestic interest rates to prop up the sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>The NT dollar, which depreciated 1.27 percent against the greenback last year,
has further dropped some 3.4 percent over the past 25 trading days, on concern
that exports may slump further.</P>
      <P>The central bank bought U.S. dollars over the past few sessions in an effort to
help exporters tide over an exports slump brought about by the global economic
recession.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports totaled US$12.37 billion in January, a sharp drop of 44.1
percent from the same month last year, while imports fell even more steeply, by
56.5 percent, to US$8.97 billion. The figure translated into a monthly trade
surplus of US$3.4 billion, according to Ministry of Finance statistics.</P>
      <P>Expressing support for the central bank's financial policy, Kevin Hsiao, a
financial analyst at UBS AG's Taipei branch, also suggested that the bank should
allow a gradual rather than steep depreciation of the local currency in order to
reduce any possible side-effects.</P>
      <P>Following the high volume of U.S. dollar selling and buying by both local
exporters and foreign banks at an exchange rate of about NT$34 during the
trading session Wednesday, The NT dollar is not expected to drastically
depreciate in the near future, but rather it will rise to NT$32.4 gradually, a
foreign exchange dealer forecast.</P>
      <P>However, Yang Chia-yen, a research fellow at the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research (TIER), said that local currency devaluation may not necessarily boost
exports, but rather would increase the cost of imports.</P>
      <P>Yang attributed Taiwan's export slump to weaker demand triggered by the global
economic recession, particularly serious shrinkage of the main export markets in
the United States and China.</P>
      <P>Sagging exports would cause difficulties for many businesses, while unemployment
could increase because many industries would have to contend with fewer orders,
which would lead to layoffs, sliding consumer confidence and a contraction in
domestic demand, Yang said.</P>
      <P>As for interest rates, Taiwan's central bank has six times lowered its key
interest rate by 2.125 percentage points since September 2008. The benchmark
discount rate, the rate the central bank charges banks for loans, now stands at
1.5 percent.</P>
      <P>There is still room for further interest rate cuts, Kevin Hsiao said, adding
that Singapore and Hong Kong posted negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth
of 3.7 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively, in the fourth quarter of last
year. Taiwan's GDP might post an even larger decline over the same period, given
its lackluster export performance and a negative growth of 32 percent in terms
of industrial production for last December, he added.</P>
      <P>He predicted the benchmark discount rate will be slashed to 1 percent.</P>
      <P>Despite the sagging global economy, there is still encouraging news on the
market, Hsiao said. For example, the U.S. Institute for Supply (ISM) Production
Index registered a higher than expected 32.1 percent in January, and the
Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) of China's manufacturing sector has risen for
two consecutive months. Therefore,  he forecast that Taiwan's export performance
would probably not deteriorate.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Any exchanges between Taiwan's National Palace Museum (NPM) and China's Palace
Museum in Beijing will be based on dignity and equality, Executive Yuan
spokesman Su Jun-pin said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Exchanges between the museums should also be launched on the premise that
Taiwan's rights and interests will not be compromised, Su said.</P>
      <P>The planning involves not just exchanges between the two major museums across
the Taiwan Strait, but also some legal issues, Su said.</P>
      <P>The two executive agencies -- the NPM and the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)  --
will therefore further discuss the matter, particularly  the issue of the NPM's
designation if it holds exhibitions in China, he added.</P>
      <P>Su was referring to a recent rumor that Beijing would ask the NPM to change its
official name to "Taipei Palace Museum (TPM) " for the purpose of joining
exhibitions organized in China.</P>
      <P>"The Taiwan public can be assured  that the NPM and MAC authorities will work
out a plan that will not compromise Taiwan's rights and dignity," Su reiterated.</P>
      <P>An NPM delegation, to be headed by the museum's director Chou Kung-shin, is
scheduled to depart for Beijing Saturday on a three-day visit, during which the
NPM and its Beijing counterpart will discuss the possibility of cooperating on
exhibition arrangements, publicity campaigns and publications, as well as
academic and staff exchanges.</P>
      <P>The visit will mark the first official contact between the two national museums
in 60 years.</P>
      <P>The NPM decided recently to put politics aside and discuss joint exhibitions
with Beijing's Palace Museum. For starters, Chou plans to discuss with the
Beijing museum the possibility of borrowing some artifacts to add to a special
exhibition of the NPM's own collection on Emperor Yung-cheng -- the fourth ruler
of the Ching Dynasty -- slated to open in Taiwan in October.</P>
      <P>Chou has said that any Beijing exhibits brought to Taiwan will be guaranteed
safe return under Taiwan's 1992 Statute on Encouraging and Rewarding Cultural
and Art Enterprises, which stipulates that foreign art and cultural objects are
exempt from seizure or any legal entanglement over ownership.</P>
      <P>She added, however, that before any of Taiwan's treasures can be displayed in
China, a similar statute would have to be put in place by Beijing to guarantee
the same protection.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the Beijing museum will pay a return visit in early March,
according to Chou.</P>
      <P>The NPM -- one of the world's most famous museums -- has the world's largest
collection of Chinese historical artifacts totaling 650,000 pieces.</P>

      <P>The Taipei Computer Association (TCA) launched the 2009 Taipei Game Show at the
Taipei World Trade Center Thursday, with the aim of exploiting the business
opportunities associated with the government's consumption stimulation plan.</P>
      <P>Along with the game show, a special 3C section has been created to boost sales
of computers, consumer electronics and home appliances by encouraging spending
of the govenrment-issued shopping vouchers, organizers said, adding that the
event is especially designed to attract those who claim their coupons after the
Lunar New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the exhibition, Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin
Chii-ming described the TCA's idea as ingenious, and noted that more than 2
million people have already claimed their shopping vouchers since the end of the
New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>"And some NT$7.2 billion (US$212 million) worth of vouchers are yet to be
claimed by the public," said Yiin.</P>
      <P>Expressing strong support for the government's NT$85.7 billion shopping voucher
program, TCA Chairman J. T. Wang said that the timing of the voucher
distribution was perfect, as most people are likely to purchase new computers
and game-related products during or after the Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>"If I am asked to grade the results of the government's voucher program, I would
give it an A plus," said Wang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang urged game lovers and the public to take advantage  of this
year's  game show and 3C exhibition,  as participating companies are offering
discounts of up to 50 percent on game related products.</P>
      <P>Wang said that participating companies have also designed a variety of
attractive deals for consumers who purchase 3C or game products with their
shopping vouchers.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, with more than 400 booths set up by 40 local and foreign
companies, the five-day event is expected to attract over 300,000 visitors.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the
TCA, will run through Feb. 16.</P>
      <P>More than 90 percent of local citizens claimed their shopping vouchers before
the Lunar New Year holiday and the second stage of distribution of the coupons
began Feb.7.</P>

      <P>The Taichung County Police Station announced Thursday that it has detained nine
suspects for smuggling and selling banned or restricted pesticides from China to
local pesticide distributors and stores.</P>
      <P>The Taichung County police made the announcement  after a 49-year-old suspect,
identified as Kao, and eight other persons were arrested in raids earlier in the
day.</P>
      <P>In a joint crackdown, eight prosecutors, over 200 law enforcement agents and
Council of Agriculture (COA) officials searched 29 locations, including Kao's
house and offices. They also raided several sites in Taichung, Yunlin, Chiayi,
Taitung and Pintung in central and southern Taiwan where it was suspected that
the smuggling ring was manufacturing, storing and selling the products.</P>
      <P>The nine suspects were charged with smuggling illegal pesticides or raw
materials from China by boat to Taiwan's outlying Kinmen Island before
transferring them to Taiwan proper, since 2007.</P>
      <P>They were also accused of manufacturing illegal pesticides in five townships in
Taichung County in central Taiwan and selling them to pesticide stores across
the country at unfairly low prices.</P>
      <P>Police also seized large quantities of pesticides and toxic materials banned or

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou proposed Thursday that Taiwan be invited to take part in
the labor ministers meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) so as to allow the country to contribute to the resolution of regional
labor issues.</P>
      <P>Ma raised the issue while receiving Peter Favila, trade and industry secretary
of the Philippines, who is in Taiwan to attend the 16th ministerial-level
economic cooperation meeting between the two countries.</P>
      <P>More than 360,000 foreign laborers are currently employed to work in Taiwan,
with those from Southeast Asia forming the largest group, including some 75,000
from the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Ma told Favila that Taiwan  expects  to engage in closer cooperation  with the
Philippines  and to participate  in the development of the ASEAN free trade
area.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan began discussions with the Philippines issues concerning the
prevention of double taxation in 2002, and expressed the hope that a related
agreement could be signed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is the seventh largest foreign investor in the Philippines,
the president urged the Filipino government to provide wider preferential
treatment for Taiwanese investors to encourage them to expand their operations
in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma said Taiwan has been very successful in promoting the
establishment of digital opportunity centers in developing nations, under an
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum initiative to bridge the digital
divide, and he offered to further work with the Philippines in this regard to

      <P>With President Ma Ying-jeou calling for Taiwan's diplomacy to prioritize
economic issues, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that it
will step up its efforts to help local enterprises explore business
opportunities abroad.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press briefing, Shih Wen-bin, director-general of MOFA's
Department of Economic and Trade Affairs, said that the ministry will strengthen
the use of existing trade mechanisms in the hope of boosting the country's
export volume in the face of the global economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>The ministry  will,  for instance,  subsidize  local firms participating  in
business exhibitions in emerging markets and countries that have diplomatic
relations with Taiwan, he said. The MOFA will also work to match domestic
companies to foreign buyers at trade fairs held in promising markets such as
Saudi Arabia, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shih said the government will help local businesses, especially those
in globally competitive industries, obtain a share of the enormous World Trade
Organization's Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) market, which has an
approximate value of US$390 billion a year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the official encouraged Taiwan companies to explore business

      <P>Taiwanese pop queen Jolin Tsai recently launched a line of street and club wear
in New York, in cooperation with the noted L.A.M.B. Clothing, under the label of
"Seventy Two Changes."</P>
      <P>Tsai, one of the most popular Mandarin-language singers in Asia, traveled to New
York recently for the launch of the new collection, which is named after one of
her best-selling albums released in 2003, "See My 72 Changes -- Magic."</P>
      <P>At a cocktail held in SOHO to launch the brand, Tsai, an English major graduate
of Fu Jen Catholic University, discussed in fluent English with the media her
ideas and inspiration for the new collection.</P>
      <P>The event attracted journalists and cameramen from more than 30 media outlets
and fashion magazines in New York.</P>
      <P>Tsai said she has been taken with fashion and design since her childhood. She
said that as she was too short to be a model, she tried to become a designer.
"Now my dream has come true," she said.</P>

approximately 100 items modeled at the launch of the brand may contact her and
she would offer them outfits for free.</P>

streamline  the implementation of such programs, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Along with Taiwan's economic and technological development over the past few

      <P>Through the use of space and remote sensing as well as the Geographic

      <P>Taiwan will employ these technologies in a pilot project with Nicaragua -- one

02/12/09  20:08:29

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Tien Chiu-chin urged
President Ma Ying-jeou's administration Thursday to protect the country's
remaining cypress forests by establishing another national park.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference at the Legislative Yuan, Tien urged the
government to stop illegal cypress logging in the Chilan mountain area of
northern Taiwan by establishing a Chilan cypress national park.</P>
      <P>"The illegal cypress logging is getting worse year by year in the Chilan
mountain area, but the government has done nothing about the situation, " said
Tien, adding that local loggers have felled a great number of valuable 1,000
-year-old Chinese cypresses due to a lack of environmental protection in the
area.</P>
      <P>According to Tien, the government planned to establish a Chilan -- or Magaw in
the aboriginal Atayal language -- national park some six years ago, but the plan
was delayed indefinitely due to objections and obstructions by indigenous
tribespeople for whom the area is their traditional homeland and who would be
kicked off the land according to existing laws that prohibit aborigines from
living in national parks.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, the park would cover more than 53,000 acres, straddling Taipei,
Yilan, Taoyuan, and Hsinchu counties. The area is home to more than 30,500
Atayal people and is famous for its primeval forests made up primarily of red
and yellow cypress.</P>
      <P>By delaying the plan indefinitely, the government has sent a message to illegal
loggers that they are free to cut down as many cypress trees as they wish, Tien
argued.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a national park in the area "would be beneficial for the
indigenous tribes, " according to Tien, who added that the government would
grant at least NT$2 billion for the development and environmental protection of
the area within five years of the park's establishment.</P>
      <P>"The park would be able to attract at least 2 million visitors a year, " Tien
speculated, adding that it would represent a significant source of income and
opportunities for employment for the indigenous tribes who rely on farming as
their sole source of income.</P>
      <P>To ensure the livelihoods of local tribes, the government would have to devise
schemes to foster tourism on the periphery of the park, Tien admitted.</P>
      <P>According to Tien, the aborigines could become tour guides and investigators,
and could also learn how to produce and market local specialities as well as
providing lodging, food and transport to visitors.</P>
      <P>Although the government  prohibits  indigenous  tribes from inhabiting national
parks -- causing fury among many aboriginal tribes -- those ideals have changed
as time has progressed, Tien said, adding that the government must find a way to
protect the environment without depriving the aboriginal tribes of their
lifestyles and homes.</P>
      <P>According to Tien,  under Taiwan's National Park Law,  an evaluation hearing
must be conducted after five years of the establishment of a national park, in
which parties can petition for the exclusion of some pre-designated pieces of
land to be excluded from the park.</P>
      <P>"If the aboriginal people are still dissatisfied with the results of the park
after five years, they can petition for the exclusion of their land from the
park, " said Tien, adding that if the aborigines "continue to oppose to the
protection of the environment and the precious forests in the area, " they might
soon lose everything to illegal loggers.</P>
      <P>Three of Taiwan's six national parks have long been a point of contention
between the government and aborigines. Indigenous tribes such as the Bunun and
Atayal bemoan the fact that their ancestral lands are being violated and that
they are deprived of their rights to ritual activities such as hunting.</P>

      <P>Allowing competitive currency depreciation is not a good strategy for fighting
the financial recession because local businesses' difficulties come mainly from
fewer orders caused by weaker demand, the county's top economic planner said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Tain-jy made the comments after a regular Cabinet meeting in response to a
call by Winston Wang, chairman of the Grace T.H.W. Group, and other business
tycoons, for Taiwan's central bank to allow the new Taiwan dollar to fall to 40
against the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>Expressing opposition to adopting a weaker currency policy to help boost
exports, Chen said it would have a great impact in many other aspects, such as
increasing the cost of imports and damping interest in investment.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although the expansion of a host of public construction programs
under a four-year NT$500 billion economic stimulus package is expected to
contribute 0.97 percent of the total gross domestic product (GDP) this year,
media reports have recently expressed far more optimistic views than expected
about Taiwan's economic outlook.</P>
      <P>This is probably because exports posted a significant drop in the fourth quarter
of last year as the global economic slump deepened, and they therefore predicted
that exports will continue to fall, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Discounting the media speculation, Chen noted that despite the global economic
recession, the drop in consumer spending in the U.S. and European economies
still stands at less than 2 percent at present.</P>
      <P>Chen described a sharp slump of 41.9 percent in Taiwan's exports in December and
a 44.1 percent drop in January as short term phenomena because in this time of
global economic uncertainty, many foreign buyers are not willing to place long
term orders.</P>
      <P>However, he predicted that export orders will resume to normal volumes in about
three to four months.</P>

      <P>Over 400 Taiwanese worshipers escorted the Matsu statue at the Tienhou Temple in
southern Taiwan's Chiayi City to Budai Port in neighboring Chiayi County
Thursday at the start of a pilgrimage to Meizhou Island in China's Fujian
Province.</P>
      <P>A long string of fireworks was set off in a token of honor to Matsu -- the
Chinese goddess of the sea -- when worshipers carrying the Matsu statute in a
sedan chair on their shoulders began the walk out of the temple in a traditional
ritual presided over by Chiayi Mayor Huang Hui-min.</P>
      <P>Huang expressed hope that the pilgrimage -- the largest-ever for Chiayi City --
will help advance exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The more than 400 Taiwanese worshipers will travel directly from Budai to
Meizhou by ferry -- marking the first such voyage between Chiayi and the Chinese
side since direct cross-Taiwan Strait air and shipping links were opened in
December last year.</P>
      <P>Tienhou Temple on Meizhou is the ancestral temple for the large number of Matsu
followers around the globe, including those in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A big ceremony to offer sacrifices to the sea was slated to be held at Budai
later Thursday before the followers set sail. The direct trip from Budai to
Meizhou will cut the travel time to about six and a half hours.</P>
      <P>Wang Kuang-li, a Tienhou Temple manager, pointed out that previously, most
Taiwanese worshipers had to sail to China via the island of Kinmen, using the
"mini links, " a trip that takes at least one day.</P>
      <P>At the same time, some 200 other Matsu worshipers were scheduled to board a
flight from Kaohsiung International Airport to Fujian's Xiamen airport en route
to Meizhou.</P>
      <P>The two groups of over 600 Matsu believers from 26 temples around Taiwan will
converge in Meizhou and then proceed to the Tienhou Temple in Quangzhou, Fujian
Province, to worship Matsu through Feb. 18.</P>
      <P>Matsu is one of the most important folk deities for people living in China's
coastal regions and in Taiwan. It is estimated that half of Taiwan's 23 million
people are Matsu believers.</P>
      <P>According to unofficial estimates, Taiwanese make more than 100,000 visits to
Meizhou's Tienhou Temple every year.</P>
      <P>Meizhou is the native land where Matsu, whose given name was Lin Mo-liang, was
born over 1,000 years ago. After her death, the people began to pray to her as
they would to a deity. Matsu gradually became one of the most important folk
deities for people living in China's coastal regions and Taiwan. It is believed
that Matsu guides ships safely though the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese trade promotion delegation to be headed by the Bureau of Foreign
Trade (BOFT) is scheduled to depart for China Feb. 15 to push local foods and
related products, the BOFT said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The delegation, comprised of around 60 executives from 40 food-processing
companies, is scheduled to visit the central Chinese cities of Nanjing and Wuhan
Feb. 16-21, where it will promote Taiwanese food products via news conferences,
talks with importers, meetings with local government officials in charge of food
imports, and promotions at supermarket chainstores in the two cities.</P>
      <P>The campaign will be the first program launched by the BOFT in a three-year,
NT$8.53 billion (US$250.94 million) project called the New Zheng He Project,
which is aimed at turning Taiwan's export trade from negative to positive growth
this year.</P>
      <P>Four other food-promotion delegations are planning to visit southern, eastern,
western and northeastern China later this year, according to the BOFT.</P>
      <P>Under the New Zheng He Project -- named after a Ming Dynasty Chinese explorer --
the administration  will assist Taiwanese suppliers and manufacturers to produce
more goods for export, with the country's entire export trade hopefully topping
NT$500 billion in 2009, thus turning around the poor performance in the export
sector due to the global economic recession.</P>
      <P>The ambitious  export-bolstering  project  will also direct Taiwanese exporters
and manufacturers to emerging markets beyond China, including India, Russia,
Brazil, the Middle East and countries in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Zheng He was an official who lived during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) . He led

      <P>The Miaoli county government announced Thursday that world renowned tenor
Placido Domingo has accepted an invitation to perform in the northern county
next month.</P>
      <P>County officials said with the success of a performance by Jose Carreras in the
county late last year, they decided to invite another tenor in the same league
to perform in the county's international music festival scheduled for March
19-21.</P>
      <P>The officials said that to cater to all age groups, they will also invite Brian
Mcknight, winner of the favorite male R&amp;B Soul Artist in the American Music
Awards, as well as Maksim, a popular pianist from Croatia.</P>
      <P>The officials said that to upgrade the cultural level and stimulate
consumption,  they will sell tickets for the three performances this time
around, although prices had yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>The organizer of the Carreras performance last November gave out 40,000 free
tickets, but more than 50,000 people showed up on performance night,
contributing a great deal to the county's revenues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier calls for action plans for long-term care</HEADLINE>

      <P>With Taiwan's population aging rapidly, the government needs to craft a
comprehensive long-term care system and improve services to those in need of
help caring for disabled seniors, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a weekly Cabinet meeting, Liu said he was sad to learn that four
tragic cases involving exhausted family members killing their disabled parents
have been reported so far this year.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, a 45-year-old woman surrendered herself to the police after
suffocating her 71-year-old mother-in-law who reportedly had been bed-ridden
and had needed assisted living for some considerable time.</P>
      <P>"These cases indicate that long-term home care is a service urgently needed in
our society and the government cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the issue,"
Liu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that people aged 65 or older now make up more than 10 percent of the
country's population, Liu said the ratio will soon exceed 15 percent.</P>
      <P>"We must face up to the problems and take immediate action to deal with them if
we are to maintain social stability," he added.</P>
      <P>As a first step, the premier went on, relevant government agencies should work
in concert to draw up a well-rounded plan for the establishment of a viable
long-term care service system as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>According to statistics complied by the Taiwan Association of Family Caregivers,
there are about 30,000 people who need long-term care or assisted living staying
in various nursing homes around Taiwan, with another 160,000 relying on family
care provided by foreign caregivers and more than 400,000 others relying on care
provided by their families.</P>
      <P>A senior executive of the association said the government should offer more and
better stress relieving services for those involved in family care of disabled
elderly people.</P>
      <P>According to the executive, an average of 30 to 40 cases of long-term caregivers
killing the people in their care are reported in Taiwan every year.</P>
      <P>Of the four cases reported this year, the perpetrators in the three other cases
committed suicide after killing their loved ones, the executive said.</P>

      <P>The Taipei Computer Association (TCA) launched the 2009 Taipei Game Show at the
Taipei World Trade Center Thursday, with the aim of exploiting the business
opportunities associated with the government's consumption stimulation plan.</P>
      <P>Along with the game show, a special 3C section has been created to boost sales
of computers, consumer electronics and home appliances by encouraging spending
of the govenrment-issued shopping vouchers, organizers said, adding that the
event is especially designed to attract those who claim their coupons after the
Lunar New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the exhibition, Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin
Chii-ming described the TCA's idea as ingenious, and noted that more than 2
million people have already claimed their shopping vouchers since the end of the
New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>"And some NT$7.2 billion (US$212 million) worth of vouchers are yet to be
claimed by the public," said Yiin.</P>
      <P>Expressing strong support for the government's NT$85.7 billion shopping voucher
program, TCA Chairman J. T. Wang said that the timing of the voucher
distribution was perfect, as most people are likely to purchase new computers
and game-related products during or after the Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>"If I am asked to grade the results of the government's voucher program, I would
give it an A plus," said Wang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang urged game lovers and the public to take advantage  of this
year's  game show and 3C exhibition,  as participating companies are offering
discounts of up to 50 percent on game related products.</P>
      <P>Wang said that participating companies have also designed a variety of
attractive deals for consumers who purchase 3C or game products with their
shopping vouchers.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, with more than 400 booths set up by 40 local and foreign
companies, the five-day event is expected to attract over 300,000 visitors.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the
TCA, will run through Feb. 16.</P>
      <P>More than 90 percent of local citizens claimed their shopping vouchers before
the Lunar New Year holiday and the second stage of distribution of the coupons
began Feb.7.</P>

      <P>The Taichung County Police Station announced Thursday that it has detained nine
suspects for smuggling and selling banned or restricted pesticides from China to
local pesticide distributors and stores.</P>
      <P>The Taichung County police made the announcement  after a 49-year-old suspect,
identified as Kao, and eight other persons were arrested in raids earlier in the
day.</P>
      <P>In a joint crackdown, eight prosecutors, over 200 law enforcement agents and
Council of Agriculture (COA) officials searched 29 locations, including Kao's
house and offices. They also raided several sites in Taichung, Yunlin, Chiayi,
Taitung and Pintung in central and southern Taiwan where it was suspected that
the smuggling ring was manufacturing, storing and selling the products.</P>
      <P>The nine suspects were charged with smuggling illegal pesticides or raw
materials from China by boat to Taiwan's outlying Kinmen Island before
transferring them to Taiwan proper, since 2007.</P>
      <P>They were also accused of manufacturing illegal pesticides in five townships in
Taichung County in central Taiwan and selling them to pesticide stores across
the country at unfairly low prices.</P>
      <P>Police also seized large quantities of pesticides and toxic materials banned or
restricted by the COA, such as fentin acetate, cyromazine, acetamiprid and
bismerthiazol.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou proposed Thursday that Taiwan be invited to take part in
the labor ministers meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) so as to allow the country to contribute to the resolution of regional
labor issues.</P>
      <P>Ma raised the issue while receiving Peter Favila, trade and industry secretary
of the Philippines, who is in Taiwan to attend the 16th ministerial-level
economic cooperation meeting between the two countries.</P>
      <P>More than 360,000 foreign laborers are currently employed to work in Taiwan,
with those from Southeast Asia forming the largest group, including some 75,000
from the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Ma told Favila that Taiwan  expects  to engage in closer cooperation  with the
Philippines  and to participate  in the development of the ASEAN free trade
area.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan began discussions with the Philippines issues concerning the
prevention of double taxation in 2002, and expressed the hope that a related
agreement could be signed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is the seventh largest foreign investor in the Philippines,
the president urged the Filipino government to provide wider preferential
treatment for Taiwanese investors to encourage them to expand their operations
in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma said Taiwan has been very successful in promoting the
establishment of digital opportunity centers in developing nations, under an
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum initiative to bridge the digital
divide, and he offered to further work with the Philippines in this regard to
help enhance its information technology capabilities.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With President Ma Ying-jeou calling for Taiwan's diplomacy to prioritize
economic issues, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that it
will step up its efforts to help local enterprises explore business
opportunities abroad.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press briefing, Shih Wen-bin, director-general of MOFA's
Department of Economic and Trade Affairs, said that the ministry will strengthen
the use of existing trade mechanisms in the hope of boosting the country's
export volume in the face of the global economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>The ministry  will,  for instance,  subsidize  local firms participating  in
business exhibitions in emerging markets and countries that have diplomatic
relations with Taiwan, he said. The MOFA will also work to match domestic
companies to foreign buyers at trade fairs held in promising markets such as
Saudi Arabia, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shih said the government will help local businesses, especially those
in globally competitive industries, obtain a share of the enormous World Trade
Organization's Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) market, which has an
approximate value of US$390 billion a year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the official encouraged Taiwan companies to explore business
prospects  linked to the government's  bilateral  and multilateral  cooperation
schemes  with foreign  countries  or organizations such as the Asia Development
Bank, with which Taiwan has investment and technical cooperation programs.</P>
      <P>Other initiatives planned by the ministry include building stronger economic and
trade relations with countries with which Taiwan has Free Trade Agreements and
providing funding for local businesses to invest in countries that are Taiwan's
diplomatic allies, Shih said.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese pop queen Jolin Tsai recently launched a line of street and club wear
in New York, in cooperation with the noted L.A.M.B. Clothing, under the label of
"Seventy Two Changes."</P>
      <P>Tsai, one of the most popular Mandarin-language singers in Asia, traveled to New
York recently for the launch of the new collection, which is named after one of
her best-selling albums released in 2003, "See My 72 Changes -- Magic."</P>
      <P>At a cocktail held in SOHO to launch the brand, Tsai, an English major graduate
of Fu Jen Catholic University, discussed in fluent English with the media her
ideas and inspiration for the new collection.</P>
      <P>The event attracted journalists and cameramen from more than 30 media outlets
and fashion magazines in New York.</P>
      <P>Tsai said she has been taken with fashion and design since her childhood. She
said that as she was too short to be a model, she tried to become a designer.
"Now my dream has come true," she said.</P>
      <P>Tsai added that any performing artists who might be interested in any of the
approximately 100 items modeled at the launch of the brand may contact her and
she would offer them outfits for free.</P>

      <P>The latest information technology will be put to use in Taiwans international
cooperation and aid programs, starting  in Central  America,  in a bid  to
streamline  the implementation of such programs, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Along with Taiwan's economic and technological development over the past few
decades, the direction of its foreign aid programs has also shifted to more
heavily utilize the country's strength in technology, said Shih Wen-bin,
director-general of MOFA's Department of Economic and Trade Affairs.</P>
      <P>Through the use of space and remote sensing as well as the Geographic
Information System (GIS), he said, Taiwan will be better equipped to carry out
environment-related projects, such as outdoor surveillance, post-disaster work
and humanitarian relief in countries that are its diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will employ these technologies in a pilot project with Nicaragua -- one
of its Central American allies -- to help strengthen environmental
sustainability there, Shih added.</P>
      <P>As the information will be directly gathered and analyzed by Taiwan's satellite,
there will no need to send hardware or additional personnel to the allied
country, according to the official.</P>
      <P>The GIS has been utilized widely in areas such as urban planning, traffic
management, biological conservation and even archeological research, Shih added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Tien Chiu-chin urged
President Ma Ying-jeou's administration Thursday to protect the country's
remaining cypress forests by establishing another national park.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference at the Legislative Yuan, Tien urged the
government to stop illegal cypress logging in the Chilan mountain area of
northern Taiwan by establishing a Chilan cypress national park.</P>
      <P>"The illegal cypress logging is getting worse year by year in the Chilan
mountain area, but the government has done nothing about the situation, " said
Tien, adding that local loggers have felled a great number of valuable 1,000
-year-old Chinese cypresses due to a lack of environmental protection in the
area.</P>
      <P>According to Tien, the government planned to establish a Chilan -- or Magaw in
the aboriginal Atayal language -- national park some six years ago, but the plan
was delayed indefinitely due to objections and obstructions by indigenous
tribespeople for whom the area is their traditional homeland and who would be
kicked off the land according to existing laws that prohibit aborigines from
living in national parks.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, the park would cover more than 53,000 acres, straddling Taipei,
Yilan, Taoyuan, and Hsinchu counties. The area is home to more than 30,500
Atayal people and is famous for its primeval forests made up primarily of red
and yellow cypress.</P>
      <P>By delaying the plan indefinitely, the government has sent a message to illegal
loggers that they are free to cut down as many cypress trees as they wish, Tien
argued.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a national park in the area "would be beneficial for the
indigenous tribes, " according to Tien, who added that the government would
grant at least NT$2 billion for the development and environmental protection of
the area within five years of the park's establishment.</P>
      <P>"The park would be able to attract at least 2 million visitors a year, " Tien
speculated, adding that it would represent a significant source of income and
opportunities for employment for the indigenous tribes who rely on farming as
their sole source of income.</P>
      <P>To ensure the livelihoods of local tribes, the government would have to devise
schemes to foster tourism on the periphery of the park, Tien admitted.</P>
      <P>According to Tien, the aborigines could become tour guides and investigators,
and could also learn how to produce and market local specialities as well as
providing lodging, food and transport to visitors.</P>
      <P>Although the government  prohibits  indigenous  tribes from inhabiting national
parks -- causing fury among many aboriginal tribes -- those ideals have changed
as time has progressed, Tien said, adding that the government must find a way to
protect the environment without depriving the aboriginal tribes of their
lifestyles and homes.</P>
      <P>According to Tien,  under Taiwan's National Park Law,  an evaluation hearing
must be conducted after five years of the establishment of a national park, in
which parties can petition for the exclusion of some pre-designated pieces of
land to be excluded from the park.</P>
      <P>"If the aboriginal people are still dissatisfied with the results of the park
after five years, they can petition for the exclusion of their land from the
park, " said Tien, adding that if the aborigines "continue to oppose to the
protection of the environment and the precious forests in the area, " they might
soon lose everything to illegal loggers.</P>
      <P>Three of Taiwan's six national parks have long been a point of contention
between the government and aborigines. Indigenous tribes such as the Bunun and
Atayal bemoan the fact that their ancestral lands are being violated and that
they are deprived of their rights to ritual activities such as hunting.</P>

      <P>Allowing competitive currency depreciation is not a good strategy for fighting
the financial recession because local businesses' difficulties come mainly from
fewer orders caused by weaker demand, the county's top economic planner said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Tain-jy made the comments after a regular Cabinet meeting in response to a
call by Winston Wang, chairman of the Grace T.H.W. Group, and other business
tycoons, for Taiwan's central bank to allow the new Taiwan dollar to fall to 40
against the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>Expressing opposition to adopting a weaker currency policy to help boost
exports, Chen said it would have a great impact in many other aspects, such as
increasing the cost of imports and damping interest in investment.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although the expansion of a host of public construction programs
under a four-year NT$500 billion economic stimulus package is expected to
contribute 0.97 percent of the total gross domestic product (GDP) this year,
media reports have recently expressed far more optimistic views than expected
about Taiwan's economic outlook.</P>
      <P>This is probably because exports posted a significant drop in the fourth quarter
of last year as the global economic slump deepened, and they therefore predicted
that exports will continue to fall, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Discounting the media speculation, Chen noted that despite the global economic
recession, the drop in consumer spending in the U.S. and European economies
still stands at less than 2 percent at present.</P>
      <P>Chen described a sharp slump of 41.9 percent in Taiwan's exports in December and
a 44.1 percent drop in January as short term phenomena because in this time of
global economic uncertainty, many foreign buyers are not willing to place long
term orders.</P>
      <P>However, he predicted that export orders will resume to normal volumes in about
three to four months.</P>

      <P>Over 400 Taiwanese worshipers escorted the Matsu statue at the Tienhou Temple in
southern Taiwan's Chiayi City to Budai Port in neighboring Chiayi County
Thursday at the start of a pilgrimage to Meizhou Island in China's Fujian
Province.</P>
      <P>A long string of fireworks was set off in a token of honor to Matsu -- the
Chinese goddess of the sea -- when worshipers carrying the Matsu statute in a
sedan chair on their shoulders began the walk out of the temple in a traditional
ritual presided over by Chiayi Mayor Huang Hui-min.</P>
      <P>Huang expressed hope that the pilgrimage -- the largest-ever for Chiayi City --
will help advance exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The more than 400 Taiwanese worshipers will travel directly from Budai to
Meizhou by ferry -- marking the first such voyage between Chiayi and the Chinese
side since direct cross-Taiwan Strait air and shipping links were opened in
December last year.</P>
      <P>Tienhou Temple on Meizhou is the ancestral temple for the large number of Matsu
followers around the globe, including those in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A big ceremony to offer sacrifices to the sea was slated to be held at Budai
later Thursday before the followers set sail. The direct trip from Budai to
Meizhou will cut the travel time to about six and a half hours.</P>
      <P>Wang Kuang-li, a Tienhou Temple manager, pointed out that previously, most
Taiwanese worshipers had to sail to China via the island of Kinmen, using the
"mini links, " a trip that takes at least one day.</P>
      <P>At the same time, some 200 other Matsu worshipers were scheduled to board a
flight from Kaohsiung International Airport to Fujian's Xiamen airport en route
to Meizhou.</P>
      <P>The two groups of over 600 Matsu believers from 26 temples around Taiwan will
converge in Meizhou and then proceed to the Tienhou Temple in Quangzhou, Fujian
Province, to worship Matsu through Feb. 18.</P>
      <P>Matsu is one of the most important folk deities for people living in China's
coastal regions and in Taiwan. It is estimated that half of Taiwan's 23 million
people are Matsu believers.</P>
      <P>According to unofficial estimates, Taiwanese make more than 100,000 visits to
Meizhou's Tienhou Temple every year.</P>
      <P>Meizhou is the native land where Matsu, whose given name was Lin Mo-liang, was
born over 1,000 years ago. After her death, the people began to pray to her as
they would to a deity. Matsu gradually became one of the most important folk
deities for people living in China's coastal regions and Taiwan. It is believed
that Matsu guides ships safely though the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) is pushing for legislation
that would stipulate tax deductions for cultural expenses, the head of the
council said Thursday.</P>
      <P>CCA Minister Huang Pi-tuan said that under the terms of a draft bill governing
the development of cultural and creative affairs, each taxpayer will be entitled
to enjoy a tax deduction up to NT$12,000 per year for his or her expenses spent
on cultural activities, including tickets to concerts, operas, other performance
arts and public exhibitions at museums.</P>
      <P>Expenses for books and movies are not included in the draft bill, Huang said,
but she added that there is room for discussion on their inclusion.</P>
      <P>Huang said the draft bill will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval
before it is referred to the Legislative Yuan for legislation.</P>
      <P>If the draft bill -- devised to encourage culture-loving people and develop a
larger literati -- is passed into law by the Legislative Yuan this year,
taxpayers could enjoy the tax deductions next May at the earliest, Huang added.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese trade promotion delegation to be headed by the Bureau of Foreign
Trade (BOFT) is scheduled to depart for China Feb. 15 to push local foods and
related products, the BOFT said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The delegation, comprised of around 60 executives from 40 food-processing
companies, is scheduled to visit the central Chinese cities of Nanjing and Wuhan
Feb. 16-21, where it will promote Taiwanese food products via news conferences,
talks with importers, meetings with local government officials in charge of food
imports, and promotions at supermarket chainstores in the two cities.</P>
      <P>The campaign will be the first program launched by the BOFT in a three-year,
NT$8.53 billion (US$250.94 million) project called the New Zheng He Project,
which is aimed at turning Taiwan's export trade from negative to positive growth
this year.</P>
      <P>Four other food-promotion delegations are planning to visit southern, eastern,
western and northeastern China later this year, according to the BOFT.</P>
      <P>Under the New Zheng He Project -- named after a Ming Dynasty Chinese explorer --
the administration  will assist Taiwanese suppliers and manufacturers to produce
more goods for export, with the country's entire export trade hopefully topping
NT$500 billion in 2009, thus turning around the poor performance in the export
sector due to the global economic recession.</P>
      <P>The ambitious  export-bolstering  project  will also direct Taiwanese exporters
and manufacturers to emerging markets beyond China, including India, Russia,
Brazil, the Middle East and countries in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Zheng He was an official who lived during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) . He led
a giant fleet of Chinese vessels to Southeast Asia, from where they are believed
to have reached as far as the west coast of Africa. He was instrumental in
building China into one of the maritime superpowers between the 14th and 17th
centuries.</P>

      <P>With Taiwan's population aging rapidly, the government needs to craft a
comprehensive long-term care system and improve services to those in need of
help caring for disabled seniors, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a weekly Cabinet meeting, Liu said he was sad to learn that four
tragic cases involving exhausted family members killing their disabled parents
have been reported so far this year.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, a 45-year-old woman surrendered herself to the police after
suffocating her 71-year-old mother-in-law who reportedly had been bed-ridden
and had needed assisted living for some considerable time.</P>
      <P>"These cases indicate that long-term home care is a service urgently needed in
our society and the government cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the issue,"
Liu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that people aged 65 or older now make up more than 10 percent of the
country's population, Liu said the ratio will soon exceed 15 percent.</P>
      <P>"We must face up to the problems and take immediate action to deal with them if
we are to maintain social stability," he added.</P>
      <P>As a first step, the premier went on, relevant government agencies should work
in concert to draw up a well-rounded plan for the establishment of a viable
long-term care service system as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>According to statistics complied by the Taiwan Association of Family Caregivers,
there are about 30,000 people who need long-term care or assisted living staying
in various nursing homes around Taiwan, with another 160,000 relying on family
care provided by foreign caregivers and more than 400,000 others relying on care
provided by their families.</P>
      <P>A senior executive of the association said the government should offer more and
better stress relieving services for those involved in family care of disabled
elderly people.</P>
      <P>According to the executive, an average of 30 to 40 cases of long-term caregivers
killing the people in their care are reported in Taiwan every year.</P>
      <P>Of the four cases reported this year, the perpetrators in the three other cases
committed suicide after killing their loved ones, the executive said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and the Philippines signed four memoranda of understanding (MOUs) upon
the conclusion of the 16th ministerial-level  economic cooperation meeting
between the two countries aimed at bolstering bilateral cooperation, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The MOUs  were forged  on cooperation  in the fields  of standardization and
conformity assessment, cooperation in small- and medium-sized  enterprises,
cross-border  information  technology exchanges  and cooperation  in the
semiconductor  manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>During the two-day meeting, the Philippines agreed to give priority
consideration to lowering import tariffs on polyester fiber from Taiwan. There
is no polyester fiber processing industry in the Philippines, MOEA officials
noted.</P>
      <P>The Philippines agreed to simplify customs procedures for imports of Taiwanese
goods at the Subic Bay Freeport Zone, which houses several Taiwanese companies,
and at the Clark Freeport Zone north of Manila, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>It was announced during the meeting that Spirit of Manila Airlines will offer
direct flight services between the Clark Freeport Zone and Taipei from March 15.</P>
      <P>It was also announced during the meeting that ATA carnet systems will be
activated June 15 between Taiwan and the Philippines to facilitate temporary
imports to each other's country. The ATA carnet operations  will be implemented
only for cooperation  in the intellectual property area, MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>The Philippines is Taiwan's 14th-largest trade partner, while Taiwan is the
eighth-largest trade partner of the Philippines. Bilateral trade totaled US$7.03
billion in 2008.</P>
      <P>According  to tallies  compiled  by the MOEA's  Investment Commission,
Philippines investment in Taiwan totaled 252 cases worth a combined US$1.17
billion as of last December, while Taiwanese investment in the Philippines
amounted to 974 cases, worth a combined US$1.84 billion as of last June.</P>

      <P>A total of 80 tons of banned or substandard pesticides smuggled from China have
been identified as being on sale around Taiwan, the Council of Agriculture (COA)
confirmed Friday.</P>
      <P>The pesticides, believed to be on sale at 20 pesticide shops around the country,
include long-banned fentin acetate, a lethal weapon against crop-depleting apple
snails, as well as 10 other categories of counterfeit pesticides such as
cyromazine, acetamiprid and bismerthiazol, according to officials from the COA
Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine.</P>
      <P>The officials said fentin acetate has been banned across the board in Taiwan
since 1997 due to the harm it causes to the human central nervous system and to
embryos.</P>
      <P>The Taichung County Police Station in central Taiwan said a day earlier that it
had nabbed nine suspects for smuggling and selling banned or counterfeit
pesticides from China.</P>
      <P>After raiding several sites in central and southern Taiwan, the Taichung police

former President Bill Clinton during the late 1990s, and during the 1996 Taiwan
Missile Crisis, he met with Taiwan's National Security Council Secretary-General
Ting Mao-shih, which later became the primary channel of communication between
the two nation's national security agencies.</P>
      <P>Asked what he thinks about the current cross-strait situation, Steinberg said
the U.S. will keep a watchful eye on Taiwan-China relations,  as they are one of
the most important issues on Washington's foreign affairs agenda.</P>
      <P>Both parties in the United States have a consensus about the U.S. cross-strait
policy, and it has been one of the most successful in terms of U.S. foreign
policy , Steinberg said.</P>
      <P>Steinberg said the U.S. has maintained the same cross-strait policy for more
than 30 years, as it has served the best interests of the parties involved and
has helped maintain peace and stability in the area.</P>
      <P>U.S. cross-strait policy under the "one-China" policy has greatly contributed to
Taiwan's democracy and cross-strait economic development, and it is very
important for the U.S to maintain its one-China policy in its cross-strait
policy, said Steinberg, describing it as beneficial for all parties and ensuring
the peace and stability of the area.</P>
      <P>The interaction between the people, the closer economic ties and the increasing
cultural exchanges between Taiwan and China are remarkable achievements for the
leaders of the two sides, said Steinberg.</P>

      <P>The current economic downturn, which is threatening the livelihoods of many
local workers, has also dampened their mood for Feb. 14, Valentine's Day.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a survey released Friday by the travel Web site
travel.1111.com.tw, 37 percent of the respondents with a partner said they will
not celebrate Valentine's Day this year, either because they are out of work, on
unpaid leave or away from their lovers.</P>
      <P>Among those not in a relationship, 60 percent said they will ignore the
occasion, while another 21 percent will celebrate it on their own.</P>
      <P>Forty-eight percent of the respondents intending to celebrate Valentine's Day
said they will spend less this year than they did last year as they are on a
tighter budget.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to negotiate with WHO if belittled in IHR integration process</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will negotiate with the World Health Organization (WHO) if Taiwan
is belittled in the WHO's International  Health  Regulations  (IHR)  integration
process, Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Liu Teh-hsun said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Responding to claims in the local media that China is conspiring to belittle and
jeopardize Taiwan's sovereignty while the nation is being integrated into the
IHR, Liu said the government is paying close attention to the integration
process and will immediately negotiate with the WHO if the nation's sovereignty
is belittled in the process.</P>
      <P>The WHO notified Taiwan in January that it has been brought under the umbrella
of the IRH, a legal framework under the WHO for global infectious disease
control, said Liu, adding that Taiwan is now establishing contact and
interaction with the WHO as it is now part of the global epidemic disease
control and health care network.</P>
      <P>"The procedures in the integration process have nothing to do with China," said
Liu, adding that Taiwan's participation in the IHR mechanism is conducted
through the WHO and does not need Beijing's approval.</P>
      <P>Things are going smoothly at the moment, Liu went on, adding that the government
will protect Taiwan's sovereignty and interests at all costs in the integration
process.</P>
      <P>Liu pointed out that the IHR is only one of the many mechanisms under the WHO,
and at the same time urged China not to obstruct Taiwan's participation in the
World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the executive arm of the WHO -- as an observer.</P>
      <P>"The government will continue to fight for Taiwan's right to participate in the
WHA and the WHO's mechanisms and activities, " said Liu, adding that it is vital
for Taiwan to protect the health and rights of its citizens.</P>
      <P>Because of China's opposition,  Taiwan had previously been excluded from the
IHR, even though a "universal application" phrase was introduced in the
regulations in 2005 with the firm support of the United  States and Taiwan's
diplomatic  allies,  and the encouragement of the European Union and Japan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier apologizes to Hansen's disease sufferers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan offered a public apology Thursday to all victims of
Hansen's disease, or leprosy, and promised that the government will provide them
with better nursing and medical care in the future.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular weekly Cabinet meeting, Liu apologized for the unfair
treatment Hansen's disease patients have suffered in the past.</P>
      <P>The patients were forcibly quarantined at the 78-year-old Losheng Sanatorium in
Sinjhuang, Taipei County under a segregation policy between 1930 and 1962. Last
year, they were removed from the sanatorium to make way for a mass rapid transit
depot, but some of them refused to leave and staged a protest against the
government's move.</P>
      <P>Liu said that following the enactment of the Statute on the Human Rights of and
Compensation for Hansen's Disease Patients last Aug. 13, leprosy suffers can now
get better care.</P>
      <P>Under the law, the government is to recompense mistreated sufferers and provide
lifelong care to the residents of Losheng Sanatorium, who were labeled
infectious and who were poorly treated by previous administrations.</P>
      <P>The premier said that previous governments did not take a proactive and
effective approach to end the discrimination against Hansen's disease patients,
which not only caused hurt to their dignity and human rights, but also caused
them severe mental anguish.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging  the unfairness  of past policies on leprosy sufferers, Liu said
that the government has paid tens of millions of new Taiwan dollars in
compensation to them and is working to restore their reputations and raise
public awareness of the disease.</P>
      <P>Liu also said the government will move to develop the sanatorium into a facility
for the treatment of chronic disease patients and a cultural heritage site.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, Department of Health Minister Yeh Ching-chuan visited Losheng and
offered an apology on behalf of Liu to the residents, receiving a warm welcome
from some of them.</P>
      <P>"I am happy to receive the government's apology because I have waited for so
long, " said Huang Wen-chang, who has been kept at the sanatorium for 54 years
since he was 20 years old. He added that he previously took part in the protests
over the relocation plan but that he is now satisfied with his living conditions
now that the government renovated the buildings in which he lives.</P>
      <P>However, Yeh's apology was also rejected by many others, most of whom are
unhappy about being relocated.</P>
      <P>Lee Tien-pei, a Losheng resident and chairman of the Losheng Self-Help
Organization, dismissed the apology as "an empty rhetorical statement, " adding
that he has not received any hard information on what the government has done or
will do for the leprosy suffers.</P>
      <P>Taking himself as an example, Lee said he has been forcibly quarantined for half
a century, but still has not seen the government come up with any concrete
measures to help end discrimination against the patients and help them back into
society.</P>
      <P>"I will not accept the government's apology, " said Lan Tsai-yun, another
Losheng resident, while describing how she was forcibly removed by the police
from her residence last December. She recalled that the police cut the power and
water when she was still living there, then cut down her door and took her away
by force.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 2.2 million adults in Taiwan have never fallen in love or had a
relationship with a member of the opposite sex, results of a public opinion poll
showed Friday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by Fu Jen Catholic University on behalf of the nonprofit
Mental Health Foundation, found that those who have never been in love have
lower mental health scores (an average of 80.1 points), than those who have had
relationships (who average 86.5 points).</P>
      <P>Yang Tsung-tsai,  a doctor  with Cardinal  Tien Hospital's Neuroscience Center
who supervised the poll, said 13.3 percent of survey  respondents  indicated
they have never been in love, translating roughly into 1.1 million men and 1.1
million women who have not had a relationship, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Yen Han-wen, a sex education professor at National Normal University, attributed
the large number of bachelors and spinsters in Taiwan mainly to the lack of an
"environment conducive to falling in love" in Taiwanese society.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, if a man invites a woman out on a date, they will immediately be
labeled as "a couple," a label preventing the man from attempting to get
acquanted with other women, Yen said.</P>
      <P>In Western society, he said, a private date between a man and a woman is just
one of many ways of getting to know each other.</P>
      <P>Yen also observed that young women in Taiwan often go out in groups, a situation
not conducive to men getting to know one of the group members privately.</P>
      <P>Yen suggested that both men and women should not only speak to people they are
familiar with at social gatherings and said that because local society still
frowns on a woman openly asking a man out, women should find less obvious or
indirect ways to arrange a date with guys they like.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted via telephone between September and October last year,
obtained 1,114 valid responses and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will hold an exhibition of African
handicrafts for sale in May as part of its efforts to promote cultural and
commercial exchanges with the continent, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-bin, director-general of MOFA's Department of Economic and Trade
Affairs, said that as Africa has suffered from the global economic slowdown
along with the rest of the world, he hoped sales at the show would contribute to
the economies of the participating countries.</P>
      <P>The African countries offering handicrafts for sale will be diplomatic allies
Burkina Faso, The Gambia, Swaziland and Sao Tome and Principe, and three non-
allies that are friendly toward Taiwan -- South Africa, Nigeria and Libya --
Shih said.</P>
      <P>Although some of the countries are economically underdeveloped, their
craftsmanship skills rank among the best in the world, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee Pai-po, deputy secretary-general of the International Cooperation and
Development Fund (ICDF), a MOFA arm that provides technical and agricultural aid
to foreign countries, said that in addition to the economic crisis, Taiwan is
also helping its allies in Africa, Central America and the Caribbean confront
the global food crisis.</P>
      <P>Lee said the ICDF's technical teams stationed in five of the country's allies --
Burkina Faso, The Gambia, Swaziland, Nicaragua and Haiti -- will step up their
efforts to carry out programs that help increase local harvests and mitigate
food shortages in those countries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States' new intelligence director reaffirmed Thursday Washington's
commitment to help Taiwan maintain a military balance with China and warned that
"preparations for a possible Taiwan conflict" remains a main purpose of China's
military modernization.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan should not be so defenseless that it feels that it has to do everything
that China says. On the other hand, China cannot be so overwhelming that it can
bully Taiwan, " said Dennis Blair, director of national intelligence under
President Barack Obama, during a hearing held by the Senate Committee on
Intelligence.</P>
      <P>In an annual threat assessment delivered to the committee, Blair said that
Taiwan as an area of tension in U.S.-China relations has substantially relaxed
since the election of President Ma Ying-jeou in 2008.</P>
      <P>With dialogue between Taiwan and China resumed soon after Ma's inauguration,
leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are cautiously optimistic that a new
period of "less confrontational relations" has begun," Blair said.</P>
      <P>However, many challenges remain, he said, noting that Taipei and Beijing will
eventually need to confront issues such as Taiwan's participation in
international organizations.</P>
      <P>In addition, Beijing has not renounced the use of force against Taiwan, and
China's leaders see maintaining the goal of unification as vital to regime
legitimacy, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, he said, the United States must continue to "make
sure that military adventures are unattractive" to both sides to strike a
balance in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to Blair, Taiwan has to realize that its long-term security lies in
"some sort of arrangement" with China, rather than in military defenses.</P>
      <P>He said the two sides should be encouraged to resolve their differences through
political and civil exchanges and proposed that they try to reach  an
arrangement  on Taiwan's  international participation.</P>
      <P>The United States, which is committed under the Taiwan Relations Act to help
Taiwan maintain a sufficient defense, has been Taiwan's most important weapons
supplier.</P>
      <P>In the latest arms deal between the two sides, the administration of former U.S.
President George W. Bush approved in late 2008 the sale of a package of weapons
to Taiwan, including 30 Apache attack helicopters, 330 advanced capability
Patriot (PAC-3) missiles, 32 Harpoon sub-launched missiles, 182 guided Javelin
missile rounds, and four E-2T system upgrades.</P>
      <P>The move, however, drew strong protest from China, which reacted by suspending
military-to-military exchanges and nonproliferation talks with the United
States.</P>

      <P>The European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT)  and Chinese Cultural University
on Friday launched an "International Internship Programto give students in
Taiwan a chance to work in an international environment and get practical work
experience and on the job training.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the agreement signing ceremony at the university's School of
Continuing Education, ECCT CEO Guy Wittich said the program can serve as a
bridge between European industrial resources and the talented Taiwanese work
force.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's competitiveness lies in its talent and this program provides a good
match for Taiwan's talent with European companies, " Wittich said.</P>
      <P>Program initiator Elias Ek, co-chairman of the ECCT's SME Center (Small and
Medium-sized Enterprises Center) , told the Central News Agency that both
companies and students can benefit greatly from the program.</P>
      <P>It's a win-win situation, Ek said.Maybe it's not so much about contributing but
inventing more win-win situations so we can benefit everybody.</P>
      <P>According to Ek, the internship program is a good way for European companies in
Taiwan to market themselves as good places to work and students will also get
university credits, job experience and earn a little bit of money through it.</P>
      <P>Asked how long the cooperation program will last, Ek said he sees no end to it
but rather the beginning of something that he hopes will keep on going for a
long time.</P>
      <P>Rain Lee, a sophomore majoring in advertising at the university, said that she
was interested in working for marketing companies.</P>
      <P>At a time of economic recession, it's very important to have work experience,
and I believe the internship program will increase my competence and my ability
to speak to people,she said.</P>
      <P>Sherry Chen,  a junior in the university's  Department of International  Trade,
expressed great interest in joining the internship program, saying that she
attended the event to see what qualities foreign companies were looking for.</P>
      <P>She was worried, however, that her poor English speaking ability might be an
obstacle in gaining an internship in these companies.</P>
      <P>In response, Jesse Arlen Smith, co-chairman of the SME Center who owns a
consulting company in Taiwan, said that his company offers an on-the-job
training program that will prepare interns for their work.</P>
      <P>The program, which looks to hire 40-50 students to work part-time for several
European companies in Taiwan, offers internships in fields  such  as business
management,  marketing,  consulting, international trade, finance, MIS-IT and
education.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) formally extended an
invitation to President Ma Ying-jeou Friday to attend the opposition-organized

      <P>DPP Deputy  Secretary-General  Chen Chi-mai  delivered  the invitation during a
20-minute meeting with Presidential Office Secretary-General Chan Chuen-po and
Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi.</P>
      <P>Chan promised to hand the invitation to Ma but did not say whether the president
will attend the conference, which is being held jointly by the DPP and the
Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>Presidential spokesman Wang Yu-chi said that the government will consider
whether the president should participate and in what form before responding to
the DPP's invitation.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP's Chen, Chan reiterated Ma's hope that DPP Chairwoman Tsai
Ing-wen would agree to have a talk with the president in the Presidential
Office, but Chen replied that the national affairs conference would be the best
venue for their meeting and hoped Ma would attend to listen to public opinion.</P>
      <P>Chen said the national convention is intended to give local people the chance to
voice their views on how to tackle rising unemployment and deal with issues
related to China policy.</P>
      <P>The DPP deputy secretary added that once the president agrees to attend the
conference, the party will discuss Ma's attendance schedule with the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office reiterated, however, that an in-depth talk between Ma
and Tsai would be the best and most effective means of communication between the
government and the opposition party.</P>
      <P>During the DPP's visit Friday, Chan stressed Ma was committed to finding ways to
revive the economy and promoting harmony between the ruling and opposition
parties, and that he attached great importance to public opinion, to the point
of visiting rural areas to seek out grassroots opinion even as the meeting with
DPP representatives was taking place.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 90 percent of elementary and junior high schools in the southern port
city of Kaohsiung have reduced their lunch fees in an effort to mitigate the
financial burden on parents amid the current economic recession, a city
councilor said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Lien Li-chien, the city's Bureau of Education raised school lunch
fees by NT$5 last autumn.</P>
      <P>During the just-concluded winter vacation,  Lien said,  he conducted a field
study which showed that 97 percent of the schools registered a budget surplus in
the previous semester, with many posting a surplus of more than NT$1 million and
one registering a surplus as high as NT$4.3 million.</P>
      <P>Acting on the Kaohsiung City Council's request, the municipal education bureau
has authorized public elementary and junior high schools to drop their school
lunch fees.</P>
      <P>According to the results of Lien's latest survey, all of the city's 91 public
elementary schools have lowered their lunch fees by an average of NT$2.3. Among
them, seven slashed lunch fees by NT$5 and 71 others cut their fees by NT$2.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 37 of the city's 40 public junior high schools have reduced their
lunch fees by an average of NT$2.6, with three lowering the fees by NT$5.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan plans to study CECA with China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) promised Friday to study the feasibility
of signing a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) with China, in
response to a call by business and industrial groups for the government to hold
talks with Beijing on that and other trade matters.</P>
      <P>The MOEA stated in a press statement that it has been closely monitoring the
formation of a regional economic bloc that includes the Association  of
Southeast  Asian Nations (ASEAN)  and its neighboring trade partners of China,
Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>The MOEA knows that Taiwanese  exporters  will face tough challenges when the
"ASEAN plus one" -- ASEAN and China -- free trade zone goes into operation in
2010, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the government has been seeking to sign free trade agreements (FTAs)
with Taiwan's major trading partners and has spared no effort to devise
strategies to deal with its exclusion from the regional economic bloc, the MOEA
said.</P>
      <P>Industry and business groups in Taiwan have been pushing for the Taiwan
government to forge closer economic links with China by signing a CECA, and to
move quickly to liberalize cross-strait trade though actions such as the removal
of tariffs.</P>
      <P>Amid some doubt and uncertainty in Taiwan regarding the idea of signing a CECA
with China, the MOEA said it will conduct a study on how such an agreement could
be achieved without sacrificing the overall interests of the country's
industrial sectors.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is also concerned that ASEAN enters into an "ASEAN plus three"
arrangement, which not only includes China but also Japan and South Korea --
with import duties on goods flowing between East Asia and the Southeast Asia
countries will be lowered or eliminated.</P>
      <P>This means that countries outside the economic bloc will have to contend with
import duties ranging from 6.5 percent to 14.9 percent in competing with
exporters from East Asia or ASEAN vying for regional markets.</P>
      <P>Fearing they will lose their competitiveness, six of Taiwan's major business and
industrial organizations -- the Chinese National Association of Industry and
Commerce, Chinese National Federation of Industries,  Taiwan  Electrical  and
Electronic  Manufacturers' Association, National Association of Small and Medium
Enterprises, General Chamber of Commerce of Republic of China, and Taiwan
Federation of Industry -- urged the government to take action as soon as
possible to deal with the looming problem.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has sought to build closer economic ties and eventually
ink a CECA with China, but the approach has drawn strong criticism from some
quarters, including the pro-independence opposition  Taiwan Solidarity  Union
(TSU)  and the Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei argued that the proposed CECA with China will force
Taiwan to follow the Hong Kong and Macau model, which will ultimately downgrade
Taiwan to the level of a local government subordinate to Beijing.</P>

      <P>Tuvalu Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia and his wife will arrive in Taiwan Saturday
for a five-day visit at the invitation of the Republic of China government.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Tuvalu will celebrate the 30th anniversary of their diplomatic
relations this year. Ielemia's visit marks the close friendship between the two
island states, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Friday in a
statement.</P>
      <P>Tuvalu is a Polynesian island nation located in the Pacific Ocean midway between
Hawaii and Australia. It is composed of nine islets and has a population of
around 11,000 people.</P>
      <P>That makes it the third least inhabited independent country in the world,  with
only Vatican  City and Nauru having smaller populations.</P>
      <P>During his stay, Ielemia will visit President Ma Ying-jeou, Premier Liu Chao-
shiuan and Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco Ou, according to the MOFA
statement.</P>
      <P>In addition, the prime minister will be interviewed by the Taipei-based
CommonWealth Magazine, which organized a "saving Tuvalu islets from global
warming with green ideas" activity last Dec. 10, inviting elementary school
students to draw their ideas on paper.</P>
      <P>Ielemia has been invited to tell Taiwanese students in person how his country is
faced with being inundated by rising sea levels resulting from global warming,
according to the MOFA.</P>

      <P>Former Vice President Annette Lu said Friday the online version of the Formosa
Post, or Yushan Wubao in Mandarin, is scheduled to be launched July 1, with the
print version being inaugurated Oct. 25.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks after meeting with Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu on the eve of
the latter's departure for a visit to the United States.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, she plans to raise NT$300 million in the coming two months to
finance the Formosa Post project.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the planned paper will reflect core values of local society and
views of grassroots people, Lu said the paper will not only recruit professional
journalists but will also introduce a "citizen reporter" system to facilitate
realization of its goals.</P>
      <P>Lu, who traveled to Washington, D.C., last month to attend U.S. President
Obama's inauguration, said her U.S. trip has solidified her resolve to establish
the Formosa Post, as Taiwan needs a newspaper to unify people who love Taiwan,
so as to normalize, globalize and enrich the country.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the newspaper, which will go on sale at 3 p.m. daily, will
focus on local and international politics, culture, and science and technology.</P>
      <P>Lu also urged Mayor Chen to speak for Taiwan's independent sovereignty during
her U.S. trip to prevent the international community from misunderstanding that
all of Taiwan's people agree with the China policy of Taiwan's incumbent
administration, which she said leans toward China.</P>

    <TEXT>Re CEP Item 0011, the words "'one China' principle" in the first and seventh
paragraphs should read "'one China' policy." A corrected version follows: U.S
supports closer cross-strait ties: U.S official

Washington, Feb. 12 (CNA) The newly appointed U.S deputy secretary of state said
Thursday that the U.S. welcomes closer cross-Taiwan Strait ties and will
continue through Washington's "one China" policy to support both sides' efforts
to overcome their differences through peaceful means.

James. B. Steinberg made the remarks while attending the annual National Council
for Visitors held in Washington, in which U.S. President Barack Obama's foreign
policy was described.

Steinberg served as deputy national security adviser during the second term of
former President Bill Clinton during the late 1990s, and during the 1996 Taiwan
Missile Crisis, he met with Taiwan's National Security Council Secretary-General
Ting Mao-shih, which later became the primary channel of communication between
the two nation's national security agencies.

Asked what he thinks about the current cross-strait situation, Steinberg said
the U.S. will keep a watchful eye on Taiwan-China relations,  as they are one of
the most important issues on Washington's foreign affairs agenda.

Both parties in the United States have a consensus about the U.S. cross-strait
policy, and it has been one of the most successful in terms of U.S. foreign
policy , Steinberg said.

Steinberg said the U.S. has maintained the same cross-strait policy for more
than 30 years, as it has served the best interests of the parties involved and
has helped maintain peace and stability in the area.

U.S. cross-strait policy under the "one-China" policy has greatly contributed to
Taiwan's democracy and cross-strait economic development, and it is very
important for the U.S to maintain its one-China policy in its cross-strait
policy, said Steinberg, describing it as beneficial for all parties and ensuring
the peace and stability of the area.

The interaction between the people, the closer economic ties and the increasing
cultural exchanges between Taiwan and China are remarkable achievements for the
leaders of the two sides, said Steinberg.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Former American official warns against danger of relying on China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13 (CNA)
02/13/09  23:22:18

    <TEXT>
      <P>Describing China's economic growth as "false and hallow, " a former American
official on Friday urged the world, including Taiwan and the U.S., to heed the
danger of relying on the rising giant to ride out the global economic crisis as
China has its own serious domestic problems to tackle.</P>
      <P>Former American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairwoman Therese Shaheen, now
chairman of the U.S. Asia Economic Foundation, stressed the importance of
obtaining a "more authentic view of China" so as to craft correspondingly
correct foreign policies.</P>
      <P>Since politics follows economics, the current global recession, or the "economic
9-11" as she put it, has shifted the policy direction of the Barack Obama
administration to focus more on economic issues.</P>
      <P>Shaheen contended, however,  that Washington's "conventional wisdom" -- that the
U.S. cannot afford to anger China because it is its major banker -- on which the
new emphasis is based, is "flatly untrue."</P>
      <P>Citing the report "Fault Lines in China's Economic Terrain" conducted by the
Rand Corporation on behalf of the U.S. government for a detailed look at China's
development, she said that the world has been mesmerized China's double-digit
economic growth.</P>
      <P>"China's fundamental economy is unstable, " she said, mainly due to its over-
dependence on foreign direct investment (FDI) and exports, and described the
Chinese economy as a "spinning top," with a constant flow of FDI pouring into
the country and an enormous amount of exports flowing out.</P>
      <P>Given China's declining export volume, however, Shaheen said it was "highly
improbable, if not impossible" that China would grow this year at an 8 percent
rate, a level widely considered necessary to uphold Chinese social stability.</P>
      <P>In addition, quoting Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao as saying that China's  economy
is "unstable,  unbalanced,  uncoordinated  and unsustainable" following the
National People's Congress in 2007, Shaheen said that "China has sailed into the
crisis on a boat that its own leadership admits has been heavily burdened and
listing for a long time."</P>
      <P>Expanding on Wen's statement, she said that China was, and still is, confronted
with grave problems in various areas, such as unemployment, the banking sector,
income disparities, the lack of a social safety net, and over-reliance on FDI
and exports.</P>
      <P>Other issues that China has to tackle, she pointed out, include corruption,
energy consumption and prices, water resources and pollution, as well as
HIV/AIDS and other epidemic diseases, which altogether, had resulted in at least
60,000 riots and protests that took place across China during 2007.</P>
      <P>In today's sluggish economic environment, Shaheen contended that there is
further pressure for China to show growth by means of "however growth can be
shown" so as to retain the image of strong economic growth and maintain domestic
social peace.</P>
      <P>Therefore, she concluded that although China is an important economy, it
"matters less than we thought" and "will not play a major role in the solution
(to the current crisis)."</P>
      <P>She said China will progress even more slowly than Taiwan and the U.S. in
today's weak global economy under its growing domestic burdens.</P>
      <P>With this change of perception of China, she said that Washington would have a
shift of attitude toward the Asian giant and lead to adjustments in its China
policy.</P>

      <P>The Taipei District Court rejected an appeal Thursday by former President Chen
Shui-bian that his detention be rescinded, as well as his plea that he be
released on bail.</P>
      <P>Chen is being held in custody at the Tucheng Detention Center in Taipei County,
awaiting trial on charges of embezzlement, bribe- taking, money laundering and
forgery. If found guilty on all the counts, he could face life imprisonment.</P>
      <P>A panel of judges ruled that the ex-president, who served two four-year terms,
still wields considerable influence, although there is no concrete evidence that
he might abscond if he is released,</P>
      <P>The judges expressed the view that the alleged money laundering by the former
first family through dummy accounts was so serious that it cannot be ruled out
that Chen and his family were stashing large sums of money abroad for their
future use.</P>
      <P>They also rejected the argument that Chen is unlikely to slip out of Taiwan
because his activities would be monitored by the bodyguards assigned to protect
him, contending that the bodyguards cannot violate Chen's free will if he
insists that they do not follow him around.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the judges noted, in the initial stage of the investigation, Chen
had instructed his former cashier, Chen Chen-hui and two former Presidential
Office aides to give false testimony regarding the former first family's
embezzlement of the president's state affairs fund and its money laundering
activities.</P>
      <P>Based on these considerations, the court ruled that it is necessary that the
former president be kept in custody.</P>
      <P>Chen was indicted Dec. 12 on corruption charges involving nearly half a billion
Taiwan dollars, becoming the first person to have served as president in
Taiwan's history to be put on trial for criminal offenses.</P>
      <P>He was released Dec. 13 upon his own recognizance after being detained for 32
days as prosecutors prepared four cases against him.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office filed an
appeal Dec. 16 against the court's decision to release Chen but failed.
Undaunted, the prosecutors launched a new bid Dec. 25 to detain Chen a second
time on grounds that he might abscond through "secret channels."</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court ordered the Taipei District Court Dec. 28 to reconsider
its decision to release Chen, and on Dec. 30 the Taipei District Court finally
approved the prosecutors' request to place Chen back in detention.</P>
      <P>The former president and his wife were indicted for embezzling NT$104 million
(US$3.12 million)  from the president's special discretionary fund during his
presidency from 2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They also are accused of taking bribes worth NT$300 million in connection with a
land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million in kickbacks to help a
contractor win the tender for a government construction project.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors recommended that the former president be given the harshest
possible sentence for his alleged illegalities.</P>
      <P>They also demanded severe penalties for his wife, son and daughter-in-law for
their "unrepentant attitude" during the course of the investigation, while
recommending commuted sentences for 10 other defendants because they had been
cooperative and helpful during the probe.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors are still investigating allegations that Chen and his wife
received bribes totaling hundreds of millions of Taiwan dollars from several
banks in exchange for favors granted to them during the former president's
second financial reform program.</P>

    <TEXT>Today is Saturday, Feb. 14, or the 20th day of the first month of the Year of
the Ox according to the lunar calendar. Following is a list of importa events
that have occurred on this date in the past:

1766: Thomas R. Malthus, the British economist who wrote "An Essay on the
Principle of Population," is born. His 1798 work argues that populations tend to
increase faster than food supplies unless the increase is checked by moral
restraints or by war, famine, or disease.

1779: Captain James Cook, the British navigator and explorer who commanded three
major voyages of "discovery," charting and "naming" many islands in the Pacific
Ocean, is killed by a native's spear in Hawaii.

1797: British naval forces under Admiral John Jervis and Captain Horatio Nelson
defeat the Spanish fleet off Portugal's Cape St. Vincent.

1859: Oregon becomes the 33rd state of the United States.

1893: Hawaii is annexed to the United States by a treaty.

1933: The League of Nations refuses to recognize the Japanese puppet regime
known as "Manchukuo." To deflect world condemnation of their hegemony, the
Japanese invaders of northern China installed the Manchukuo regime in 1932. This
"land of the Manchu" proved to be no more than another stepping stone for the
extension of Japanese aggression.

in Taipei to assume his post.

1974: A six-member Jordanian trade mission led by S.A. Matouk, president of the

      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yeh Ching-chuan promised Friday to come up
with substantive measures to help the public cope with psychological problems
amid the current economic crisis.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks after he met with the representatives of 26 mental health
groups, led by Hsieh Meng-hsiung, chairman of the John Tung Foundation.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that he would assign people to deal with the pressing problems.</P>
      <P>"I will also submit two major projects on suicide prevention and drug prevention
to the Executive Yuan," Yeh added.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the government and the private sector could work
together to tide over the difficulties.</P>
      <P>The representatives said that with the current economic slump, the government
has attempted a quick fix by offering material assistance, but has largely
ignored "psychological problems."</P>
      <P>They said that since the second half of last year, the number of people seeking
counseling with the Teacher Chang Foundation has surged by 20 percent.</P>
      <P>The number of outpatients seeking mental health and psychological counseling has
also increased, they added.</P>
      <P>Hsieh and the others signed a petition that urged Yeh to integrate the resources
of the government and the private sector, avoid the waste of resources and
upgrade the quality of mental health services.</P>
      <P>According to an online survey published by the John Tung Foundation in early
December, the number of suicides in Taiwan has risen in the wake of the economic
crisis triggered by the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers in September

    <HEADLINE>Court rejects former president's appeal against detention</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13 (CNA)
02/14/09  14:59:36

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court rejected an appeal Thursday by former President Chen
Shui-bian that his detention be rescinded, as well as his plea that he be
released on bail.</P>
      <P>Chen is being held in custody at the Tucheng Detention Center in Taipei County,
awaiting trial on charges of embezzlement, bribe- taking, money laundering and
forgery. If found guilty on all the counts, he could face life imprisonment.</P>
      <P>A panel of judges ruled that the ex-president, who served two four-year terms,
still wields considerable influence, although there is no concrete evidence that
he might abscond if he is released,</P>
      <P>The judges expressed the view that the alleged money laundering by the former
first family through dummy accounts was so serious that it cannot be ruled out
that Chen and his family were stashing large sums of money abroad for their
future use.</P>
      <P>They also rejected the argument that Chen is unlikely to slip out of Taiwan
because his activities would be monitored by the bodyguards assigned to protect
him, contending that the bodyguards cannot violate Chen's free will if he
insists that they do not follow him around.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the judges noted, in the initial stage of the investigation, Chen
had instructed his former cashier, Chen Chen-hui and two former Presidential
Office aides to give false testimony regarding the former first family's
embezzlement of the president's state affairs fund and its money laundering
activities.</P>
      <P>Based on these considerations, the court ruled that it is necessary that the
former president be kept in custody.</P>
      <P>Chen was indicted Dec. 12 on corruption charges involving nearly half a billion
Taiwan dollars, becoming the first person to have served as president in
Taiwan's history to be put on trial for criminal offenses.</P>
      <P>He was released Dec. 13 upon his own recognizance after being detained for 32
days as prosecutors prepared four cases against him.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office filed an
appeal Dec. 16 against the court's decision to release Chen but failed.
Undaunted, the prosecutors launched a new bid Dec. 25 to detain Chen a second
time on grounds that he might abscond through "secret channels."</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court ordered the Taipei District Court Dec. 28 to reconsider
its decision to release Chen, and on Dec. 30 the Taipei District Court finally
approved the prosecutors' request to place Chen back in detention.</P>
      <P>The former president and his wife were indicted for embezzling NT$104 million
(US$3.12 million)  from the president's special discretionary fund during his
presidency from 2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They also are accused of taking bribes worth NT$300 million in connection with a
land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million in kickbacks to help a
contractor win the tender for a government construction project.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors recommended that the former president be given the harshest
possible sentence for his alleged illegalities.</P>
      <P>They also demanded severe penalties for his wife, son and daughter-in-law for
their "unrepentant attitude" during the course of the investigation, while
recommending commuted sentences for 10 other defendants because they had been
cooperative and helpful during the probe.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors are still investigating allegations that Chen and his wife
received bribes totaling hundreds of millions of Taiwan dollars from several
banks in exchange for favors granted to them during the former president's
second financial reform program.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Former American official warns against danger of relying on China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13 (CNA)
02/14/09  15:00:45

    <TEXT>
      <P>Describing China's economic growth as "false and hallow, " a former American
official on Friday urged the world, including Taiwan and the U.S., to heed the
danger of relying on the rising giant to ride out the global economic crisis as
China has its own serious domestic problems to tackle.</P>
      <P>Former American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairwoman Therese Shaheen, now
chairman of the U.S. Asia Economic Foundation, stressed the importance of
obtaining a "more authentic view of China" so as to craft correspondingly
correct foreign policies.</P>
      <P>Since politics follows economics, the current global recession, or the "economic
9-11" as she put it, has shifted the policy direction of the Barack Obama
administration to focus more on economic issues.</P>
      <P>Shaheen contended, however,  that Washington's "conventional wisdom" -- that the
U.S. cannot afford to anger China because it is its major banker -- on which the
new emphasis is based, is "flatly untrue."</P>
      <P>Citing the report "Fault Lines in China's Economic Terrain" conducted by the
Rand Corporation on behalf of the U.S. government for a detailed look at China's
development, she said that the world has been mesmerized China's double-digit
economic growth.</P>
      <P>"China's fundamental economy is unstable, " she said, mainly due to its over-
dependence on foreign direct investment (FDI) and exports, and described the
Chinese economy as a "spinning top," with a constant flow of FDI pouring into
the country and an enormous amount of exports flowing out.</P>
      <P>Given China's declining export volume, however, Shaheen said it was "highly
improbable, if not impossible" that China would grow this year at an 8 percent
rate, a level widely considered necessary to uphold Chinese social stability.</P>
      <P>In addition, quoting Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao as saying that China's  economy
is "unstable,  unbalanced,  uncoordinated  and unsustainable" following the
National People's Congress in 2007, Shaheen said that "China has sailed into the
crisis on a boat that its own leadership admits has been heavily burdened and
listing for a long time."</P>
      <P>Expanding on Wen's statement, she said that China was, and still is, confronted
with grave problems in various areas, such as unemployment, the banking sector,
income disparities, the lack of a social safety net, and over-reliance on FDI
and exports.</P>
      <P>Other issues that China has to tackle, she pointed out, include corruption,
energy consumption and prices, water resources and pollution, as well as
HIV/AIDS and other epidemic diseases, which altogether, had resulted in at least
60,000 riots and protests that took place across China during 2007.</P>
      <P>In today's sluggish economic environment, Shaheen contended that there is
further pressure for China to show growth by means of "however growth can be
shown" so as to retain the image of strong economic growth and maintain domestic
social peace.</P>
      <P>Therefore, she concluded that although China is an important economy, it
"matters less than we thought" and "will not play a major role in the solution
(to the current crisis)."</P>
      <P>She said China will progress even more slowly than Taiwan and the U.S. in
today's weak global economy under its growing domestic burdens.</P>
      <P>With this change of perception of China, she said that Washington would have a
shift of attitude toward the Asian giant and lead to adjustments in its China
policy.</P>

rate of growth of Taiwan's overall population.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's indigenous people were also younger on average than other groups,

      <P>Former Vice President Annette Lu said Friday the online version of the Formosa
Post, or Yushan Wubao in Mandarin, is scheduled to be launched July 1, with the
print version being inaugurated Oct. 25.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks after meeting with Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu on the eve of
the latter's departure for a visit to the United States.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, she plans to raise NT$300 million in the coming two months to
finance the Formosa Post project.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the planned paper will reflect core values of local society and
views of grassroots people, Lu said the paper will not only recruit professional
journalists but will also introduce a "citizen reporter" system to facilitate
realization of its goals.</P>
      <P>Lu, who traveled to Washington, D.C., last month to attend U.S. President
Obama's inauguration, said her U.S. trip has solidified her resolve to establish
the Formosa Post, as Taiwan needs a newspaper to unify people who love Taiwan,
so as to normalize, globalize and enrich the country.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the newspaper, which will go on sale at 3 p.m. daily, will
focus on local and international politics, culture, and science and technology.</P>
      <P>Lu also urged Mayor Chen to speak for Taiwan's independent sovereignty during
her U.S. trip to prevent the international community from misunderstanding that
all of Taiwan's people agree with the China policy of Taiwan's incumbent
administration, which she said leans toward China.</P>
      <P>Both Lu and Chen are veteran members of the opposition pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party.</P>

      <P>The government should not sign a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement
(CECA)  with China without the social consensus of the Taiwanese people,
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Tsai was responding to a newspaper report that quoted National Security Council
Secretary-General Su Chi as having said that the government has come to a
decision to sign a CECA with China in the future and that negotiations with
China on the issue will begin through the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the government should be "more prudent" about the issue as it
would affect the country's economy and politics.</P>
      <P>In addition, Tsai urged the government to inform and convince the public about
the purpose of a CECA with China.</P>
      <P>If the government signs a CECA without the consensus of the people, it will
cause a negative impact on society, Tsai predicted.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the signing of the CECA will involve delicate political
issues that will cause a serious social conflict in Taiwan, if the government
does not seek the approval of the people.</P>
      <P>The discussion and evaluation of the feasibility of the signing of the CECA
should be conducted in a transparent manner, said Tsai, arguing that this is the
"only way" to let the Taiwanese people understand how the agreement will affect
Taiwan economically, socially and politically.</P>
      <P>Industry  and business  groups have been pushing for the government to forge
closer economic links with China by signing a CECA and to move quickly to
liberalize cross-Taiwan Strait trade through actions such as the removal of

      <P>Japan is expected to launch a working holiday program with Taiwan this summer to
strengthen exchanges between young people of the two countries, according to the
leader of apro-Taiwan Japanese parliamentary group that is promoting the
program.</P>
      <P>Takeo Hiranuma,  head of the Japan-ROC Dietmen's  Council, mentioned the
possibility Thursday during a forum with a Taiwanese journalist delegation that
is visiting Japan.</P>
      <P>In addition to the working-holiday program, the council is also promoting within
the Japanese government a proposal by Taiwan to open an office in the Hokkaido
city of Sapporo, Hiranuma said.</P>
      <P>Takao Fujii, another senior member of the council, told CNA that the working
holiday program is aimed at allowing young people to work on a short-term basis
while traveling in a foreign country and that Japan currently  maintains
working holiday programs with nine countries.</P>
      <P>According  to an official  of the Tokyo-based  Interchange Association -- a
quasi-official organization authorized to handle exchanges with Taiwan in the
absence of diplomatic ties -- like the working holiday programs with other
countries, the one with Taiwan will target travelers aged under 35.</P>
      <P>The details of the agreement will be hammered out through discussions with
Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>Hiranuma said his group has been working closely with Taiwan to try to solve
various issues between the two sides.</P>
      <P>For example, thanks to the council's efforts, the Japanese government granted
visa-free entry to Japan by Taiwanese citizens in 2007, and the sides also
recognized each other's driver's licenses that same year, Hiranuma said.</P>
      <P>In the future, the council will also promote legislation to make possible an
exhibition in Japan of artifacts from Taiwan's National Palace Museum, he said.</P>

      <P>Services for wiring money from China to Taiwan and vice versa through post
offices will begin Feb. 18 now that the complicated operating system has been
set up, Taiwan's state-run Chunghua Post Co. announced Saturday.</P>
      <P>It will mark the beginning of two-way remittance services across the Taiwan
Strait, further promoting the cross-strait exchanges that had been blocked in
many ways until President Ma Ying-jeou, who advocates closer Taiwan-China
relations, was inaugurated last May.</P>
      <P>The two sides launched direct postal links last Dec. 15 following an agreement
signed last November by Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and
his Chinese counterpart, Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
President Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>The remittance services, however, could not be available at that time due to
technical problems.</P>
      <P>Chunghua Post began allowing people in Taiwan to wire money to China in 1991.
Currently, there are 91 post offices around Taiwan offering the service, with
the transfers in NT dollars exchanged into the Chinese yuan through Citibank
before being wired to designated banks in China.</P>
      <P>On average, NT$1.46 billion (US$42.9 million) is transferred to China from
Taiwan through Chunghua Post every year</P>
      <P>Once the direct post office-to-post office services are launched, the remittance
procedure will be much shorter, although Citibank will continue to provide the
currency exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Post Deputy General Manager Huang Shu-chien stated that the exchanges
will be conducted in US dollars and that the value of each transfer from Taiwan
to China will be limited to US$30,000 or less.</P>
      <P>Huang said that despite remittances already being frequent between banks on the
two sides, the new service will still be a convenient choice as there are over
37,000 post offices in China.</P>
      <P>"Even though not all of them will offer the service, the number of places where
individuals or enterprises can wire money to Taiwan will be increased," Huang
noted.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will carefully monitor an upcoming visit to Asia by new U.S. Secretary of
State Hillary Rodham Clinton and expects her to pay attention to cross-Taiwan
Strait relations while in China, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA spokesman Henry Chen, the fact that Clinton has made Asia the
destination of her first overseas trip demonstrates the importance that the
United States attaches to the region.</P>
      <P>The government  hopes  the visit  will  lead to favorable interactions with
Asian nations and help bring issues concerning regional peace and stability into
the spotlight, he added.</P>
      <P>Clinton is scheduled to depart Sunday for her visit, which will take her to
Japan, Indonesia, South Korea and China.</P>
      <P>During a speech Friday delivered to the Asia Society in New York, Clinton said
she is ready to deliver to Asia "a message about America's desire for more
rigorous and persistent commitment and engagement, " with issues to be addressed
covering the economic crisis, climate change, clean energy and the non-
proliferation of nuclear weapons.</P>
      <P>On relations with China,  Clinton said that maintaining a positive, cooperative
relationship with Beijing is vital to peace and prosperity in the region and the
rest of the world.</P>
      <P>She noted that China has asserted itself in positive ways as chair  of the Six-
Party  talks  and in its participation  in international peacekeeping efforts,
and will also resume mid-level military-to-military discussions with the United
States later this month.</P>
      <P>"And we look forward to further improved relations across the Taiwan Strait,"
she added.</P>
      <P>Beijing  suspended  military-to-military   exchanges  and nonproliferation talks
with Washington late last year to protest against the latest arms sales to
Taiwan by the administration of then-U.S. President George W. Bush.</P>
      <P>The United States, which is committed under the terms of the Taiwan Relations
Act (TRA) to help Taiwan maintain a sufficient defense capability, has long been
Taiwan's most important weapons supplier.</P>
      <P>Asked during a background briefing Friday in Washington, D.C. if the new
administration of President Barack Obama will suspend arms sales to Taiwan, a
senior U.S. State Department official said this will not happen because the
policy "has been consistent with the TRA and the communiques (with China)."</P>
      <P>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there will not be any
major change to U.S. policy toward Taiwan, as it has been very successful and
has helped maintain peace in the region.</P>
      <P>The official's remarks came one day after Dennis Blair, the new director of
national intelligence, reaffirmed Washington's commitment to help Taiwan
maintain a military balance with China, which has been continuing its military
modernization.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan should not be so defenseless that it feels that it has to do everything
that China says. On the other hand, China cannot be so overwhelming that it can
bully Taiwan, " Blair said during a hearing held by the Senate Committee on
Intelligence.</P>

      <P>More than 2,000 people took part in a major tree-planting activity in Nantou
County, central Taiwan Saturday in a bid to show their love and care for the
land.</P>
      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Vice Chairman Hu Hsing-hua, speaking at the
activity that was sponsored by the council and the Nantou county government,
noted that "green forestation" is part of the government's ambitious "i-Taiwan
12 projects" program and is a move designed to protect the environment.</P>
      <P>"The government expects 400 communities around the island to take part in the
tree planting campaign that will continue throughout the year," Hu said.</P>
      <P>The government is planning to plant forest on 60,000 hectares of lowlands within
eight years and to establish three 1,000-hectare forest recreation areas, he
added.</P>
      <P>He urged the public to take part in the campaign to get everyone to plant at
least one tree in their lifetime to help create a green homeland.</P>
      <P>"By pooling our strength, we can soon realize the dream of a green Taiwan," he
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Forestry Bureau under the COA said it will organize more than 20
tree sapling donation activities around the nation as part of the campaign.</P>

(FTA)  and a Comprehensive  Economic Cooperation  Arrangement  (CECP)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Topics to be discussed in a planned third meeting between the heads of the two
intermediary bodies on either side of the Taiwan Strait have been set, and do
not include the issue of a proposed Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement
(CECA) between the two sides, a spokesman for the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun made the announcement Saturday after  a local
newspaper  quoted  National  Security  Council Secretary-General Su Chi as
saying that the government has decided to sign a CECA with China at some point
in the future.</P>
      <P>Su also said that negotiations with China on the issue will begin through the
intermediary Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Liu told CNA that forging a CECA with China was part of the election campaign
platform of President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Carrying out the policy is a goal that every government agency should seek to
achieve, he said, describing CECA as a vital matter for the normalization of
trade and economic ties between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>However, an agreement of this kind covers a wide range of different  subjects,
so that the content and even its final designation require discussions among
relevant agencies before it can be brought up in SEF-ARATS talks, Liu said.</P>
      <P>He further said the issues on the agenda of the third round of talks between SEF
Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen Yunlin slated for later this
year have been firmed up and include joint efforts by the two sides to crack
down on crime, regular air and boat services, financial cooperation and the
opening of Taiwan to funds from China.</P>
      <P>Whether or not to have the CECA issue discussed in a further round of
negotiations in the latter half of the year will depend on the results of the
upcoming third-round talks, Liu added.</P>
      <P>The CECA would allow the two sides to offer each other economic and trade
privileges, including the lifting of tariffs on imports and non-tariff trade
barriers, or to further hold existing tariff and trade policies.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, who broached the idea during his election campaign, CECA is a
third choice along with a free trade agreement like the one China signed with
Hong Kong in 2003. A CECA, the government believes, would avoid the sticky
"state-to-state" dispute and would also ensure that Taiwan's sovereignty was not
cast into doubt.</P>

      <P>The pandas at the Taipei Zoo -- Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan -- were released into
their outdoor exhibition area Saturday, their first chance to enjoy the fresh
air since they were brought to Taiwan last Dec. 23 after being given by Beijing
in a goodwill gesture.</P>
      <P>The female panda, Yuan Yuan, appeared slightly shocked by the voices of
visitors, zoo spokesman Chin Shi-chien said, pointing out that until that day,
they had been kept in a soundproof indoor enclosure since the panda hall was
opened to the public Jan. 26.</P>
      <P>The panda was not used to its new noisier environment, he noted, adding that in
future, the zoo will broadcast recordings of the zoo visitors in the indoor area
to allow the pandas to adapt to the noises, he added.</P>
      <P>As the outdoor temperature was around 20 Celsius degrees -- the ideal climate
for pandas -- the zoo decided to let them out into the outdoor area that has
been constructed to resemble the animals' natural habitat.</P>
      <P>According to the zoo, the pair ran back and forth in the outdoor area, appearing
excited with their new living space.</P>
      <P>More than 330,000 people have visited the pandas since they went on display for

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei-based National Palace Museum (NPM) Director Chou Kung-shin emphasized the
requirement for equal standing in engagements across the Taiwan Strait Saturday
as she arrived in Beijing to promote bilateral cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chou's visit marks the first formal engagement between the staff of the NPM and
its Chinese counterpart, the Palace Museum in Beijing, since Taiwan and China
split in a civil war 60 years ago.</P>
      <P>As the first NPM head to visit China in six decades, Chou was circumspect
toward potentially  sensitive issues regarding the museum's designation and her
capacity in engagements with China.</P>
      <P>In a brief encounter with reporters at her Beijing hotel, Chou characterized the
engagements as "museum to museum" -- seen as a veiled emphasis on parity in
exchanges between the NPM and the Palace Museum, both of which hold part of the
imperial art collection of China.</P>
      <P>Chou also said she is hopeful that her visit will contribute to the
establishment of a mechanism for wide-ranging cooperation between the two
museums.</P>
      <P>"People on both sides of the Taiwan Strait will definitely benefit greatly from
cooperation between our two museums, " she told reporters.</P>
      <P>Chou was greeted by Zheng Xinmiao, curator of Beijing's Palace Museum, who
presided over a welcoming ceremony in a VIP room at Beijing Capital
International Airport for Chou and her entourage.</P>
      <P>In contrast to Taiwan's passionate attention to Chou's visit, Beijing kept a low
profile toward the event, backpedaling on its previous promise to allow
journalists to cover the airport welcoming ceremony for Chou and her group.</P>
      <P>A news conference scheduled to take place Sunday after a meeting between staff
members of the two museums was also canceled.</P>
      <P>Asked about his views on the cancellation, Su Ching-feng, director of the NPM's
public affairs office who is accompanying Chou on the visit, said only that the
delegation respects its host's arrangement.</P>
      <P>The delegation was scheduled to tour the Palace Museum in Beijing Sunday and to
holds talks with Chinese museum curators later in the day on future cooperation
projects.</P>
      <P>High on the agenda will be the possibility of Beijing lending 29 Qing dynasty
artworks for a three-month exhibition that will open at the NPM in Taipei in
October.</P>
      <P>Should that happen, it will mark the first time that the imperial Chinese art
collection, is partially exhibited together again after having been divided for
60 years by war and political turbulence.</P>
      <P>The talks will also cover cooperation in art conservation, publications and
promotions.</P>
      <P>Taipei's National Palace Museum is home to the cream of the 1,000-year Chinese
art collection, while the Palace Museum in Beijing holds most of the rest of the
collection.</P>

      <P>Taipei Songshan Airport, which now mainly host domestic and cross-Taiwan Strait
flights, may begin hosting Japan-bound flights from next year, civil aviation
officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, opening flight services between Songshan Airport in
downtown Taipei and Haneda Airport in downtown Tokyo will be high on the agenda
of a new round of Taiwan-Japan consultations on amending their bilateral
aviation agreement that are set to take place in Tokyo next week.</P>
      <P>Although the two sides have tentatively agreed to the opening of Songshan-Haneda
flight services, the officials said the actual launch of such services will not
begin until next year when a new runway construction project at Haneda Airport
is completed.</P>
      <P>In consideration of the two airports' limited capacity, the officials said each
airline from both sides will be allowed to operate only one round-trip flight
per day.</P>
      <P>Other issues to be discussed at the upcoming aviation talks will include the
possibility of raising the number of flights to Japan's Narita International
Airport, the officials said.</P>
      <P>On the Songshan Airport's expansion project, the officials said the airport's
first terminal will be transformed into a facility hosting flights to
neighboring countries in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>But as the Taipei city government has listed the facade of the 40-year-old
Songshan Airport as a historical structure, the officials said the Civil
Aeronautics Administration is still mulling how to avoid damaging the historical
structure while carrying out the expansion project.</P>

alone.</P>
      <P>Mocking his involvement in illicit narcotics during the "dark days, " Su said
during a visit to a drug abuse treatment center that he could have been awarded
a master's degree in drug abuse. Yet, he preaches that the scourge in one's
heart is even harder to get rid of than kicking the habit. "If you think you
can't do it, you won't."</P>
      <P>Encouraging other addicts to believe that they can do it, he also exhorted them
to accept help from others. "You must accept others' help, because you can't do
it alone," he said.</P>
      <P>Su recalled that he spent much of his childhood in a state of fear, dread or
high anxiety. After his parents divorced, he lived with his grandmother, who
became his only relative in his formative years.</P>
      <P>He remembered that he was always the troublemaker in the eyes of his teachers in
junior high school, from which he failed to graduate.</P>
      <P>He was in jail for the first time on charges of using and possessing illicit
narcotics at the age of 13. Since then, he split his time between prisons and
hospitals, as he was not only a drug abuser but was also involved in street
violence.</P>
      <P>At the beginning, he said, the drugs could really calm him, make him feel
carefree and forget about who he was and what he should do. Months later, he
became a slave to drugs and could not live without them. A few years later, he
lost both his health and his girlfriend of many years.</P>
      <P>Su said his grandmother, who died a couple of years ago, was his first savior,
adding that despite his leading a life like hell, his grandmother, a devout
Christian, had never forsaken him.</P>
      <P>He said kicking the habit is hard but not impossible. He recalled that his
grandmother tried numerous times to bring him to the Lord for salvation, but in
vain -- until he attended a sermon in Taipei given by an African American
evangelical minister from a church in New York. Toward the end of the service,
he went to the front to receive a prayer said by the minister in a bid to lead
him out of darkness.</P>
      <P>At that juncture, he said, he felt so clean inside and so happy from within that
he was on his knees crying like a baby, and for the first time, he met God and
he knew he was "saved."</P>
      <P>From that day forth, Su cut all his links with the drug world and also stopped
smoking, relying on God to get him through his cold turkey.</P>
      <P>Over the past six years of being clean, Su has worked ceaselessly as a
missionary of God, visiting correction centers to meet inmates, and hospitals to
console patients, as well as working as a volunteer for several organizations
for the disabled.</P>
      <P>Even today,  tears  fill his eyes when he remembers  his grandmother, who he
described as spending hours on the road bringing him heavy sacks of fruit when
he was in prison.</P>
      <P>In a further cruel twist of fate, when Su found the meaning of life by helping
people, as well as getting married, he was diagnosed last October to be in the
late stages of his cancer.</P>
      <P>Can the "angel" make it? If you believe in a god, you can perhaps offer him a
prayer.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced Sunday that effective
immediately,  Slovenia passport holders will no longer require visas to visit
Taiwan for less than 30 days.</P>
      <P>Anne Hung, director-general of MOFA's Department of European Affairs, said the
decision was based on the friendly relations that Slovenia shares with Taiwan
and the fact that the move poses no threat to Taiwan's national security.</P>
      <P>Slovenia will become the seventh Central or Eastern European country to enjoy
visa-free privileges, Hung said, following Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Lithuania,
Estonia and Latvia.</P>
      <P>In total, 27 European Union nations have been granted visa-free privileges, with
Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus being considered for the same treatment, Hung said.</P>
      <P>She expressed hope that the extensive inclusion of Europe's Schengen states in
Taiwan's visa exemption policy, as well as a government move to issue
"ePassports," or chip-embedded passports, will give Taiwan more leverage in
negotiating for reciprocal treatment with the European Union (EU).</P>
      <P>Taiwan's low visa refusal rate recorded in the EU, at less than 1 percent, will

      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu pledged Sunday to open a penguin house, the largest in
Taiwan, late this year or early next year.</P>
      <P>Construction of the penguin house, located within the city's traditional fish
market -- which is awaiting refurbishment -- is slated to be completed in
October at the earliest or early next year, Hu said.</P>
      <P>The mayor made the remarks while answering questions from reporters at a ground-
breaking ceremony for the city's tourism "fisherman's wharf," to be located
adjacent to the fish market.</P>
      <P>The Taichung city government hopes both the penguin hall the artificial wharf
will become the central Taiwan city's major tourist attractions.</P>
      <P>Once the penguin hall is completed, it will host a variety of exhibitions,
specimens and research information related to the bird, Hu said.</P>
      <P>The Taichung city is planning to lease popular king penguins from the Taipei
city zoo, he went on. "Taichung's penguin house will definitely be opened before
the next Lunar New Year," he added.</P>
      <P>Within three years, the city's penguin house is projected to purchase five or
six species of penguin, he said.</P>
      <P>He also elaborated on Taichung City's decision to construct a penguin house
rather than an originally planned marine life education hall, explaining that
the change of mind was made on the grounds that Pingtung County in southern
Taiwan already has a marine life education facility.</P>

      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu presided Sunday over a ground-breaking ceremony for a
tourism fisherman's wharf to be located next to the city's traditional fish
market, in an effort to build a new landmark for the central Taiwan city's
tourism promotion drive.</P>
      <P>In addition to a penguin hall that will be built within the traditional fish
market, Hu said, an artificial fisherman's wharf will be constructed on a plot
of 5,000 pings (1 ping equals to 3.305 square meters) next to the traditional
fish market, with a budget of NT$100 billion (US$2.94 billion) earmarked for the
project.</P>
      <P>Hu expressed hope that the two projects will help forge a new image and new
tourist spots for Taichung City upon their completion, slated for October or
November next year.</P>
      <P>The city government will also hold a contest to select a name for the wharf, in

      <P>According to fish market corp. chairman Lee Jen-teh, a retail center for fish

fisherman's wharf. A ship-shaped building and a square with ponds will also be
constructed.</P>
      <P>Taichung City has a population of more than 1 million and has long been
considered by many people as the most livable city in Taiwan due to its mild

    <HEADLINE>TAITRA order-soliciting plan begins to bear fruit</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A plan for an export-boosting project that was initiated by the administration
late last year has already begun to bear fruit, the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>With the efforts of the Purchases and Sample Exhibitions Plan -- sponsored by
the semi-official TAITRA to solicit export orders for Taiwanese exporters and
manufacturers -- at least four major buyers from around the world have placed
orders or have engaged in serious talks with local exporters, TAITRA Secretary-
General Chao Yung-chuan said.</P>
      <P>The plan is part of a three-year, NT$8.53 billion (US$250.94 million) project
called the New Zheng He Project launched by the Ministry of Economic Affairs
late last year aimed at turning Taiwan's export trade from negative to positive
growth this year.</P>
      <P>Wolseley UK, the world's No. 1 distributor of heating and plumbing products and
a leading supplier of building products to the professional market, has recently
placed orders worth US$8 million with Taiwanese suppliers for nuts and bolts as
well as other related products, including bathroom fittings and lighting
components, according to Chao.</P>
      <P>"Wolseley is expected to place new orders worth some US$10 million with Taiwan
shortly," Chao noted.</P>
      <P>Wolseley, whose global procurement topped US$27.5 billion in 2007, is expected
to make purchases in Taiwan this year to the tune of US$40 million.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Chao said, two procurement representatives from Poland's TIM S.A.
are scheduled to visit Taiwan Feb. 17-19 for talks on procurement of electronics
and electrical engineering products.</P>
      <P>Nearly 100 local companies have signed up to take part in the talks.</P>
      <P>TIM S.A.'s annual business turnover has averaged US$200 million over the past
several years and the company has a staff of more than 400.</P>
      <P>It will be the first time has TIM S.A. has approached Taiwan for supplies, Chao
went on, adding that deals with the company will serve as a litmus test for
Taiwan's potential in cracking the vast Eastern European market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Specialty Bolt, the largest nuts and bolts dealer in the New England
region of the United States, is scheduled to host a sample display workshop at
TAITRA's office in the southern port city of Kaohsiung Feb. 17.</P>
      <P>So far, over 50 companies in the area have registered to take part in the
workshop, said Wu Chun-ze, head of the TAITRA Kaohsiung Office.</P>
      <P>Specialty Bolt, an important supplier of hardware products to OEM plants in the
United States, Canada and Mexico, purchases about US$18 million-worth of
products from around the world every year.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA officials, representatives of Mexico's Grupo Tutsa, a
leading nuts and bolts dealer, have been visiting central and southern Taiwan
since Feb. 9 for procurement talks with local suppliers.</P>
      <P>Wu said that since their visit began, the representatives have canceled a plan
to visit Hangzhou in China.</P>
      <P>Under the New Zheng He Project -- named after a Ming Dynasty Chinese explorer --
the administration  will assist Taiwanese suppliers and manufacturers to produce
more goods for export, with the country's entire export trade hopefully topping
NT$500 billion in 2009, thus turning around the poor performance in the export
sector due to the global economic recession.</P>
      <P>The ambitious  export-bolstering  project  will also direct Taiwanese exporters
and manufacturers to emerging markets beyond China, including India, Russia,
Brazil, the Middle East and countries in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Zheng He was an official who lived during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) . He led
a giant fleet of Chinese vessels to Southeast Asia, from where they are believed
to have reached as far as the west coast of Africa. He was instrumental in
building China into one of the maritime superpowers between the 14th and 17th
centuries.</P>

      <P>A non-government Taiwanese medical team that provided free medical services to
some 5,000 people during a just concluded two-week mission to Kenya returned to
Taiwan Friday.</P>
      <P>The team, composed of 27 medical personnel from various medical centers, as well
as volunteers, was organized by the Taiwan Root Medical Peace Corps (TRMPC), a
private non-profit organization dedicated to improving the quality of life
through the provision of medical services at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>The team arrived in Kenya late January, when the African country was plagued by
massive food shortages due to a prolonged drought, according to TRMPC President
Liu Chi-chun.</P>
      <P>The team held 10 free clinics in several towns near Lake Victoria, where there
are large numbers of AIDS patients, orphans and starving people, according to
Liu.</P>
      <P>Liu recalled that when an overturned gasoline tanker exploded in the town of
Molo Feb. 1, leaving 113 dead and about 200 injured, his team, despite being
nearby, was unable to provide aid as it was unaware of the accident.</P>
      <P>The TRMPC has rich experience in extending emergency medical relief, such as
providing post-war aid in Kosovo, providing medical treatment for victims of the
South Asia tsunami and the Indonesia earthquake, Liu said, adding that if the
team had learned about the explosion, it could have provided humanitarian
relief.</P>
      <P>Since February 2000, the TRMPC has arranged medical missions every year to
African countries during the Chinese New Year holiday. It has provided services
in Swaziland, Malawi, Ghana, Senegal, Gambia, Liberia and Somalia.</P>

      <P>A government housing subsidy program to help young couples renting property or

      <P>Under the program, the government will provide 10,000 openings for a NT$2
million (US$58,823) government-subsidized home loan that will be interest-free

      <P>Lawyers defending former President Chen Shui-bian and his wife in a series of
corruption cases complained Sunday that while going through the recorded
depositions  of witnesses, they found a 30-minute section on one of the discs
that had no sound.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-lung, one of Chen's lawyers, expressed suspicion that the Special
Investigation  Division  (SID)  under the Supreme Prosecutors  Office might have
tampered with the recording to eradicate testimony favorable to the former
president.</P>
      <P>However, SID Director Chen Yun-nan said the prosecutors in his division would
never mute a deposition on purpose and that the problem could be due to
malfunctioning of the video recording equipment.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-nan said he had not examined the disc in question and suspected that
the soundless part could simply be an intermission videotaped by a camcorder
left running after the deposition was temporarily halted.</P>
      <P>He added that his division will look into the matter and establish the cause of
the problem. As for whether the disc could be considered effective evidence, he
pointed out that that is up to the court to decide.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Yun-nan, in addition to the recording on disc, the deposition
was also transcribed to ensure the accuracy of the testimony. Furthermore, the
lawyers of the former president can always cross-examine the witness in question
-- Taiwan Cement Corp. Chairman Koo Cheng-yun, who was found by the prosecutors
to have transferred NT$300 million (US$8.81 million) in 2003 as bribes to the
former president and his wife for a land procurement deal in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecutors, the former president used his position to push for
the government's purchase of the land for the construction of a science park
after his wife Wu Shu-jen allegedly accepted bribes through the landowner.</P>
      <P>The land procurement scandal is one of a series of criminal cases involving the
former president and his family. The charges against them in the other cases
include embezzlement, money laundering and forgery.</P>
      <P>The former president and his wife have been indicted for embezzling NT$104
million (US$3.12 million) from the president's special discretionary fund during
his presidency from 2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also accused of taking NT$90.93 million in kickbacks to help a
contractor win the tender for a government construction project.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian is being held in custody at a Taipei County detention center. He
is Taiwan's first former president to face trial on criminal offenses and if
convicted, could face a life sentence.</P>

New Seven Wonders, a non-profit Swiss foundation, agency officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kaohsiung harbor working to strengthen competitiveness</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau is accelerating the implementation of several
construction and dredging programs at the southern harbor to enhance its
competitiveness, a bureau official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Reeling from the effects of the global economic downturn, the harbor handled
9.67 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) last year, a drop of 5 percent
from the previous year. The harbor is designed to handle 10 million TEUs per
year, according to the official.</P>
      <P>The harbor lost its place as one of the world's 10 busiest container ports due
to the fall in container volume last year, the official went on, attributing
this to stiff competition from other major ports in Pacific Asia, an exodus of
local enterprises, China's magnetic effect and the development of China's harbor
shipping industry, as well as soaring oil prices last year and lower shipping
demand due to the global crisis.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to counter these setbacks, the bureau will speed up the pace of
several construction projects, including the first-phase construction  of an
intercontinental  container center and the establishment of four new deep-water
wharves slated to be completed in 2013.</P>
      <P>After completion, the new wharves will be able to accommodate large container
ships capable of carrying 10,000 TEUs and will increase the harbor's cargo-
handling capacity by 2 million TEUs per year, according to the official.</P>
      <P>The bureau will also speed up work on two dredging programs at the harbor's
first and second seaway areas designed to widen the two navigation channels to
14-15 meters, allowing them to accommodate larger vessels, the official said.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials will visit foreign shipping companies  to increase their
understanding of the environmental advantages of the harbor and to seek business
opportunities. The bureau also plans to set up a cooperation system to attract
private companies to take on the construction projects, and to relax regulations
on leasing the harbor's facilities, the official added.</P>

      <P>"Fan" tours designed for overseas followers of Taiwanese pop stars have worked
their way to becoming a strong tourist draw, increasing the number of visitors
to Taiwan from Japan and Korea despite the economic slowdown, a government
agency reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>The tourism industry worldwide has been battered by last year's soaring oil
prices and the global sluggish economy, but Taiwan still managed to receive over
1.08 million visitors from Japan over the past year, according to the Tourism
Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>The figure was a drop of 6.83 percent from the year-earlier level, and the
bureau described attracting 1.08 million as "not an easy task" as the overall
number of Japanese outbound travelers saw a decline of 7.6 percent compared to
the previous year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of Korean visitors to Taiwan totaled approximately
253,000, an increase of 11.71 percent year-on-year in spite of the buffeting
that country's economy took, while a significant depreciation of its currency
put many Koreans off traveling abroad, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>The bureau attributed these relatively optimistic developments to the success of
tours targeting foreign fans attracted to Taiwanese singers and actors, as part
of the bureau's 2008-2009 "Taiwan Touch Your Heart" campaign to attract
tourists.</P>
      <P>For instance, around 3,500 fans from seven Asian countries who gathered in
Taipei earlier in the day to see the Taiwanese pop group Fahrenheit were
expected to bring in NT$100 million (US$2.93 million) of business during their
stays here, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>The group has been chosen as Taiwan's "tourism ambassador" for Korea and Japan
this year, the bureau added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ashes of Buddhist Master Sheng Yen, founder of Dharma Drum Mountain Monastery in
Jinshan, Taipei County, were buried Sunday in a cemetery near the monastery he
founded.</P>
      <P>His ashes were divided into five bags, and buried in five different holes at the
Jinshan Cemetery as he requested before he died on Feb. 3.</P>
      <P>The cemetery , owned by the Taipei County, was managed by the Dharma Drum
Mountain Monastery.</P>
      <P>The ceremony had drawn more than 30,000 followers of the master as well as
celebrities including President Ma Ying-jeou, Vice President Vincent Siew, and
former Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>The crowd formed a line up to three kilometers along the path leading from the
monastery to the cemetery where the ashes of the dead were buried beside trees
in a rite advocated by Sheng Yen as "plant bury."</P>
      <P>Born in Shanghai, eastern China in 1931, Sheng Yen became a Buddhist monk at 13,
but was conscripted into the Nationalist Army as a soldier and moved to Taiwan
in 1949.</P>
      <P>He left the army and resumed his life as a Buddhist monk in 1959, and eventually
became a famous Buddhist master in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In 1979, Sheng Yen was named the abbot of Nung Chan Monastery in Beitou, Taipei
City and turned it into Taiwan's center of Chan which is a school of Buddhism.</P>
      <P>In order to accommodate his growing followers, he began the construction of a
more spacious monastery in 2000 in Jinshan, and the Dharma Drum Mountain
Monastery was inaugurated in 2005.</P>
      <P>He died in Taipei of kidney failure at the age of 78 after a long illness.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cancer-fighting drug abuser finds hope by helping others</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/15/09  15:43:03</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>Su Kai-nung visits drug detoxification centers regularly to share his experience
in kicking the habit. He frequents hospitals to cheer up cancer patients by
soloing on the saxophone and he serves as a division chief at a foundation
established for the welfare and wellbeing of the physically and mentally
challenged.</P>
      <P>Su -- a "veteran" drug addict suffering from late-stage lung cancer -- works
like a dervish every day, but feels happy, really happy.</P>
      <P>He has been chosen out of some 600 candidates nationwide as one of the six
individuals to be conferred Feb. 21 with the prestigious Chou Ta-Kuan Award of
Hope this year for his courage facing life's challenges and his fervent
compassion and determination to help others.</P>
      <P>Viewing the handsome -- even elegant -- young man playing What a Wonderful World
on sax, one can hardly imagine that the 32-year-old has spent most of his life
in jail, depriving him of a normal education, and that, having nearly burnt
himself out thanks to the scourge of drugs, he faces his deteriorating condition
alone.</P>
      <P>Mocking his involvement in illicit narcotics during the "dark days, " Su said
during a visit to a drug abuse treatment center that he could have been awarded
a master's degree in drug abuse. Yet, he preaches that the scourge in one's
heart is even harder to get rid of than kicking the habit. "If you think you
can't do it, you won't."</P>
      <P>Encouraging other addicts to believe that they can do it, he also exhorted them
to accept help from others. "You must accept others' help, because you can't do
it alone," he said.</P>
      <P>Su recalled that he spent much of his childhood in a state of fear, dread or
high anxiety. After his parents divorced, he lived with his grandmother, who
became his only relative in his formative years.</P>
      <P>He remembered that he was always the troublemaker in the eyes of his teachers in
junior high school, from which he failed to graduate.</P>
      <P>He was in jail for the first time on charges of using and possessing illicit
narcotics at the age of 13. Since then, he split his time between prisons and
hospitals, as he was not only a drug abuser but was also involved in street
violence.</P>
      <P>At the beginning, he said, the drugs could really calm him, make him feel
carefree and forget about who he was and what he should do. Months later, he
became a slave to drugs and could not live without them. A few years later, he
lost both his health and his girlfriend of many years.</P>
      <P>Su said his grandmother, who died a couple of years ago, was his first savior,
adding that despite his leading a life like hell, his grandmother, a devout
Christian, had never forsaken him.</P>
      <P>He said kicking the habit is hard but not impossible. He recalled that his
grandmother tried numerous times to bring him to the Lord for salvation, but in
vain -- until he attended a sermon in Taipei given by an African American
evangelical minister from a church in New York. Toward the end of the service,
he went to the front to receive a prayer said by the minister in a bid to lead
him out of darkness.</P>
      <P>At that juncture, he said, he felt so clean inside and so happy from within that
he was on his knees crying like a baby, and for the first time, he met God and
he knew he was "saved."</P>
      <P>From that day forth, Su cut all his links with the drug world and also stopped
smoking, relying on God to get him through his cold turkey.</P>
      <P>Over the past six years of being clean, Su has worked ceaselessly as a
missionary of God, visiting correction centers to meet inmates, and hospitals to
console patients, as well as working as a volunteer for several organizations
for the disabled.</P>
      <P>Even today,  tears  fill his eyes when he remembers  his grandmother, who he
described as spending hours on the road bringing him heavy sacks of fruit when
he was in prison.</P>
      <P>In a further cruel twist of fate, when Su found the meaning of life by helping
people, as well as getting married, he was diagnosed last October to be in the
late stages of his cancer.</P>
      <P>Can the "angel" make it? If you believe in a god, you can perhaps offer him a
prayer.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced Sunday that effective
immediately,  Slovenia passport holders will no longer require visas to visit
Taiwan for less than 30 days.</P>
      <P>Anne Hung, director-general of MOFA's Department of European Affairs, said the
decision was based on the friendly relations that Slovenia shares with Taiwan
and the fact that the move poses no threat to Taiwan's national security.</P>
      <P>Slovenia will become the seventh Central or Eastern European country to enjoy
visa-free privileges, Hung said, following Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Lithuania,
Estonia and Latvia.</P>
      <P>In total, 27 European Union nations have been granted visa-free privileges, with
Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus being considered for the same treatment, Hung said.</P>
      <P>She expressed hope that the extensive inclusion of Europe's Schengen states in
Taiwan's visa exemption policy, as well as a government move to issue
"ePassports," or chip-embedded passports, will give Taiwan more leverage in
negotiating for reciprocal treatment with the European Union (EU).</P>
      <P>Taiwan's low visa refusal rate recorded in the EU, at less than 1 percent, will
also help back up the government's efforts, she added.</P>

      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu pledged Sunday to open a penguin house, the largest in
Taiwan, late this year or early next year.</P>
      <P>Construction of the penguin house, located within the city's traditional fish
market -- which is awaiting refurbishment -- is slated to be completed in
October at the earliest or early next year, Hu said.</P>
      <P>The mayor made the remarks while answering questions from reporters at a ground-
breaking ceremony for the city's tourism "fisherman's wharf," to be located
adjacent to the fish market.</P>
      <P>The Taichung city government hopes both the penguin hall the artificial wharf
will become the central Taiwan city's major tourist attractions.</P>
      <P>Once the penguin hall is completed, it will host a variety of exhibitions,
specimens and research information related to the bird, Hu said.</P>
      <P>The Taichung city is planning to lease popular king penguins from the Taipei
city zoo, he went on. "Taichung's penguin house will definitely be opened before
the next Lunar New Year," he added.</P>
      <P>Within three years, the city's penguin house is projected to purchase five or
six species of penguin, he said.</P>
      <P>He also elaborated on Taichung City's decision to construct a penguin house
rather than an originally planned marine life education hall, explaining that
the change of mind was made on the grounds that Pingtung County in southern
Taiwan already has a marine life education facility.</P>

      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu presided Sunday over a ground-breaking ceremony for a
tourism fisherman's wharf to be located next to the city's traditional fish
market, in an effort to build a new landmark for the central Taiwan city's
tourism promotion drive.</P>
      <P>In addition to a penguin hall that will be built within the traditional fish
market, Hu said, an artificial fisherman's wharf will be constructed on a plot
of 5,000 pings (1 ping equals to 3.305 square meters) next to the traditional
fish market, with a budget of NT$100 billion (US$2.94 billion) earmarked for the
project.</P>
      <P>Hu expressed hope that the two projects will help forge a new image and new
tourist spots for Taichung City upon their completion, slated for October or
November next year.</P>
      <P>The city government will also hold a contest to select a name for the wharf, in
an effort to increase public awareness of the project.</P>
      <P>According to fish market corp. chairman Lee Jen-teh, a retail center for fish
and farm produce, as well as a restaurant, will be established at the
fisherman's wharf. A ship-shaped building and a square with ponds will also be
constructed.</P>
      <P>Taichung City has a population of more than 1 million and has long been
considered by many people as the most livable city in Taiwan due to its mild
weather, beautiful landscape and convenient traffic network, and the penguin
house and wharf are expected to provide a major tourism boost.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A plan for an export-boosting project that was initiated by the administration
late last year has already begun to bear fruit, the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>With the efforts of the Purchases and Sample Exhibitions Plan -- sponsored by
the semi-official TAITRA to solicit export orders for Taiwanese exporters and
manufacturers -- at least four major buyers from around the world have placed
orders or have engaged in serious talks with local exporters, TAITRA Secretary-
General Chao Yung-chuan said.</P>
      <P>The plan is part of a three-year, NT$8.53 billion (US$250.94 million) project
called the New Zheng He Project launched by the Ministry of Economic Affairs
late last year aimed at turning Taiwan's export trade from negative to positive
growth this year.</P>
      <P>Wolseley UK, the world's No. 1 distributor of heating and plumbing products and
a leading supplier of building products to the professional market, has recently
placed orders worth US$8 million with Taiwanese suppliers for nuts and bolts as
well as other related products, including bathroom fittings and lighting
components, according to Chao.</P>
      <P>"Wolseley is expected to place new orders worth some US$10 million with Taiwan
shortly," Chao noted.</P>
      <P>Wolseley, whose global procurement topped US$27.5 billion in 2007, is expected
to make purchases in Taiwan this year to the tune of US$40 million.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Chao said, two procurement representatives from Poland's TIM S.A.
are scheduled to visit Taiwan Feb. 17-19 for talks on procurement of electronics
and electrical engineering products.</P>
      <P>Nearly 100 local companies have signed up to take part in the talks.</P>
      <P>TIM S.A.'s annual business turnover has averaged US$200 million over the past
several years and the company has a staff of more than 400.</P>
      <P>It will be the first time has TIM S.A. has approached Taiwan for supplies, Chao
went on, adding that deals with the company will serve as a litmus test for
Taiwan's potential in cracking the vast Eastern European market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Specialty Bolt, the largest nuts and bolts dealer in the New England
region of the United States, is scheduled to host a sample display workshop at
TAITRA's office in the southern port city of Kaohsiung Feb. 17.</P>
      <P>So far, over 50 companies in the area have registered to take part in the
workshop, said Wu Chun-ze, head of the TAITRA Kaohsiung Office.</P>
      <P>Specialty Bolt, an important supplier of hardware products to OEM plants in the
United States, Canada and Mexico, purchases about US$18 million-worth of
products from around the world every year.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA officials, representatives of Mexico's Grupo Tutsa, a
leading nuts and bolts dealer, have been visiting central and southern Taiwan
since Feb. 9 for procurement talks with local suppliers.</P>
      <P>Wu said that since their visit began, the representatives have canceled a plan
to visit Hangzhou in China.</P>
      <P>Under the New Zheng He Project -- named after a Ming Dynasty Chinese explorer --
the administration  will assist Taiwanese suppliers and manufacturers to produce
more goods for export, with the country's entire export trade hopefully topping
NT$500 billion in 2009, thus turning around the poor performance in the export
sector due to the global economic recession.</P>
      <P>The ambitious  export-bolstering  project  will also direct Taiwanese exporters
and manufacturers to emerging markets beyond China, including India, Russia,
Brazil, the Middle East and countries in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Zheng He was an official who lived during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) . He led
a giant fleet of Chinese vessels to Southeast Asia, from where they are believed
to have reached as far as the west coast of Africa. He was instrumental in
building China into one of the maritime superpowers between the 14th and 17th
centuries.</P>

      <P>A non-government Taiwanese medical team that provided free medical services to
some 5,000 people during a just concluded two-week mission to Kenya returned to
Taiwan Friday.</P>
      <P>The team, composed of 27 medical personnel from various medical centers, as well
as volunteers, was organized by the Taiwan Root Medical Peace Corps (TRMPC), a
private non-profit organization dedicated to improving the quality of life
through the provision of medical services at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>The team arrived in Kenya late January, when the African country was plagued by
massive food shortages due to a prolonged drought, according to TRMPC President
Liu Chi-chun.</P>
      <P>The team held 10 free clinics in several towns near Lake Victoria, where there
are large numbers of AIDS patients, orphans and starving people, according to
Liu.</P>
      <P>Liu recalled that when an overturned gasoline tanker exploded in the town of
Molo Feb. 1, leaving 113 dead and about 200 injured, his team, despite being
nearby, was unable to provide aid as it was unaware of the accident.</P>
      <P>The TRMPC has rich experience in extending emergency medical relief, such as
providing post-war aid in Kosovo, providing medical treatment for victims of the
South Asia tsunami and the Indonesia earthquake, Liu said, adding that if the
team had learned about the explosion, it could have provided humanitarian
relief.</P>
      <P>Since February 2000, the TRMPC has arranged medical missions every year to
African countries during the Chinese New Year holiday. It has provided services
in Swaziland, Malawi, Ghana, Senegal, Gambia, Liberia and Somalia.</P>

      <P>More than 500 companies from 60 countries around the world have registered to
attend Sourcing Taiwan 2009, a function  aimed  at  creating  partnerships
between  Taiwanese manufacturers and foreign buyers for increased trade
exchanges, the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>A total of 507 foreign companies are expected to be represented at the event
slated to be held at the Taipei World Trade Center (TWTC) at the end of March, a
TAITRA official said.</P>
      <P>The number of attending companies is far greater than originally anticipated,
the official noted, adding that the council originally targeted some 350 foreign
companies to help shore up the country's export trade.</P>
      <P>Of the 507 companies, 195 are major players in global trade, with annual
business turnovers exceeding US$100 million, the official said.</P>
      <P>One-on-one trade talks are slated to be held at the TWTC March 31, enabling some
2,000 Taiwanese manufacturers or exporters to meet with the foreign buyers for
trade talks. TAITRA estimates that some US$120 billion (US$3.53 billion) in
trade opportunities are expected to be generated from the talks.</P>

      <P>Two Chinese children nabbed at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport Saturday
for holding fake Taiwanese identification were deported to China the following
day, according to the National Immigration Agency (NIA).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawyers defending former President Chen Shui-bian and his wife in a series of
corruption cases complained Sunday that while going through the recorded
depositions  of witnesses, they found a 30-minute section on one of the discs
that had no sound.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-lung, one of Chen's lawyers, expressed suspicion that the Special
Investigation  Division  (SID)  under the Supreme Prosecutors  Office might have
tampered with the recording to eradicate testimony favorable to the former
president.</P>
      <P>However, SID Director Chen Yun-nan said the prosecutors in his division would
never mute a deposition on purpose and that the problem could be due to
malfunctioning of the video recording equipment.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-nan said he had not examined the disc in question and suspected that
the soundless part could simply be an intermission videotaped by a camcorder
left running after the deposition was temporarily halted.</P>
      <P>He added that his division will look into the matter and establish the cause of
the problem. As for whether the disc could be considered effective evidence, he
pointed out that that is up to the court to decide.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Yun-nan, in addition to the recording on disc, the deposition
was also transcribed to ensure the accuracy of the testimony. Furthermore, the
lawyers of the former president can always cross-examine the witness in question
-- Taiwan Cement Corp. Chairman Koo Cheng-yun, who was found by the prosecutors
to have transferred NT$300 million (US$8.81 million) in 2003 as bribes to the
former president and his wife for a land procurement deal in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecutors, the former president used his position to push for
the government's purchase of the land for the construction of a science park
after his wife Wu Shu-jen allegedly accepted bribes through the landowner.</P>
      <P>The land procurement scandal is one of a series of criminal cases involving the
former president and his family. The charges against them in the other cases
include embezzlement, money laundering and forgery.</P>
      <P>The former president and his wife have been indicted for embezzling NT$104
million (US$3.12 million) from the president's special discretionary fund during
his presidency from 2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also accused of taking NT$90.93 million in kickbacks to help a
contractor win the tender for a government construction project.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian is being held in custody at a Taipei County detention center. He
is Taiwan's first former president to face trial on criminal offenses and if
convicted, could face a life sentence.</P>

      <P>The  Construction  and  Planning Administration under the Ministry of the
Interior (MOI) urged Taiwanese people Sunday to vote for Yushan, or Jade
Mountain, in a global contest for a new listing of seven world wonders.</P>
      <P>The 3,952 meter Yushan -- Taiwan's highest peak -- is the only site in the
country with preliminary shortlisting among 261 natural heritage sites listed by
New Seven Wonders, a non-profit Swiss foundation, agency officials said.</P>
      <P>As foundation experts will nominate 21 candidate sites out of 77 selected
through a second stage of public voting on the Internet before July 7, agency
officials called on the public to take part in the  global  vote  through
various  Web  sites,  including www.new7wonders.com or another Web site run by
the Yushan National Park Administration in conjunction with the New Seven
Wonders foundation.</P>
      <P>Although the government and private sectors have in recent years been seeking to
have Yushan listed as a world heritage site recognized by the United Nations,
agency officials said the goal remains some way off due to political pressure,
as Taiwan is not a member of the world body.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau is accelerating the implementation of several
construction and dredging programs at the southern harbor to enhance its
competitiveness, a bureau official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Reeling from the effects of the global economic downturn, the harbor handled
9.67 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) last year, a drop of 5 percent
from the previous year. The harbor is designed to handle 10 million TEUs per
year, according to the official.</P>
      <P>The harbor lost its place as one of the world's 10 busiest container ports due
to the fall in container volume last year, the official went on, attributing
this to stiff competition from other major ports in Pacific Asia, an exodus of
local enterprises, China's magnetic effect and the development of China's harbor
shipping industry, as well as soaring oil prices last year and lower shipping
demand due to the global crisis.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to counter these setbacks, the bureau will speed up the pace of
several construction projects, including the first-phase construction  of an
intercontinental  container center and the establishment of four new deep-water
wharves slated to be completed in 2013.</P>
      <P>After completion, the new wharves will be able to accommodate large container
ships capable of carrying 10,000 TEUs and will increase the harbor's cargo-
handling capacity by 2 million TEUs per year, according to the official.</P>
      <P>The bureau will also speed up work on two dredging programs at the harbor's
first and second seaway areas designed to widen the two navigation channels to
14-15 meters, allowing them to accommodate larger vessels, the official said.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials will visit foreign shipping companies  to increase their
understanding of the environmental advantages of the harbor and to seek business
opportunities. The bureau also plans to set up a cooperation system to attract
private companies to take on the construction projects, and to relax regulations
on leasing the harbor's facilities, the official added.</P>

      <P>"Fan" tours designed for overseas followers of Taiwanese pop stars have worked
their way to becoming a strong tourist draw, increasing the number of visitors
to Taiwan from Japan and Korea despite the economic slowdown, a government
agency reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>The tourism industry worldwide has been battered by last year's soaring oil
prices and the global sluggish economy, but Taiwan still managed to receive over
1.08 million visitors from Japan over the past year, according to the Tourism
Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>The figure was a drop of 6.83 percent from the year-earlier level, and the
bureau described attracting 1.08 million as "not an easy task" as the overall
number of Japanese outbound travelers saw a decline of 7.6 percent compared to
the previous year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of Korean visitors to Taiwan totaled approximately
253,000, an increase of 11.71 percent year-on-year in spite of the buffeting
that country's economy took, while a significant depreciation of its currency
put many Koreans off traveling abroad, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>The bureau attributed these relatively optimistic developments to the success of
tours targeting foreign fans attracted to Taiwanese singers and actors, as part
of the bureau's 2008-2009 "Taiwan Touch Your Heart" campaign to attract
tourists.</P>
      <P>For instance, around 3,500 fans from seven Asian countries who gathered in
Taipei earlier in the day to see the Taiwanese pop group Fahrenheit were
expected to bring in NT$100 million (US$2.93 million) of business during their
stays here, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>The group has been chosen as Taiwan's "tourism ambassador" for Korea and Japan
this year, the bureau added.</P>

      <P>Ashes of Buddhist Master Sheng Yen, founder of Dharma Drum Mountain Monastery in
Jinshan, Taipei County, were buried Sunday in a cemetery near the monastery he
founded.</P>
      <P>His ashes were divided into five bags, and buried in five different holes at the
Jinshan Cemetery as he requested before he died on Feb. 3.</P>
      <P>The cemetery , owned by the Taipei County, was managed by the Dharma Drum
Mountain Monastery.</P>
      <P>The ceremony had drawn more than 30,000 followers of the master as well as
celebrities including President Ma Ying-jeou, Vice President Vincent Siew, and
former Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>The crowd formed a line up to three kilometers along the path leading from the
monastery to the cemetery where the ashes of the dead were buried beside trees
in a rite advocated by Sheng Yen as "plant bury."</P>
      <P>Born in Shanghai, eastern China in 1931, Sheng Yen became a Buddhist monk at 13,
but was conscripted into the Nationalist Army as a soldier and moved to Taiwan
in 1949.</P>
      <P>He left the army and resumed his life as a Buddhist monk in 1959, and eventually
became a famous Buddhist master in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In 1979, Sheng Yen was named the abbot of Nung Chan Monastery in Beitou, Taipei
City and turned it into Taiwan's center of Chan which is a school of Buddhism.</P>
      <P>In order to accommodate his growing followers, he began the construction of a
more spacious monastery in 2000 in Jinshan, and the Dharma Drum Mountain
Monastery was inaugurated in 2005.</P>
      <P>He died in Taipei of kidney failure at the age of 78 after a long illness.</P>

      <P>As much as 45 percent of the trash discarded by the Taiwan public was recycled
last year thanks to the government's garbage sorting policy, according to
statistics released Monday by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA).</P>
      <P>During the January-November 2008 period, each citizen in Taiwan produced an
average 0.839 kilograms of garbage per day, with the trash incinerated or buried
in landfills averaging 0.46 kilograms per person per day, the EPA data showed.</P>
      <P>Since 2006, the EPA has been promoting a policy under which garbage should be
sorted and separated into three categories -- ordinary garbage, recyclables and
food scraps -- before being taken to the trash trucks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ma will attend 228 service, does not fear heckling: spokesman</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will make room in his tight schedule to attend a service
to be held in Kaohsiung in commemoration of the 228 Incident of 1947, despite
rumors that he might be heckled by the victims' relatives, Presidential Office
spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-chi quoted Ma as saying that he would attend the 228 memorial service
slated for Feb. 28 in the southern port city of Kaohsiung and would not mind if
there were protests against him during the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Ma said the country should face the mistakes  of history courageously, but
members of the society should seek reconciliation instead of confrontation with
each other, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>Ma understands and is willing to face any uncomfortable moments as president,
Wang said. Ma has attended similar services many times over the past years,
including during his tenure as Taipei city mayor and chairman of the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) , and was heckled on several occasions, Wang added.</P>
      <P>Wang said the president has decided to attend the services that will be held in
Taipei and Kaohsiung Feb. 28.</P>
      <P>As usual, the events will be sponsored by the 228 Incident Memorial Foundation,
a non-profit organization founded by the Executive Yuan in April 1995 on the
basis of the Compensation and Rehabilitation Act.</P>
      <P>Wang, however, called for people at the services to express their opinions in a
rational way.</P>
      <P>He added that security will be tight during the president's attendance of the
services, as the safety of the head of state is of ultimate importance.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident, which began Feb. 27, 1947, refers to a brutal crackdown on the
local population by KMT troops in March and April of that year that reportedly
led to the deaths of an estimated 28,000 people.</P>
      <P>At the time of the incident, many innocent people, including elite members of
the society, were blacklisted and consequently victimized.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) announced
Monday that it will open four new offices in China this year to help Taiwan
companies explore the Chinese market in response to growing business demand.</P>
      <P>Offices in Nanjing and Wuhan in the central Chinese provinces of Jiangsu and
Hubei, Guangzhou in southern China's Guangdong Province and Dalian in Liaoning
Province in northeastern China will be opened this year, TAITRA Secretary-
General Chao Yung-chuan said.</P>
      <P>TAITRA already maintains offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Qingdao and
Xiamen.</P>
      <P>To help China-based Taiwanese businesses tap into the mainland market, TAITRA
will send delegations to China from Feb. 17 to March 6 to hold a series of
briefing sessions in about 10 cities, including Qingdao, Dongguan, Xiamen,
Shenzhen, Quanzhou, Chengdu, Shanghai, Nanjing and Beijing,  said Wu Lee-min,
director  of TAITRA's information technology center.</P>
      <P>Most Taiwan companies operating in China are export oriented businesses, which
have been hit hard by the economic downturn.</P>
      <P>From mid-February to late August, TAITRA experts will also hold a series of
seminars for Taiwan businessmen in southern, central and northern China to
inform them of the importance of branding and to help them gain footholds in the
Chinese domestic market.</P>
      <P>Exploring the Chinese market is a key aspect of the New Zheng He Project of the
Taiwan government, which is designed to help Taiwanese enterprises  boost global
exports in response to the economic recession.</P>
      <P>Zheng was an official of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and the most famous
Chinese navigator. He was a contemporary of Columbus.</P>
      <P>Zheng sailed from China to the South Pacific, Indian Ocean, Taiwan, the Persian
Gulf and Africa in seven epic voyages from 1405 to 1433, some 80 years before
Columbus' voyages.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Plans to launch a service Wednesday to wire money between China and Taiwan
through post offices have been postponed to an unspecified date, Chunghwa Post
Co. said Monday.</P>
      <P>According  to Chunghwa  Post Deputy General Manager  Huang Shu-chien, China's
postal service authorities have informed the company that it is difficult for
the Chinese side to begin the two-way remittance service as scheduled, but they
did not explain why.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Post speculated that because of the large number of post offices in
China -- more than 37,000 -- the authorities have not yet been able to work out
the operational costs for wire transfers.</P>
      <P>The state-run Chunghwa Post announced last week that two-way remittance services
across the Taiwan Strait will begin Feb. 18, after the two sides launched direct
postal links last Dec. 15.</P>
      <P>The links were based on an agreement signed last November by Straits Exchange
Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart, Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits President Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>However, while the postal links got off the ground on the scheduled date, the
remittance service was delayed due to what the two sides said were challenging
technical problems.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Post first opened a wire transfer service in 1991 for people wishing to
remit money to China. Currently, there are 91 post offices around Taiwan that
offer the service, with NT dollar transfers converted to Chinese yuan through
U.S.-based Citibank before being wired to designated banks in China.</P>
      <P>On average, NT$1.46 billion (US$42.9 million) is transferred to China from
Taiwan through Chunghwa Post every year.</P>
      <P>Once the direct remittance service is launched, the process is expected to be
much faster, although Citibank will continue to facilitate the currency
exchange.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) expressed confidence Monday that
U.S.-Taiwan relations would not be affected by plans between the United States
and China to resume military consultations.</P>
      <P>As these consultations had been in progress up to last year, there is no need
for concern that they will affect the continuity of the smooth ties between the
U.S. and Taiwan, said Harry Tseng, director-general of the MOFA's Department of
North American Affairs.</P>
      <P>Asked if the new U.S. administration might halt the weapons sales to Taiwan in
view of the upcoming consultations with China, Tseng said this is unlikely, as
the Pentagon since last October had notified the Congress of the proposed arms
sale to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tseng said he expects the U.S. would reiterate its "one China" policy if asked
by Chinese leaders to comment on the Taiwan issue, since this framework has
proved successful in helping to maintain peace and prosperity in the region over
the past three decades.</P>
      <P>During a speech delivered last Friday to the Asia Society in New York, new U.S.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the U.S. will resume mid-level
defense consultations with China later this month.</P>
      <P>Beijing  called  off  high-level  military  exchanges  and non-proliferation
talks with the U.S. last October after the Pentagon notified Congress that it
planned to sell a package of advanced defensive weapons to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However,  the spokesman  for China's defense ministry,  Hu Changming, said last
month that his country was willing to resume military cooperation with the new
U.S. administration of President Barack Obama.</P>
      <P>The United States, which is committed under the terms of the Taiwan Relations
Act to help Taiwan maintain adequate defense capability, has long been Taiwan's
major defensive weapons supplier.</P>
      <P>During a hearing held last week by the Senate Committee on Intelligence, new
U.S. Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair reaffirmed Washington's
commitment to help Taiwan maintain a military balance with China, which
continues to modernize its military.</P>

      <P>Seven young siblings of a stray dog family that were found near death due to
illness and starvation off a trail in the Kenting National Park in southern
Taiwan late last year have boarded a plane to new homes in the United States,
thanks to the efforts of a local animal welfare group and its online supporters.</P>
      <P>The seven two-month-old puppies -- whose mother Daisy was flown to Seattle
nearly a month ago to a new home -- will be adopted by seven families in Los
Angeles, according to the Kaohsiung-based Animal Rescue Team Taiwan (ARTT).</P>
      <P>The family was rescued in early December last year thanks to a young woman from
Taipei, identified only by her online user name "shing0128, " who found the
litter with their mother during a hike in the national park.</P>
      <P>Discovering that the bitch was seriously ill and that the puppies were weak,
"shing0128" drove to the nearby township of Hengchun to buy dog food for the
animals.</P>
      <P>Because she could not take them home and was worried that the litter could
starve to death, "shing0128" took pictures of them and noted their location
using her GPS before heading home to Taipei. Once there, she posted the pictures
and information about the dogs on the ARTT Web site chat room.</P>
      <P>A second individual going by the moniker of "Little Soldier," who saw
"shing0128's" information on the Internet, immediately rode his motorbike to
Kenting National Park and found the litter and their sick mother.</P>
      <P>"Little Soldier" fed the dogs and put a red collar on the mother dog before
taking more pictures of the family in need, which he then posted on the ARTT Web
site.</P>
      <P>A third individual, identified as Ms. Chang from Tainan City, drove to Kenting
with her boyfriend early the next morning, caught the dogs and brought them to
ARTT's headquarters in Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>ARTT vets treated the animals, fed them and gave them shelter.</P>
      <P>Before long, ARTT posted the story of the rescue on the Web sites of two major
animal protection organizations in the United States in the hope that the dogs
could find new homes there.</P>
      <P>Good news came soon and all the dogs -- now in good health -- found new homes in
the U.S.</P>
      <P>Ni Ching-tai, an ARTT volunteer, said he will make arrangements to make the
story into a series of graphics that will serve as good educational material.</P>

      <P>Overall production of Taiwan's IC industry is expected to suffer a year-on-year
slide of 26.9 percent this year as a result of the global economic recession,
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) forecast Monday.</P>
      <P>Officials from the MOEA's Department of Industrial Technology said the overall
production of IC industry -- the backbone of Taiwan's industrial growth --
totaled NT$1.34 trillion (US$39.41 billion) in 2008, down 8.1 percent year-on-
year.</P>
      <P>Production is estimated to decline even further this year, to fall below NT$1
trillion, possibly to as low as NT$984.5 billion, marking an alarming decline of
26.9 percent year-on-year, the officials said.</P>
      <P>A breakdown compiled by the department shows that output of the IC fabrication
sector -- the key player of the IC industry -- totaled NT$654.2 billion in 2008,
representing a decline of 11.2 percent compared to the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The output of the semiconductor manufacturing sector amounted to NT$446.9

      <P>Some 310 companies have responded positively to a training program aimed at
providing specialized courses for workers on unpaid leave, the Cabinet-level
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>To date, 310 businesses have registered with the CLA to offer training courses
in foreign languages, computer skills, business management, and research and
renovation to their workers on unpaid leave.</P>
      <P>CLA officials estimated that 5,600 companies will join the program, to the
benefit of around 168,000 workers across the country. The officials forecast
that some of the workers will be able to begin receiving training from March.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the council will offer subsidies of up to NT$1.9 million
(US$57,100) to each large business concern and NT$950,000 to each medium- and
small-sized enterprise participating in the program.</P>
      <P>Eligible participating workers will receive subsidies of up to NT$10,000 per
month for a maximum period of six months.</P>
      <P>The CLA reported early last week that at least 180,000 workers across Taiwan
were being forced to take unpaid leave days, with those in the high-tech and
financial service sectors most likely to be given extra unpaid days off.</P>
      <P>The council said the estimate was based on reports on unpaid leave practices
submitted by more than 400 companies across the country between Dec. 23 and Jan.
31, with the number of affected workers totaling around 180,000.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of workers on full or partial unpaid leave in the Hsinchu

      <P>A delegation of the Taiwan Financial Services  Roundtable  (TFSR)  held talks
Monday with Taiwanese businessmen operating in China and Beijing officials to
gain a better understanding of the current economic state of China and the kind
of financial services Taiwanese businesses need.</P>
      <P>The 40-member group, headed by TFSR Chairman Shea Jia-dong, arrived in Beijing
the previous day to convey Taiwan's wish for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
to accelerate their financial cooperation.</P>
      <P>The visitors are also expected to probe the possibility of the two sides signing
a memorandum of understanding  on financial supervision cooperation, as the
issue has been put on the planned agenda of a third meeting  between Taiwan's
Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese
counterpart, Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits President Chen
Yunlin, scheduled for May.</P>
      <P>Shea told Taiwanese reporters before the Monday workshop that cross-strait
exchanges in the financial sector have not been frequent in the past. The TFSR,
therefore, wants to convey the hope that the Chinese authorities will step up
their pace in opening China's financial market for cross-strait exchanges or
transactions, he said.</P>
      <P>Shea, who has previously served as minister of finance, said he hopes China will
allow Taiwanese banks to open branches in China without having first to set up
representative offices.</P>
      <P>He also expressed hope that China will allow Taiwanese bank branches to deal
with trading in the Chinese yuan in China.</P>
      <P>Members of the TFSR delegation include Taiwan Business Bank Chairman Joseph N.
Tsai, Mega Bills Finance Chairman Tzeng Chuei-ji, China Development Industrial
Bank President Lawrence S. Liu, SinoPac Holdings President Mckinney Y.T. Tsai
and Bank of Taiwan President Lo Tzer-cheng.</P>
      <P>The delegation will visit the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the China
Insurance Regulatory Commission in Beijing before traveling to Shanghai Feb. 18.
It is scheduled to return to Taiwan Feb. 20.</P>
      <P>The TFSR was founded in 2005, following the model of the U.S.-based Financial

      <P>However, Wang also said that the present maximum payable period of six months
remains reasonable, given the fact that the average duration of unemployment in
January stood at 26 weeks, or slightly more than six months.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive extension will only be justified if the average duration of
unemployment increases, she said.</P>
      <P>According to the Employment Insurance Law, workers who lose their jobs through
no fault of their own and who fail to find new ones within 14 days of
registering with a government-run employment service organization can receive 60
percent of their insured wages for up to six months.</P>
      <P>The CLA has submitted to the Legislative Yuan a proposed amendment to the law in
which the maximum payable period would be extended to nine months for older
workers and those with physical or mental disabilities.</P>
      <P>Wang said that if the government does not take any steps to address the
unemployment problem, the jobless rate will likely top 6 percent this year.</P>
      <P>The government is working to control the unemployment rate within 4.5 percent by
promoting various job creation programs, she said.</P>
      <P>Among them are a "get to work" program launched last October in which businesses
participating in the program will get a government subsidy of NT$10,000 per
month for each unemployed worker who has been out of work three or more
consecutive months prior to being hired, for a maximum period of six months.</P>
      <P>The program has so far helped 13,106 jobless workers find employment, Wang
noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 7,312 workers had been provided short-term jobs in local government
agencies as of Feb. 10, and local authorities are expected to further provide
5,517 temporary jobs this year, she said.</P>
      <P>Due to the economic downturn that was triggered mainly by the global financial
crisis, Taiwan's unemployment rate soared to 5.03 percent in December 2008,
hitting the highest level since October 2003 and marking the first time in five
years that the monthly jobless rate had topped 5 percent.</P>
      <P>The average unemployment  rate for 2008 was 4.14 percent, representing a four-
year high.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan International Festival (TIF) , slated to kick off in Taipei Friday,
will feature performances that demonstrate how technology can be incorporated
into the performing arts and used to expand artistic creation, the event's
organizer said Monday.</P>
      <P>The National Theater and Concert Hall (NTCH) said 12 renowned international and
domestic groups will stage a series of performances at the festival, which runs
until April 3, under the themevision of the future." The shows will encompass
drama, music and dance.</P>
      <P>The performances, characterized by their interactivity, display a diversity of
styles that noticeably differ from those in traditional theater, allowing
audiences not only to watch and listen but also to participate through special
installations, NTCH Chairwoman Tchen Yu-chiou said in a statement posted on the
event's Web site</P>
      <P>NTCH Artistic Director Liu Chiung-shu explained, for instance, that
lemieux.pilon 4d art from Canada combines animation and film in its production
about Norman McLaren, a legendary figure in animation arts.</P>
      <P>Also, Philip Glass'Book of Longingintermingles the poems and paintings of the
Canadian singer Leonard Cohen through the use of multimedia.</P>
      <P>Other highlights includeThe Japanese Gardenby the Italian T.P.O. Visual Theatre
that uses game-like interactive devices as well as the digital version of The
Rite of Spring (Le Sacre du Printemps), among others, Liu added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tchen said that Taiwanese groups will also have a presence during the
festival, including the National Taiwan Symphony Orchestra, U Theatre and the
Hsiao Hsi Yuan Puppet Theater.</P>
      <P>In addition, the three-day Open-Air International Arts Festival will take place
in celebration of the now completed renovation of NTCH at its outdoor plaza from

    <HEADLINE>Rumor on when to fill gasoline tanks proven untrue</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics officials said Monday that motorists should ignore the rumor that they
will be shortchanged if they have their fuel tanks filled at service stations
around noon.</P>
      <P>The officials at the Bureau of Standards,  Metrology  and Inspection under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs said the results of a survey commissioned by the
bureau debunked the rumor that motorists spend more on fuel at noon because the
higher temperatures at that hour cause gasoline to expand.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the Industrial Technology Research Institute of Taiwan,
collected 840 fuel samples through 53 fuel dispensing nozzles made by three
major brands -- Tokheim, Wayne and Nuovo-Pignone -- at 10 filling stations in
northern, central and southern Taiwan when temperatures were either higher than
30 degrees Celsius or lower than 20 degrees C.</P>
      <P>Measurements of the fuel samples showed there was only a 0.055 percent
difference in volume between the two groups of fuel samples as a result of the
temperature variations.</P>
      <P>The officials pointed out that most fuel at filling stations sits in underground
tanks that act like big Thermos bottles, and that as a result, temperature
variations within the storage tanks are minimal throughout the day.</P>
      <P>They added that there is no need for motorists to buy fuel only early in the
morning or around midnight when temperatures are cooler.</P>
      <P>Gasoline, like any liquid, expands as its temperature increases. A 10-degree
Celsius temperature increase can cause gasoline to expand by about 3.5 percent.
Diesel fuel also expands and contracts over 2 percent for every 10-degree
Celsius change in the temperature.</P>
      <P>About two years ago, the same rumor spread in California, but experts explained
that the fuel at gas stations stayed close to 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees
Celsius) because it was stored underground and that any variations would even
out over the year or be too small to matter to consumers.</P>

      <P>The public is happy to see the easing of relations with China and is optimistic
over the development of such ties, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) spokesman
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Liu Teh-hsun made the remarks after the MAC summarized 108 public opinion
surveys related to cross-Taiwan Strait relations last year.</P>
      <P>Since President Ma Ying-jeou assumed office May 20, the public has "felt warmer
cross-strait relations" after the chilly relations under the previous
administration, Liu said.</P>
      <P>"Those who are optimistic about the development of cross-strait relations
outnumbered those who are pessimistic, according to the public opinion polls,"
he added.</P>
      <P>Those who said they are satisfied with the government's China policy also
outnumbered those who said they are dissatisfied, and a great majority are
positive about the government's efforts in improving cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>The polls also showed that as the government has eased relations with China,
the public has had higher  expectations  of the government's role in managing
the ties, hoping it will regulate the pace of the liberalization process, adopt
complementary measures and conduct risk assessments to prevent any negative
effects.</P>
      <P>On polls on Taiwan's national status and its future, the MAC said that those who
are in favor of the status quo in the broader sense, including those who are in
favor of the status quo before moving toward independence or unification, those
who want a status quo before deciding on unification or independence later, and
those who want a permanent status quo, accounted for between 64.9 percent and
91.8 percent of the public.</P>
      <P>The ratio was similar to the results of polls in preceding years, indicating
that those who are in favor of rapid independence or unification are in the
minority.</P>
      <P>The MAC said that between 75.4 percent and 81.6 percent identify with President
Ma Ying-jeou's "no unification, no independence, and no use of force" advocacy
to maintain the status quo in the Taiwan Strait under the framework of the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The MAC also said that between 52.2 percent and 68.7 percent of respondents to
the various polls said that cross-strait relations are moving toward a calmer
state, with between 50.6 percent and 57.9 percent believing that the government
can maintain cross-strait peace and stability.</P>
      <P>Between 62 percent and 65 percent of the public was confident cross-strait ties
would bring political stability and economic development over the next four
years, and between 47 percent and 62 percent were optimistic about the overall
development of cross-strait ties.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is opposed to the widely-
discussed idea of Taiwan signing a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement
(CECA) with China, said DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen Monday.</P>
      <P>Tsai made her stance known at a press conference after meeting with the DPP's 27
lawmakers to discuss issues important to the party, including the CECA, a plan
to allow Chinese students to study in universities and graduate schools in
Taiwan, and the government's measures to help the jobless.</P>
      <P>The meeting was held to form a consensus on the DPP's stands on the issues at
the Legislative Yuan, which will open its first session this year Feb.  20. The
DPP holds 27 seats in the 113-seat legislature, which is currently short two
members who were forced to cede their seats due to legal issues.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that debate in the legislative session will likely focus on issues
related to China and economic problems.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the CECA, an idea proposed by President Ma Ying-jeou during his
election campaign to further promote economic and trade cooperation between
Taiwan and China, Tsai contended that such an accord could turn Taiwan into a
dependency of China.</P>
      <P>She argued that if the government seals the agreement with China without careful
consideration or a common public consensus, it could cause social conflict.</P>
      <P>Tsai therefore  urged the government  to make all of its negotiations with
Chinese authorities and its cross-strait policy deliberations transparent.</P>
      <P>She suggested that an efficient monitoring mechanism should be set up either in
the Legislative Yuan or among political parties to oversee the administration of
the policy.</P>
      <P>As to the plan to allow Chinese students to study in Taiwan, which some people
suggest will harm the employment opportunities of Taiwanese graduates, Tsai said
the DPP would refrain from commenting at present.</P>
      <P>She said, however, that the party had its doubts about government plans to spend
taxpayer funds on rescuing a minority of key industries and enterprises, such as
a possible plan to bail out DRAM maker, ProMOS Technologies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Port is seeking to boost its competitiveness as it handled fewer
containers last year than in 2007 and is likely to see its global ranking fall,
the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hit by the global economic downturn and especially a dramatic fall in the
country's exports in the fourth quarter of the year, the southern port handled
9.67 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) in 2008, down 5 percent from
the 2007 level, bureau statistics showed.</P>
      <P>With Kaohsiung possibly falling out of the world's top 10 container ports in
2008, the bureau is exploring ways to reverse the decline,  including launching
several construction and dredging projects, bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>Four deep-sea wharfs, slated to be completed in 2013, are expected to increase
the port's container handling capability by 2 million TEUs per year, according
to the officials.</P>
      <P>Improved ties with China may also provide new momentum. Since direct shipping
services were established across the Taiwan Strait in mid-December, the number
of containers handled by the port has increased by an average of more than
200,000 TEUs per month, they noted.</P>
      <P>That jump has led the bureau to focus its expansion program for the port on
cross-strait routes. To capitalize on the newly opened shipping links, the
bureau intends to develop the port into a value added distribution center and
offer incentives to foreign shippers and warehousing companies to set up
facilities there.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Port is Taiwan's largest deep-sea port and was once the world's third-
largest container port. It was ranked as the eighth biggest container port in
the world in 2007 behind Dubai and ahead of Hamburg, Germany, with 10.257
million TEUs handled.</P>
      <P>The top five ports in the world were Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Shenzhen
and Busan.</P>

      <P>ScinoPharm Taiwan Ltd., a biotechnology company in the Tainan Science-Based
Industrial Park in southern Taiwan, saw pre-tax profits grow 119 percent in 2008
on improved sales of its oncology products.</P>
      <P>Jo Shen, president and CEO of ScinoPharm, said the company posted pre-tax income
of NT$905 million, up 119 percent from NT$413 million in 2007, on revenues of
NT$3.14 billion (US$91.58 million).</P>
      <P>The reported revenues were 26 percent higher than the NT$2.49 billion in sales
the company reported a year earlier.</P>
      <P>The biotech company achieved strong growth at a time when annual results at most
other hightech companies in the Tainan park suffered serious declines in 2008
because of the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Shen attributed her company's success to the company's management strategy and
the successful marketing of its oncology products.</P>
      <P>ScinoPharm is a leading active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) supplier to the
global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry.</P>
      <P>It provides a full range of API services from process development and production
of early phase clinical trial material to large-scale manufacturing for
commercial launches. The company currently serves more than 190 customers
worldwide.</P>
      <P>In November last year, ScinoPharm was granted a U.S. patent for its new
crystalline forms of irinotecan hydrochloride, which are designed to allow for
easier filtration during production processing.</P>
      <P>The patent covers preparation methods and use of the novel molecules in the
treatment of metastatic colon cancer. It is the ninth U.S. patent granted to
ScinoPharm and the second patent for irinotecan hydrochloride, one of the
company's high-demand oncology products.</P>
      <P>Irinotecan hydrochloride, a cancer drug most commonly used to treat patients
with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum, became generic in the U.S. in
February 2008. Annual sales of the drug in the US market alone were
approximately US$556 million in 2007, according to IMS Health data.</P>
      <P>In addition to irinotecan hydrochloride, ScinoPharm offers 20 other products in
its oncological line, including paclitaxel and docetaxel.</P>
      <P>ScinoPharm's patent portfolio currently consists of 11 granted patents and more
than 24 patent applications in the United States and abroad for a wide range of
products.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Songshan Airport in downtown Taipei should be demolished when Taiwan grows
strong enough to share Hong Kong's functions or even replace it as a hub of
trade and transportation services with China, a hotelier said Monday.</P>
      <P>Stanley Yen, president of the Landis Hotels and Resorts Group who is also known
as the godfather of Taiwan's hotel industry, floated the idea in a speech
delivered at a monthly meeting of officials at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>As the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have finally launched direct shipping and
air links, Yen said Taiwan should capitalize on the opportunity to develop
cross-Taiwan Strait transportation and commercial markets.</P>
      <P>In so doing, Yen said, Taiwan will some day be able to share markets currently
held by Hong Kong and even eventually beat it out.</P>
      <P>When the time comes, Yen said, the government should have Songshan Airport torn
down to make way for a New York Central Park-like recreational area and a modern
town patterned after Tokyo's midtown, which incorporates green technology in its
construction.</P>
      <P>With the demolition of the airport, all limitations on the height of buildings
in its surrounding areas would be eliminated. Lower structures  in the area
could be integrated and rebuilt into skyscrapers while leaving more space for
landscaping.</P>
      <P>In his view,  Yen said only such large-scale construction opportunities could
attract world-class land developers to invest in Taiwan's construction market.</P>
      <P>By then, all flight services could be concentrated at Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport, which will be connected with downtown Taipei by mass
rapid transit (MRT) lines now under construction, Yen said.</P>
      <P>He even suggested that 20 to 50 years into the future, a Maglev, or magnetic
levitation line, could be built to further shorten the travel time between the
airport and Taipei to 12 minutes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yen stressed the value of culture in developing taiwan's tourism
industry.</P>
      <P>"Culture is the biggest added value for tourism development and part of Taiwan's
commendable soft power," Yen said.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to incorporate culture in its diplomatic efforts, using
cultural activities as a means to foster friendship, good will and cooperation
in various fields, including politics.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is opposed to the widely-
discussed idea of Taiwan signing a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement
(CECA) with China, said DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen Monday.</P>
      <P>Tsai made her stance known at a press conference after meeting with the DPP's 27
lawmakers to discuss issues important to the party, including the CECA, a plan
to allow Chinese students to study in universities and graduate schools in
Taiwan, and the government's measures to help the jobless.</P>
      <P>The meeting was held to form a consensus on the DPP's stands on the issues at
the Legislative Yuan, which will open its first session this year Feb.  20. The
DPP holds 27 seats in the 113-seat legislature, which is currently short two
members who were forced to cede their seats due to legal issues.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that debate in the legislative session will likely focus on issues
related to China and economic problems.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the CECA, an idea proposed by President Ma Ying-jeou during his
election campaign to further promote economic and trade cooperation between
Taiwan and China, Tsai contended that such an accord could turn Taiwan into a
dependency of China.</P>
      <P>She argued that if the government seals the agreement with China without careful
consideration or a common public consensus, it could cause social conflict.</P>
      <P>Tsai therefore  urged the government  to make all of its negotiations with
Chinese authorities and its cross-strait policy deliberations transparent.</P>
      <P>She suggested that an efficient monitoring mechanism should be set up either in
the Legislative Yuan or among political parties to oversee the administration of
the policy.</P>
      <P>As to the plan to allow Chinese students to study in Taiwan, which some people
suggest will harm the employment opportunities of Taiwanese graduates, Tsai said
the DPP would refrain from commenting at present.</P>
      <P>She said, however, that the party had its doubts about government plans to spend
taxpayer funds on rescuing a minority of key industries and enterprises, such as
a possible plan to bail out DRAM maker, ProMOS Technologies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Port is seeking to boost its competitiveness as it handled fewer
containers last year than in 2007 and is likely to see its global ranking fall,
the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hit by the global economic downturn and especially a dramatic fall in the
country's exports in the fourth quarter of the year, the southern port handled
9.67 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) in 2008, down 5 percent from
the 2007 level, bureau statistics showed.</P>
      <P>With Kaohsiung possibly falling out of the world's top 10 container ports in
2008, the bureau is exploring ways to reverse the decline,  including launching
several construction and dredging projects, bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>Four deep-sea wharfs, slated to be completed in 2013, are expected to increase
the port's container handling capability by 2 million TEUs per year, according
to the officials.</P>
      <P>Improved ties with China may also provide new momentum. Since direct shipping
services were established across the Taiwan Strait in mid-December, the number
of containers handled by the port has increased by an average of more than
200,000 TEUs per month, they noted.</P>
      <P>That jump has led the bureau to focus its expansion program for the port on
cross-strait routes. To capitalize on the newly opened shipping links, the
bureau intends to develop the port into a value added distribution center and
offer incentives to foreign shippers and warehousing companies to set up
facilities there.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Port is Taiwan's largest deep-sea port and was once the world's third-
largest container port. It was ranked as the eighth biggest container port in
the world in 2007 behind Dubai and ahead of Hamburg, Germany, with 10.257
million TEUs handled.</P>
      <P>The top five ports in the world were Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Shenzhen

    <HEADLINE>Hotelier proposes demolition of Songshan Airport</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.16 (CNA)
02/16/09  23:47:50
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Songshan Airport in downtown Taipei should be demolished when Taiwan grows
strong enough to share Hong Kong's functions or even replace it as a hub of
trade and transportation services with China, a hotelier said Monday.</P>
      <P>Stanley Yen, president of the Landis Hotels and Resorts Group who is also known
as the godfather of Taiwan's hotel industry, floated the idea in a speech
delivered at a monthly meeting of officials at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>As the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have finally launched direct shipping and
air links, Yen said Taiwan should capitalize on the opportunity to develop
cross-Taiwan Strait transportation and commercial markets.</P>
      <P>In so doing, Yen said, Taiwan will some day be able to share markets currently
held by Hong Kong and even eventually beat it out.</P>
      <P>When the time comes, Yen said, the government should have Songshan Airport torn
down to make way for a New York Central Park-like recreational area and a modern
town patterned after Tokyo's midtown, which incorporates green technology in its
construction.</P>
      <P>With the demolition of the airport, all limitations on the height of buildings
in its surrounding areas would be eliminated. Lower structures  in the area
could be integrated and rebuilt into skyscrapers while leaving more space for
landscaping.</P>
      <P>In his view,  Yen said only such large-scale construction opportunities could
attract world-class land developers to invest in Taiwan's construction market.</P>
      <P>By then, all flight services could be concentrated at Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport, which will be connected with downtown Taipei by mass
rapid transit (MRT) lines now under construction, Yen said.</P>
      <P>He even suggested that 20 to 50 years into the future, a Maglev, or magnetic
levitation line, could be built to further shorten the travel time between the
airport and Taipei to 12 minutes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yen stressed the value of culture in developing taiwan's tourism
industry.</P>
      <P>"Culture is the biggest added value for tourism development and part of Taiwan's
commendable soft power," Yen said.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to incorporate culture in its diplomatic efforts, using
cultural activities as a means to foster friendship, good will and cooperation
in various fields, including politics.</P>

      <P>Planting on a large scale did not begin until 1918, when the Japanese imported
over 900 Yoshino cherry saplings and grew them in the area around what is now
the Chaoping train station. Three years later, the trees all blossomed at the

      <P>Various varieties of cherry trees from Japan have since continued to be
introduced to the area, increasing the number of cherry trees there to around

schedule Monday, said Kenneth Kuanlin Fan, president of the World Congress of
Cultures.</P>
      <P>Ye visited Master Wu Ming of the Faming Monastery in Shulin, Taipei County and
then traveled to Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan to meet with the venerable Ching
Hsin of the Chinese Buddhist Association.</P>
      <P>Ye called on the Buddhist leaders to discuss matters related to the forum, which
is scheduled to be held in Taipei and Wuxi, Jiangsu province between March 27
and April 1.</P>
      <P>"Ye's visit is significant, " said Fan, noting that China had previously
advocated atheism and that religion had been rigorously suppressed.</P>
      <P>He observed that Ye's visit indicates that China has begun to attach more
importance to religion following a period of greater economic development and
cultural openness.</P>
      <P>Fan said that Chinese leader Hu Jintao has stressed a harmonious society, and
that Chinese Premier Wen Jiabo also stressed moral education, showing that China
has attached increasing importance to religious culture.</P>
      <P>Ye was invited by the Dharma-Drum Mountain Cultural and Educational Foundation.
He attended the ash burial ceremony of Master Sheng Yen, founder of the
foundation, Sunday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Hotelier proposes demolition of Songshan Airport</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.16 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Songshan Airport in downtown Taipei should be demolished when Taiwan grows
strong enough to share Hong Kong's functions or even replace it as a hub of
trade and transportation services with China, a hotelier said Monday.</P>
      <P>Stanley Yen, president of the Landis Hotels and Resorts Group who is also known
as the godfather of Taiwan's hotel industry, floated the idea in a speech
delivered at a monthly meeting of officials at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>As the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have finally launched direct shipping and
air links, Yen said Taiwan should capitalize on the opportunity to develop
cross-Taiwan Strait transportation and commercial markets.</P>
      <P>In so doing, Yen said, Taiwan will some day be able to share markets currently
held by Hong Kong and even eventually beat it out.</P>
      <P>When the time comes, Yen said, the government should have Songshan Airport torn
down to make way for a New York Central Park-like recreational area and a modern
town patterned after Tokyo's midtown, which incorporates green technology in its
construction.</P>
      <P>With the demolition of the airport, all limitations on the height of buildings
in its surrounding areas would be eliminated. Lower structures  in the area
could be integrated and rebuilt into skyscrapers while leaving more space for
landscaping.</P>
      <P>In his view,  Yen said only such large-scale construction opportunities could
attract world-class land developers to invest in Taiwan's construction market.</P>
      <P>By then, all flight services could be concentrated at Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport, which will be connected with downtown Taipei by mass
rapid transit (MRT) lines now under construction, Yen said.</P>
      <P>He even suggested that 20 to 50 years into the future, a Maglev, or magnetic
levitation line, could be built to further shorten the travel time between the
airport and Taipei to 12 minutes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yen stressed the value of culture in developing taiwan's tourism
industry.</P>
      <P>"Culture is the biggest added value for tourism development and part of Taiwan's
commendable soft power," Yen said.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to incorporate culture in its diplomatic efforts, using
cultural activities as a means to foster friendship, good will and cooperation
in various fields, including politics.</P>

      <P>Shih Ming-teh, the former Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) chairman
who led an anti-corruption movement against former President Cheng Shui-bian and
was tried for violating the Assembly and Parade law, will sit alone in front of
the Presidential Office Feb. 20 -- the day of the court ruling -- in a silent
protest over the government's failure to abolish the law, his spokesman said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Jerry Fan, spokesman for the "anti-corruption, depose Chen" campaign, said at a
news conference that Shih will start his sit-in at 3 p.m. and will continue
until the ruling, which is scheduled to be announced an hour later.</P>
      <P>"Shih has said many times that he insists that if found guilty, he will not
appeal but will go to jail according to the ruling, " Fan said, describing the
indictments as "extremely preposterous."</P>
      <P>Along with 15 other campaign officials named as co-defendants, Shih, who served
as DPP chairman between 1994 and 1996 before quitting the party in 2000, were
indicted Aug. 3, 2007 on charges of violating the Assembly and Parade Law for
staging an Oct. 10, 2006 "siege" of the Presidential Office and Chen's official
residence in an attempt to disrupt National Day celebration activities.</P>
      <P>One of Shih's co-defendants, political science professor Yao Li-ming, said at
the news conference that Shih's decision to go to jail is aimed at highlighting
how "unreasonable" the law is and how President Ma Ying-jeou has failed to carry
out his campaign promise to abolish the law.</P>
      <P>He noted that as the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) holds a majority in the Legislative
Yuan, it should not take this long to deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>Critics of the law say it infringes upon the freedom of expression protected by
the Constitution because those wishing to demonstrate must apply for government
approval before taking to the streets to champion their causes.</P>
      <P>"Ma should only apologize when he runs for re-election rather than now, " Yao
said. "What he should do at the moment is urge the ruling KMT to abolish the
law."</P>
      <P>Yao said Shih has expressed hope that the other co-defendants will not follow
his example and will appeal the rulings against them because his act alone is
enough to make the point.</P>
      <P>However,  former DPP member Wang Li-ping,  another of the co-defendants, also
said at the news conference that she will give up her right to appeal and that
she believed half of the co-defendants will make the same decision.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the anti-Chen campaign will take to the streets again in the
future, Yao said it will be "merely a matter of time" if the KMT still turns a
deaf ear to the calls to abolish the assembly law.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton affirmed Monday that there will
be no change in Washington's policy on arms sales to Taiwan under the new
administration of President Barack Obama.</P>
      <P>Clinton, who departed Sunday for a four-nation Asia visit, made the remarks in
an interview during her flight to Japan, her first stop.</P>
      <P>Clinton said U.S. policy with respect to Taiwan "remains as it has been" because
it is based on Washington's long-standing "one China" policy, the three
communiques with China and the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>"And under the Taiwan Relations Act, there is a clear provision that the United
States will provide support for Taiwan's defense. And that is why there have
been, over the many years, the sale of defensive materials to Taiwan," Clinton
said.</P>
      <P>Clinton said she is pleased about the decreased tension and increasing
cooperation between Taiwan and China over the past months, which she said is a
direction that the United States wants to support and promote.</P>
      <P>The United States has long been Taiwan's most important weapons supplier,
despite this being an irritant in U.S.-China relations.</P>
      <P>In the latest arms deal between the two sides, the administration of former
President George W. Bush approved in late 2008 the sale of a package of weapons
to Taiwan,  including  30 Apache attack helicopters, 330 advanced capability
Patriot (PAC-3) missiles, 32 Harpoon sub-launched missiles, 182 Javelin guided
missiles, and four E-2T system upgrades.</P>
      <P>The move drew a strong protest from China, which reacted by suspending military-
to-military exchanges and nonproliferation talks with the United States.</P>
      <P>China will be the final leg of Clinton's Asia trip, which will also take her to
Indonesia and South Korea.</P>

      <P>Taiwan does not allow the importation of fresh or preserved Kumquats from China,
and government agencies will jointly clamp down on the smuggling of such
products into the country, the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Shu-shien, director-general of the COA's International Affairs Department,
said Taiwan only allows a small amount of fresh kumquats from Japan and
preserved kumquats from some Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand and
Vietnam to be sold on the domestic market.</P>
      <P>Chang made the statements in the wake of recent local media reports that
substandard Chinese kumquats were being sold in Taiwan under the guise of
produce from Yilan County in northeastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, about 300 hectares of land in Taiwan are used to grow
kumquats, yielding about 4,000 metric tons of the fruit per year. Yilan County
accounts for 90 percent of the production, with the peak harvest season being
from December to February.</P>
      <P>Twenty percent of the yield is distributed to retail markets, while 80 percent
is used to make preserved snacks, she said.</P>
      <P>Although the harvesting period for the fruit this year has almost ended, she
said, COA officials will continue monitoring its retail prices on the domestic
market to help guarantee the local farmers' profits.</P>
      <P>The price of fresh kumquats in Taipei city's fruit and vegetable wholesale
markets rose from NT$25.1 per kilogram in 2005 to NT$39.3 per kilogram on
average in recent months.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the COA has asked the customs and coastal patrol authorities to crack
down more heavily on the smuggling of fresh and preserved kumquats from China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two noted scientists urged the public Tuesday to join star gazers around the
world in observing comet Lulin -- the first comet jointly discovered by
astronomers on both sides of the Taiwan Strait in 2007 -- when it moves closest
to the Earth on Feb. 24.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, former National Central University (NCU) Vice
President and Professor of Astronomy and Space Science Wing-huen Ip and Graduate
Institute of Astronomy professor Chen Wen-ping said the approach of the comet
provides a great opportunity for people to not only increase their knowledge of
astronomy but also to experience the beauty of the night sky.</P>
      <P>"It takes a kind of special destiny to be able to see a comet," said Chen.</P>
      <P>"Given that comet Lulin's orbit takes over 20 million years to complete... this
is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see it, " Chen noted.</P>
      <P>"This is the first and last time comet Lulin will enter the solar system," he
added.</P>
      <P>Ip said the comet allows scientists to learn about the past and explore the
future.</P>
      <P>"Astronomy sometimes is a bit like archeology, " said Ip. "Comets like Lulin,
which are young and contains a lot of chemicals from the time it was created,
provide us with a key to open the mysterious door of how our solar system was
formed 4.5 billion years ago."</P>
      <P>"The more we learn about the structure and functions of comets, the sooner we
will be able to react when we find objects that pose a threat to the Earth," he
added.</P>
      <P>The discovery of Lulin (C/2227 N3) was part of the major achievements made in
the Lulin Sky Survey project that was planned to explore the various populations
of small bodies in the solar system, especially on studying objects that might
present a hazard to the Earth.</P>
      <P>It was initially described as an asteroidal object when found by Ye Quanzhi at
the Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, China.</P>
      <P>Three images were obtained by Lin Chi-sheng of NCU's Graduate Institute of
Astronomy July 11, 2007, using the 41-cm camera at the university's Lulin
Observatory in Nantou, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that 2009 has been designated as International Year of Astronomy,  Chen
said the discovery  of Lulin two years  ago coincidentally makes it one of the
biggest astronomy events of 2009.</P>
      <P>The comet is moving between the constellations Scorpio and Libra and is expected
to move toward Leo at an accelerating pace in late February, reaching its
closest distance to the Earth on Feb. 24 -- about 61 million kilometers. It will
be visible to the naked eye, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>A series of events, including observation activities and seminars , have been
organized by NCU to provide more information about the comet.</P>

      <P>A planned ministry of culture is slated to be inaugurated in 2011 to coincide
with the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, a Council
of Cultural Affairs (CCA) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the Executive Yuan Organization Law Amendment, the ministry will

next year, Fang said.</P>
      <P>Once the ministry is established, its jurisdiction will cover the area of mass
media affairs presently handled by the Government Information Office, and museum
management now under the authority of the Ministry of Education.</P>
      <P>In addition, in an effort to establish a unified regulatory authority for
cultural affairs, the CCA will seek to have the ministry given jurisdiction over
the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, the National
Theater Hall and the National Concert Hall, according to Fang.</P>
      <P>To mark the country's 100th founding anniversary, the CCA will compile
publications  featuring  Taiwanese  culture by inviting outstanding people from
various sectors of society to write articles pertaining to Taiwan's diversified

      <P>The game industry is thriving despite the worst economic downturn since the 1991
recession, with operators in the business speculating that the sector will enjoy
growth of between 10 percent and 15 percent in Taiwan this year.</P>
      <P>Wang Chun-po, CEO of the Kaohsiung-based Soft-World International Corp., said in
a forum at the 2009 Taipei Game Show last week that almost all game producers
have been taking in record-high revenues since the second half of last year.</P>
      <P>He attributed this level of performance in the industry to the growing number of
"new players" -- the unemployed and people on unpaid leave.</P>
      <P>Since the growth of the industry is being driven by the development of a so-
called "stay-at-home economy" in which home recreation is becoming more popular,
the game businesses are worried about an economic recovery," Wang joked.</P>
      <P>Wang's company reported record revenues of NT$736.85 million (US$21.38 million)
in January, which represented a growth of 59.34 percent from the same month in
2008, and 7.56 percent from December last year.</P>
      <P>The online game designer and producer reported revenues of NT$650 million in
both November and December 2008, after the global economic storm broke.</P>
      <P>Wang said online games are mostly designed with social functions that allow the
users to make friends or let off steam without having to leave home.</P>
      <P>In the future, there will room for Taiwan's game industry to continue to grow,
he added, noting that Taiwanese players on average spend NT$457 per month on the
purchase of online games, half of what buyers in South Korea spend.</P>
      <P>Besides, there are still a lot of potential buyers among the new groups of
unemployed and under-employed game players, Wang said.</P>
      <P>According to a report released by the Council of Labor Affairs on Tuesday, as of
Monday 203,000 workers at 439 companies around Taiwan had been forced to take
unpaid leave days, up 10 percent from the period before the nine-day Lunar New
Year holiday that ended Feb. 1.</P>

      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) disclosed Monday that
it last week adopted a special budget of NT$150.6 billion (US$4.34 billion) for
2009 as part of the government's expanded public construction program for the
next four years.</P>
      <P>The top economic policy-planning body indicated that the NT$150.6 billion
budget,  to be submitted to the legislature soon for screening, will be part of
the four-year public construction program that will carry a price tag of NT$500
billion (US$14.46 billion).</P>
      <P>CEPD officials said the four-year plan is expected to raise the gross domestic
product (GDP) growth in real terms by 0.97 percentage points this year and
increase real GDP growth by 1.22 percentage points, 1.01 percentage points, and
0.89 percentage points for 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.</P>
      <P>The four-year program is projected to create between 190,000 and 220,000 jobs
this year, with more new jobs to come on stream in the next three years. It is
estimated that 200,000 to 230,000 jobs will be created in 2010; 160,000 to
190,000 jobs in 2011; and 120,000 to 150,000 jobs in 2012.</P>
      <P>The officials stressed that the construction projects in the four-year plan are
all necessary and urgent and will have a multiplying effect on the nation's
economy.</P>
      <P>The projects are intended to further improve Taiwan's public transportation
networks,  provide stable water supply to rural townships, enhance the safety of
bridges, public roads and old school buildings, and strengthen the
infrastructure to sharpen the nation's competitiveness.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, some of the projects can begin as soon as the
legislature passes the NT$150.6 billion budget for this year.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Kuomintang confirmed earlier this month
that after the legislature's next session begins Feb. 20, the first and foremost
item on the agenda will be the special budget bill for the government's expanded
public construction program.</P>

representing an Internet usage rate of nearly 69 percent, according to a report
released Tuesday by the Taiwan Network Information Center (TWNIC).</P>
      <P>The survey showed that some 14.2 million Internet users, or nearly 71 percent of
the Internet user population in Taiwan, were aged 12 or older.</P>
      <P>About 13.3 million of the total Web surfers in Taiwan were broadband  Internet
users,  which translated  into a broadband prevalence rate of 66.5 percent, the
poll found.</P>
      <P>Some 68.94 percent of Taiwan's population across the age spectrum use the
Internet, the survey found. In this respect, Taiwan ranks behind South Korea
(73.83 percent) and Japan (73.85 percent) but higher than Hong Kong (66 percent)
and Singapore (58.59 percent), the reported indicated.</P>
      <P>The survey on the use of broadband Internet in Taiwan was conducted between Dec.
7, 2008 and Jan. 3 this year among people over the age of 12 in households that
subscribe to local telephone services in 23 cities and counties around the
country.</P>
      <P>A total of 3,284 valid samples were collected for the survey. It had a margin of
error of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points and a 95 percent confidence level.</P>
      <P>According to polls conducted in the past few years, most of the people who did
not use the Internet said this was because they felt no need or had no equipment
to do so, said Liang Te-hsin, a professor at Fu Jen Catholic University's
Department of Statistics and Information.</P>
      <P>However, Internet access has become more widespread in Taiwan recently with the
increased  availability  of government-funded equipment, according to Liang, who
added that the matter of Internet use is a personal choice.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan mulls closing representative office in Bangladesh</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is considering shutting down its
representative office in Bangladesh in light of its low level of performance, an
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The ministry is currently conducting a comprehensive review of the effectiveness
of its overseas offices with a view to maximizing its overall diplomatic
resources, said MOFA's spokesman Henry Chen at a press briefing.</P>
      <P>Closing a representative office, he explained, would involve considerations
such as relations between Taiwan and the host government, the performance of the
office in providing consular services and the number of Taiwanese based in the
host country.</P>
      <P>"The performance of the office in Bangladesh has so far been lackluster in this
regard," he said.</P>
      <P>However, the ministry will see whether any improvements can be achieved in the
wake of the recent general elections in Bangladesh, he added.</P>
      <P>He also stressed that the decision on whether or not to close the representative
office will be fully based on Taiwan's own evaluation, and that it will not be
influenced by the pressure China has exerted on Bangladesh since the office was
established nearly five years ago.</P>
      <P>The MOFA set up a representative office in India in 1995 and another in
Bangladesh in 2004 -- Taiwan's only two in South Asia -- as part of its efforts
to strengthen relations with countries in the region, help Taiwanese firms seek
business opportunities there, and provide services for overseas Taiwanese living
in those countries.</P>
      <P>However, the Bangladesh office has encountered difficulties carrying out the
functions that were initially agreed upon by the governments of Taiwan and the
South Asian country due to pressure from China, according to a diplomatic
source.</P>
      <P>For example,  issuing visas to Bangladeshis has been made impossible and they
have had to turn instead to Taiwan's representative office in Thailand to obtain
visas.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA statistics, there were around 130 Taiwanese living in
Bangladesh as of December last year.</P>

      <P>Shops that offer NT$100 (US$2.9) haircuts are seeing a sharp increase in
business, as more people are trying to cut back on spending in a difficult
economy.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan caught in the tide of the global financial tsunami and people
tightening their belts, personal grooming is one of expenses that is being
trimmed.</P>
      <P>Boys and men, who generally pay relatively less attention than females to hair
styling, are choosing the 100-dollar haircut shops over hair salons or
barbershops, giving those low-end businesses a big boost.</P>
      <P>Business at such shops has grown by at least 10 percent with the start of the
new school term, according to one shop owner surnamed Chang.</P>
      <P>In Taichung City in central Taiwan, there is a 100-dollar haircut shop in almost
every hypermart, and they offer a haircut-only service that does not include
shampooing.</P>
      <P>This type of value-for-money service has not only retained its usual clientele,
but is also attracting many first-time customers.</P>
      <P>"The number of customers started increasing slightly at the end of last year,"
Chang told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>This could be as a result of people trying to save money or because the public
is pleased with the quality of 100-dollar haircuts," he added.</P>
      <P>Facing fierce competition from 100-dollar haircut shops, many hair salons have
jumped on the bandwagon and are now offering 100-dollar haircuts in a bid to
keep their customers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>200,300 workers being given unpaid leave days: labor council</HEADLINE>

(By Luis Yu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 200,300 workers across Taiwan are having to take unpaid days off,
which represents a 10 percent increase over the number recorded in a survey
prior to the Lunar New Year, the Cabinet-level Council for Labor Affairs (CLA)
announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the council, the estimate is based on reports on unpaid leave
practices submitted to the CLA on Jan. 16 by 439 companies across the country.</P>
      <P>Since  January,  the CLA has been stipulating  that local enterprises report the
number of workers they ask to take unpaid leave, to better monitor the impact of
falling exports on Taiwan's labor market, said Sun Pi-hsia the head of the
department of labor standards of the CLA.</P>
      <P>Starting this week, the CLA will conduct random inspections at approximately 200
local companies to check whether they obtained the consent of their employees
before asking them to take unpaid leave and whether such workers are receiving
at least the minimum monthly salary of NT$17,280 (US$499) as required by law,
said Sun.</P>
      <P>"The local labor bureaus will fine companies that are not paying their employees
the minimum monthly wage and those employers who failed to obtain the consent of
their workers before sending them on unpaid leave," he added.</P>
      <P>As of Jan. 16, some 200,300 workers across Taiwan were being asked to take
unpaid leave days, with those in high-tech sector most likely to fall victim to
this practice.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of workers on full or partial unpaid leave in the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park in northern Taiwan has reached over 10,000
accounting for 77 percent of the park's total work force.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports -- most of which are high-tech products -- declined due to
falling demand from key markets such as China, the United States and Europe in
the current global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Since the end of last year, many Taiwanese companies have asking their workers
to take unpaid leave or face layoff, as a means of reducing operating costs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou expressed his hope Tuesday that the U.S. government will
offer Taiwanese citizens visa-free treatment, saying such treatment from Japan
has helped boost passenger traffic between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Ma made the request during his meeting at the Presidential Office with visiting
U.S. Representative Shelley Berkley (D-Nevada), who is also the co-chair of the
Congressional Taiwan Caucus.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that the United Kingdom recently announced it would grant Taiwan
passport holders visa-free access and said Japan launched the measure for Taiwan
in 2005.</P>
      <P>The preferential treatment encourages local tourists to travel to the countries,
Ma said, with Taiwanese visitors to Japan growing to one-sixth of all foreign
visitors to the country after the visa exemption for Taiwanese travelers began.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the number of Japanese visitors to Taiwan has grown to over
one-fourth of all foreign visitors to Taiwan, which Ma also attributed to visa-
free access.</P>
      <P>According to Bureau of Tourism statistics,  the number of travelers between
Taiwan and Japan hit a record high in 2007, with nearly 1.17 million Japanese
visiting Taiwan and 1.28 million Taiwanese visiting Japan.</P>
      <P>Berkley arrived in Taiwan Sunday for a five-day visit at the invitation of
Taipei County-based Fu Jen Catholic University. She is scheduled to leave Feb.

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese director to shoot remaining scenes of 'Visages' in Taipei</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Renowed Taiwanese film director Tsai Ming-liang said Tuesday that he and his
crew are ready to shoot the remaining scenes of his latest film "Visages" in
Taipei after spending four months working on the French-Taiwanese production in
Paris.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by French actress Fanny Ardant and other members of the cast, Tsai
said at a press conference in Taipei that he felt very proud and happy that a
Taiwanese work would be chosen to feature the Louvre Museum in Paris, and that
he has done his best to show that cultural value can be preserved in a movie.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that while the film might prove controversial, he was sure that this
Taiwanese production, with French assistance, would redefine art and show that
movies are also a type of culture.</P>
      <P>"I have experienced a lot of pressure in Paris as I have continuously reminded
myself that 'Visages' might be compared to the construction of the Louvre
Pyramid by I.M. Pei in 1983, which is now a Paris landmark," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The key, however, to the creation of any unique and original work is the "return
to innocence," Tsai said. "I had to make myself into a child again in order to
let my imagination flow freely," he admitted.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he was excited and anxious to shoot the rest of the film in Taipei,
because "it is a great opportunity to promote Taipei City to worldwide movie
viewers through filmmaking."</P>
      <P>Expressing thanks to the Taipei City government's support and assistance, Tsai
said that he is grateful that many city government officials worked hard to get
the 500 tons of water needed for a vital scene of the film.</P>
      <P>The film will include many elements of Taiwan's modern and ancient culture, such
as the way Taiwanese people dump their trash, hold funerals and build houses,
which Tsai says are unique compared to other cultures in the world.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, when asked about her experience working with Tsai, Ardant said she
has communicated with the director through an interpreter, but noted that both
of them could understand what each other wanted through facial expressions after
working together for a while.</P>
      <P>"Although I don't understand Chinese, the tone of the language is beautiful and
sounds as if people are singing to me, " Ardant said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ardant said that it is great to be part of a film that can connect
two cities of the world that are so different.</P>
      <P>"I usually don't like traveling or going to places as a tourist, but I am very
happy to have a chance to visit Taiwan and work on the film with Tsai," she
said.</P>
      <P>The movie, a tribute to French New Wave cinema, will be a film within a film. It
tells the story of a Chinese filmmaker who heads to the Louvre to shoot a film
that revolves around the myth of Salome and her request to her father Herod that
St. John the Baptist be beheaded.</P>
      <P>Financed by NT$200 million (US$5.78) in investment from Taiwan, France, the
Netherlands and Belgium, the production has already been tapped as a possible
hit at next year's Cannes International Film Festival.</P>

      <P>There were about 150 such calls to the center in January, up 36.3 percent
compared to the 110 calls recorded for the same month last year, LifeLine
Hualien Center chief Chiu You said.</P>
      <P>Around one-third of the 150 telephone calls were made by people who had lost
their jobs.</P>
      <P>Chiu said that judging from the phone calls, it was easy to grasp the
seriousness of the recent spate of layoffs. Most of those seeking help were
unemployed workers aged between 40-50, with some 50 percent of those asking for
help mentioning their intention to commit suicide.</P>
      <P>The center received over 60 calls during the week-long Lunar New Year holidays
in late January, with a majority related to problems arising from joblessness,
such as poor relations between husbands and wives and between children and
parents.</P>
      <P>Last year, 60.3 percent of the calls for help to the center were made by women,
and 39.7 percent by men, with the 40-49 age group accounting for the largest
share of 28.6 percent, center statistics showed. Those aged between 30 and 39
accounted for 19.1 percent of the calls.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Tuesday it would be difficult
to arrange the exchange of an American suspect recently apprehended in Taipei
for Taiwanese fugitives living in the U.S. because the two countries do not have
a mutual extradition agreement.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen was responding to an opinion piece by Loh I-cheng,
Taiwan's former ambassador to South Africa,  who suggested that an American
fugitive recently apprehended in Taiwan could be used as a bargaining chip to
get the U.S. to extradite individuals living there who are wanted by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Loh was referring to Wang You-theng, who allegedly embezzled billions of Taiwan
dollars from his Rebar Asia Pacific Group, and Huang Fang-yen, the former deputy
head of the Shin Kong Memorial Hospital.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors  want to question  Huang as a witness in the investigation into
corruption and money-laundering allegations againt former President Chen Shui-
bian and his wife.</P>
      <P>Chen said that it would not be easy to negotiate such a deal due to the lack of
an extradition treaty between Taiwan and the U.S. He pointed out, however, that
the signing of such an agreement is a top priority of President Ma Ying-jeou's
administration.</P>
      <P>Ma has successfully rebuilt mutual trust between Taiwan and the U.S.  since
assuming  office  last May,  Chen said,  and the administration is now also
focusing its efforts on getting Taiwan into the American visa waiver program and
signing a free trade agreement with the U.S.</P>
      <P>The fugitive Loh was referring to has been identified as Mark Lee Kaczmarczyk,
who fled the U.S. to escape child molestation charges.</P>
      <P>Kaczmarczyk, who is being held at the Sanhsia Alien Detention Center, was nabbed
in Taipei by Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) Sunday after the CIB
was contacted by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for help in
locating the suspect.</P>
      <P>According to the CIB, Kaczmarczyk was wanted in California for allegedly
molesting six children at a daycare center that he operated and could face a
jail term of 48 years.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of an extradition treaty between the two countries,
Kaczmarczyk is likely to be repatriated to the U.S. if he is not found to have
committed any crimes while in Taiwan, the CIB said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Penghu County government plans to hold 37 explanatory forums in the county's
neighborhoods to enlist support for its plan to allow casinos to be set up on
the Taiwan-held island group, but anti-gambling activists have turned seven of
the first 10 sessions into boisterous debates.</P>
      <P>Members of the Taiwan Anti-Gambling Alliance complained that they were not
invited to the first three explanatory forums. They insisted that they had the
right to attend all the remaining sessions to be held in each and every village
in the lead-up to a county-wide referendum on whether casinos should be allowed
in the county.</P>
      <P>Lin Chang-hsing, a convener of the alliance, criticized the county government
for painting a rosy picture of the proposed casino operations while ignoring
their potential negative effects, including moral depravity, deterioration of
social order, and the majority of economic benefits being reaped by foreign
financial groups.</P>
      <P>"The residents of Penghu should be allowed to hear both pros and cons of the
issue. Their right to know should not be affected," he said.</P>
      <P>Lin vowed that members of the alliance will attend each of the remaining
information forums to present their opposing view.</P>
      <P>"We surely will follow the county government officials and their invited experts
like a shadow," he said.</P>
      <P>County government officials contend, however, that the opening of casinos would
create thousands of jobs and greater social welfare for local residents, bring
more tourists to the island chain and generate more benefits for the local
economy.</P>
      <P>The county's Tourism Bureau officials, in charge of presenting the county's
case, said they would be undermining the county government's position if they
maintained a neutral stand or promoted the negative side of casino operations at
the forums.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved on Jan. 12 an amendment to the Offshore Islands
Development Act, legalizing the operation of casinos on Taiwan's outlying
islands, but requiring that a referendum be held to obtain the approval of local
residents before casinos are built.</P>
      <P>The Penghu County government is likely to hold a referendum on the casino issue
by the end of this year. It will need the support of more than half of the
voters participating in the referendum to give its plan the green light.</P>
      <P>The county government held a county-wide referendum in 2003 on whether casinos
should be allowed in Penghu, and only 13,814 residents, or 21 percent, of those
eligible to vote actually did so. Of those who cast their votes, 12 percent
favored the plan, while 9 percent opposed it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Czech Gems' exhibition opens in Taipei</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 17 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Taiwan Museum (NTM) launched the "Czech Gems" exhibition Tuesday,
and invited art lovers to experience the outstanding achievements, modern art
and beauty of the Baroque architecture of the Czech Republic.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening ceremony, Chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Cultural Affairs (CCA) Huang Pi-twan said that "Czech Gems, " which was jointly
planned by the Czech Economic and Cultural Office (CECO) and NTM,  allows a
deeper understanding of the multi-faceted value and vitality of the Czech
culture.</P>
      <P>Located in central Europe, the Czech Republic dates back to an ancient
civilization, and its long history and rich culture have given birth to fine
literature, art, craft and architecture that are admired all over the world, she
said.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which will run through April 5,  includes technology, music,
design, modern art, sports and scenery of the Czech Republic, from ancient to
modern times, she added.</P>
      <P>The CECO Representative Jaroslav Dolecek said at the ceremony that the word
"gem" does not just mean a precious stone that has been cut and polished, as it
also denotes something that is prized, especially for great beauty or
perfection, or someone who is in some way outstanding and unique.</P>
      <P>"One can find such gems in every country in the world, including Taiwan," said
Dolecek.</P>
      <P>"The Czech Gems exhibition will take you on a remarkable journey through the
history of the Czech Republic up to the present day, and will provide a window
on a place that for some will be a distant and little-known country somewhere in
Europe, " the representative said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Dolecek said that the exhibition will offer the Taiwanese public
with a great opportunity to get acquainted with the achievements, famous
personalities, world-renowned inventions, the breathtakingly beautiful
architecture and refreshing modern art of the Czech Republic.</P>
      <P>"I am confident that there is something for everyone in the exhibition,
something that you will find interesting, surprising or admirable, and which
will bring you joy, expand your knowledge, and leave you with a positive
impression of my country and its people, " said Dolecek.</P>
      <P>According to the NTM, the "Czech Gems" exhibition will also be presented at the
National Tainan Living Art Center from April 8 to June 14, the Cultural Affairs
Bureau of Kaohsiung County Government from June 27 to July 26, the Taichung
County Seaport Art Center from Aug. 8 to Sep. 6, and the National Taitung Living
Art Center from Sep. 19 to Oct. 30.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the CCA in recent years has been cooperating with the
Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic to promote an international cultural
exchange plan.</P>
      <P>"In 2005, the NTM created a special exhibition 'A Thousand Faces of Formosa- the
Nature and Tradition of Taiwan' in the Czech Republic's National Museum," said
Huang.</P>
      <P>This was achieved on the basis of an exchange agreement between the CCA and the
Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic, she added.</P>
      <P>Moreover, in 2007, the NTM invited the Czech Republic's National Museum to bring
the "Traditional Czech Puppets" exhibition to Taiwan, which gave the people of
Taiwan a chance to appreciate one of the Czech Republic's most important
traditional art forms, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"After several years of interaction and exchange, the cooperation between Taiwan
and the Czech Republic with respect to exhibitions and cultural  heritage
preservation  has strengthened  the cultural ties between the two countries,"
she noted.</P>

      <P>Chou Kung-hsin, the director of Taiwan's National Palace Museum (NPM) said
Tuesday that her visit to Shanghai is "purely for academic exchanges with the
Shanghai Museum" to see what collections the museums could borrow from each
other and display in their respective cities.</P>
      <P>Chou, peppered by questions from Taiwanese reporters after arriving in Shanghai
from Beijing, also denied reports that the Shanghai Museum wants to borrow from
the NPM an 18th-century painting, titled "Along the River During the Qingming
Festival, " for the World Expo Shanghai 2010.</P>
      <P>Shanghai Museum Director Chen Xiejun stressed it has no plans to borrow the
renowned painting created by Qing Dynasty court painters as a remake of the
original version generally attributed to Song Dynasty artist Zhang Zeduan
(1085-1145).</P>
      <P>Zhang's painting, kept at Beijing's Palace Museum, depicts how people living
during the Song period in Bianjing -- today known as Kaifeng  in Henan Province
--  celebrated  the Qingming,  or Tomb-sweeping, Festival.</P>
      <P>Chou had no official activities in Shanghai Tuesday, and was scheduled to visit
the Shanghai Museum the following day.</P>
      <P>Chou arrived in Beijing last Saturday for a landmark visit and met with her
counterpart at Beijing's Palace Museum, Zheng Xinmiao, on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The meeting was the first formal engagement between curators of the two museums
since much of the Beijing museum's collection was removed by the Kuomintang and
hidden around China before being sent to Taiwan some 60 years ago.</P>

      <P>Taiwan won a total of 30 medals -- six golds, 12 silvers and 12 bronzes -- in
the week-long 2009 Special Olympics World Winter Games that concluded recently
in the United States, according to the Sports Affairs Council (SAC) Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The 36 young athletes that represented Taiwan won medals in all four events in
which they participated -- speed skating, figure skating, snowshoeing and floor
hockey, the SAC said.</P>
      <P>According to the council, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden attended the Idaho games
and presented awards to the Taiwanese medalist in the figure skating event. A
photograph of the presentation made the front page of the biggest local
newspaper, "Boise Statesman," that day, the SAC said.</P>
      <P>Upon their return to Taiwan Tuesday, the 59-member delegation, which
participated in the event under the name "Chinese Taipei," was received by
President Ma Ying-jeou, the SAC added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan won 20 gold medals, 13 silvers and 10 bronzes in the 2005 Special
Olympics in the Japanese city of Nagano, the SAC recalled.</P>
      <P>At this year's games, held from Feb. 7-13, the other events included alpine
skiing, cross-country skiing and snowboarding.</P>
      <P>Like the Olympic Games, the Special Olympics are held every four years in summer

      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu promised during a visit to a local nursery school
Tuesday to extend more aid to social welfare  groups  to help them cope with
financial  shortfalls exacerbated by the global economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>Hu pledged that he will not sit idly by at a time when many social welfare
foundations,  particularly those taking care of children and the elderly, have
been hit hard by financial problems as private donations to charities have
shrunk since late last year.</P>
      <P>According to the mayor, he has twice reported to President Ma Ying-jeou and once
to first lady Chow Mei-ching about the seriousness of the problem, in the hope
that the government could offer greater financial assistance to these social
welfare organizations.</P>
      <P>The mayor made the remarks while on a visit to the Daniel A. Poling Memorial
Babies' Home -- his second visit to the nursery school in a month. He had called
on the facility shortly before the Lunar New Year in late January.</P>
      <P>The nursery school now raises 96 children, included seven babies recently
deserted by their parents.</P>
      <P>When Hu arrived at the nursery school, a 20-year-old multiple- handicapped man
presented a painting featuring Hu and his wife to the mayor. The painting was

      <P>Lai, heading a special delegation, will leave for the Caribbean country
Wednesday. During his stay there, he will visit King and inspect a hospital for

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese director to shoot remaining scenes of 'Visages' in Taipei</HEADLINE>

      <P>Renowed Taiwanese film director Tsai Ming-liang said Tuesday that he and his
crew are ready to shoot the remaining scenes of his latest film "Visages" in
Taipei after spending four months working on the French-Taiwanese production in
Paris.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by French actress Fanny Ardant and other members of the cast, Tsai
said at a press conference in Taipei that he felt very proud and happy that a
Taiwanese work would be chosen to feature the Louvre Museum in Paris, and that
he has done his best to show that cultural value can be preserved in a movie.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that while the film might prove controversial, he was sure that this
Taiwanese production, with French assistance, would redefine art and show that
movies are also a type of culture.</P>
      <P>"I have experienced a lot of pressure in Paris as I have continuously reminded
myself that 'Visages' might be compared to the construction of the Louvre
Pyramid by I.M. Pei in 1983, which is now a Paris landmark," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The key, however, to the creation of any unique and original work is the "return
to innocence," Tsai said. "I had to make myself into a child again in order to
let my imagination flow freely," he admitted.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he was excited and anxious to shoot the rest of the film in Taipei,
because "it is a great opportunity to promote Taipei City to worldwide movie
viewers through filmmaking."</P>
      <P>Expressing thanks to the Taipei City government's support and assistance, Tsai
said that he is grateful that many city government officials worked hard to get
the 500 tons of water needed for a vital scene of the film.</P>
      <P>The film will include many elements of Taiwan's modern and ancient culture, such
as the way Taiwanese people dump their trash, hold funerals and build houses,
which Tsai says are unique compared to other cultures in the world.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, when asked about her experience working with Tsai, Ardant said she
has communicated with the director through an interpreter, but noted that both
of them could understand what each other wanted through facial expressions after
working together for a while.</P>
      <P>"Although I don't understand Chinese, the tone of the language is beautiful and
sounds as if people are singing to me, " Ardant said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ardant said that it is great to be part of a film that can connect
two cities of the world that are so different.</P>
      <P>"I usually don't like traveling or going to places as a tourist, but I am very
happy to have a chance to visit Taiwan and work on the film with Tsai," she
said.</P>
      <P>The movie, a tribute to French New Wave cinema, will be a film within a film. It
tells the story of a Chinese filmmaker who heads to the Louvre to shoot a film
that revolves around the myth of Salome and her request to her father Herod that
St. John the Baptist be beheaded.</P>
      <P>Financed by NT$200 million (US$5.78) in investment from Taiwan, France, the
Netherlands and Belgium, the production has already been tapped as a possible
hit at next year's Cannes International Film Festival.</P>

in Taipei to search for a solution to fishing rights issues in disputed  waters,
Tsai Ming-yao, secretary-general of the quasi-official Association of East Asian
Relations (AEAR), said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The meeting will be held in Taipei soon, and more details will be made public
in the coming days, " Tsai told a news briefing at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>"Taiwan hopes to forge a consensus with Japan on settling bilateral fishery
disputes and work out a joint management mechanism in disputed overlapping
waters by putting aside the sovereignty controversy surrounding the Tiaoyutai
Islands in the East China Sea," he said.</P>
      <P>The Japanese call the Tiaoyutais the Senkaku Islands.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Tokyo have held 15 rounds of fisheries talks since 1996, with the
last round occurring in July 2005 in Tokyo, but sharp differences remain between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>The association was set up under the MOFA in 1972 to handle affairs relating to
Japan after Tokyo switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing that

      <P>The number of people in Hualien County seeking counseling over the telephone
increased by close to 40 percent in January this year, the county's lifeline
center said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>There were about 150 such calls to the center in January, up 36.3 percent
compared to the 110 calls recorded for the same month last year, LifeLine
Hualien Center chief Chiu You said.</P>
      <P>Around one-third of the 150 telephone calls were made by people who had lost
their jobs.</P>
      <P>Chiu said that judging from the phone calls, it was easy to grasp the
seriousness of the recent spate of layoffs. Most of those seeking help were
unemployed workers aged between 40-50, with some 50 percent of those asking for
help mentioning their intention to commit suicide.</P>
      <P>The center received over 60 calls during the week-long Lunar New Year holidays
in late January, with a majority related to problems arising from joblessness,
such as poor relations between husbands and wives and between children and
parents.</P>
      <P>Last year, 60.3 percent of the calls for help to the center were made by women,
and 39.7 percent by men, with the 40-49 age group accounting for the largest
share of 28.6 percent, center statistics showed. Those aged between 30 and 39
accounted for 19.1 percent of the calls.</P>
      <P>A vast majority of 79 percent of last year's calls for help did not indicate any
intention to commit suicide -- a big departure from the latest trend, center
officials said.</P>

      <P>A delegation of U.S. legislative assistants paid a visit Tuesday to the Taiwan
Root Medical Peace Corps (TRMPC) in recognition of the non-governmental
organization's humanitarian relief efforts.</P>
      <P>Led by William Pewen,  a senior health policy advisor to Republican Senator
Olympia Snowe of Maine, the 13-member delegation headed to the TRMPC office in
Xindian, Taipei County to gain a better understanding of the organization's
work. The TRMPC is dedicated to improving the quality of life through the
provision of medical services in aboriginal tribal areas in Taiwan and remote
regions in foreign countries.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a briefing, Huang Chen-wu, a TRMPC volunteer in charge of
international affairs, said that the organization has held some 190 free clinics
in Taiwan and in 40 countries around the world over the past 14 years. It has
provided post-war aid in Kosovo, given medical treatment to victims of the South
Asia tsunami and the Indonesia earthquake, and offered humanitarian assistance
in the poorest areas of the world, Huang added.</P>
      <P>The TRMPC is the first and only non-governmental organization from Taiwan to
obtain a seat in the Conference of Non- Governmental Organizations in
Consultative Relationship with the United Nations, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Several of the visiting U.S. delegates expressed concern over the health of
Taiwan's aboriginal people and their migration to urban areas.</P>
      <P>Micheleen Crowell, an aide to Democratic Congressman John Lewis, also asked
about the effects of the current economic recession on the TRMPC's operations

medical aid overseas.</P>
      <P>Citing a recent mission to Kenya as an example, TRMPC President Liu Chi-chun
said every volunteer worker paid NT$75,000 (US$2,167) for the trip during the

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Tuesday it would be difficult
to arrange the exchange of an American suspect recently apprehended in Taipei
for Taiwanese fugitives living in the U.S. because the two countries do not have
a mutual extradition agreement.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen was responding to an opinion piece by Loh I-cheng,
Taiwan's former ambassador to South Africa,  who suggested that an American
fugitive recently apprehended in Taiwan could be used as a bargaining chip to
get the U.S. to extradite individuals living there who are wanted by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Loh was referring to Wang You-theng, who allegedly embezzled billions of Taiwan
dollars from his Rebar Asia Pacific Group, and Huang Fang-yen, the former deputy
head of the Shin Kong Memorial Hospital.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors  want to question  Huang as a witness in the investigation into
corruption and money-laundering allegations againt former President Chen Shui-
bian and his wife.</P>
      <P>Chen said that it would not be easy to negotiate such a deal due to the lack of
an extradition treaty between Taiwan and the U.S. He pointed out, however, that
the signing of such an agreement is a top priority of President Ma Ying-jeou's
administration.</P>
      <P>Ma has successfully rebuilt mutual trust between Taiwan and the U.S.  since
assuming  office  last May,  Chen said,  and the administration is now also
focusing its efforts on getting Taiwan into the American visa waiver program and
signing a free trade agreement with the U.S.</P>
      <P>The fugitive Loh was referring to has been identified as Mark Lee Kaczmarczyk,
who fled the U.S. to escape child molestation charges.</P>
      <P>Kaczmarczyk, who is being held at the Sanhsia Alien Detention Center, was nabbed
in Taipei by Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) Sunday after the CIB
was contacted by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for help in
locating the suspect.</P>
      <P>According to the CIB, Kaczmarczyk was wanted in California for allegedly
molesting six children at a daycare center that he operated and could face a
jail term of 48 years.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of an extradition treaty between the two countries,
Kaczmarczyk is likely to be repatriated to the U.S. if he is not found to have
committed any crimes while in Taiwan, the CIB said.</P>

in the county.</P>
      <P>Lin Chang-hsing, a convener of the alliance, criticized the county government
for painting a rosy picture of the proposed casino operations while ignoring
their potential negative effects, including moral depravity, deterioration of
social order, and the majority of economic benefits being reaped by foreign
financial groups.</P>
      <P>"The residents of Penghu should be allowed to hear both pros and cons of the
issue. Their right to know should not be affected," he said.</P>
      <P>Lin vowed that members of the alliance will attend each of the remaining
information forums to present their opposing view.</P>
      <P>"We surely will follow the county government officials and their invited experts
like a shadow," he said.</P>
      <P>County government officials contend, however, that the opening of casinos would
create thousands of jobs and greater social welfare for local residents, bring
more tourists to the island chain and generate more benefits for the local
economy.</P>
      <P>The county's Tourism Bureau officials, in charge of presenting the county's
case, said they would be undermining the county government's position if they
maintained a neutral stand or promoted the negative side of casino operations at
the forums.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved on Jan. 12 an amendment to the Offshore Islands
Development Act, legalizing the operation of casinos on Taiwan's outlying
islands, but requiring that a referendum be held to obtain the approval of local
residents before casinos are built.</P>
      <P>The Penghu County government is likely to hold a referendum on the casino issue
by the end of this year. It will need the support of more than half of the
voters participating in the referendum to give its plan the green light.</P>
      <P>The county government held a county-wide referendum in 2003 on whether casinos
should be allowed in Penghu, and only 13,814 residents, or 21 percent, of those
eligible to vote actually did so. Of those who cast their votes, 12 percent
favored the plan, while 9 percent opposed it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Czech Gems' exhibition opens in Taipei</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 17 (CNA)
02/17/09  21:24:32
(By Luis Yu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Taiwan Museum (NTM) launched the "Czech Gems" exhibition Tuesday,
and invited art lovers to experience the outstanding achievements, modern art
and beauty of the Baroque architecture of the Czech Republic.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening ceremony, Chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Cultural Affairs (CCA) Huang Pi-twan said that "Czech Gems, " which was jointly
planned by the Czech Economic and Cultural Office (CECO) and NTM,  allows a
deeper understanding of the multi-faceted value and vitality of the Czech
culture.</P>
      <P>Located in central Europe, the Czech Republic dates back to an ancient
civilization, and its long history and rich culture have given birth to fine
literature, art, craft and architecture that are admired all over the world, she
said.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which will run through April 5,  includes technology, music,
design, modern art, sports and scenery of the Czech Republic, from ancient to
modern times, she added.</P>
      <P>The CECO Representative Jaroslav Dolecek said at the ceremony that the word
"gem" does not just mean a precious stone that has been cut and polished, as it
also denotes something that is prized, especially for great beauty or
perfection, or someone who is in some way outstanding and unique.</P>
      <P>"One can find such gems in every country in the world, including Taiwan," said
Dolecek.</P>
      <P>"The Czech Gems exhibition will take you on a remarkable journey through the
history of the Czech Republic up to the present day, and will provide a window
on a place that for some will be a distant and little-known country somewhere in
Europe, " the representative said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Dolecek said that the exhibition will offer the Taiwanese public
with a great opportunity to get acquainted with the achievements, famous
personalities, world-renowned inventions, the breathtakingly beautiful
architecture and refreshing modern art of the Czech Republic.</P>
      <P>"I am confident that there is something for everyone in the exhibition,
something that you will find interesting, surprising or admirable, and which
will bring you joy, expand your knowledge, and leave you with a positive
impression of my country and its people, " said Dolecek.</P>
      <P>According to the NTM, the "Czech Gems" exhibition will also be presented at the
National Tainan Living Art Center from April 8 to June 14, the Cultural Affairs
Bureau of Kaohsiung County Government from June 27 to July 26, the Taichung
County Seaport Art Center from Aug. 8 to Sep. 6, and the National Taitung Living
Art Center from Sep. 19 to Oct. 30.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the CCA in recent years has been cooperating with the
Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic to promote an international cultural
exchange plan.</P>
      <P>"In 2005, the NTM created a special exhibition 'A Thousand Faces of Formosa- the
Nature and Tradition of Taiwan' in the Czech Republic's National Museum," said
Huang.</P>
      <P>This was achieved on the basis of an exchange agreement between the CCA and the
Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic, she added.</P>
      <P>Moreover, in 2007, the NTM invited the Czech Republic's National Museum to bring
the "Traditional Czech Puppets" exhibition to Taiwan, which gave the people of
Taiwan a chance to appreciate one of the Czech Republic's most important
traditional art forms, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"After several years of interaction and exchange, the cooperation between Taiwan
and the Czech Republic with respect to exhibitions and cultural  heritage
preservation  has strengthened  the cultural ties between the two countries,"
she noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chou Kung-hsin, the director of Taiwan's National Palace Museum (NPM) said
Tuesday that her visit to Shanghai is "purely for academic exchanges with the
Shanghai Museum" to see what collections the museums could borrow from each
other and display in their respective cities.</P>
      <P>Chou, peppered by questions from Taiwanese reporters after arriving in Shanghai
from Beijing, also denied reports that the Shanghai Museum wants to borrow from
the NPM an 18th-century painting, titled "Along the River During the Qingming
Festival, " for the World Expo Shanghai 2010.</P>
      <P>Shanghai Museum Director Chen Xiejun stressed it has no plans to borrow the
renowned painting created by Qing Dynasty court painters as a remake of the
original version generally attributed to Song Dynasty artist Zhang Zeduan
(1085-1145).</P>
      <P>Zhang's painting, kept at Beijing's Palace Museum, depicts how people living
during the Song period in Bianjing -- today known as Kaifeng  in Henan Province
--  celebrated  the Qingming,  or Tomb-sweeping, Festival.</P>
      <P>Chou had no official activities in Shanghai Tuesday, and was scheduled to visit
the Shanghai Museum the following day.</P>
      <P>Chou arrived in Beijing last Saturday for a landmark visit and met with her
counterpart at Beijing's Palace Museum, Zheng Xinmiao, on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The meeting was the first formal engagement between curators of the two museums
since much of the Beijing museum's collection was removed by the Kuomintang and
hidden around China before being sent to Taiwan some 60 years ago.</P>

      <P>Taiwan won a total of 30 medals -- six golds, 12 silvers and 12 bronzes -- in
the week-long 2009 Special Olympics World Winter Games that concluded recently
in the United States, according to the Sports Affairs Council (SAC) Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The 36 young athletes that represented Taiwan won medals in all four events in
which they participated -- speed skating, figure skating, snowshoeing and floor
hockey, the SAC said.</P>
      <P>According to the council, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden attended the Idaho games
and presented awards to the Taiwanese medalist in the figure skating event. A
photograph of the presentation made the front page of the biggest local
newspaper, "Boise Statesman," that day, the SAC said.</P>
      <P>Upon their return to Taiwan Tuesday, the 59-member delegation, which
participated in the event under the name "Chinese Taipei," was received by
President Ma Ying-jeou, the SAC added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan won 20 gold medals, 13 silvers and 10 bronzes in the 2005 Special
Olympics in the Japanese city of Nagano, the SAC recalled.</P>
      <P>At this year's games, held from Feb. 7-13, the other events included alpine
skiing, cross-country skiing and snowboarding.</P>
      <P>Like the Olympic Games, the Special Olympics are held every four years in summer
and winter. The first Special Olympics Summer Games were held in the U.S. city
of Chicago in 1968, while the first Winter Games were held in 1977 in Steamboat
Springs, also in the U.S.</P>

      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu promised during a visit to a local nursery school
Tuesday to extend more aid to social welfare  groups  to help them cope with
financial  shortfalls exacerbated by the global economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>Hu pledged that he will not sit idly by at a time when many social welfare
foundations,  particularly those taking care of children and the elderly, have
been hit hard by financial problems as private donations to charities have
shrunk since late last year.</P>
      <P>According to the mayor, he has twice reported to President Ma Ying-jeou and once
to first lady Chow Mei-ching about the seriousness of the problem, in the hope
that the government could offer greater financial assistance to these social
welfare organizations.</P>
      <P>The mayor made the remarks while on a visit to the Daniel A. Poling Memorial
Babies' Home -- his second visit to the nursery school in a month. He had called
on the facility shortly before the Lunar New Year in late January.</P>
      <P>The nursery school now raises 96 children, included seven babies recently
deserted by their parents.</P>
      <P>When Hu arrived at the nursery school, a 20-year-old multiple- handicapped man
presented a painting featuring Hu and his wife to the mayor. The painting was
done by the young man himself.</P>

Saint  Lucia's independence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday

      <P>Saint Lucian Prime Minister Stephenson King invited Ma to visit his country for
the celebration slated for Feb. 22. Ma, however, could not attend because of his

      <P>Lai, heading a special delegation, will leave for the Caribbean country
Wednesday. During his stay there, he will visit King and inspect a hospital for
mentally ill patients built with Taiwan's support.</P>
      <P>Taiwan resumed diplomatic relations with Saint Lucia on April 30, 2007, after

      <P>Hungarian electronic and print media outlets have widely reported a Formosan
butterfly exhibition that was opened at the vintage Hungarian Natural History
Museum in Budapest Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time since the museum's inception in 1802 that it has
exhibited a large number of live insects, according to an official with the
Taiwanese information division located in Budapest.</P>
      <P>A total of 800 butterflies of various species are expected to emerge from their
cocoons at the museum over the next 72 days until April 30, the last day of the
exhibition, the official said.</P>
      <P>Museum authorities anticipate that the display will draw at least 20,000
visitors over the next two months.</P>
      <P>The Hungarian Natural History Museum has maintained  close academic and
ecological ties with Taiwan's museums and research institutions, including the
National Taiwan Museum, the National Taiwan Museum of Natural Science, the
Taiwan Forestry Research Institute and the Zoology Department of National Taiwan
University.</P>
      <P>The museum's researchers have visited Taiwan 23 times over the last 12 years for
biological  research or academic exchanges, according to the Taiwan official.</P>
      <P>A similar Formosan butterfly exhibition was opened in Sweden's capital Stockholm
earlier this month, also attracting large crowds. That exhibition is scheduled
to run until the end of March, the official said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Travelers to China urged to get measles vaccines for their infants</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 18 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on Wednesday reminded people planning to
travel to China with infants to make sure to have their children immunized
against the measles prior to departure,  following  recent reports of measles
infections traceable to China.</P>
      <P>The most recent case involves a five-year-old boy from northern Taiwan, who came
down with a fever and rashes early this month soon after returning from a trip
to southern Taiwan during the Chinese New Year holiday, said CDC Deputy
Director-General Chou Chih-hao.</P>
      <P>An investigation found that the boy was hospitalized for other ailments for four
days during his stay in southern Taiwan, sharing a room with an 11-month-old
girl who was infected with the measles. He contracted the measles virus from the
girl, Chou said.</P>
      <P>The girl, whose mother is a Chinese citizen, fell ill soon after returning from
a trip to China in mid-January. She had not received the measles-mumps-rubella
(MMR) vaccine, Chou said.</P>
      <P>The boy, whose mother is also a Chinese citizen, had also never received the MMR
vaccine, although he was given one dose of the measles vaccine in China when he
was nine months old, he said.</P>
      <P>The case follows another one reported late last year, in which a cluster of
seven measles infections was traced to a 20-month-old boy from Kaohsiung who
contracted the disease in China, according to Chou.</P>
      <P>Noting that the number of measles cases reported in China has been on the rise
over the past three years, Chou urged parents not to take children who have not
received the MMR vaccine to China.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, children are normally given a first dose of the MMR vaccine when they
are between 12-15 months old and a booster shot during their first year of
elementary school.</P>
      <P>In light of the high virulence of the measles virus, the CDC advised parents not
to skip the MMR inoculation for their children, including those who have
received the measles vaccine before reaching one year old.</P>

has chosen to transfer to a less known high school in Taoyuan County to help his

      <P>Lin Tse-yu transferred to the private Chi-Ying Senior High School in Taoyuan
earlier this month for the spring semester of his first year of study to take
advantage of generous scholarships awarded by the high school to attract elite
students.</P>
      <P>Lin, who posted one of the highest scores on the high-school entrance
examination, wrote two letters to Chi-Ying administrators during the winter
break expressing his intention to transfer to the high school because the
scholarship would help his parents, who have suffered  financially  because of
their slumping beauty parlor business.</P>
      <P>Chi Ying accepted Lin and decided to award him a scholarship for NT$1.66 million
(US$48,823) over the next two-and-a-half years before he graduates, far beyond
the actual fees and expenses he would have had to pay as a student there or at

    <HEADLINE>CECA will not be signed during third SEF-ARATS talks: SEF head</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China will not sign a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement
(CECA) during their planned third round of negotiations, the head of Taiwan's
Straits Exchange Foundation said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung told reporters at an economic cooperation forum in
Taipei that the SEF and the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) will not ink a CECA, as preparations for negotiations
with China concerning the issue have not yet concluded.</P>
      <P>"The government has decided to sign a CECA with China at some point in the
future, but it won't be during the third round of negotiations between the SEF
and the ARATS," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, forging a CECA with China is vital for the normalization of
trade and economic ties between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>However, the signing of the complex agreement covering a wide range of issues
requires discussions among relevant agencies of the two sides before it can be
included as an issue on the agenda of future SEF-ARATS talks, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chiang explained that the content and principles of a CECA and a free
trade agreement are basically the same and the signing of a CECA between Taiwan
and China will be consistent with the World Trade Organization's most favored
nation status (MFN) principles.</P>
      <P>"Despite many political difficulties, Taiwan needs to sign a CECA with China as
soon as possible, " said Chiang, who contended that Taiwan's economy, industrial
sector and export markets will be deeply impacted if it is excluded from the
alliances between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and three
major East Asian economies -- China, South Korea and Japan.</P>
      <P>Chiang warned that Taiwan will be marginalized once ASEAN members and South
Korea finish signing FTAs or other forms of economic cooperation agreements with
China.</P>
      <P>Bilateral and multilateral economic cooperation and integration is an
unstoppable trend in today's world economy, Chiang said, noting that there are
already more than 250 FTAs registered under the WTO.</P>
      <P>Chiang said, however, that "the majority of nations that have signed FTAs with
Taiwan are from Latin America, and represents no more than 0.2 percent of
Taiwan's overall export volume."</P>
      <P>The signing of the CECA with China would prevent Taiwan from being marginalized
in the international arena and would also allow the free flow of merchandise,
services, and capital between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, he argued.</P>
      <P>The SEF and the ARATS are quasi-official organizations designated by each side
of the Taiwan Strait to handle cross-strait matters in the absence of official
ties.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Association of University Professors (TAUP) will commerorate the 228
Incident on Feb. 28 by sitting in silence, said TAUP Chairman Chen Yi-sheng
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference held in Taipei, Chen urged all Taiwanese
citizens, regardless of their political leaning,  to participate in the
activity.</P>
      <P>"We hope to reveal the historical truth of the massacre that occured some 62
years ago in a peaceful manner, " said Chen, adding that the 228 Incident was a
historical tragedy that has affected all of society.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, during the "Never Forget the 228 Incident" event to be held
at the National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei, 1,246 participants will
sit on the ground and spell out the Chinese characters for "never forget 228."</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said the activity will remain calm and peaceful as there will
be no speeches or slogans.</P>
      <P>"We will only play a pre-recorded tape of the events that happened during the
228 massacre," said Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen said the historical truth of the 228 Incident has been clouded by the
ongoing political  conflict between the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , adding that politicians from
both parties have used the incident for electoral purposes.</P>
      <P>"The truth has been distorted as both parties have exploited the incident come
election time," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Asked if the vast majority of individuals and organizations that hope to uncover
the truth of the 228 Incident are supporters of the pro-independence DPP, Chen
said that the TAUP will reflect on the issue.</P>
      <P>"Despite past stereotypes,  we welcome with open arms all Taiwanese citizens who
wish to participate in this event, because the 228 Incident is a historical
tragedy that has shaken the lives of all Taiwanese  citizens regardless  of
their ancestry or political leaning," noted Chen.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident was an anti-government uprising in Taiwan that began Feb. 28,
1947 and was violently suppressed by the KMT government.</P>
      <P>An estimated 10,000 to 30,000 people were killed during the Incident and in

      <P>Tourism operators asked Yilan County Magistrate Lu Guo-hua Wednesday to extend
the ongoing 2009 Taiwan Lantern Festival in Yilan City, northeastern Taiwan,
which is scheduled to end Feb. 22.</P>
      <P>Chang Ching-lai, an executive member of the Taiwan Leisure Farming Development
Association, along with several representatives of recreational farming and
lodging businesses, paid a call on Lu at the county hall earlier in the day and
requested the extension, saying that the event has been drawing many visitors
and trade opportunities.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that Yilan's tourism usually drops to a "super-low" season after the
Lunar New Year festival. However, he said, thanks to the Taiwan Lantern
Festival, which was held in Yilan this year for the first time in history, the
occupancy rate at his hotel has increased five fold compared with the same
period last year.</P>
      <P>He added that the 10-plus foreign tour groups from Hong Kong and Singapore
staying at his hotel have all listed the lantern festival, which began Feb. 9,
as a must see.</P>
      <P>"Several foreign tourists have even said they wished their tour schedule allowed
them more hours at the festival, " Chang said.</P>
      <P>In response to the request, Lu said that an extension of the festival would
involve negotiating the many contracts that the organizers signed with
performing groups. However, if this issue can be worked out and the MOTC agrees
to the proposal, then he would be delighted to see the event prolonged, the
county magistrate said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Lantern Festival, jointly organized by the Bureau of Tourism under
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) and the Yilan County
government, has attracted tens of thousands of visitors every day since it
opened.</P>
      <P>Because of the large number of people traveling to Yilan City for the festival,
most of the major roads between the city and the surrounding townships have been
frequently congested, with the worst traffic conditions occurring over the last
two weekends.</P>
      <P>The Toucheng toll station on the Taipei-Yilan Freeway recorded some 74,000
vehicles on the highway on Valentine's Day Feb. 14.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China Steel Corp., Taiwan's largest steel maker, confirmed Wednesday that it is
likely to post an operating loss in the first quarter of the year, mainly
because of retroactive discounts to customers.</P>
      <P>Chung Lo-min, executive vice president of China Steel, said that as a result of
retroactive discounts totaling NT$4 billion (US$115.2 million) in the first
quarter, China Steel will likely register a decline in revenues for the January
to March period.</P>
      <P>If Chung's forecast is accurate, it will be the second quarterly loss in a row
for the steel maker, which is 23 percent owned by the government.</P>
      <P>China Steel suffered its first quarterly loss in its nearly 40-year history in
the fourth quarter of 2008, reporting a loss of NT$18.62 billion, which reduced
its income for that year to NT$30.2 billion, down 50 percent from 2007.</P>
      <P>In late November it decided to lower the prices of its steel products by an
average of 22.56 percent, or an average of NT$7,058 per metric ton, for the
first quarter of 2009 to help relieve the plight of mid- and downstream steel
factories in Taiwan suffering from the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, China Steel announced a further average price reduction of 14.03

      <P>The government will not only help exports but will also continue its efforts to
expand domestic demand to help revive the slumping economy, the nation's top
economic planner said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Rising unemployment is also a major government concern, " said Chen Tien-jy,
chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), at a
gathering of entrepreneurs.</P>
      <P>The jobless rate hit 5.03 percent in December and is generally expected to rise
even further after the announcement of January's jobless rate later this month,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>On public calls for the government to issue a new round of shopping vouchers to
help stimulate consumption, Chen said the council will wait until September to
assess the results of the first round of the program.</P>
      <P>He noted that there is still a Dragon Boat Festival,  a traditional festival
which falls on June 27, that could spark a wave of spending between now and
September when the vouchers must be used.</P>
      <P>The government distributed around NT$85 billion in vouchers to spur consumption
on the island and boost Taiwan's ailing retail sector. Each citizen was given
NT$3,600 in vouchers.</P>
      <P>Chen said that if exports decline by 20 percent and imports also decline, it
will affect gross domestic product by around 2 percentage points.</P>
      <P>But Chen indicated that the major factor behind the local economy's contraction
in the fourth quarter was the 30 percent decline in private investment.</P>
      <P>Chen would not comment on the recent sharp depreciation of new Taiwan dollar,
which has helped exporters but hurt importers.</P>
      <P>The new Taiwan dollar closed at NT$34.650 to the U.S. dollar Wednesday. (By

    <TEXT>
      <P>A project to clear landmines in the Mashan area of the Taiwan-controlled island
of Kinmen off China's Fujian province is scheduled to begin March 2 and last for
four months, the Kinmen Defense Command reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Mashan demining operations will be carried out by the Singaporean Explomo
Technical Services Pte Ltd. over an area of 140,000 square meters in three
stages over a four-month period, the defense command said.</P>
      <P>Explomo, which won the demining contract in an open bid last year, will clear
landmines in six minefields in Kinmen covering 214,900 square meters during the
whole year, while the demining team of the Army Engineers Corps will clear 21
minefields over a total area of about 389,900 square meters, the command said.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference held at a borough office in Chinsha Township, an
Explomo project manager Huang Jou-li said that the first stage of the Mashan
demining operations will be highly dangerous because it involves mainly manual
jobs in shallow minefields mostly in the beachside casuarina woods.</P>
      <P>Traffic controls will be put in place around the Mashan area daily, during the
periods 5:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m., in the first month of
operations, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang also gave the assurance that Explomo operators will mark the graves in the
area and will not disturb them. Any human remains found in the demining process
will be collected and stored for interment in a shrine that will be built in
Kinmen later, he said.</P>
      <P>Last December, the Kinmen Defense Command gave an order for demining operations
over a 20-hectare area in Kuningtou village to be suspended, pending
consultations with the island's residents who had complained that the demining
work had destroyed nearly 1,000 graves of their ancestors.</P>
      <P>Kuningtou was the site of a 1949 battle in which Republic of China forces
defeated two invading regiments of China's People's Liberation Army.</P>
      <P>The shores of Kinmen -- Taiwan's farthest outpost in the military standoff with
China -- were carpeted with landmines during the peak hostilities between the
two sides in the 1950s.</P>
      <P>More than 70,000 mines were believed to have been left in more than 150
minefields on the island.</P>
      <P>In the 1950s and 1960s, many civilians were killed or maimed when they
accidentally stepped on the explosive devices.</P>
      <P>As cross-strait tensions eased, the government lifted the wartime regulations in
1992 and ended Kinmen's status as a combat zone.</P>
      <P>The move allowed the island to open up to tourism, prompting the need to clear
the landmines from areas no longer under military control.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Market forces will set Taiwan dollar's value: vice president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Wednesday that the local currency's value,
which has lost ground against the U.S. dollar in recent days, will be decided by
market forces.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's central bank has been closely monitoring the New Taiwan
dollar's exchange rate against the U.S. greenback, Siew said it is natural that
the local currency has lost ground against the U.S. currency, as the South
Korean won and the Chinese yuan have also depreciated against the greenback in
recent weeks.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan's open foreign exchange market, Siew said, as foreign traders see
other currencies depreciating, they are likely to sell the local currency as
well, driving down its value.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks while answering questions from reporters concerning the
continued depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar at the Taipei World Trade
Center, where an annual fair organized by the Taiwan Optical Importers
Association was being held.</P>
      <P>Driven by the sharp depreciation of the Korean won, the local unit slipped by
NT$0.34 to a nearly six-year low of NT$34.62 against the U.S. dollar Tuesday
from the previous level of NT$33 early this year.</P>
      <P>Chang Pen-tsao, chairman of the ROC General Chamber of Commerce, predicted that
the New Taiwan dollar might fall below the 35 mark against the greenback as the
Korean won has lost more than 30 percent of its value against the U.S. currency
over the past six months.</P>
      <P>Although a weakening local currency should help boost exports, Chang said it
also might affect the prices of goods in the domestic market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy is likely to register negative growth in the first half of this
year, but some investors are hopeful it will return to positive growth later in
the year, boosted by an increase in electronic product exports during the high-
tech peak season.</P>
      <P>Lai Cheng-i, chairman of the private Council for Industrial and Commercial
Development, said later Wednesday, however, that it would not be advantageous
if the local  currency  fell below  the psychologically important 35 barrier.</P>
      <P>Although a cheap Taiwan dollar might bolster exports, it could also deal a
serious blow to importers and domestic consumption, Lai suggested.</P>
      <P>A sharp depreciation might also deter some people's plans to wire their money
back to Taiwan, negating the government's long-term efforts to lure Taiwanese
capital back home from abroad, he warned.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, a depreciating won has largely slashed South Koreans'
spending power, as seen through the number of South Koreans staying at his
hotel, the upscale Lalu overlooking Sun Moon Lake in central Nantou County.</P>
      <P>He said the hotel now receives only about 15 guests from that country per month,
a sharp drop-off from the 200 it averaged per month in the past.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Examination Yuan rules out pay cut for civil servants</HEADLINE>

02/18/09  20:01:33

    <TEXT>
      <P>Examination Yuan President John Kuan ruled out Wednesday the possibility of the
government reducing public servant salaries in the current economic climate,
even as he renewed a proposal to reform the civil service by weeding out poorly
performing employees.</P>
      <P>Kuan made the remarks during an interview with the Central News Agency in
response to a question on whether Taiwan planned to follow in the footsteps of
Singapore, which will cut the salaries of its senior civil servants and
ministers by up to 19 percent this year to reflect a decline in the country's
gross domestic product (GDP).</P>
      <P>Kuan said Singapore's situation is different from Taiwan's, in that senior civil
servants there are offered very high salaries and a percentage of their annual
salary is linked to GDP growth, while Taiwan's civil servants are not
particularly highly paid and their salaries are fixed.</P>
      <P>The current recession should not affect the salaries of civil servants in Taiwan
because government expenditure for personnel is lower than 1 percent of the GDP,
Kuan said.</P>
      <P>Most importantly, the government's fiscal status remains sound, with the country
maintaining very high foreign exchange reserves and remaining free from foreign
debt, Kuan added.</P>
      <P>According to Kuan, ensuring a stable livelihood for government employees allows
them to perform their duties without worry, which is fundamental to social
stability.</P>
      <P>However, while they have this type of job security, government employees must
ensure that their performance meets expectations, he said.</P>
      <P>"You should be prepared to be weeded out if you do not do your job to the best
of your ability," he cautioned civil servants.</P>
      <P>Reaffirming his resolve to reform and modernize the civil service system, Kuan
said that within one year the Examination Yuan will come up with a draft
amendment to the law governing the civil service performance evaluation system
and submit it to the Legislative Yuan for review by next February.</P>
      <P>On the four-level scale -- from "A" to "D" -- used to rate the performance of
government employees, more than 99 percent of them are now getting an "A" or a
"B," he said. "But their reputation among the public is obviously not as good."</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, only around 0.02 percent of government employees have been
given an annual "C" rating, and fewer than five persons have gotten a "D," which
indicates that the evaluation system is not serving its true purpose, Kuan said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that specific criteria be set out to encourage civil servants to
keep upgrading their performance to earn a favorable rating, and to help them
realize that the civil service is not an "iron rice bowl."</P>
      <P>Pointing to the example of Japan, which uses a five-level scale to rate the
performance of its civil servants, Kuan said around 5 percent of government
employees in Japan get a "D" or "E" rating each year, which usually results in
retraining, dismissal or transfer to the private sector.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kuan said a resolution will be hammered out in the first half of this
year to address a situation  in which a preferential 18-percent interest rate on
deposits by retired civil servants allow them to earn more than they did when
they were employed.</P>
      <P>While promoting  reform,  the government  will ensure that retirement benefits
to entry-level and mid-level personnel are sufficient to support basic living
standards, and that the benefits to senior personnel do not grossly exceed what
is required to maintain basic living standards, according to Kuan.</P>
      <P>The Examination Yuan is the government branch responsible for civil service
recruitment and management.</P>

      <P>Competitors from 20 countries will participate  in the 2009 Taiwan International
Dancesport Open Championship (TIDOC), which will be held at the Taipei Arena on
Feb. 28, the head of the Taiwan Dancesport Development Association (TDDA)
announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference in Taipei, TDDA President Wang Hsueh-fu said that
with the assistance and support of the Taipei city government and other
government agencies,  the 2009 TIDOC has attracted the participation of
professionals from around the world.</P>
      <P>"The annual TIDOC is the biggest event for Taiwan's dancesport community," said
Wang.</P>
      <P>More than 300 couples from 20 countries, including the U.S., Italy, Russia,
Australia, Europe, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, China, Singapore, Thailand, the
Philippines and Malaysia, have signed up for this year's TIDOC, Wang added.</P>
      <P>As dancesport has been thriving in Taiwan over the past decade, ballroom dance
enthusiasts no longer have to go to England's Black Pool to experience  the
exciting environment  of international competitions, said Wang.</P>
      <P>"We have gone out of our way to provide the best environment possible for the
participants, despite the global economic downturn," said Wang, adding that the
organizing committee will provide free accommodation, meals and transportation
for all foreign participants.</P>
      <P>In order to attract  more professional  participants,  the organizing committee
is also covering the round trip airfares of competitors who have won major
international dancesport championships in the past, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The committee has invited the number one couple in sportsdance in the U.S.,
Riccardo Cocchi and Yulia Zagoruychenko, to perform at this year's TIDOC, he
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang said that in order to give more Taiwanese a chance to learn
about and experience the beauty of ballroom dancing, the organizing committee is
offering 3,000 free tickets.</P>
      <P>"The Taipei Arena will issue 1,200 free tickets starting from Feb. 21, while the
TDDA will hand out 1,800 free tickets to charity organizations around the
country," said Wang.</P>
      <P>According to the organizers, the winners in the professional and amateur
categories of this year's TIDOC will receive prizes of NT$30,000 (US$865) and
NT$8,000, respectively.</P>
      <P>Ticket prices for the event range from NT$600 to NT$8,000 and can be obtained

      <P>The incidence of spinal fractures caused by pressure on fragile bones has been
on the rise among people in Taiwan aged 65 and over, increasing by 60,000
patients per year, a doctor at National Cheng Kung University Hospital in
southern Taiwan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Citing health statistics, Hung Yu-chang, a neurological surgeon, said that half
a million people in the over-64 age group in Taiwan suffer from osteoporosis --
a disease characterized by reduced bone density and increased risk of fracture.</P>
      <P>Hung added that in Taiwan, 30 percent of women over 64 years of age are affected
by osteoporosis, and that one in every four people in that age group have
suffered an osteoporotic compression fracture of the spine.</P>
      <P>According to Hung, NCK University Hospital has been treating about 19 such cases
per year, with the patients ranging from 42 to 108 years of age. The treatment
method used by the hospital is called vertebroplasty -- a procedure that
stabilizes the spinal compression fracture by injecting bone cement into the
damaged vertebra.</P>
      <P>The method was developed by interventional neuroradiologists in France in 1987,
but the earliest procedures were performed through open back surgery.</P>

      <P>Alarmed by gloomy economic  records registered in the previous quarter, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Wednesday it will take effective
strategies to help prod up sagging exports, the prime mover of Taiwan's economic
growth.</P>
      <P>The ministry issued the statement after the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) reported earlier in the day that the country's
gross domestic product (GDP) posted a marginal 0.12 growth for 2008, the lowest
growth rate since 2001.</P>
      <P>The latest DGBAS report also showed that the country's GDP contracted 8.36
percent in the last quarter of 2008, marking the largest quarterly decline in
history.</P>
      <P>Alarmed by the spate of lackluster economic records, the DGBAS adjusted downward
its forecast of the country's GDP growth for 2009 to negative 2.97 percent and
the Central Bank of the Republic of China also decided to further lower its key
interest rates by 0.25 percentage points from Thursday.</P>
      <P>For its part, the MOEA said in the press statement that it has launched a "New
Zheng He" project aimed at expanding exports of Taiwan-made products,
particularly sales to emerging markets.</P>
      <P>Moreover,  the  statement  said  the ministry's  Industrial Development Bureau
has worked out a package of guidelines for structural adjustments of the
manufacturing sector in order to sharpen its competitive edges in the global
market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MOEA officials said the recent currency depreciation is expected to
help enhance Taiwan's export competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Noting that the manufacturing sector accounts for about 30 percent of the annual
GDP growth, the officials said currency depreciation will definitely contribute
to the country's exports.</P>
      <P>Even though currency depreciation will increase import costs of major raw
materials, commodity prices are not expected to rise substantially given the
sluggish demand amid the current global economic recession, the officials
predicted.</P>

      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) cut its
economic forecast for Taiwan Wednesday, predicting that the country's gross
domestic product (GDP) for 2009 will shrink by 2.97 percent, in what it said
will be the country's worst economic performance in history.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS, the economy will fall for three straight quarters,
shrinking 6.51 percent in Q1, 6.85 percent in Q2, and 2.67 percent in Q3, before
showing growth of 4.5 percent in Q4.</P>
      <P>If the DGBAS predictions are correct, it means the GDP would drop for five
quarters in a row, from Q3 in 2008 to Q3 in 2009.</P>
      <P>The latest DGBAS tallies show that the GDP shrank 8.36 percent in Q4 2008 in its
biggest quarterly decline in history.</P>
      <P>The agency revised its outlook for the economy at a press conference hosted by
DGBAS Director-General Shih Su-mei and Tsai Hung-kun, chief of the agency's
third department.</P>
      <P>Previously, the DGBAS had forecast that the economy would grow by 2.12 percent
this year.</P>
      <P>However, at the press conference,  Shih said that if the government had not
intervened with measures like the shopping voucher and expanded public works
programs, the outlook would have been even more grim, as the GDP would have
fallen 5.74 percent this year.</P>
      <P>The government's economic stimulus efforts are estimated to help cut the slide
by 2.77 percentage points, she said.</P>
      <P>Shih also forecast that exports will shrink by 20 percent and imports by 26.2
percent in 2009 due to an overall recession that has resulted in growing
unemployment and a decline in consumption.</P>
      <P>According to the latest DGBAS forecast, the consumer price index (CPI) will fall
by 0.82 percent this year, while the gross national product (GNP) will reach
NT$12.4975 trillion (US$359.928 billion) , and the per capita GNP will stand at
US$15,957.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's GDP grew by 0.12 percent in 2008, its worst performance since 2001 when
the economy contracted by 2.17 percent due to the Internet bubble, DGBAS said.</P>

      <P>A 32-year-old Taiwanese man who says he is stranded in Shenyang in China's
northeastern Liaoning Province is seeking help to return to Taiwan, claiming
that he lost all his money and travel documents during a tour of China.</P>
      <P>Yeh Shu-cheng told the Central News Agency Wednesday by phone from a local help
center in Shenyang that he has been stranded in the Chinese city since Feb. 13
and wants to return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he was waiting for an ID document from a police station in Taiwan's
Sinjhuang City to verify his citizenship.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, he embarked on a tour of the mainland last year after
traveling from Taiwan to China on May 28. However, he lost all of his money,
travel documents, luggage and cell phone on Jan. 1 this year while traveling on
a train from Guanzhou in Guandong Province to Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province, he
claimed.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he sought assistance from local Chinese officials in charge of Taiwan
affairs when he was in Zhejiang Province's Hangzhou and in Jiangsu Province's
Nangjing, but that nothing could be done because he could not produce any
documents to verify his status.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he arrived in Shenyang via several other cities with assistance
provided by help centers, each of which bought him train tickets to the next
destination.</P>
      <P>"Thanks to some kindhearted people in Shenyang and to a local evening newspaper

      <P>Taiwan could face a deflation crisis in the wake of a government forecast that

since crude oil prices have fallen, the pressure for consumer prices to rise has
eased.</P>
      <P>As a result, major industrial economies, including the United States, have
predicted a drop in their consumer prices, he said.</P>
      <P>Perng said there are risks of deflation in the U.S. and Taiwan, but not in the
Euro zone, Indonesia or the Philippines.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's National Palace Museum (NPM) will engage in substantive cooperation
with the Shanghai Museum without touching on the sensitive designation and legal
issues.</P>
      <P>NPM Director Chou Kung-shin made the announcement in Shanghai Wednesday at a
news conference held after her meeting with senior Shanghai Museum officials.</P>
      <P>Chou, who arrived in Shanghai Tuesday on the second leg of her historic visit to
China, told reporters that her current visit is based on the principle of parity
and described the engagements as museum-to-museum exchanges.</P>
      <P>As the Taipei-based museum bears the word "national" in its name, Chou said all
the exchanges with the Shanghai Museum will avoid the designation issue.</P>
      <P>The exchanges will also not touch on the legal issues concerning the possibility
of Chinese authorities seizing the NPM artworks should they be loaned to China
for exhibition, Chou added.</P>
      <P>The NPM in suburban Taipei is home to the cream of the 1,000-year Chinese art
collection, while the rest of the collection is held by several Chinese museums,
particularly the Palace Museum in Beijing.</P>
      <P>On other agreements reached in her talks with Shanghai Museum staff, Chou said
the two sides agreed to establish a cooperative mechanism, with NPM Deputy
Director Feng Ming-chu and Shanghai Museum deputy chief, Chen Kelun, holding
regular teleconferences or making exchange visits to discuss feasible
cooperative programs and steps to execute them.</P>
      <P>The two museums will also cooperate  in art conservation, publications and
promotions.</P>
      <P>Chou and other NPM officials are scheduled to conclude their landmark visit and
return to Taipei Thursday.</P>
      <P>During the delegation's visit to Beijing on the first leg of its China visit,
Chou held talks with the city's Palace Museum curator Zheng Xinmiao in the first
formal engagement between the staff of the two museums since Taiwan and China
split in a civil war 60 years ago.</P>
      <P>As a result of the talks, the Palace Museum in Beijing has agreed to lend its
Taiwan counterpart 29 Qing dynasty artifacts for a three-month exhibition that
will begin in October this year.</P>
      <P>Beijing's loan of its collection to Taipei will make possible the first display
of the imperial artifacts under one roof since they were split six decades ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Steel likely to post a loss in the first quarter</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China Steel Corp., Taiwan's largest steel maker, confirmed Wednesday that it is
likely to post an operating loss in the first quarter of the year, mainly
because of retroactive discounts to customers.</P>
      <P>Chung Lo-min, executive vice president of China Steel, said that as a result of
retroactive discounts totaling NT$4 billion (US$115.2 million) in the first
quarter, China Steel will likely register a decline in revenues for the January
to March period.</P>
      <P>If Chung's forecast is accurate, it will be the second quarterly loss in a row
for the steel maker, which is 23 percent owned by the government.</P>
      <P>China Steel suffered its first quarterly loss in its nearly 40-year history in
the fourth quarter of 2008, reporting a loss of NT$18.62 billion, which reduced
its income for that year to NT$30.2 billion, down 50 percent from 2007.</P>
      <P>In late November it decided to lower the prices of its steel products by an
average of 22.56 percent, or an average of NT$7,058 per metric ton, for the
first quarter of 2009 to help relieve the plight of mid- and downstream steel
factories in Taiwan suffering from the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, China Steel announced a further average price reduction of 14.03
percent, or NT$3,353 per metric ton, for the domestic market in April and May,
with the prices for June to be determined separately in the future.</P>
      <P>The new prices will be retroactive to the first three months of the year and are
expected to cost the company NT$4 billion in first quarter revenue, sending
revenues lower for the second consecutive quarter, Chung said.</P>
      <P>The quoted prices for April and May are as follows:</P>
      <P>--Steel plates: NT$4,166 per metric ton;</P>
      <P>--Steel rod and wire products: NT$3,500 per ton;</P>
      <P>--Hot-rolled steel coils: NT$3,000 per ton;</P>
      <P>--Cold-rolled steel coils: NT$2,691 per ton;</P>
      <P>--Electro-galvanized steel coils: NT$4,000 per ton;</P>
      <P>--Electrical steel coils: NT$4,500;</P>
      <P>--Hot-dipped galvanized steel coils: NT$2,869 per ton.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government's economic focus remains boosting domestic demand: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 18 (CNA)
02/18/09  19:09:53</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will not only help exports but will also continue its efforts to
expand domestic demand to help revive the slumping economy, the nation's top
economic planner said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Rising unemployment is also a major government concern, " said Chen Tien-jy,
chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), at a
gathering of entrepreneurs.</P>
      <P>The jobless rate hit 5.03 percent in December and is generally expected to rise
even further after the announcement of January's jobless rate later this month,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>On public calls for the government to issue a new round of shopping vouchers to
help stimulate consumption, Chen said the council will wait until September to
assess the results of the first round of the program.</P>
      <P>He noted that there is still a Dragon Boat Festival,  a traditional festival
which falls on June 27, that could spark a wave of spending between now and
September when the vouchers must be used.</P>
      <P>The government distributed around NT$85 billion in vouchers to spur consumption
on the island and boost Taiwan's ailing retail sector. Each citizen was given
NT$3,600 in vouchers.</P>
      <P>Chen said that if exports decline by 20 percent and imports also decline, it
will affect gross domestic product by around 2 percentage points.</P>
      <P>But Chen indicated that the major factor behind the local economy's contraction
in the fourth quarter was the 30 percent decline in private investment.</P>
      <P>Chen would not comment on the recent sharp depreciation of new Taiwan dollar,
which has helped exporters but hurt importers.</P>
      <P>The new Taiwan dollar closed at NT$34.650 to the U.S. dollar Wednesday. (By

    <HEADLINE>Demining work on Kinmen to resume March 2</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Feb. 18 (CNA)
02/18/09  19:16:22
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A project to clear landmines in the Mashan area of the Taiwan-controlled island
of Kinmen off China's Fujian province is scheduled to begin March 2 and last for
four months, the Kinmen Defense Command reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Mashan demining operations will be carried out by the Singaporean Explomo
Technical Services Pte Ltd. over an area of 140,000 square meters in three
stages over a four-month period, the defense command said.</P>
      <P>Explomo, which won the demining contract in an open bid last year, will clear
landmines in six minefields in Kinmen covering 214,900 square meters during the
whole year, while the demining team of the Army Engineers Corps will clear 21
minefields over a total area of about 389,900 square meters, the command said.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference held at a borough office in Chinsha Township, an
Explomo project manager Huang Jou-li said that the first stage of the Mashan
demining operations will be highly dangerous because it involves mainly manual
jobs in shallow minefields mostly in the beachside casuarina woods.</P>
      <P>Traffic controls will be put in place around the Mashan area daily, during the
periods 5:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m., in the first month of
operations, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang also gave the assurance that Explomo operators will mark the graves in the
area and will not disturb them. Any human remains found in the demining process
will be collected and stored for interment in a shrine that will be built in
Kinmen later, he said.</P>
      <P>Last December, the Kinmen Defense Command gave an order for demining operations
over a 20-hectare area in Kuningtou village to be suspended, pending
consultations with the island's residents who had complained that the demining
work had destroyed nearly 1,000 graves of their ancestors.</P>
      <P>Kuningtou was the site of a 1949 battle in which Republic of China forces
defeated two invading regiments of China's People's Liberation Army.</P>
      <P>The shores of Kinmen -- Taiwan's farthest outpost in the military standoff with
China -- were carpeted with landmines during the peak hostilities between the
two sides in the 1950s.</P>
      <P>More than 70,000 mines were believed to have been left in more than 150
minefields on the island.</P>
      <P>In the 1950s and 1960s, many civilians were killed or maimed when they
accidentally stepped on the explosive devices.</P>
      <P>As cross-strait tensions eased, the government lifted the wartime regulations in
1992 and ended Kinmen's status as a combat zone.</P>
      <P>The move allowed the island to open up to tourism, prompting the need to clear
the landmines from areas no longer under military control.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Market forces will set Taiwan dollar's value: vice president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 18 (CNA)
02/18/09  19:50:31
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Wednesday that the local currency's value,
which has lost ground against the U.S. dollar in recent days, will be decided by
market forces.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's central bank has been closely monitoring the New Taiwan
dollar's exchange rate against the U.S. greenback, Siew said it is natural that
the local currency has lost ground against the U.S. currency, as the South
Korean won and the Chinese yuan have also depreciated against the greenback in
recent weeks.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan's open foreign exchange market, Siew said, as foreign traders see
other currencies depreciating, they are likely to sell the local currency as
well, driving down its value.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks while answering questions from reporters concerning the
continued depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar at the Taipei World Trade
Center, where an annual fair organized by the Taiwan Optical Importers
Association was being held.</P>
      <P>Driven by the sharp depreciation of the Korean won, the local unit slipped by
NT$0.34 to a nearly six-year low of NT$34.62 against the U.S. dollar Tuesday
from the previous level of NT$33 early this year.</P>
      <P>Chang Pen-tsao, chairman of the ROC General Chamber of Commerce, predicted that
the New Taiwan dollar might fall below the 35 mark against the greenback as the
Korean won has lost more than 30 percent of its value against the U.S. currency
over the past six months.</P>
      <P>Although a weakening local currency should help boost exports, Chang said it
also might affect the prices of goods in the domestic market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy is likely to register negative growth in the first half of this
year, but some investors are hopeful it will return to positive growth later in
the year, boosted by an increase in electronic product exports during the high-
tech peak season.</P>
      <P>Lai Cheng-i, chairman of the private Council for Industrial and Commercial
Development, said later Wednesday, however, that it would not be advantageous
if the local  currency  fell below  the psychologically important 35 barrier.</P>
      <P>Although a cheap Taiwan dollar might bolster exports, it could also deal a
serious blow to importers and domestic consumption, Lai suggested.</P>
      <P>A sharp depreciation might also deter some people's plans to wire their money
back to Taiwan, negating the government's long-term efforts to lure Taiwanese
capital back home from abroad, he warned.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, a depreciating won has largely slashed South Koreans'
spending power, as seen through the number of South Koreans staying at his
hotel, the upscale Lalu overlooking Sun Moon Lake in central Nantou County.</P>
      <P>He said the hotel now receives only about 15 guests from that country per month,
a sharp drop-off from the 200 it averaged per month in the past.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Examination Yuan rules out pay cut for civil servants</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 18 (CNA)
02/18/09  20:01:33
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Examination Yuan President John Kuan ruled out Wednesday the possibility of the
government reducing public servant salaries in the current economic climate,
even as he renewed a proposal to reform the civil service by weeding out poorly
performing employees.</P>
      <P>Kuan made the remarks during an interview with the Central News Agency in
response to a question on whether Taiwan planned to follow in the footsteps of
Singapore, which will cut the salaries of its senior civil servants and
ministers by up to 19 percent this year to reflect a decline in the country's
gross domestic product (GDP).</P>
      <P>Kuan said Singapore's situation is different from Taiwan's, in that senior civil
servants there are offered very high salaries and a percentage of their annual
salary is linked to GDP growth, while Taiwan's civil servants are not
particularly highly paid and their salaries are fixed.</P>
      <P>The current recession should not affect the salaries of civil servants in Taiwan
because government expenditure for personnel is lower than 1 percent of the GDP,
Kuan said.</P>
      <P>Most importantly, the government's fiscal status remains sound, with the country
maintaining very high foreign exchange reserves and remaining free from foreign
debt, Kuan added.</P>
      <P>According to Kuan, ensuring a stable livelihood for government employees allows
them to perform their duties without worry, which is fundamental to social
stability.</P>
      <P>However, while they have this type of job security, government employees must
ensure that their performance meets expectations, he said.</P>
      <P>"You should be prepared to be weeded out if you do not do your job to the best
of your ability," he cautioned civil servants.</P>
      <P>Reaffirming his resolve to reform and modernize the civil service system, Kuan
said that within one year the Examination Yuan will come up with a draft
amendment to the law governing the civil service performance evaluation system
and submit it to the Legislative Yuan for review by next February.</P>
      <P>On the four-level scale -- from "A" to "D" -- used to rate the performance of
government employees, more than 99 percent of them are now getting an "A" or a
"B," he said. "But their reputation among the public is obviously not as good."</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, only around 0.02 percent of government employees have been
given an annual "C" rating, and fewer than five persons have gotten a "D," which
indicates that the evaluation system is not serving its true purpose, Kuan said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that specific criteria be set out to encourage civil servants to
keep upgrading their performance to earn a favorable rating, and to help them
realize that the civil service is not an "iron rice bowl."</P>
      <P>Pointing to the example of Japan, which uses a five-level scale to rate the
performance of its civil servants, Kuan said around 5 percent of government
employees in Japan get a "D" or "E" rating each year, which usually results in
retraining, dismissal or transfer to the private sector.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kuan said a resolution will be hammered out in the first half of this
year to address a situation  in which a preferential 18-percent interest rate on
deposits by retired civil servants allow them to earn more than they did when
they were employed.</P>
      <P>While promoting  reform,  the government  will ensure that retirement benefits
to entry-level and mid-level personnel are sufficient to support basic living
standards, and that the benefits to senior personnel do not grossly exceed what
is required to maintain basic living standards, according to Kuan.</P>
      <P>The Examination Yuan is the government branch responsible for civil service
recruitment and management.</P>

      <P>Competitors from 20 countries will participate  in the 2009 Taiwan International
Dancesport Open Championship (TIDOC), which will be held at the Taipei Arena on
Feb. 28, the head of the Taiwan Dancesport Development Association (TDDA)
announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference in Taipei, TDDA President Wang Hsueh-fu said that
with the assistance and support of the Taipei city government and other
government agencies,  the 2009 TIDOC has attracted the participation of
professionals from around the world.</P>
      <P>"The annual TIDOC is the biggest event for Taiwan's dancesport community," said
Wang.</P>
      <P>More than 300 couples from 20 countries, including the U.S., Italy, Russia,
Australia, Europe, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, China, Singapore, Thailand, the
Philippines and Malaysia, have signed up for this year's TIDOC, Wang added.</P>
      <P>As dancesport has been thriving in Taiwan over the past decade, ballroom dance
enthusiasts no longer have to go to England's Black Pool to experience  the
exciting environment  of international competitions, said Wang.</P>
      <P>"We have gone out of our way to provide the best environment possible for the
participants, despite the global economic downturn," said Wang, adding that the
organizing committee will provide free accommodation, meals and transportation
for all foreign participants.</P>
      <P>In order to attract  more professional  participants,  the organizing committee
is also covering the round trip airfares of competitors who have won major
international dancesport championships in the past, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The committee has invited the number one couple in sportsdance in the U.S.,
Riccardo Cocchi and Yulia Zagoruychenko, to perform at this year's TIDOC, he
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang said that in order to give more Taiwanese a chance to learn
about and experience the beauty of ballroom dancing, the organizing committee is
offering 3,000 free tickets.</P>
      <P>"The Taipei Arena will issue 1,200 free tickets starting from Feb. 21, while the
TDDA will hand out 1,800 free tickets to charity organizations around the
country," said Wang.</P>
      <P>According to the organizers, the winners in the professional and amateur
categories of this year's TIDOC will receive prizes of NT$30,000 (US$865) and
NT$8,000, respectively.</P>
      <P>Ticket prices for the event range from NT$600 to NT$8,000 and can be obtained
through the TDDA, the organizers said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The incidence of spinal fractures caused by pressure on fragile bones has been
on the rise among people in Taiwan aged 65 and over, increasing by 60,000
patients per year, a doctor at National Cheng Kung University Hospital in
southern Taiwan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Citing health statistics, Hung Yu-chang, a neurological surgeon, said that half
a million people in the over-64 age group in Taiwan suffer from osteoporosis --
a disease characterized by reduced bone density and increased risk of fracture.</P>
      <P>Hung added that in Taiwan, 30 percent of women over 64 years of age are affected
by osteoporosis, and that one in every four people in that age group have
suffered an osteoporotic compression fracture of the spine.</P>
      <P>According to Hung, NCK University Hospital has been treating about 19 such cases
per year, with the patients ranging from 42 to 108 years of age. The treatment
method used by the hospital is called vertebroplasty -- a procedure that
stabilizes the spinal compression fracture by injecting bone cement into the
damaged vertebra.</P>
      <P>The method was developed by interventional neuroradiologists in France in 1987,
but the earliest procedures were performed through open back surgery.</P>

      <P>Alarmed by gloomy economic  records registered in the previous quarter, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Wednesday it will take effective
strategies to help prod up sagging exports, the prime mover of Taiwan's economic
growth.</P>
      <P>The ministry issued the statement after the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) reported earlier in the day that the country's
gross domestic product (GDP) posted a marginal 0.12 growth for 2008, the lowest
growth rate since 2001.</P>
      <P>The latest DGBAS report also showed that the country's GDP contracted 8.36
percent in the last quarter of 2008, marking the largest quarterly decline in
history.</P>
      <P>Alarmed by the spate of lackluster economic records, the DGBAS adjusted downward
its forecast of the country's GDP growth for 2009 to negative 2.97 percent and
the Central Bank of the Republic of China also decided to further lower its key
interest rates by 0.25 percentage points from Thursday.</P>
      <P>For its part, the MOEA said in the press statement that it has launched a "New
Zheng He" project aimed at expanding exports of Taiwan-made products,
particularly sales to emerging markets.</P>
      <P>Moreover,  the  statement  said  the ministry's  Industrial Development Bureau
has worked out a package of guidelines for structural adjustments of the
manufacturing sector in order to sharpen its competitive edges in the global
market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MOEA officials said the recent currency depreciation is expected to
help enhance Taiwan's export competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Noting that the manufacturing sector accounts for about 30 percent of the annual
GDP growth, the officials said currency depreciation will definitely contribute
to the country's exports.</P>
      <P>Even though currency depreciation will increase import costs of major raw
materials, commodity prices are not expected to rise substantially given the
sluggish demand amid the current global economic recession, the officials
predicted.</P>

      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) cut its
economic forecast for Taiwan Wednesday, predicting that the country's gross
domestic product (GDP) for 2009 will shrink by 2.97 percent, in what it said
will be the country's worst economic performance in history.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS, the economy will fall for three straight quarters,
shrinking 6.51 percent in Q1, 6.85 percent in Q2, and 2.67 percent in Q3, before
showing growth of 4.5 percent in Q4.</P>
      <P>If the DGBAS predictions are correct, it means the GDP would drop for five
quarters in a row, from Q3 in 2008 to Q3 in 2009.</P>
      <P>The latest DGBAS tallies show that the GDP shrank 8.36 percent in Q4 2008 in its
biggest quarterly decline in history.</P>
      <P>The agency revised its outlook for the economy at a press conference hosted by
DGBAS Director-General Shih Su-mei and Tsai Hung-kun, chief of the agency's
third department.</P>
      <P>Previously, the DGBAS had forecast that the economy would grow by 2.12 percent
this year.</P>
      <P>However, at the press conference,  Shih said that if the government had not
intervened with measures like the shopping voucher and expanded public works

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese claims he's stranded in Shenyang, appeals for help</HEADLINE>

      <P>A 32-year-old Taiwanese man who says he is stranded in Shenyang in China's
northeastern Liaoning Province is seeking help to return to Taiwan, claiming
that he lost all his money and travel documents during a tour of China.</P>
      <P>Yeh Shu-cheng told the Central News Agency Wednesday by phone from a local help
center in Shenyang that he has been stranded in the Chinese city since Feb. 13
and wants to return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he was waiting for an ID document from a police station in Taiwan's
Sinjhuang City to verify his citizenship.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, he embarked on a tour of the mainland last year after
traveling from Taiwan to China on May 28. However, he lost all of his money,
travel documents, luggage and cell phone on Jan. 1 this year while traveling on
a train from Guanzhou in Guandong Province to Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province, he
claimed.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he sought assistance from local Chinese officials in charge of Taiwan
affairs when he was in Zhejiang Province's Hangzhou and in Jiangsu Province's
Nangjing, but that nothing could be done because he could not produce any
documents to verify his status.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he arrived in Shenyang via several other cities with assistance
provided by help centers, each of which bought him train tickets to the next
destination.</P>
      <P>"Thanks to some kindhearted people in Shenyang and to a local evening newspaper
that ran a story about my adventure, I was able to contact the Chungping police
station in Sinjhuang City," he said. "The Sinjhuang police in Taipei County have
promised to fax my personal information to Shenyang."</P>
      <P>He said that while many people thought he was lying, he did not have the
slightest motive to do so.</P>
      <P>"Why would I lie to make myself miserable?" he asked.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he was confident that he would make it back to Taiwan, but said he
would need help because he is now penniless.</P>
      <P>"I have no money or travel documents. I am itching and hurting all over, and my
head is swollen like a pig's. I need help to return to Taiwan," he said.</P>

      <P>National Cheng Kung University in Tainan established a Marine Life, Whale and
Dolphin Research Center on its campus in Annan District Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang Hwung-hweng, vice president of NCK University, and Tainan Deputy Mayor
Hung Cheng-chung jointly presided over the inauguration of the center.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony, Huang said that the center, located close to the sea,
will focus on research on marine life in the waters around southern Taiwan --
unlike Academia Sinica, National Taiwan University and National Taiwan Ocean
University, whose research programs are centered on marine life in waters around
northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang Chien-ping --  a marine biologist,  professor at the university and
director of the center -- said the center will not only serve as a museum to
display the bones of marine mammals and other specimens, it will also conduct
research on marine life and conservation.</P>
      <P>Noting that whales and dolphins often become stranded on the coasts of Tainan,
Kaohsiung and Pingtung, Wang said the center will also play a role in the rescue
of these creatures.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by Wang's research team show that about 25 percent of the
whales and dolphins beached on Taiwan's coastlines were found in these areas.</P>

      <P>Taiwan could face a deflation crisis in the wake of a government forecast that
the consumer price index will move down by 0.82 percent this year, the governor
of the Central Bank of the Republic of China warned Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In response to media questions, Perng Fai-nan said the bank will remain alert to
the possible crisis, and that he hopes the deflation will not last long if it
does occur.</P>
      <P>Perng said that demand has been dropping amid the global downturn, and that
since crude oil prices have fallen, the pressure for consumer prices to rise has
eased.</P>
      <P>As a result, major industrial economies, including the United States, have
predicted a drop in their consumer prices, he said.</P>
      <P>Perng said there are risks of deflation in the U.S. and Taiwan, but not in the
Euro zone, Indonesia or the Philippines.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's National Palace Museum (NPM) will engage in substantive cooperation
with the Shanghai Museum without touching on the sensitive designation and legal
issues.</P>
      <P>NPM Director Chou Kung-shin made the announcement in Shanghai Wednesday at a
news conference held after her meeting with senior Shanghai Museum officials.</P>
      <P>Chou, who arrived in Shanghai Tuesday on the second leg of her historic visit to
China, told reporters that her current visit is based on the principle of parity
and described the engagements as museum-to-museum exchanges.</P>
      <P>As the Taipei-based museum bears the word "national" in its name, Chou said all
the exchanges with the Shanghai Museum will avoid the designation issue.</P>
      <P>The exchanges will also not touch on the legal issues concerning the possibility
of Chinese authorities seizing the NPM artworks should they be loaned to China
for exhibition, Chou added.</P>
      <P>The NPM in suburban Taipei is home to the cream of the 1,000-year Chinese art
collection, while the rest of the collection is held by several Chinese museums,
particularly the Palace Museum in Beijing.</P>
      <P>On other agreements reached in her talks with Shanghai Museum staff, Chou said
the two sides agreed to establish a cooperative mechanism, with NPM Deputy
Director Feng Ming-chu and Shanghai Museum deputy chief, Chen Kelun, holding
regular teleconferences or making exchange visits to discuss feasible
cooperative programs and steps to execute them.</P>
      <P>The two museums will also cooperate  in art conservation, publications and
promotions.</P>
      <P>Chou and other NPM officials are scheduled to conclude their landmark visit and
return to Taipei Thursday.</P>
      <P>During the delegation's visit to Beijing on the first leg of its China visit,
Chou held talks with the city's Palace Museum curator Zheng Xinmiao in the first
formal engagement between the staff of the two museums since Taiwan and China
split in a civil war 60 years ago.</P>
      <P>As a result of the talks, the Palace Museum in Beijing has agreed to lend its
Taiwan counterpart 29 Qing dynasty artifacts for a three-month exhibition that
will begin in October this year.</P>
      <P>Beijing's loan of its collection to Taipei will make possible the first display
of the imperial artifacts under one roof since they were split six decades ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Foot-and-mouth disease cases reported in central Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.18  (CNA)

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will not be eligible to apply for listing as a foot-and-mouth-
disease(FMD) -free country until the latter half of 2011 at the earliest after
sporadic FMD cases were reported in two counties in central Taiwan earlier this
month, an official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang Kuo-ching, deputy director of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) under the Council of Agriculture (COA), told
an evening news conference that 15 pigs in a small ranch in Yunlin County were
found Feb.4 to have developed blisters in their mouths and feet, suspected of
falling victim to FMD infection.</P>
      <P>"All of the 68 hogs in the farm have been culled," Huang said.</P>
      <P>On Feb.9, 23 pigs in a large-scale farm in neighboring Changhua County were also
detected to have similar symptoms, Huang said, adding that all of the 609 pigs
kept under the same roof have been culled and the remaining 5,503 hogs raised in
the farm have received anti-FMD shots to prevent spread of the highly contagious
viral disease that mainly affects cloven-hoofed animals, including pigs, cattle
and sheep.</P>
      <P>Quoting laboratory testing reports released Feb.17, Huang said the viruses
detected in the two hog farms were same as the O-type virus that originated in
pigs smuggled from China in 1997 and caused an outbreak in Taiwan in March that
year.</P>
      <P>"The viruses found in the Yunlin and Changhua ranches were not new strains and
unlikely to infect humans, " Huang said, adding that locally produced pork
remains safe to eat.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, hog farms within a 3-km radius of the two farms, 44 in
Yunlin and 31 in Changhua, have all been put under close monitoring, Huang said,
adding that his bureau will pull out all the stops to contain any possible
outbreak.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, all of the infected pigs had not received anti-FMD
injections for some time in line with the country's plan to apply with the World
Organization for Animal Health (OIE) for an FMD-free status.</P>
      <P>"We were originally scheduled to come up with the application next year, but the
plan has to be postponed to the latter half of 2011 at the earliest because of
the latest cases in Yunlin and Changhua," Huang said.</P>
      <P>After the first FMD case broke out in Taiwan on March 20, 1997, Huang said
Taiwan has been trying to stamp out the disease as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Since then, he said, all pig farms and slaughter houses around Taiwan have
continuously conducted disinfections to maintain a clean environment and prevent
the spread of viruses.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the percentage of pigs at nationwide hog farms receiving anti-
FMD vaccine injections has dropped from 50 percent last November to the current
level of less than 10 percent on average at each farm, moving toward a zero
injection rate so as to meet the OIE's requirements, Huang said.</P>
      <P>According to the OIE's regulations, a country is entitled to apply for an FMD-
free status if no fresh suspicious FMD cases are reported within one year after
suspension of anti-FMD vaccination.</P>
      <P>The COA originally planned to file such an application in May next year, but now
the application has to be delayed for at least one-and-a-half years, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan used to raise as many as 12 million pigs per year in the peak years, with
7 million exported to Japan annually, according to COA statistics. Taiwan now
raises only about 6.4 million pigs ayear, mainly for local consumption.</P>

      <P>Taiwan could face a deflation crisis in the wake of a government forecast that
the consumer price index will move down by 0.82 percent this year, the governor
of the Central Bank of the Republic of China warned Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In response to media questions, Perng Fai-nan said the bank will remain alert to
the possible crisis, and that he hopes the deflation will not last long if it
does occur.</P>
      <P>Perng said that demand has been dropping amid the global downturn, and that
since crude oil prices have fallen, the pressure for consumer prices to rise has
eased.</P>
      <P>As a result, major industrial economies, including the United States, have
predicted a drop in their consumer prices, he said.</P>
      <P>Perng said there are risks of deflation in the U.S. and Taiwan, but not in the
Euro zone, Indonesia or the Philippines.</P>

      <P>National Cheng Kung University in Tainan established a Marine Life, Whale and
Dolphin Research Center on its campus in Annan District Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang Hwung-hweng, vice president of NCK University, and Tainan Deputy Mayor
Hung Cheng-chung jointly presided over the inauguration of the center.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony, Huang said that the center, located close to the sea,
will focus on research on marine life in the waters around southern Taiwan --
unlike Academia Sinica, National Taiwan University and National Taiwan Ocean
University, whose research programs are centered on marine life in waters around
northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang Chien-ping --  a marine biologist,  professor at the university and
director of the center -- said the center will not only serve as a museum to
display the bones of marine mammals and other specimens, it will also conduct
research on marine life and conservation.</P>
      <P>Noting that whales and dolphins often become stranded on the coasts of Tainan,
Kaohsiung and Pingtung, Wang said the center will also play a role in the rescue
of these creatures.</P>

      <P>A 32-year-old Taiwanese man who says he is stranded in Shenyang in China's
northeastern Liaoning Province is seeking help to return to Taiwan, claiming
that he lost all his money and travel documents during a tour of China.</P>
      <P>Yeh Shu-cheng told the Central News Agency Wednesday by phone from a local help
center in Shenyang that he has been stranded in the Chinese city since Feb. 13
and wants to return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he was waiting for an ID document from a police station in Taiwan's
Sinjhuang City to verify his citizenship.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, he embarked on a tour of the mainland last year after
traveling from Taiwan to China on May 28. However, he lost all of his money,
travel documents, luggage and cell phone on Jan. 1 this year while traveling on
a train from Guanzhou in Guandong Province to Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province, he
claimed.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he sought assistance from local Chinese officials in charge of Taiwan
affairs when he was in Zhejiang Province's Hangzhou and in Jiangsu Province's
Nangjing, but that nothing could be done because he could not produce any
documents to verify his status.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he arrived in Shenyang via several other cities with assistance
provided by help centers, each of which bought him train tickets to the next
destination.</P>
      <P>"Thanks to some kindhearted people in Shenyang and to a local evening newspaper
that ran a story about my adventure, I was able to contact the Chungping police
station in Sinjhuang City," he said. "The Sinjhuang police in Taipei County have
promised to fax my personal information to Shenyang."</P>
      <P>He said that while many people thought he was lying, he did not have the
slightest motive to do so.</P>
      <P>"Why would I lie to make myself miserable?" he asked.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he was confident that he would make it back to Taiwan, but said he
would need help because he is now penniless.</P>
      <P>"I have no money or travel documents. I am itching and hurting all over, and my
head is swollen like a pig's. I need help to return to Taiwan," he said.</P>

      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) cut its
economic forecast for Taiwan Wednesday, predicting that the country's gross
domestic product (GDP) for 2009 will shrink by 2.97 percent, in what it said
will be the country's worst economic performance in history.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS, the economy will fall for three straight quarters,
shrinking 6.51 percent in Q1, 6.85 percent in Q2, and 2.67 percent in Q3, before
showing growth of 4.5 percent in Q4.</P>
      <P>If the DGBAS predictions are correct, it means the GDP would drop for five
quarters in a row, from Q3 in 2008 to Q3 in 2009.</P>
      <P>The latest DGBAS tallies show that the GDP shrank 8.36 percent in Q4 2008 in its
biggest quarterly decline in history.</P>
      <P>The agency revised its outlook for the economy at a press conference hosted by
DGBAS Director-General Shih Su-mei and Tsai Hung-kun, chief of the agency's
third department.</P>
      <P>Previously, the DGBAS had forecast that the economy would grow by 2.12 percent
this year.</P>
      <P>However, at the press conference,  Shih said that if the government had not
intervened with measures like the shopping voucher and expanded public works
programs, the outlook would have been even more grim, as the GDP would have
fallen 5.74 percent this year.</P>
      <P>The government's economic stimulus efforts are estimated to help cut the slide
by 2.77 percentage points, she said.</P>
      <P>Shih also forecast that exports will shrink by 20 percent and imports by 26.2
percent in 2009 due to an overall recession that has resulted in growing
unemployment and a decline in consumption.</P>
      <P>According to the latest DGBAS forecast, the consumer price index (CPI) will fall
by 0.82 percent this year, while the gross national product (GNP) will reach
NT$12.4975 trillion (US$359.928 billion) , and the per capita GNP will stand at
US$15,957.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's GDP grew by 0.12 percent in 2008, its worst performance since 2001 when
the economy contracted by 2.17 percent due to the Internet bubble, DGBAS said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Locally developed device offers hope for aortic dissection patients</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/19/09  13:00:12</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 58-year-old man surnamed Chen was rushed to a hospital in Taiwan recently
complaining of severe chest pains and shortness of breath.</P>
      <P>A chest X-ray and CT scan showed that his aorta, the main artery that connects
the heart to the rest of the body, had split open and then ruptured, resulting
in massive internal bleeding.</P>
      <P>Surgeons cut open his chest and tried to suture an artificial vascular graft
onto the damaged aorta, but Chen continued to lose blood during the long
procedure and died on the operating table.</P>
      <P>Chen's death was not a statistical aberration. Some 28.5 percent of patients
with the condition -- known as aortic dissection -- who make it to surgery die,
but Chen's life may have been saved had his surgeons had access to a device
developed by a local surgical team that cuts operating times and limits the loss
of blood.</P>
      <P>The team's head, Dr. Jeng Wei, director of the Heart Center at the Cheng Hsin
Rehabilitation Center in Taipei, said he has used the NT$34,000 (US$1,000)
device, called the vascular ring connector (VRC), with positive results on a
total of 20 patients, including 10 since it was approved by the Department of
Health (DOH) in August 2008.</P>
      <P>Wei was given the go ahead by the DOH on a case-by-case to use the device on the
other 10 patients before getting formal approval.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the VRC became the first implanted cardiovascular device developed by
Taiwanese researchers to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) , and Wei and his team then submitted the device for approval in Taiwan
before using it successfully on patients.</P>
      <P>The aorta, the biggest artery in the body with a thickness of between 2 mm and 3
mm, contains three layers in its wall that allows seven tons of blood to pass
through it every day, Wei explained.</P>
      <P>Aortic dissection is a condition in which a tear occurs in the aorta's inner
lining, often caused by a sudden surge in blood pressure. Blood then flows
between the wall's layers and forces them apart.</P>
      <P>If the dissection ruptures all three layers of the aorta, massive and rapid
blood loss occurs -- an emergency situation that requires immediate surgery.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that aortic dissections resulting in rupture have an 80 percent
mortality rate, with 50 percent of patients dying before they even reach a
hospital.</P>
      <P>For those who make it to a medical facility, or those with chronic dissection,
in which the aorta could rupture at any time, the VRC lowers the operating risks
compared to the conventional treatment in which the damaged section of the aorta
is surgically replaced with an artificial graft, often made of dacron, said Wei.</P>
      <P>"The surgical risks of the suturing method are very high due to the fragility of
the dissected aorta," he noted.</P>
      <P>During surgery, the aorta and the graft are sutured together, but friction from
the sutures on the fragile inner layer of the aorta often causes secondary tears
that can lead to uncontrollable bleeding and eventual death.</P>
      <P>"That is the nightmare  for every surgeon treating aortic dissection patients,"
he said.</P>
      <P>The patients are at further risk because they are forced to undergo a
potentially  8-12 hour operation during which blood circulation may be
interrupted several times for up to 30 minutes at a time.</P>
      <P>Wei and his team began to develop the VRC about a decade ago, based on a
sutureless graft introduced in the United States in the 1980s.</P>
      <P>Wei's metallic ring, made of titanium and shaped a bit like a section of water
pipe, differs from the U.S. design in that it has two furrows that make it
easier to secure the tube to the vascular graft and the aorta.</P>
      <P>Wei's technique involves first inserting the ring inside the graft and suturing
the two together. The graft and ring are then placed inside the aorta and joined
together surgically (a process called anastomosis) with nylon tapes tied tightly
outside the aorta.</P>
      <P>"The VRC allows surgeons to do a quick sutureless anastomosis in less than two
minutes,  compared with the conventional suture technique that generally takes
more than 30 minutes," he said.</P>
      <P>"Also, the risk of bleeding during the entire surgical procedure is much less
(less than 500 c.c. of blood is lost on average) than with conventional suture
techniques, " he added,  although he acknowledged that inserting any foreign
body into a patient still entails a degree of risk.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chu Tong-wei, director of Cardiosurgery Department at Lotung Poh-Ai Hospital
in Yilan County, northeastern Taiwan, who used to be a member of Wei's team,
said he would recommend the VRC to any aortic dissection patients.</P>
      <P>"The VRC significantly reduces surgery time and the complications induced by the
heart-lung machine, such as brain ischemia (insufficient oxygen) and kidney
failure," he said.</P>
      <P>Wei's trailblazing device has yet to be widely accepted by Taiwan's conservative
medical community, but Chu expects fellow cardiovascular surgeons to begin using
it when the short-, mid- and long-term results of its use on patients have been
published in prestigious medical journals.</P>
      <P>Dr. Kuan-ming Chiu, director of the Cardiovascular Center at the Far Eastern
Memorial Hospital, is one of those who would like to see the longer term
prognosis of patients with the device before giving it his full support.</P>
      <P>"If the ring is proved to be as trustworthy as the artificial heart valve ring,
which has been in use for decades, then any lingering doubts will be put to
rest," Chiu said.</P>
      <P>Exposing any patient to a foreign body carries risks, Chiu went on, adding that
it is not yet clear if the VRC, when exposed to blood, will trigger tissue
reaction or biocompatibility issues.</P>
      <P>The VRC might also lead to blood clots, possibly caused by wear to the ring's
titanium surface, Chiu said.</P>
      <P>But he stressed that if compatibility and wear questions are addressed, then the
VRC will prove to be of great help to surgeons at smaller hospitals and give
their patients a better chance of survival.</P>
      <P>Wei, who has already obtained patents for the VRC in Taiwan, China and Japan,
said he "would welcome the use of the VRC by local and foreign medical
institutions, " hoping that it could benefit more patients like Tu Hsing-hwa, a
56-year-old freelance graphic designer who had the device inserted last
December.</P>
      <P>Tu experienced terrible back pain Oct. 29, 2008, which he described as like
"being stabbed from behind,' and the pain quickly spread to his chest.</P>
      <P>Diagnosed at a city hospital with aortic dissection, he was later told by a
bigger hospital that the survival rate from surgery was only 20 percent.</P>
      <P>Instead of operating, the hospital gave Tu medication to control his blood
pressure and discharged him, but he knew the aorta could rupture at any time and
sought out Wei, who also found he had coronary artery blockage.</P>
      <P>Tu underwent surgery Dec. 24 and was able to get out of bed the very next day.
With nearly two months having passed without incident since the operation, Tu
said he felt happy about gaining a new lease on life.</P>
      <P>"It gave me a big shock when I found out I was so close to death, " recalled Tu.
"I'm grateful to Dr. Wei and his life-saving device." ENDITEM/Is ***** *****

    <HEADLINE>CECA with China no solution to Taiwan's economic woes: scholars</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  19 (CNA)
02/19/09  14:51:24
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several scholars slammed the government Thursday over its decision to sign a
Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) with China, saying that the
Ma Ying-jeou administration should take charge of rescuing Taiwan's sliding
economy rather than putting all its hopes on China.</P>
      <P>The scholars made the remarks at a seminar titled "The Myths and Disasters of
Signing a CECA," which was hosted by Taiwan Advocates, a think tank set up by
former President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>The possibility of signing a CECA with Beijing has been widely discussed over
the past few months, and has spurred criticisms from the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, which fears that the issue will involve delicate political
issues that will give rise to serious social conflicts in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the quasi-official Strait Exchange Foundation
(SEF), said a day earlier that while the Taiwan government has decided that it
will sign a CECA with China at some point in the future, the SEF and its
counterpart in Beijing, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS), will not ink such an accord during their upcoming third round of
negotiations.</P>
      <P>However, the scholars at Thursday's forum warned that there is more at stake
than just the removal of cross-Taiwan Strait trade barriers.</P>
      <P>The CECA would be tantamount to "de facto unification" of Taiwan and China
because no matter what name the agreement is given, it is aimed at removing
restrictions for the cross-strait movement of commercial products, personnel and
capital, said Kenneth Lin, a National Taiwan University economics professor.</P>
      <P>After inking a CECA with Beijing, the only thing that would be left for the
ruling Kuomintang to do is to forge an accord with the Communist Party of China
to end civil war of their own and realize the goal of "de jure unification" of
the two sides, Lin said.</P>
      <P>He contended that Ma should take the lead to rescue Taiwan's slumping economy
instead of depending on China.</P>
      <P>The Ma administration should integrate government agencies into its plan to
expand domestic demand, instruct the Central Bank to help small- and medium-
sized enterprises by granting them loans, and give assistance to industries such
as renewable energy and the highly innovative sectors, he suggested.</P>
      <P>Hong Tsai-lung, an associate research fellow at Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, shared this view, saying at the forum that there are too many myths
about the value of a CECA with China, and describing the possible agreement as
"a rose with thorns."</P>
      <P>Some of the myths are that the CECA would facilitate the normalization of cross-
strait economic and trade relations and that it would create a good foundation
for Taiwan to ink free trade agreements (FTAs) with the United States and Japan,
he said.</P>
      <P>"The  CECA  will  extend  far beyond  economic  and trade normalization, " Hong
said. "It will deepen Taiwan's dependence on China, and we definitely should not
put all our eggs in one basket."</P>
      <P>"Unlike individual businessmen or companies, a government cannot talk only about
economic interests and avoid political issues," he said.</P>
      <P>Hong contended that a CECA with Beijing should be considered only on condition
that Beijing agrees to stop boycotting Taiwan's efforts to sign FTAs with other
countries and that China does not insist on prerequisites such as recognition of
its one-China principle.</P>

      <P>A cargo and passenger ferry, Ocean LaLa, is slated to begin service on the
Keelung-Xiamen-Makong route in April, an official with the Kaohsiung Harbor
Administration's Magong office said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based Excalibur International Marine Corp., which owns Ocean LaLa,
has filed an application  with the Ministry  of Transportation and
Communications to operate on the route, according to Han Chi-yang, vice chief
executive of the company.</P>
      <P>If the application is approved as expected, the Ocean LaLa will begin service in
April, sailing every Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday from Keelung Harbor
in northern Taiwan, to Xiamen in China's southeastern Fujian Province, then to
Magong in Taiwan's outlying island of Penghu and returning to Keelung the same
day, said Chang Ya-fu, director of the Magong office of the Kaohsiung Harbor
Administration.</P>
      <P>The previously Spain-registered Ocean LaLa was built in Singapore in 2004,  and
plied the Spain-Morocco  route before Excalibur International bought it for
NT$770 million (US$22.32 million).</P>
      <P>The 2,292-ton Ocean LaLa can accommodate 540 passengers, 54 private vehicles and
six tour buses.</P>
      <P>Excalibur International began operating a passenger and cargo ferry route
between Taichung and Magong Oct. 29, 2008, but later suspended the service.</P>
      <P>The Ocean LaLa is expected to offer visitors between Taiwan and China a new
travel option, which will include a transit stop in Penghu -- about 41
kilometers off the southwest coast of Taiwan proper -- and thus give the
offshore island a chance to develop as a logistic hub in East Asia, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The owner of another cargo vessel has filed an application to ply the Chiayi-
Magong-Xiamen route, which if approved, would also help to expand shipping
services on Penghu Island, Chang added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has directed the Council of Agriculture (COA) to
collaborate with local governments in dealing with the outbreak of two cases of
foot-and-mouth-disease (FMD) in central Taiwan earlier this month, Government
Information Office Minister Su Jun-pin said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The COA confirmed Wednesday that FMD had broken out on two hog farms, one in
Yunlin County and the other in Changhua County.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the animals that fell ill had not been vaccinated against FMD.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu has directed the COA to investigate whether the virus found on the
two farms was the same as the one that swept the island in 1997, Su said. Liu
also urged the relevant government agencies not to let down their guard against
the disease, Su added.</P>
      <P>The 1997 epidemic prompted Taiwan to cull 3.8 million pigs and delivered a heavy
blow to Taiwan's pork exports.</P>
      <P>The COA promised to keep a close watch on the latest developments and to take
action to prevent diseased pork from reaching the market.</P>
      <P>The new outbreak will delay by at least 18 months Taiwan's application to the

      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has crafted a plan  to sharpen  the
administration's  "financial  management efficiency, " with the aim of boosting
revenues in the national coffers, Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular Executive Yuan meeting chaired by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan,
Lee said that in order to realize the plan, the MOF will take the lead with
initiatives to "save money, look for money and make money."</P>
      <P>"Governments in the past spent money to govern, but efficient governments govern
without spending too much, and the most efficient governments govern and make
money," Lee said.</P>
      <P>To save money, the administration must embrace the concept of "cost efficiency,"
he said.</P>
      <P>To look for money, the government must streamline its managerial strategies and
efficiently administer financing, he suggested.</P>
      <P>To make money, the government must adapt and develop innovative financial and
monetary policies, he added.</P>
      <P>"We hope that we can boost government revenues based on a paradigm of 'doing the
best job with the fewest resources, '" Lee reiterated.</P>
      <P>More specifically, Lee said, government-owned assets nationwide are currently
worth about NT$7.45 trillion (US$218.97 billion), with about NT$4.44 trillion
coming from lands. This is an area in which government  agencies  can hone their
new skills  in financial management, he added.</P>
      <P>He expressed hopes that public offices and state-controlled enterprises would
change their passive mindset, and instead, manage the government's assets in
active and innovative ways.</P>

      <P>The state-run Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) is offering NT$5 million
(US$144,508) in its search for a creative image to transform the chimney of a

      <P>More than 30,000 college students per day have been seeking part-time jobs since
the start of the new semester, with an average 5.5 students competing for one
such job opportunity, according statistics provided by a local online job bank
on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Despite the economic slowdown in Taiwan, there is still healthy demand on the
part-time job market in areas such as restaurants and beverage shops, the food
processing industry, shopping centers, garment accessory stores, leisure and
travel businesses, beauty parlors, and in education, the job bank Minijob.com
said.</P>
      <P>For college students,  there are greater opportunities for part-time work at
cram schools, in restaurants and in supermarket product promotion services, the
job bank said.</P>
      <P>It recommended that college freshmen, sophomores and juniors seek high paying
part-time jobs, noting that unlike college seniors they are not faced with the
pressure of finding full-time jobs.</P>
      <P>Although most part-time jobs pay around NT$100 (US$2.88) per hour, a raise is
likely after a two-month probation period and the pay could go up to NT$20,000
per month plus a bonus, the job bank said.</P>
      <P>There are also part-time jobs that pay NT$330 to NT$500 per hour for work such
as English and math tutoring of elementary school students, it added.</P>
      <P>College students should invest their time prudently in order to achieve the
maximum results, as most of them who have part-time jobs also have to attend
classes, the job bank advised.</P>

      <P>With tears in their eyes, some indigenous elders shaved their head during a
demonstration in front of the Executive Yuan Thursday to protest against a local
government's demolition plan that will leave more 100 aborigines homeless.</P>
      <P>Scores of other residents of the same communities -- Sa'owac and Kan Chin
located under the Wuling Bridge in Taoyuan County in northern Taiwan -- also
joined the protest and urged the county government to halt the plan, which they
described as "forced relocation."</P>
      <P>The protesters, mainly from the Amis tribe, reiterated their right to housing,
saying that all they want is a piece of land on which they can live permanently
and observe their traditional way of life.</P>
      <P>The communities under the bridge consist of about 100 people, most of whom are
vegetable farmers, in 41 households.</P>
      <P>The county government has ordered the demolition of the illegal structures,
saying that they are in protected waterway area that has been earmarked for a
bicycle path.</P>
      <P>However, it promised to provide housing subsidies and employment assistance to
aborigines affected by the demolition plan.</P>
      <P>But according to one of the protest organizers, Banai Wang, no concrete details
of the offer were given by the county government at a public hearing on Feb. 6
to discuss the relocation plan.</P>
      <P>The protesters said they have been relocated three times over the past 30 years,
and claimed that their plight highlights the unequal distribution of the
country's social resources and the inequity of the government's land development
policy.</P>
      <P>This has left the first-generation of "urban" aborigines homeless and the second
generation jobless, they said.</P>
      <P>Deputy Minister of the Cabinet-level Council of Indigenous Peoples Wang Chin-fa,
who came out of the Executive Yuan building to accept a petition from the
protesters, said that the central administration would have to respect the local
government's decision as it was based on the Water Act regulations.</P>
      <P>He, however, promised to hold discussions with the county government on possible
alternative solutions.</P>
      <P>The protesters said that they will hold another demonstration in front of the
Presidential Office if the dispute is not settled.</P>

    <HEADLINE>World renowned tenor to perform at Miaoli music festival</HEADLINE>

      <P>Placido Domingo, one of The Three Tenors, will perform at the Miaoli
International Music Festival slated for March 19-21 in the north-central county
of Miaoli, county officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Following early successes on the operatic stage, Domingo became a central figure
in a new era of tenors -- along with the late Luciano Pavarotti and Jose
Carreras -- late last century. The three singers reinvented classical music in
1990 when they appeared together for the first time at the football World Cup
opening as The Three Tenors, thrilling millions of people worldwide.</P>
      <P>Domingo is expected to perform March 21 at the third concert of the Miaoli music
festival, the Miaoli county government said.</P>
      <P>Brian McKnight, a multiple music award winner, and Maksim, a popular Croatian
pianist, are also scheduled to perform at the concert "to cater to all age
groups," county officials said.</P>
      <P>The Brian McKnight concert will be free, while tickets to the Maksim and Domingo
concerts will be sold at charity prices, although the exact costs are yet to be
decided.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the success of the Jose Carreras' concert in the county last year,
the officials decided to invite another tenor in the same league to perform at
the international music festival, the first of its kind to be held in Miaoli
County.</P>
      <P>The organizer of the Carreras concert last November gave out 40,000 free
tickets, but more than 50,000 people showed up on performance night, which help
to boost the county's revenues.</P>
      <P>Carreras thrilled the packed audience in the kind of show that was rarely seen
in the predominantly agricultural county.</P>
      <P>The county government spent NT$20 million (US$597,000)  to organize the Carreras
concert, on the initiative of Magistrate Liu Cheng-hung who once said that it
makes his heart ache to see Miaoli County, long considered a "cultural desert, "
left out each time a major cultural event is held in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The rare concert, open to all, also lured many visitors from outside the county
to spend money in Miaoli, a development that Liu had anticipated.</P>
      <P>The free tickets to the Carreras concert were a treat to Miaoli residents, paid
for from an NT$100 million (US$2.89 million) prize that Liu and his
administration won from the central government in an investment inducement
competition.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Spirit of 228 Incident key to Taiwan's future: 228 foundation</HEADLINE>

02/19/09  21:24:06

    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-funded Memorial Foundation of 228 announced Thursday that it will hold
a national-level ceremony in the southern city of Kaohsiung on Feb.28 to
commemorate the 62nd anniversary of the 228 Incident of 1947.</P>
      <P>This and related events would raise public awareness of the incident and teach
the younger generation about its spirit and significance, thus helping to
safeguard Taiwan's longterm survival, the foundation said.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident, which began Feb. 28, 1947, refers to the brutal crackdown on
the local population by Kuomintang (KMT) troops in March and April of that year.
This led to perhaps as many as 28,000 people being killed. Many other innocent
people, including many elite members of the society, were blacklisted and
suffered victimization.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Chen Ching-huang, president of the foundation,
said the theme  for this year's  series  of 228 commemorative events would
beTaiwan's Second Start -- Justice, Peace and 228.</P>
      <P>Only by studying and learning from the incident could people safeguard Taiwan's
identity and its long-term survival, he added.</P>
      <P>Regarding a rumor that members of some victimsfamilies were planning to throw
shoes at President Ma Ying-jeou when he attended the ceremony, Chen said he was
trying to persuade them not to since it should be a peaceful event.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen warned that Ma's reliance on China to save Taiwan's stagnant
economy was "wrong and dangerous."</P>
      <P>Such a policy was reminiscent of Taiwanese people's hopes of KMT rule after the
ROC government gained control of the island in 1945 after 50 years of Japanese
rule, Chen claimed.</P>
      <P>Excessive China fever might put Taiwan into eternal damnation with no return,he
warned.</P>
      <P>The crisis we are facing now is double what it was before because, back then, we
were only fighting the Communist Party of China (CPC) , while now we are facing
both the KMT and the CPC, he argued.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Lee Yung-te said it was sad that today's
younger generation had little idea about the 228 Incident and little interest in
learning about it, which was why the Kaohsiung city government fully supported
the event.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident is a historical tragedy, and if knowledge of it is not passed
down from generation to generation, it will be detrimental for future
development and a great shame,Lee said.</P>
      <P>Chang Yen-hsien, director-general of the 228 Incident Care Association, said the
national-level ceremony had a three-fold significance.</P>
      <P>It would be Ma's first speech about the incident as president, it would provide
a great chance to educate the younger generation about that particular period of
history, and it was an opportunity to pass on the spiritual legacy of fighting
against authority, Chang explained.</P>
      <P>In addition to the ceremony scheduled for Feb.28 in Kaohsiung, there would also
be an international film festival on human rights, 228-themed art exhibition,
memorial concert and a seminar, according to the foundation.</P>

      <P>Two-way flights between Taipei Songshan Airport and Tokyo's Haneda Airport are
projected to begin in October 2010, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Civil aviation officials from the two countries reached agreement on the
proposal raised by Taiwanese officials at a recent meeting in Tokyo, the MOFA
official said.</P>
      <P>The two airports would begin exchanging flights in October next year, once
construction of a fourth runway at the Tokyo airport has been completed, he
said. By that time, four aviation companies based in Taiwan and Japan would
offer regular flights between the two destinations, he added.</P>
      <P>The Japanese side hoped Taipei's Songshan Airport could also expand its runways
so as to accommodate airplanes capable of carrying over 200 passengers,
according to the official.</P>
      <P>Tokyo's Haneda Airport serves alomost all domestic flights and a limited number
of international flights, while Taipei's Songshan airport serves domestic and
cross-Taiwan Strait flights at present.</P>
      <P>Japan Airlines (JAL) President and CEO Haruka Nishimatsu, who was visiting
Taiwan, was quoted as being keen to welcome Songshan-Haneda flights as they
would reduce travel time between the two cities, according to the MOFA official.</P>
      <P>JAL currently operates eight regular daily flights between Taiwan and Japan,
carrying more than 900,000 passengers between the two countries in 2008. China
Airlines (CAL) , Taiwan's largest carrier, transported about 1.6 million
travelers between Taiwan and Japan over the same period.</P>
      <P>Establishment of two-way flights between Taipei Songshan Airport and Tokyo
Haneda Airport was one of President Ma Ying-jeou's campaign promises before he
assumed office in May last year.</P>

      <P>The government's policy of signing a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation
Agreement (CECA) with China is key to normalization of trade and economic ties
across the Taiwan Strait, and China, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chiarman Liu Te-shun said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Even though Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) would not negotiate the signing
of a CECA at the next round of cross-strait talks later this year, relevant
government agencies on both sides were doing their best to conclude the
discussions and evaluations relating to the issue, Liu said.</P>
      <P>"Once details concerning the issue are completed, negotiations with China will
begin through the SEF and ARATS, " Liu added.</P>
      <P>As the CECA is vital for normalization of trade and economic ties between Taiwan
and China, carrying out this policy is a goal every government agency should
pursue, Liu argued.</P>
      <P>Responding to concerns raised by Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, that most Taiwanese people do not understand the
content of the CECA, Liu said the MAC would do its best to inform the public and
the legislature about the content and benefits of signing a CECA with China.</P>
      <P>In addition, Liu said the MAC would keep the legislature well informed about the
content and progress of the third round of cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>As the content and principles of a CECA and a Free Trade Agreement are basically
the same, the signing of a CECA with China will allow the free flow of
merchandise, services, and capital between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official organizations designated by their
respective governments to handle cross-strait matters in the absence of official
ties. The MAC supervises SEF operations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No zero interest rate in Taiwan despite rate cuts: central bank</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan will not witness a zero interest rate, Perng Fai-nan, governor of the
Central Bank of the Republic of China, reiterated Wednesday while announcing a
further cut of 0.25 percentage point on the bank's key interest rates.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after the government revealed that Taiwan's economy
contracted 8.36 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008. It also adjusted downward
its economic forecast, predicting that the country's economy would shrink by
2.97 percent in 2009.</P>
      <P>From Thursday, the benchmark discount rate would be lowered to 1.25 percent, the
secured loans rate to 1.625 percent, and the unsecured loans rate to 3.5
percent, the bank said.</P>
      <P>The interest rate cut was the seventh cut since Sept. 25, 2008. Despite the
consecutive cuts totaling 2.375 percentage points, Perng said that Taiwan had no
plans to reduce interest rates all the way to zero percent.</P>
      <P>Perng said the rate-cut decision was made to help boost domestic demand, given
that the economic growth rate was expected to fall as a result of a sharp drop
in exports due to the worldwide economic slump.</P>
      <P>According to the latest government forecast, the consumer price index (CPI)
would fall by 0.82 percent this year, while domestic interest rates would remain
in the positive territory, Perng said, adding that consequently Taiwan would not
enter an era of zero interest rate.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan's one-year deposit interest rate was still higher than
Singapore's 0.65 percent, Hong Kong's 0.45 percent, and Japan's 0.25 percent per
annum.</P>
      <P>With the interest rate cuts, depositors would see their interest income shrink,
but borrowers would see their interest payment burden eased, Perng added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, monetary analysts forecast Taiwan's central bank would further cut
its benchmark discount interest rate to between 0.5 percent and 1 percent in the
middle of this year in line with the looser monetary policy adopted by the bank.</P>
      <P>Fu Ming-tsai, a financial analyst at the Taiwan branch of Standard Chartered
Bank, predicted that the benchmark discount interest rate will be lowered to 1
percent in mid-2009 as the government would continue its looser monetary policy
in a bid to stimulate the economy.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, Kevin Hsiao, head of UBS Wealth Management Research in Taiwan,
forecast Taiwan would see a benchmark discount interest rate of 0.5 percent
later in the year.</P>
      <P>Fu said that Taiwan's economy was weaker than the market expected, due mainly to
a steep fall in exports, a problem with exports inventory adjustment, sluggish
domestic demand, and low interest by the private sector to invest.</P>
      <P>Fu forecast that a government-initiated public infrastructure construction
program package --  particularly a NT$500 billion economic stimulus project --
and domestic consumption would be key to Taiwan's economic recovery in the
second half of this year.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's National Palace Museum (NPM) and the Palace Museum in Beijing have
reached a nine-point consensus on closer cooperation and exchange, NPM Director
Chou Kung-shin said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at Taoyuan International Airport upon returning
from China, Chou said that, without touching on sensitive designation and legal
issues, the two museums reached a consensus on academic, archive and art-
conservation exchanges, as well as on publication and exhibition cooperation.</P>
      <P>"The two museums also agreed to strengthen museum-to-museum exchanges based on
the principle of parity and to engage in in-residence visit exchanges," Chou
said.</P>
      <P>"Yet we have not signed any agreements for the cooperation and exchange
programs. There were only meeting minutes," she explained.</P>
      <P>Chou labeled her just-concluded visits to the Palace Museum in Beijing and
Shanghai Museum as fruitful and rewarding despite tight schedules.</P>
      <P>Responding to a foreign wire-service journalist's question as to whether and
when valuable NPM artworks would be transported across the Taiwan Strait to be
exhibited in China, Chou said she had initiated the "first stage" mission, and
the "second stage" mission should be done by people upstairs.</P>
      <P>"I would not speculate on it. There is no timetable for this matter because
there are national policies involved," she continued.</P>
      <P>Chou led an NPM delegation to visit Beijing Feb. 14-16, during which she met
with Beijing Palace Museum's curator Zheng Xinmiao, marking the first formal
engagement between the staff of the two museums since Taiwan and China split
following the civil war 60 years ago.</P>
      <P>Chou visited Shanghai Museum Feb. 17-18, where she also met top officials and
discussed feasible cooperative programs and steps to execute them.</P>
      <P>The NPM in suburban Taipei is home to the cream of the 1,000-year Chinese art
collection, while the rest is held by several Chinese museums, particularly the
Palace Museum in Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Palace Museum in Beijing has agreed, on a case-by-case premise, to lend its
Taiwan counterpart 29 Qing dynasty artifacts for a three-month exhibition that
will begin in October this year.</P>
      <P>Beijing's loan of its collection to Taipei will make possible the first display
of the imperial artifacts under one roof since they were split up six decades
ago.</P>

      <P>In yet more evidence of the economic slowdown, the number of foreign laborers in
the manufacturing sector in the southern port city of Kaohsiung fell below that
of foreign caregivers in January for the first time, the city's Bureau of Labor
Affairs said Thursday.</P>
      <P>At around 6,380, the number of foreign laborers made up only 49 percent of the
citys entire alien working population which stood at 12,900 last month, bureau
statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The bureau attributed the decline to premature rescissions of contracts by
Taiwanese manufacturers starting last October due to decreasing demands from
industry. Meanwhile, an increasing need for caregivers providing long-term
assistance reflected its own growth.</P>
      <P>With a high domestic unemployment rate, the bureaus chief secretary, Li Huan-
hsun, said that opinions remained varied regarding whether hiring foreign
workers would affect job opportunities for Taiwanese citizens.</P>
      <P>As part of the efforts to avoid possible negative consequences, however,  the
labor bureau has imposed stricter measures when examining foreign worker
applications so that opportunities are only given to those who will complement
the particular needs of domestic industries on a dynamic basis, bureau officials
said.</P>
      <P>The number of foreign workers in Kaohsiung City has averaged around 13,700 in

      <P>Chinese real estate commercials would remain prohibited in Taiwan, Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said Thursday following careful
evaluation and discussions between the Cabinet-level council and the Ministry of
the Interior (MOI).</P>

of local  real estate  and land  developers associations.</P>
      <P>Most of the representatives disagreed with the proposal of lifting the ban on
Chinese real estate commercials at this time of economic hardship, Liu said.</P>
      <P>As the government is trying to boost the nation's economy by stimulating
domestic spending, Liu said, realtors would not like to give the wrong idea that
they are encouraging the Taiwanese public to invest in China's real estate
market.</P>
      <P>Liu said this was the best policy at the present since Taiwan was facing a great

      <P>Hsinchu City Mayor Lin Junq-tzer launched a campaign Thursday urging the public
to carry canteens instead of buying bottled water, so as to save resources.</P>
      <P>Lin's call on students and office employees to carry their own canteens and
thereby support the city's environmental protection drive was supported by a
wide cross section of people attending his press conference.</P>
      <P>Every liter of bottled water wastes resources equivalent to consumption of 17.5
liters of water, Lin argued.</P>
      <P>The mayor  said he would  ask the city's  education  and environmental
protection bureaus to take charge of promoting the campaign in the hope that
each citizen would do his or her share to cherish the planet by gradually
quitting the habit of drinking bottled water.</P>
      <P>Tu Chi-shian, deputy director-general of the Hsinchu Science Park

      <P>The government's policy of signing a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation
Agreement (CECA) with China is key to normalization of trade and economic ties
across the Taiwan Strait, and China, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chiarman Liu Te-shun said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Even though Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) would not negotiate the signing
of a CECA at the next round of cross-strait talks later this year, relevant
government agencies on both sides were doing their best to conclude the
discussions and evaluations relating to the issue, Liu said.</P>
      <P>"Once details concerning the issue are completed, negotiations with China will
begin through the SEF and ARATS, " Liu added.</P>
      <P>As the CECA is vital for normalization of trade and economic ties between Taiwan
and China, carrying out this policy is a goal every government agency should
pursue, Liu argued.</P>
      <P>Responding to concerns raised by Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, that most Taiwanese people do not understand the
content of the CECA, Liu said the MAC would do its best to inform the public and
the legislature about the content and benefits of signing a CECA with China.</P>
      <P>In addition, Liu said the MAC would keep the legislature well informed about the
content and progress of the third round of cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>As the content and principles of a CECA and a Free Trade Agreement are basically
the same, the signing of a CECA with China will allow the free flow of
merchandise, services, and capital between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official organizations designated by their
respective governments to handle cross-strait matters in the absence of official
ties. The MAC supervises SEF operations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Inking of CECA key to normalization of economic ties: MAC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's policy of signing a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation
Agreement (CECA) with China is key to normalization of trade and economic ties
across the Taiwan Strait, and China, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chiarman Liu Te-shun said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Even though Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) would not negotiate the signing
of a CECA at the next round of cross-strait talks later this year, relevant
government agencies on both sides were doing their best to conclude the
discussions and evaluations relating to the issue, Liu said.</P>
      <P>"Once details concerning the issue are completed, negotiations with China will
begin through the SEF and ARATS, " Liu added.</P>
      <P>As the CECA is vital for normalization of trade and economic ties between Taiwan
and China, carrying out this policy is a goal every government agency should
pursue, Liu argued.</P>
      <P>Responding to concerns raised by Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, that most Taiwanese people do not understand the
content of the CECA, Liu said the MAC would do its best to inform the public and
the legislature about the content and benefits of signing a CECA with China.</P>
      <P>In addition, Liu said the MAC would keep the legislature well informed about the
content and progress of the third round of cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>As the content and principles of a CECA and a Free Trade Agreement are basically
the same, the signing of a CECA with China will allow the free flow of
merchandise, services, and capital between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official organizations designated by their
respective governments to handle cross-strait matters in the absence of official
ties. The MAC supervises SEF operations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Number of foreign laborers lower than caregivers in Kaohsiung</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In yet more evidence of the economic slowdown, the number of foreign laborers in
the manufacturing sector in the southern port city of Kaohsiung fell below that
of foreign caregivers in January for the first time, the city's Bureau of Labor
Affairs said Thursday.</P>
      <P>At around 6,380, the number of foreign laborers made up only 49 percent of the
citys entire alien working population which stood at 12,900 last month, bureau
statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The bureau attributed the decline to premature rescissions of contracts by
Taiwanese manufacturers starting last October due to decreasing demands from
industry. Meanwhile, an increasing need for caregivers providing long-term
assistance reflected its own growth.</P>
      <P>With a high domestic unemployment rate, the bureaus chief secretary, Li Huan-
hsun, said that opinions remained varied regarding whether hiring foreign
workers would affect job opportunities for Taiwanese citizens.</P>
      <P>As part of the efforts to avoid possible negative consequences, however,  the
labor bureau has imposed stricter measures when examining foreign worker
applications so that opportunities are only given to those who will complement
the particular needs of domestic industries on a dynamic basis, bureau officials
said.</P>
      <P>The number of foreign workers in Kaohsiung City has averaged around 13,700 in
recent years, according to official statistics.</P>

      <P>The government's plan to sign a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement
(CECA)  with China complied with the country's law governing the development of
cross Taiwan Strait relations, Taiwan's top China-policy planner said Friday.</P>
      <P>Signing a CECA with China -- which aims to allow free flow of merchandise,
services, and capital between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait -- conformed
with stipulations of the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of

      <P>One day earlier, MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said that since the CECA is vital
for normalization of trade and economic ties between Taiwan and China, bringing
this plan to fruition was a goal every government agency should pursue.</P>
      <P>At present, there is no timetable for the signing of such an agreement, and it
is not expected to be broached at the next round of negotiations between

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to seek resumption of pork exports to Singapore</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 20 (CNA)
02/20/09  14:41:05

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) pledged Friday to seek to negotiate with
Singapore for resumption of pork exports,  which  were  suspended  in the wake
of the latest foot-and-mouth outbreak in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Singapore's Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) announced Thursday its
decision to suspend the import of pork and pork products from Taiwan in the wake
of the report of FMD infections in two hog farms in the central Taiwanese
counties of Yunlin and Changhua earlier this month.</P>
      <P>COA Vice Minister Wang Cheng-teng confirmed that Taiwan had informed the
Singaporean authorities of the FMD outbreak and that pork exporters had also
taken the initiative to withhold exports to Singapore.</P>
      <P>Wang said chances were good that exports could be resumed in the future, as
Singapore does not raise hogs of its own but relies on imports.</P>
      <P>Singapore last banned Taiwanese pork imports in 1997 following a previous FMD
outbreak and only lifted the ban in 2007.</P>
      <P>AVA data shows that Singapore imported 999 metric tons of pork and pork products
from Taiwan in 2008, which accounted for less than 1 percent of Singapore's pork
and pork product market.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Singapore is a significant market for Taiwan's farmers with more
than half of annual exports of around 1,400 metric tons of fresh or frozen pork
going to the island state in recent years, COA figures show.</P>
      <P>Before the 1997 outbreak of FMD -- a highly contagious viral disease that mainly
affects cloven-hoofed animals -- Taiwan raised as many as 12 million hogs per
year, with the meat from 7 million being exported to Japan, according to the
COA.</P>
      <P>Taiwan now raises about 6.4 million hogs a year, mainly for domestic
consumption.</P>
      <P>The latest FMD outbreak occurred just as Taiwan was working toward the goal of
being listed as a fully FMD-free country, after having been recognized by the
World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as an "FMD-free country with
vaccination" thanks to its efforts to eliminate the disease over the past
decade.</P>
      <P>According to OIE regulations, a country is entitled to apply for FMD-free status
if no fresh FMD cases are reported within one year after suspension of anti-FMD
vaccination.</P>
      <P>The COA originally planned to file such an application in May next year, but now
the application will have to be delayed for at least 18 months.</P>
      <P>As a result of the outbreak, the wholesale price of hogs in Taiwan dropped from
NT$60.89 per kilogram Wednesday to NT$57.25 per kilogram Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a bid to stabilize hog prices, hog farmers agreed Thursday to reduce pork
production by 5 percent after discussing the issue with the COA.</P>

      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan ( AIT) said Friday that it has invited three
renowned American artists to participate in the 2009 Taiwan International
Festival (TIF) , which will host 12 productions from around the world.</P>
      <P>Opening on Friday and running until April 3, the first TIF has the slogan
"Vision of the future" and encompasses drama, music, and dance performances.</P>
      <P>"The AIT is pleased to co-sponsor the 2009 Taiwan International Festival,
organized by the National Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Center," the AIT said in a
press release, adding that it has invited respected theater director Robert
Wilson, cellist Maya Beiser and composer Philip Glass to the event.</P>
      <P>Calling Wilson as an "internationally acclaimed figure in the theater world,"
the AIT said that his production of "Orlando" will be performed from Feb. 21 to
March 1 at the National Theater.</P>
      <P>Wilson is "a towering figure in the world of experimental theater and an
explorer in the uses of time and space on stage. Transcending theatrical
convention, he draws in other performance and graphic arts, which coalesce into
an integrated tapestry of images and sounds," the AIT quoted the New York Times
as saying.</P>
      <P>Noting that "Orlando" is the adaptation of an influential 1928 novel by Virginia
Woolf, the Wilson's production stars actress Wei Hai-ming, one of Taiwan's most
acclaimed performers of Beijing opera, as Orlando, according to the AIT.</P>
      <P>The play will be presented in Mandarin Chinese, with Chinese and English
subtitles. Detailed program information can be found on the TIF's Web site
http://event.ntch.edu.tw/2009/tif/en/index.html.</P>
      <P>The AIT serves as the de facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan in the absence of official

      <P>Despite the political difficulties currently faced by the government, Taiwan's
garment manufacturers hope that President Ma's administration will sign a
Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) with China as soon as
possible, a garment makers leader said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chairman of the Taiwan Garment Industry Association (TGIA) Laurence Tsai told
reporters that local industries should take the initiative to cooperate and
exchange opinions with their Chinese counterparts to help facilitate the
government's efforts toward inking the CECA.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, leading garment manufacturers have cooperated with their
Chinese counterparts since 1992.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's garment industry has successfully signed a memorandum of cooperation
with the China Textile Industry Association last Dec. 12," said Tsai.</P>
      <P>The memorandum concerns cooperation in the areas of technological innovation,
brand development, and trade, explained Tsai, adding that other local industries
should follow TGIA's model so as to pave the road for the signing of a CECA with
China.</P>
      <P>"Since the signing of a complex agreement like the CECA requires a long process
of discussion, evaluation, and negotiation between the two sides, Taiwan's
industries should aggressively seek closer cooperation and communication to help
accelerate the process, " urged Tsai.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Tsai said that although discussion of the CECA is not on the agenda
for the next round of negotiations between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF)  and China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) ,
members of the two quasi-official organizations could still discuss the issue in
an informal manner.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai warned that if Taiwan does not ink the CECA before Japan, China,
South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) eliminate
mutual tariffs next year, Taiwan's export competitiveness will be jeopardized,
as the nation's exports will be subject to higher tariffs in ASEAN member
nations.</P>
      <P>According to the SEF, the principals and contents of a Free Trade Agreement
(FTA) and a CECA are basically the same, and are also consistent with the
principles of the Most Favored Nations Status (MFN) in the World Trade
Organization (WTO), so the signing of a CECA will allow the free flow of
merchandise, services, and capital between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's leading accreditation body has inked a memorandum of understanding
(MOU) with its Thai counterpart aimed at bolstering bilateral cooperation  and
exchanges,  the government announced Friday.</P>
      <P>The deal between the Taiwan Accreditation Foundation (TAF) and the Department of
Science Service (DSS) under the Thai Ministry of Science  and Technology  is
another  indication  that Taiwan's accreditation system is used as a model by
developing countries, said Chen Jay-san, director-general of the Bureau of
Standards, Metrology and Inspection under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's certification system has also been adopted by Japan, Saudi Arabia and
Malaysia in the past, Chen added.</P>
      <P>After the signing of the MOU, Chen said the TAF and DSS will jointly  certify
common client bodies and begin exchanges  of accreditation skills in areas of
shared interest.</P>
      <P>Taiwan established its own accreditation system, referred to as CNLA at the
time, in 1990. The CNLA later became among the first signatories  of  the  Asia
Pacific  Laboratory  Accreditation Cooperation's mutual recognition arrangement.</P>
      <P>It switched its name to the current TAF in 2003.</P>
      <P>As the only national accreditation body in Taiwan, TAF recognizes and promotes
organizations by assessing, based on international standards and criteria, their

    <HEADLINE>Court clears ex-DPP chief and 15 'Red Shirt' demonstration leaders</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, the former chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
was found not guilty Friday of charges that he led an unapproved parade against
then-President Chen Shui-bian in Taipei in October 2006.</P>
      <P>Also cleared by the Taipei District Court were 15 other leaders of the
demonstration, known as the Red Shirt campaign because the movement's
participants all donned red shirts.</P>
      <P>Shih had previously vowed that he would not appeal the ruling if he were found
guilty.</P>
      <P>Shih, who served as the DPP's chairman from 1994 to 1996, later had a falling
out with the party he once headed and in August 2006 organized a movement that
pushed for Chen to step down from office over corruption allegations.</P>
      <P>A demonstration to unseat the president, which took place in the square in front
of the Presidential Office, was launched in early September and lasted for more
than one month.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 10, 2006, Shih staged a parade in Taipei without the authorities'
approval that attempted to surround the Presidential Office as Chen was
presiding over a celebration of the country's national day.</P>
      <P>He, as well as 15 co-leaders, were later indicted for illegal assembly.</P>
      <P>The veteran politician, who spent a total of 25 years in jail as a political
dissident, said he would rather go to jail than appeal any guilty ruling against
him to highlight the injustice of the assembly law, which he claims restricts
people's right to protest.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan, Hong Kong should have official communication conduit: SEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong Kong,  Feb. 20 (CNA)
02/20/09  17:16:01

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and Hong Kong should maintain an official, or at least semi-official,
communication channel to ensure better exchanges between the people from the two
sides, the deputy chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) ,  Kao
Koong-lian, said Friday.</P>
      <P>Kao, who also doubles as secretary-general of the quasi-official SEF, said that
presently, Taiwan and Hong Kong seem to have no channel through which they can
communicate normally.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a seminar with a group of representatives of civic groups in
Hong Kong and members of Hong Kong's business sector, Kao said that although the
Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) has set up an office in Taiwan, it
has been operated as a private company focused solely on business and trade
affairs.</P>
      <P>"The office's functions are quite different from what Taiwan had originally
envisioned," Kao said.</P>
      <P>"We think that existing liaison offices between Taiwan and Hong Kong should be
upgraded to official or semi-official levels because if these offices are purely
private, they are actually redundant, since there are plenty of private
organizations in Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and Macau that are in contact with
each other, " Kao said.</P>
      <P>As business and trade between Taiwan and Hong Kong grows, trade disputes will
inevitably occur, necessitating official intervention if the problems are to be
solved, he added.</P>
      <P>Kao argued, therefore, that Hong Kong's liaison office in Taiwan should not only
collect  trade information,  but also collect information and relay opinions to
governments of both sides.</P>
      <P>He added that the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, Hong Kong's
governmental agency in charge of Taiwan affairs, has interacted with Chung Hwa
Travel Service, Taiwan's official liaison office in Hong Kong, in the past, but
only in a private or unofficial manner.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kao said, the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region has not established an office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The HKTDC office in Taiwan has been authorized only to handle business and
trade activities, rather than solve problems facing Hong Kong residents staying
in Taiwan, such as the loss of travel documents or identification papers," he
said.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung City Government launched a drive Friday to encourage the public to
speak their mother tongues on the eve of the International Mother Language Day.</P>
      <P>The city government's  Bureau of Education,  Commission of Indigenous Affairs,
and Commission of Hakka Affairs held a news conference to promote the "2009
International Mother Language Day, Speak One's Mother Tongue Loudly" drive.</P>
      <P>Hakka elementary school students as well as their peers from indigenous Amis,
Paiwan and Rukai tribes, also sang songs in their own mother tongues to the
delight of the spectators.</P>
      <P>"In the past, people stressed that language is a communication tool, overlooking
the cultural value of their mother language, " and some mother tongues have
vanished because of this, said Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Lee Yung-te.</P>
      <P>To create a pluralistic environment for students to learn their mother
languages, Lee noted that Mayor Chen Chu has instructed that even if there is
only one student who wishes to learn a mother tongue, the school will be
required to offer a class to teach it.</P>
      <P>Lee also expressed the hope that mother languages will not only be "classroom"
languages, but languages that are actually used in daily life.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No FMD cases reported from outside of Yunlin, Changhua: COA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 20 (CNA)
02/20/09  18:10:24
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the Council of Agriculture (COA) said only two counties --
Yunlin and Changhua -- have reported outbreaks of foot-and-mouth-disease (FMD)
as of Friday and that the council is closely monitoring the outbreak.</P>
      <P>Answering reporters' questions at the Legislative Yuan, Chen Wu-hsiung said most
pig farms around Taiwan are clean.</P>
      <P>The recent FMD outbreak, he said, resulted from a few pig farmers failing to
wipe out the O-type virus that was blamed for triggering the first FMD outbreak
in Taiwan in 1997.</P>
      <P>Taiwan launched a program beginning in 2007 to stop giving pigs anti-FMD
vaccines in a bid to apply to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) to
be given FMD-free status. A zero-vaccine environment is one of the requirements.</P>
      <P>Through the program, the proportion of pigs in Taiwan not receiving vaccines
rose from 10 percent in 2007 to 90 percent as of August 2008, and today, most
pigs do not get the injections.</P>
      <P>"It means most pig farms are safe," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The outbreak that occurred early this month came at pig farms that had stopped
giving pigs the vaccination.</P>
      <P>The incident will delay the country's application to the OIE for FMD-free status
by at least 18 months and has led Singapore, the one country that still imports
pork from Taiwan, to temporarily suspend pork purchases from the country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Nantou County, which neighbors the FMD-affected areas, is on alert,
with over 100 pig farms in the county asked to reinforce sterilization
procedures and exercise strict controls on the entrance and exit of vehicles and
people.</P>
      <P>The head of the county's agricultural department, Chen Chao-wang, said there are
some 90,000 pigs being raised on the mostly small and medium scale farms
situated primarily in Shueili, Puli and Yuchih townships.</P>
      <P>The 1997 epidemic prompted Taiwan to cull 3.8 million pigs and delivered a heavy
blow to Taiwan's pork exports.</P>
      <P>Taiwan once raised as many as 12 million pigs per year at its peak, with 7
million exported to Japan annually, according to COA statistics. Taiwan now
raises only about 6.4 million pigs a year, mainly for local consumption.</P>

      <P>Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-bin urged schools in his city Friday to help 55
students who have dropped out of school due to their families' economic woes
return to class.</P>
      <P>"Not one student should drop out of school just because their families can't
afford tuition, " Hau said at a meeting of Taipei City secondary  school
principals.</P>
      <P>Promising that the Taipei city government will do everything in its power to
help the needy students, Hau stressed that teachers should take the initiative
to understand the financial situations of their students so that the city's
Bureau of Education can provide the necessary assistance.</P>
      <P>According to Hau, 55 students, including 47 in high school, failed to return to
school or have dropped out of school in Taipei City because of their families'
financial predicaments.</P>
      <P>"Teachers  should immediately  notify the city's Bureau of Education when they
find that a student might be forced to drop out of school due to their families'
financial difficulties, " Hau said, and he pledged that the city government
would support the students under any condition.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hau said the city government has launched a number of programs,
including the recent distribution of food vouchers and the opening of the power
education program, to assist financially challenged families or individuals who
have been affected by the global economic downturn to stay afloat.</P>
      <P>All students have the right to go to school, and the city government will do its
best to give students the best educational environment possible, Hau said.</P>
      <P>Urging teachers and principals to pay more attention to the needs of their
students, Hau said that helping people in need is far more effective and
honorable than praying to God or going to church.</P>
      <P>School principals and teachers are the "front line commanders" in the education
sector, and they should take the initiative to try to change the lives of the
students, Hau said.</P>
      <P>Such an action would not only be regarded as a great achievement but would also

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will sponsor another 10 disadvantaged
foreign children through World Vision Taiwan this year as part of the ministry's
foreign aid program, ministry officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministry has sponsored seven children since 1998, and this year it
will donate NT$84,000 (US$2,435) to World Vision Taiwan to help 10 more children
from seven countries: El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Haiti, the Dominican
Republic, Swaziland and Malawi, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Of the seven, only Malawi is not one of Taiwan's diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>In addition, the MOFA will also earmark NT$1.5 million to subsidize a program

wheelchairs, 150 pair of underarm crutches, and 10 white canes will be donated
to charity organizations in Laos, Vietnam, the Philippines and Sri Lanka, the

      <P>Another NT$1.5 million will be used to finance a program organized by the Field
Relief Agency of Taiwan to provide education and medical services in remote

improving care for disadvantaged children in northern Thailand, they said.</P>
      <P>In terms of medical services, the MOFA will commission the International
Cooperation and Development Fund to send 20 medical missions to 15 of Taiwan's
diplomatic allies this year, according to the ministry.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's foreign aid resources are limited compared with those of
advanced countries, the efforts will nevertheless help enhance Taiwan's

      <P>A charitable organization in Nantou County that has distributed  meals to needy
senior citizens since a devastating earthquake hit central Taiwan in 1999 is now
desperately in need of donations to keep it alive.</P>
      <P>The Long-Yan-Lin  Welfare  Association,  based in Jhongliao township's Longan
village, has distributed over 1 million free boxed meals to the elderly since
the devastating magnitude 7.3 earthquake rattled Taiwan on Sept. 21, 1999, said
Chen Teh-an, president of the Taichung Sungchu Rotary Club.</P>
      <P>Operations of the association, however, may soon be suspended because of
financial difficulties, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen's Rotary Club chapter donated NT$100,000 (US$2,890) to the association
Friday, hoping that it will lead to a larger stream of donations from around the
country, particularly from the business community, to enable the association to
continue helping people in need.</P>
      <P>Welcoming the donation, Long-Yan-Lin Welfare Association Chairman Chen Hsiu-fu
said the association  lacks  contacts  with big businessmen, and its growing
financial shortfalls since the onset of the global financial crunch have made it
increasingly difficult for the group to distribute meals for free.</P>
      <P>Chen  said  the association  is now considering  launching money-making
businesses to raise money for the meals, which cost more than NT$5 million a
year.</P>
      <P>In addition to distributing  free meals,  Chen said,  the association has also
initiated other charitable or social programs, such as offering financial aid to
children from disadvantaged families, providing daytime nursing home services
for the elderly and promoting community development.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Tourism Bureau wants to position the country as a pleasant and
convenient tourist destination for Muslim tourists, saying Friday that it will
provide the necessary assistance to local hotels and restaurants on how to host
Muslims.</P>
      <P>Wayne Hsi-lin Liu, director of the Tourism Bureau's International Affairs
Division, made the remarks at a seminar aimed at enticing Muslim tourists to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He was joined  by some  150 representatives  from hotels, restaurants,
recreational farms and the local Muslim community.</P>
      <P>Today's seminar is just the start of a series of efforts that the Tourism Bureau
will make to tap into the huge Muslim tourist market,Liu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan may be rich in culture and history and have stunning natural beauty and a
friendly people, but Liu acknowledged that the country lacks the knowledge of
how to welcome Muslim visitors and does not have any Halal-certified restaurants
to accommodate them.</P>
      <P>To help Taiwan become a more viable destination for the world's more than 1
billion Muslims, the Tourism Bureau intends to educate local tourism operators
about Islamic culture and assist hotels, recreation areas and restaurants in
acquiring Halal certification, Liu said.</P>
      <P>In addition to inviting international Muslim clerics and experts to carry out
on-site inspections and plan special itineraries for Muslim tourists, the
Chinese Moslem Association in Taiwan is also planning to launch a Halal
certification system so that every Muslim visitor can rest assured that they are
eating foods consistent with their beliefs in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Malaysia, with a population that is 60 percent Muslim, is the initial target of
the bureau's campaign because Malaysians enjoy 30-day visa-free entry to Taiwan,
Liu said, while India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam will
also be important target markets.</P>
      <P>In line with theTour Taiwan Years 2008-2009program, the bureau hopes to attract
tour groups with 2,000 Muslim visitors this year -- 10 times the annual average,
he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government launched theTour Taiwan Years 2008-2009 program Feb. 15,
2008, investing NT$1 billion (US$28.73 million) to boost foreign tourist
arrivals.</P>
      <P>The program's goal was to attract 4 million international arrivals in 2008 and
4.25 million in 2009, but only 3.84 million visitors arrived in Taiwan in 2008.</P>
      <P>The shortfall, however, was mostly due to fewer people coming to Taiwan to do
business, as tourist arrivals rose 7.7 percent in 2008 to 1.78 million people.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is home to more than 50,000 Muslims and has six mosques in Taipei,

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) is planning to ban the use of para-methoxy-
ethylamphetamine (PMEA) as police reports indicate that local youths are abusing
it in increasing amounts.</P>
      <P>The DOH gave advance notice Friday of its intention to control the drug's
circulation by designating PMEA as a class-3 controlled drug, which means it
cannot be used or traded by people who are not physicians, dentists and
veterinarians.</P>
      <P>According to the Criminal Investigation Bureau, laboratory checks of 30 batches
of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine) -- more commonly known by its
street name Ecstasy -- seized during police raids last year found that some of
the pills contained PMEA, which can cause organ failure and is blamed for
causing a death in Japan in 2005.</P>
      <P>Lin Jie-liang, head toxicologist at the Linkou branch of Chang Gung Memorial

    <HEADLINE>Consumer group urges bus fare increase plan to be reviewed</HEADLINE>

02/20/09  20:46:42

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation urged Friday that a proposal to raise bus fares
approved by the Directorate General of Highways (DGH) Feb. 13 be reviewed and
that the reasons justifying an increase be clearly explained.</P>
      <P>Bus fares  will rise by 20 percent  if the Ministry  of Transportation and
Communications gives the green light to the proposal, which Consumers'
Foundation Chairman Hsieh Tien-jen charged would increase the financial burden
of commuters at a time when the economy is struggling.</P>
      <P>Bus fares are generally adjusted based on 18 factors, including passenger
occupancy rates, gasoline prices, personnel costs, vehicle maintenance
expenditure and vehicle depreciation, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>This time, however, the 20 percent increase in fares proposed by bus companies
was based mainly on dwindling passenger numbers, because all other costs have
only increased by an estimated 10 percent.</P>
      <P>Low passenger volumes have kept prices on long distance west coast routes
depressed, with tickets between Taipei and Taichung costing only NT$80, far less
than the approved fare price of NT$318.</P>
      <P>But a ticket on the heavily traveled Taipei to Keelung route is about NT$55,
close to the approved fare price of NT$58, Hsieh noted.</P>
      <P>He said increasing fares dramatically because of low passenger occupancy rates
on the west coast routes would be unfair to those commuting on more popular
runs.</P>
      <P>Hsieh cited a survey conducted by the foundation that aside from residents of
Taipei City and Taipei County, 80 percent of commuters in the rest of the
country use private vehicles as a means of transportation because of the lack of
public transportation, its high cost, and the amount of time wasted.</P>
      <P>He said people who use private vehicles spend an average of NT$809  a month on
transportation,  while those using  public transportation spend an average of
NT$1,703 per month, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is a democratic country, Hsieh said, and any information related to
adjusting bus fares should be made transparent.</P>
      <P>He dismissed claims by bus companies that a substantial fare rise was needed to
reflect the increasing cost of natural rubber RSS3, saying that its price had
soared to NT$3,100/ton in July 2008 from NT$1,800/ton in 2006, but had dropped
back to NT$1,500/ton recently.</P>
      <P>Bus companies have long enjoyed privileges and benefits by operating their
routes under franchise agreements, Hsieh said, and with such advantages they
should be required to fulfill their social responsibility.</P>
      <P>Rather than seeking government subsidies or requesting fare increases to attract
more passengers, bus operators should strive to improve their service to get
through difficult financial times, Hsieh said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>World Vision ambassador calls for assistance to help Ethiopia</HEADLINE>

      <P>World Vision Taiwan's "Love Ambassador" Sylvia Chang, just back from her second
visit to Ethiopia, said Friday she was "truly amazed" at the improvement
Taiwan's help had brought to people's livelihoods there, and she urged local
residents to continue to support the group's efforts.</P>
      <P>Chang, a performing artist-turned-filmmaker, said that compared to her first
visit to the African country in 1993, she felt comforted to discover that skin
disease and malnutrition observed among local children at that time had declined
significantly.</P>
      <P>Also, with World Vision's technical assistance and irrigation program,  some
Ethiopian families have become able to sustain themselves by planting fruit
trees, vegetables and other crops, she observed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-assisted papayas, for example, were two to three times bigger than those
normally found in the country, and therefore could bring higher profits to the
farmers, she said.</P>
      <P>Although there have been considerable improvements, she urged more people to
provide financial support, as problems such as the lack of clean water, drought,
and increased food prices still threaten Ethiopia and could eventually hurt the
entire world.</P>
      <P>She said her recent visit made her rethink the relationship that human beings
have with the earth and the definitions of "poverty" and "wealth."</P>
      <P>The organization's National Director Hank Du, another member of the delegation
that made the trip, said the visit was especially meaningful because 2009 marks
the 20th year since the foundation launched its food aid program worldwide.</P>
      <P>The NT$3.5 billion (US$1 billion) the organization has collected since 1989 has
been used to help over 50 million needed people living in 85 countries, mainly
on the African continent, to gain access to nutrition as well as re-establish
their communities, he said.</P>
      <P>In the face of the domestic and global economic slowdown, he requested more
people to participate in the charity to assist people facing economic
difficulties and spread love to every corner of society and the world "like a
candle in the darkness."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Clean energy not a liability but an opportunity: VP</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Friday that the development of the nation's
green energy industry and the promotion of environmental awarareness in the
country is no longer a liability but a great opportunity that will contribute to
the nation's sustainable development.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks while attending the Olive Mountain Forum of Taipei's Young
Women's Christian Association (YWCA) , which was held to address the topics of
environmental protection and green energy.</P>
      <P>"The achievement  of sustainable  development  requires the integration of a
nation's economic,  environmental  and social components at all levels, " said
Siew, who argued that the government could turn the current economic recession
into an opportunity by investing in the development of green energy.</P>
      <P>According to Siew, the development of green industries is the most important
issue on the government's national development agenda, followed by cultural
innovation, tourism, medical care and upscale agriculture.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should protect the environment and develop sustainable energy sources as
problems such as global warming, air and water pollution, ozone layer decay and
the disappearance of species are worsening at a rapid rate, he said.</P>
      <P>To help develop green energy sources and solve these problems, the government
needs to provide incentives to the public and related industries, Siew said, and
he warned that people should not ignore the issue simply because oil prices have
fallen dramatically since hitting historic highs last July.</P>
      <P>"Japan is the perfect example, " Siew said. While inflation reached 3.5 percent
in Taiwan and 7 percent in most Asian countries when oil prices soared to US$140
per barrel, Japan's inflation remained stable at 1.2 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>A country with as few resources as Japan did not suffer from the spike in oil
prices because it had already developed sustainable energy sources and were not
so heavily dependent on overpriced oil, Siew said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he stressed that the idea of green energy and environmental
protection  awareness should be promoted through education.</P>
      <P>"We need to let the future leaders of our country understand the importance of
environmental protection and the development of green energy industry," he said.</P>
      <P>Siew stressed that the government and local industry should not only help
develop the green energy sector for economic purposes.</P>
      <P>"By switching the dependency on conventional sources of energy to clean energy,
we'll have a chance to allow our future generation to inherit a 'green island'
instead of a polluted one," Siew said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President not to attend weekend conference on national affairs</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will not attend a conference on national affairs to be
sponsored by two opposition parties, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wang said that after the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
lawmakers  repeatedly  boycotted  Friday's  legislative proceedings, "the
significance of the president attending the meeting no longer exists."</P>
      <P>He said that Ma was scheduled to visit Hsinchu Saturday, but had considered
postponing the visit to Sunday and had "in fact decided to attend the weekend
conference."</P>
      <P>But the Presidential Office "regretted" the development in the Legislative Yuan
Friday afternoon when DPP lawmakers converged in front of the podium to prevent
Premier Liu Chao-shiuan from giving his administrative report.</P>
      <P>The public expects the government to do everything it can to address the
country's economic woes, but the DPP had hampered the government's s efforts on
the issue, and the DPP "should bear full responsibility," Wang said.</P>
      <P>He argued that a "responsible political party which is sincere in seeking a
reconciliation" should not on one hand invite President Ma to attend the
conference and at the same time boycott legislative proceedings  to prevent the
premier from fulfilling his legal responsibility and delivering his report to
the public.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the Presidential Office will send an envoy to attend the
conference, Wang said that "there is no such plan."</P>
      <P>He also stressed, however, that President Ma has not given up on the possibility
of meeting with DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen to help ease the confrontation
between the ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>"The door to communicate with Tsai remains open," Wang added.</P>
      <P>In response, the DPP said Ma's declining of the invitation based on the
legislative fracas "was simply an excuse to cover his cowardice in facing public
voices."</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-tsang, director of the DPP's Department of Culture and Information,
said the government has been erratic, arrogant and deaf to public voices in
unveiling a spate of what he called "inefficient" strategies.</P>
      <P>The two-day meeting, sponsored by the DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union, will
forge private views on the crisis, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Ma's administration should not forge policy behind closed doors, and Liu's
Cabinet should not continue its bad economic policy, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu said he would not attend the conference because of other
commitments, but he would encourage other Cabinet ministers to attend and listen
to the views for the Cabinet's reference.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Friday that disrupting  legislative  sessions would
not help the country's competitiveness and urged lawmakers of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to be "rational" in fulfilling their duties.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers refused to allow Liu to deliver his administrative report earlier
in the day unless he apologized for the country's contracting economy,  which
the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics predicted Wednesday
would shrink by 2.97 percent this year.</P>
      <P>Guarded by Kuomingtang legislators who formed a circle around him, Liu
eventually gave a shortened version of his report amid an uproar from DPP
lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Responding to questions from DPP Legislator Ker Chien-ming after delivering his
report, Liu said he would apologize if the opposition party helps accelerate the
review of the government's NT$500 billion four-year economic stimulus package
focusing on increasing public works.</P>
      <P>"I will make the apology as many times as requested as long as you (lawmakers)
fulfill the people's expectations," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Friday was the first day of the Legislative Yuan's first session of the year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's inbound foreign direct investment (FDI) plunged in January compared to
a year earlier, just the latest sign of the worsening economic climate in the
region, according to statistics released Friday by the Investment Commission.</P>
      <P>Approved FDI in January totaled US$145 million, down 73 percent from a year
earlier, while the total number of approved foreign and overseas Chinese
investment projects fell 61 percent to 72, the commission said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's investment in foreign countries also dropped sharply in January, with
outbound investment falling 82.39 percent year-on-year to US$89.91 million and
the number of projects filed falling to 17, from 47 a year earlier, the
statement said.</P>
      <P>Outbound investment to China also plunged, with the value of approved
investments falling 56.31 percent to US$283 million and the number of approved
projects dropping from 72 to 23, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The dismal January figures for inbound  FDI were somewhat exaggerated by the
long Lunar New Year holiday break, a commission official said, but the first
half of February showed signs of a rebound, with Taiwan receiving US$380 million
in FDI through Feb. 17.</P>
      <P>The FDI inflows of many Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea and Hong
Kong, fell dramatically in 2008 due to the global economic downturn, according
to a commission official. Taiwan was no exception, with FDI falling 46 percent
in 2008 to US$8.23 billion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin announced Friday that he will donate 10 percent of his
monthly salary to help those in need of emergency help amid the current global
economic slump.</P>
      <P>Hau made the announcement after attending a ceremony launching the 2009 flower
season on scenic Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>Saying he agrees with the South Korean government's strategy to have its senior
officials, military officers and university heads return 10 percent of their
annual salaries to national coffers from February to help disadvantaged people
ride out the present economic storm, Hau said he will follow suit.</P>
      <P>Hau acknowledged, however, that such a strategy remained utterly inadequate to
cope with today's weakened economy, describing it as pouring a cup of water on a
burning cart of firewood.</P>
      <P>It would be more effective for the government to come up with a well-rounded
economic stimulus package, Hau stressed.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, the Taipei city government has launched a series of
programs, including issuing food vouchers, opening vocational training classes
and other courses to help disadvantaged families cope with the economic
downturn, acquire vocational skills and obtain short-term jobs.</P>
      <P>Following the lead of Singapore, which announced it would cut the salaries of
top government officials by 12 percent to 20 percent in January, the South
Korean government announced a similar program Thursday.</P>
      <P>It said that senior public servants, including officials at the deputy minister
level and higher, three-star lieutenant generals and above and university
presidents will return 10 percent of their monthly salaries to national coffers
starting in Feburary for one year, with the funds used to help disadvantaged
families hit by the current economic downturn.</P>
      <P>For failing to deliver on his campaign promise of achieving a high economic
growth rate, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak aready announced last year he
will donate his entire salary to help the underprivileged during his five-year
tenure.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin opened the 2009 Yangmingshan Flower Festival Friday in
Yangmingshan National Park in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>The annual festival will run 31 days until March 22 and give visitors the
opportunity to see various flowers in full bloom, including the Taiwan cherry,
the Kwanzan cherry -- a popular variety of flowering cherries originating in
Japan -- and multicolored azaleas and camellias.</P>
      <P>According to Fang Chan-jung, a section chief of the Parks and Street Lights
Office under the Taipei City government's Public Works Department, the theme for
this year's flower festival is "Grass Mountain Nostalgia." The Grass Mountain,
or Caoshan, was the original name of Yangmingshan.</P>
      <P>The park will present several forms of entertainment, including concerts
featuring classic songs, to bring back people's memories of old times.</P>
      <P>According to Fang, because of the good condition of the flowers and the fine
weather expected in the coming weeks, the number of visitors to the flower
festival is expected to surpass the 1.19 million recorded during the 2008
festival.</P>
      <P>The Yangmingshan Flower Festival is one of five major flower shows in Taipei
every year. It will be followed by the calla lilly season from March 27 to April
26 in the Zhuzi Lake valley -- also located in Yangmingshan National Park.</P>
      <P>The event is expected to attract over 700,000 visitors to 12 hectares of calla
lily fields, which produce some 3 million flowers a year, accounting for 90
percent of Taiwan's total calla lily production.</P>
      <P>Visitors can enjoy the fun of heading to the fields and picking for themselves
the flowers they wish to buy.</P>
      <P>To accommodate people who want to go to Yangmingshan National Park to admire the
flowers, two city bus companies have added seven new bus routes leading to the
park during the two festivals.</P>

      <P>Fifty-three percent of the people surveyed are confident about the government's
performance over the next 12 months, according to a public opinion survey
released by the Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation Commission
Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey was released to coincide with the completion of President Ma Ying-
jeou's first nine months in office. Ma was inaugurated on May 20, 2008.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that approval ratings for both President Ma and Premier
Liu Chao-shiuan were on the rise, while their disapproval ratings fell.</P>
      <P>Ma had an approval rating of 43.7 percent, an increase of 0.5 percentage points
compared to the previous poll conducted in November, while Premier Liu Chao-

      <P>President Ma had a disapproval rating of 43.2 percent, and Premier Liu had a
disapproval rating of 41.3 percent, down 7.4 percentage points and 12.2
percentage points, respectively.</P>
      <P>But when asked if Premier Liu will perform better than he has to date, 38.9
percent of respondents said he would, down 10 percentage points from the 48.9
percent who felt that way in the previous poll.</P>
      <P>Overall, 41.9 percent of the public is satisfied with the Cabinet's performance,
up 1.7 percentage points from the previous survey.</P>
      <P>On the performance of Ma's administration over the next year, 53.4 percent said
they are confident, down 3.6 percentage points from the previous survey.</P>
      <P>More people were satisfied than dissatisfied  with the Ma administration's
performance on issues such as cross-strait and diplomatic relations,
transportation development, tax reform, care for the underprivileged, the
promotion of energy conservation, upgrading government integrity, environmental
protection and the handling of natural disasters.</P>
      <P>The reverse was true on the issues of investment solicitation, social order,

      <P>Aboriginal lawmakers of different political stripes unanimously urged the
government Friday to take more active steps to preserve their tribal languages,
which have all been listed by the United Nations as on the brink of extinction.</P>
      <P>According to an investigative report released recently by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) , the languages of
all 14 of Taiwan's officially recognized indigenous tribes are threatened with
extinction.</P>
      <P>Legislator  Chen  Ying  of the main opposition  Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said the education system adopted by the ruling Kuomintang during its
uninterrupted hold on power from 1945 through May 2000 was the number one
culprit in the disappearance of Taiwan's aboriginal languages.</P>
      <P>Even though the government  has begun efforts  to protect indigenous tribal
languages in recent years, Chen said it has not done enough to reverse the
trend.</P>
      <P>She suggested that the government should ease accreditation requirements for
tribal language teachers so that more people speaking indigenous languages can
be allowed to teach aboriginal children their mother tounges at elementary
schools.</P>
      <P>Tutoring fees for those teachers should also be raised to encourage younger
indigenous people to study their own languages, she suggested.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kung Wen-chi of the ruling Kuomintang said the government should

    <HEADLINE>Indigenous lawmakers call for preservation of tribal languages</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Aboriginal lawmakers of different political stripes unanimously urged the
government Friday to take more active steps to preserve their tribal languages,
which have all been listed by the United Nations as on the brink of extinction.</P>
      <P>According to an investigative report released recently by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) , the languages of
all 14 of Taiwan's officially recognized indigenous tribes are threatened with
extinction.</P>
      <P>Legislator  Chen  Ying  of the main opposition  Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said the education system adopted by the ruling Kuomintang during its
uninterrupted hold on power from 1945 through May 2000 was the number one
culprit in the disappearance of Taiwan's aboriginal languages.</P>
      <P>Even though the government  has begun efforts  to protect indigenous tribal
languages in recent years, Chen said it has not done enough to reverse the
trend.</P>
      <P>She suggested that the government should ease accreditation requirements for
tribal language teachers so that more people speaking indigenous languages can
be allowed to teach aboriginal children their mother tounges at elementary
schools.</P>
      <P>Tutoring fees for those teachers should also be raised to encourage younger
indigenous people to study their own languages, she suggested.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kung Wen-chi of the ruling Kuomintang said the government should
enact an indigenous languages development law to better protect tribal
languages.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei of the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union said many
factors have contributed  to the decline of tribal languages, including the ban
on the use of tribal languages during the 50 years of Japanese colonial  rule
and the ensuing KMT government's biased attitude toward them.</P>
      <P>In her view, Kao Chin said the current government should devote more resources
to encourage the study of indigenous tribal languages.</P>

      <P>Fifty-three percent of the people surveyed are confident about the government's
performance over the next 12 months, according to a public opinion survey
released by the Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation Commission
Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey was released to coincide with the completion of President Ma Ying-
jeou's first nine months in office. Ma was inaugurated on May 20, 2008.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that approval ratings for both President Ma and Premier
Liu Chao-shiuan were on the rise, while their disapproval ratings fell.</P>
      <P>Ma had an approval rating of 43.7 percent, an increase of 0.5 percentage points
compared to the previous poll conducted in November, while Premier Liu Chao-
hsiuan had a 41.4 percent approval rating, 3.7 percentage points higher than the
last survey.</P>
      <P>President Ma had a disapproval rating of 43.2 percent, and Premier Liu had a
disapproval rating of 41.3 percent, down 7.4 percentage points and 12.2
percentage points, respectively.</P>
      <P>But when asked if Premier Liu will perform better than he has to date, 38.9
percent of respondents said he would, down 10 percentage points from the 48.9
percent who felt that way in the previous poll.</P>
      <P>Overall, 41.9 percent of the public is satisfied with the Cabinet's performance,
up 1.7 percentage points from the previous survey.</P>
      <P>On the performance of Ma's administration over the next year, 53.4 percent said
they are confident, down 3.6 percentage points from the previous survey.</P>
      <P>More people were satisfied than dissatisfied  with the Ma administration's
performance on issues such as cross-strait and diplomatic relations,
transportation development, tax reform, care for the underprivileged, the
promotion of energy conservation, upgrading government integrity, environmental
protection and the handling of natural disasters.</P>
      <P>The reverse was true on the issues of investment solicitation, social order,
educational reform and consumer price stability.</P>
      <P>The latest survey was conducted Feb. 16-17 by calling 1,078 adults, with 168
refusing to answer questions. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus
2.98 percentage points.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin announced Friday that he will donate 10 percent of his
monthly salary to help those in need of emergency help amid the current global
economic slump.</P>
      <P>Hau made the announcement after attending a ceremony launching the 2009 flower
season on scenic Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>Saying he agrees with the South Korean government's strategy to have its senior
officials, military officers and university heads return 10 percent of their
annual salaries to national coffers from February to help disadvantaged people
ride out the present economic storm, Hau said he will follow suit.</P>
      <P>Hau acknowledged, however, that such a strategy remained utterly inadequate to
cope with today's weakened economy, describing it as pouring a cup of water on a
burning cart of firewood.</P>
      <P>It would be more effective for the government to come up with a well-rounded
economic stimulus package, Hau stressed.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, the Taipei city government has launched a series of
programs, including issuing food vouchers, opening vocational training classes
and other courses to help disadvantaged families cope with the economic
downturn, acquire vocational skills and obtain short-term jobs.</P>
      <P>Following the lead of Singapore, which announced it would cut the salaries of
top government officials by 12 percent to 20 percent in January, the South
Korean government announced a similar program Thursday.</P>
      <P>It said that senior public servants, including officials at the deputy minister
level and higher, three-star lieutenant generals and above and university
presidents will return 10 percent of their monthly salaries to national coffers
starting in Feburary for one year, with the funds used to help disadvantaged
families hit by the current economic downturn.</P>
      <P>For failing to deliver on his campaign promise of achieving a high economic
growth rate, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak aready announced last year he
will donate his entire salary to help the underprivileged during his five-year
tenure.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's inbound foreign direct investment (FDI) plunged in January compared to
a year earlier, just the latest sign of the worsening economic climate in the
region, according to statistics released Friday by the Investment Commission.</P>
      <P>Approved FDI in January totaled US$145 million, down 73 percent from a year
earlier, while the total number of approved foreign and overseas Chinese
investment projects fell 61 percent to 72, the commission said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's investment in foreign countries also dropped sharply in January, with
outbound investment falling 82.39 percent year-on-year to US$89.91 million and
the number of projects filed falling to 17, from 47 a year earlier, the
statement said.</P>
      <P>Outbound investment to China also plunged, with the value of approved
investments falling 56.31 percent to US$283 million and the number of approved
projects dropping from 72 to 23, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The dismal January figures for inbound  FDI were somewhat exaggerated by the
long Lunar New Year holiday break, a commission official said, but the first
half of February showed signs of a rebound, with Taiwan receiving US$380 million
in FDI through Feb. 17.</P>
      <P>The FDI inflows of many Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea and Hong
Kong, fell dramatically in 2008 due to the global economic downturn, according
to a commission official. Taiwan was no exception, with FDI falling 46 percent
in 2008 to US$8.23 billion.</P>

the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics predicted Wednesday
would shrink by 2.97 percent this year.</P>

eventually gave a shortened version of his report amid an uproar from DPP
lawmakers.</P>

review of the government's NT$500 billion four-year economic stimulus package
focusing on increasing public works.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged President Ma Ying-jeou
Saturday to replace the premier and reshuffle the Cabinet in order to rescue the
country's flailing economy.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen insisted that Premier Liu Chao-shiuan owes the
public an apology for failing to honor his promise of reversing the economic
downturn.</P>
      <P>Liu's failure is evident from the fact that the economy actually declined by
8.36 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 and is expected to shrink by 2.97
percent in 2009, she said.</P>
      <P>Tsai argued that a reshuffle is urgent because "the economy would be hopeless
unless the Cabinet is replaced."</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks while addressing the opening of a national affairs
conference jointly held by the DPP and the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union,
one day after DPP legislators blocked the premier's policy report to the
legislature to pressure him to apologize for the country's bad economic
situation.</P>
      <P>The two parties had invited  President  Ma to attend the conference, which
focused on economic issues, but Ma declined. Instead, the president called a
meeting with economic officials the same day to discuss ways to boost the
economy.</P>
      <P>At the conference, former Vice President Annette Lu offered to accept a cut this
year of NT$500,000 (US$14,705) in her annual retirement benefits, which
currently amount to NT$3.5 million, so that the government could use the money
to help the disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>The government is studying whether to reduce or waive visa fees in a bid to
attract more foreign visitors to Taiwan, an official of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lo Yu-chung, director-general of MOFA's Bureau of Consular Affairs, said that
the matter is expected to be decided by the end of March.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks amid reports that Thailand, which has seen a sharp decline
in tourist arrivals due to its political conflicts and the world financial
crisis, is planning to waive visa fees for tourists with effect from March.</P>
      <P>"Not only Thailand, but Taiwan also is studying a slate of ideas for
preferential visa treatment to attract more foreign visitors and stimulate
domestic consumption," Lo said.</P>
      <P>The proposals under consideration include reducing or waiving visa fees for
visitors from certain countries, and expanding the visa-free and landing visa
programs to include more countries.</P>
      <P>Currently, most foreign visitors to Taiwan are required to apply for a tourist
visa at a cost of US$50.</P>
      <P>Lo noted that visitors from 38 countries, including Australia, the United States
and Switzerland, as well as travelers from India, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Thailand and Vietnam who have permanent residence status in the United States or
Canada currently are entitled to visa-free entry for tourism purposes.</P>
      <P>The government is considering expanding the program to include more countries
and visitors from Southeast and South Asia who hold long-term visas for the
United States, Canada, the European Union and Japan, he added.</P>
      <P>"In the future, the government will widen its preferential visa treatment
program, but at the same time will guard against social problems that could stem
from an influx of foreign visitors," he said, citing as examples the problems of
people working illegally in Taiwan or overstaying their visas.</P>
      <P>"The MOFA will work closely with the National Immigration Agency under the
Ministry of the Interior to devise measures to avoid any possible negative
impact of the plan," he added.</P>

      <P>An incentive program introduced by the state-owned Taiwan Power Company
(Taipower) to encourage energy conservation has helped decrease household
electricity consumption by 2.84 billion kilowatt-hours (kwh) over the past eight
months, company officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The reduction means that carbon dioxide emissions were down by 1.79 million
metric tons and that the discount to consumers on electricity bills amounted to
NT$14.2 billion between July 2008 to January 2009, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The incentive program, which took effect in July 2008, allows consumers a
discount of up to 20 percent if they use the same amount or less electricity
compared with the previous year.</P>
      <P>Also, during the period Oct. 1 to Feb. 11, the government subsidized  the
purchase of more than 148,000 energy-efficient electrical  appliances by local
consumers,  with the subsidies totalling NT$300 million.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the energy consumed by Taipower decreased by 321,100 kiloliters of
crude oil equivalent in 2008, saving NT$1.7 billion in energy costs, thanks to
its energy conservation efforts,  the officials said.</P>
      <P>The efforts include cutting the heat consumption of the company's generators,
its use of electricity and its circuit rate loss, they added.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou directed the Executive Yuan Saturday to come up with
concrete plans within three months for improving Taiwan's industrial output and
boosting exports amid the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Ma gave the directive at a meeting with Premier Liu Chao-shiuan and the Cabinet
members in charge of economic and financial affairs, in a brainstorming session
convened by the president to discuss how the country can survive the current
worldwide recession.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, Ma reiterated that seeking the normalization of economic and
trade relations between Taiwan and China is at the core of his administration's
cross-Taiwan Strait policy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should take seriously the reality of the economic and trade situation in
the region and try to forge a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement
(CECA) with China, he said.</P>
      <P>The president, who floated the idea of a CECA during his election campaign last
year, asked the country's economic officials to solicit public opinion on issues
related to the inking of such an agreement.</P>
      <P>He also directed them to invite the opposition parties to participate in the
public discussions on the issue so as to gain the broadest possible consensus.</P>
      <P>Presidential  Office spokesman  Wang Yu-chih recounted  the president's
instructions at a press conference held after the meeting.</P>
      <P>Asked about opposition Democratic Progressive Party Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen's
call for a complete reshuffle of the Cabinet, Wang said "there is no such a plan
at present."</P>
      <P>Wang told the media that the president was cognizant of the executive branch's
efforts over the past nine months to deal with the country's economic problems.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Ma has praised the Cabinet for its handling of the dramatic global
economic changes, in particular the measures it took to help stimulate the
economy and lower the unemployment rate, Wang related.</P>
      <P>However, Ma urged the officials to speed up the implementation of his
administration's economic stimulus plans, and expressed the hope that the
legislature will give priority to the NT$500 billion (US$14.36 billion)  budget
for a four-year public construction program, Wang added.</P>
      <P>The president is unwilling to see the government's economic rescue programs
delayed, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The officials at the meeting were also directed by the president to devise ways
of prompting manufacturing industries to diversify and brand their products and
to acquire new techniques and technology, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ma gave instructions for more government resources to be injected
into tourism, medical services, biotech and "exquisite agriculture" industries
to give them added value, Wang said.</P>
      <P>However, the president stressed that although the government plans to invest
heavily in public projects, private investment should also be encouraged through
less restrictive laws and preferential taxation, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Ma believes that Taiwan must discover its competitive edges and plan projects
for the its long-term economic development before the global economy begins to
recover so as to take the lead in international competition in the future, Wang
said.</P>

four central and south-central counties in Taiwan drew a large number of cycling

      <P>The annual event was organized by the Cabinet-level Sports Affairs Council as
part of a government publicity campaign to raise public awareness of the
importance of conserving energy and cutting greenhouse gas emissions by
promoting the bicycle as a green mode of transportation.</P>

tour was also aimed at encouraging local people to exercise regularly and engage
more in outdoor recreational activities for physical fitness and health.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's Chinese medicine standards seen as model for U.K.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
02/21/09  21:24:23

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan can serve as a role model for the United Kingdom and can play an
important role in lifting the profile of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in
the Western world, as it has a high standard of TCM education and advanced
production technology, a group of experts from the U.K. said Saturday.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with the Central News Agency, Tony Booker, president
of the U.K. Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine, said that he was amazed by the
high level of quality control in producing TCM products and the expertise of TCM
practitioners in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He was part of a 13-member group of TCM practitioners, leading research
scientists and experts from the U.K. and Ireland, who were in Taiwan to observe
and study its practice of Chinese medicine.</P>
      <P>During their stay Feb. 16-21, the group visited the Department of Health's
Committee on Chinese Medicine and Pharmacy, China Medical University, Taipei
Chinese Medical Association, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Sun Ten
Pharmaceutical Company.</P>
      <P>"I'm particularly impressed with the care and attention Taiwanese take in the
production and the quality of Chinese medicine, putting an enormous amount of
investment into quality assurance, which is very good," Booker said.</P>
      <P>"That's something we really need to try and copy in the U.K.," he added.</P>
      <P>Brooker,  a member of the advisory board for the British government 's Herbal
Medicine Regulation Working Group (HMRWG), said Taiwan's regulations on Chinese
medicine can also serve as reference for the U.K. and that he will report to
Westminster about this.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Western nations have been gradually becoming more open-minded
about traditional medicines and TCM has been receiving great attention
worldwide. However, despite the growing popularity, there are no statutory
regulations on herbal medicine, acupuncture and TCM practitioners in the U.K.,
and herbal medicine was identified as posing risk to public health due to poor
practice.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the committees of HMRWG and the Acupuncture Regulation Working
Group (ARWG) were set up in 2002 by the British Department  of Health to
coordinate  some 15,000 U.K.  herbal practitioners of all traditions and to
consider how regulation of acupuncture and herbal medicine could best be
achieved.</P>
      <P>Brooker said that in addition to Taiwan's high standard of education in
scientific Chinese medicine, its regulations in the discipline can also serve as
a good model for the U.K.</P>
      <P>There are some areas, such as student exchanges and training programs, in which
Taiwan and the U.K. can work together for mutual benefit, he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that he has been working on some exchange programs with local
universities and hospitals, Cheng Ming-zhao, a member of the HMRWG and the head
of Middlesex University's Chinese Medicine Program, told the CNA that Taiwan's
standard of education and quality control in TCM are the advantages that can be
used to raise the profile of TCM internationally.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan can play an important role in the globalization of Chinese medicine,
Cheng said, adding that instead of having just bilateral collaboration between
Taiwan and the U.K., Taiwan, China and Europe can all work together to achieve
this goal.</P>
      <P>Michael Heinrich, head of the Centre for Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy at
London School of Pharmacy, said that Taiwan has great potential in terms of
Chinese medicine research and it will benefit from stronger international
collaboration.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A five-star rating system will be formally introduced in Taiwan for hotel
classification as part of the government's all-out efforts to promote and
upgrade the local tourist industry, tourism officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications  has
already  publicized  rating guidelines  and regulations and will begin to accept
applications for assessment in April, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, the officials said, the first batch of local hotels to join
the assessment program will be eligible to put up their formally certified star
rating signs in the middle of the year at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far not formally introduced a star rating system and many self-
proclaimed four-star or five-star hotels are rated based on discretion rather
than official authorization, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The rating system will not be mandatory, as hotels are free to decide whether
they want to join the classification program, but only those with "tourist
hotel" or "hotel" licenses are eligible to apply for rating, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The assessment will cover two stages, with architecture and facilities evaluated
in the first stage and service quality in the second stage.</P>
      <P>Only those that pass the first stage of assessment with a score of at least 301
out of 1,000 points may decide whether to proceed to the second stage of rating.</P>
      <P>Hotels that get 301 points to 600 points will be assigned a three-star rating.</P>
      <P>Those that enter the second stage of appraisal but fail to get a total score of
600 points will still be classified as three-star hotels.</P>
      <P>Hotels that want to obtain a four-star or higher rating must take part in both
hardware  facility  and software service quality assessment and obtain a total
score of more than 600 points.</P>
      <P>The star rating will remain valid for only three years, after which hotels must
again be evaluated.</P>
      <P>To spur the hotels' interest, the Tourism Bureau will foot the bill for the
first-ever rating assessment, but in the future, participating hotels will be
required to pay the costs.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau officials said they expect at least 500 of Taiwan's more than
4,000 hotels to take part in the assessment in the first year and that more than
half of the local hotels will be certified under the star rating system within
three years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Late priest's wish to establish home for disabled adults comes true</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The wish of the late Father Francis Burkhardt to set up a home for the seriously
disabled adults was realized Saturday with the inauguration of the Sacred Heart-
Francis Home in Chiayi County, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The NT$380 million facility in Putze City, Chiayi, is designed to house 200
seriously disabled people.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Chang Chun-hsiuung,  former Minister of the Interior Chang Po-ya,
Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen, Chiayi County Council Speaker Yu Cheng-
ta, Legislator Chang Hwa-kuan, Cardinal Paul Shan Kuo-hsi and Chung An-chu,
Catholic bishop of the Chiayi Parish, attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony.</P>
      <P>"The priest dedicated all his life to service in Taiwan and he was truly a most
beautiful and valuable Taiwanese," Chang Chun-hsiung said.</P>
      <P>"The inauguration of the home will bring the society a ray of sunshine, hope and
happiness," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chiayi Magistrate Chen said the construction of the home cost about NT$380
million, and that there was a shortfall of NT$50 million. He urged the public to
donate generously to help make up the shortage in funds to fully complete the
facility.</P>
      <P>Burkhardt was born in Basel City, Switzerland. He originally served in China,
spreading the Christian gospel there. He moved to Taiwan in 1959.</P>
      <P>The Catholic priest gave half a century of dedicated service to the Taiwan
people before he passed away in 2003 at the age of 101.</P>
      <P>He founded the Scared Heart Home in 1990 in Tungshih township, Chiayi County to
accommodate disabled individuals aged 5-50.</P>
      <P>However, concerned that the disabled would have no place to go when they grew
older, the priest said at his 100th birthday celebrations that he wished to
build a home for the seriously disabled adults.</P>
      <P>After he died at age 101, some who were inspired by his compassion and love
continued his mission, and a ground breaking for the Sacred Heart-Francis Home
was held in 2004.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and former Interior Minister Chang Po-ya
offered assistance to buy the land for the project from the state-owned Taiwan
Sugar Company, which once owned the land.</P>
      <P>Around 100 occupants of the Sacred Heart Home are now relocating to the Sacred
Heart-Francis Home, as the original facility is being renovated and the work is
expected to take more than a year.</P>

      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian's hunger strike is not expected to affect a
three-day pretrial session scheduled to start Feb.24 to settle technical details
regarding trial of corruption and money laundering charges against him,
prosecutors said Saturday.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks after Lee Ta-chu, deputy director of the Taipei Detention
Center, confirmed earlier in the day that Chen, who has been kept behind bar
since Dec.30, 2008, has not eaten anything for two days.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Chen only drank water while declining to eat anything. He also
refused to have his blood pressure and pulse measured, Lee said, adding that the
detention center will pay extra attention to his situation.</P>
      <P>Chiang Chih-ming, secretary of Chen's office, said Friday that Chen stopped
eating two days ago in protest against what he called continued judicial
persecution against him.</P>
      <P>Chen, who left office in May 2008 due to term limits, has been charged with
embezzling, taking bribes, money laundering, influence peddling and extortion in
the case, which also implicated his family.</P>
      <P>Chen insisted on his innocence when he appeared in the court Jan. 19 to defend
himself in a pretrial hearing. At his lawyers' request, a collegial panel of
judges at the Taipei District Court agreed at the time to postpone the Jan.20-21
pretrial session to Feb.24-26.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors investigating the case said Saturday they see no reason for any
further postponement of the pretrial hearings.</P>
      <P>Even if Chen's health is not good due to his refusal to eat, prosecutors said,
the court hearing can proceed with Chen's attorneys answering questions on his
behalf.</P>
      <P>Chen, who served as president between 2000 and May 2008, suffered a fresh blow
Friday as the Taiwan High Court rejected his appeal to replace the presiding
judge in his corruption and money laundering trial.</P>
      <P>Chen had demanded through his lawyers the removal of judge Tsai Shou-hsun, who
was ordered by the Taipei district court to take over his case last December.</P>
      <P>Some legal experts voiced concerns over the move, particularly after Tsai
reversed an earlier ruling granting Chen bail on the grounds that he could flee
the island or destroy evidence.</P>
      <P>The High Court said in a statement that it stood by the appointment.</P>
      <P>"The district court followed relevant legal procedures  in assigning the case,"
the high court said in a statement.</P>

      <P>As part of an eco-friendly drive initiated by the Cabinet-level Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) , public agencies and schools have cut down on
the use of paper cups by over 90 percent over the past year and a half, the EPA
reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>Since July 1 2007 until the end of 2008, the number of paper cups used by
government agencies and schools was 3.71 million, a steep drop of 90.19 percent
from 2006 when the number was 37.82 million, EPA statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The drive, which was launched in July 2007, resulted in a reduction of 273
metric tons of waste, calculated on an average weight of 0.008 kilograms per
paper cup, EPA officials said.</P>
      <P>EPA officials attributed the success of the initiative to regulations limiting
the use of paper cups in schools and public agencies to certain occasions and
setting goals for a reduction in use.</P>
      <P>According to EPA figures, the use of sealed cups of water and the consumption of
bottled water in government agencies and public schools in 2008 were down by
80.69 percent and 78.47 percent, respectively, from the 2006 levels. This is an
indication that non- disposable cups are being used instead of paper cups, the
agency said.</P>

the Irish and British visa lists cohere in all practical respects within the

now being followed by our U.K. colleagues," the official said.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that this process will be completed before the new U.K. arrangements
take effect, the official added.</P>
      <P>The U.K.  announced Feb.  9 that it will waive the visa requirements for Taiwan
passport holders for visits of less than six months, with effect from March 3.</P>
      <P>The Irish official, however, noted that the visa system in Ireland is different
from that in the U.K. It operates on the basis that, depending on his or her
nationality, the visitor is either visa required or they are not, irrespective
of the length of their stay or its purpose.</P>
      <P>According to the Irish government, the number of applications by Taiwanese
passport holders for entry to Ireland is around 1,200 per annum.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China government allows Ireland passport holders 30-day visa
free stay in the country.</P>
      <P>Lan Kuo-yu, a London-based Taiwanese travel agency operator, welcomed the plan
by Ireland, saying that if it follows in the U.K.'s footsteps and offers visa
free treatment for short-term Taiwanese visitors, this would definitely help to
lure more Taiwanese tourists to Ireland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President pledges NT$1.5b to fund 228 foundation</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou promised Sunday that the government will provide NT$1.5
billion (US$41 million) to the state-funded 228 Memorial Foundation over the
next few years so that it can continue its operations.</P>
      <P>Ma said that in order to raise public awareness of the 228 Incident of 1947 and
help the younger generation to understand its significance, the administration
will donate NT$300 million to the 228 Foundation each year until the foundation
has NT$1.5 billion which should be able to generate enough interest to finance
its operations.</P>
      <P>"If the interest the foundation earns from the annual allocations is not enough
to fund its operations, then the Executive Yuan will be asked to appropriate
more money to help it function," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a meeting at the Presidential Office on major
national and economic issues.</P>
      <P>On the issue of whether the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall should be renamed, Ma
said the Ministry of Education has been asked to sponsor a series of civic
forums on the matter and to inform the public of its decision before July this
year.</P>
      <P>Ma said that in addressing sensitive ethnic issues, the process is just as
important as the conclusion.</P>
      <P>Therefore, on matters pertaining to the 228 Incident and the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall, the relevant decision makers had better adopt the "decision by
consensus" approach, instead of voting on the issues, he advised.</P>
      <P>"In a vote, there is always a winner and a loser," the president said. "This
means that some people may be forced to swallow their dissatisfaction, which
could later become seeds of conflict."</P>
      <P>He said that the government should deal patiently with ethnic issues, and that
the relevant officials should listen carefully to the people -- some of whom
might be harboring misunderstandings, prejudices or strong feelings that could
be difficult to discern.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that although the government has tried hard over the past decades to
tell the people the truth and compensate the families of the victims of the 228
Incident, some research organizations remain relentless in their efforts to
uncover the facts surrounding the incident.</P>
      <P>The president commended these organizations for their tenacity, saying that
without truth, there can be no trust or peace, and that the hatred derived from
distrust can be hard to dispel.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident, which began Feb. 28, 1947, refers to the brutal crackdown on
citizens by the then Kuomintang troops in March and April of that year, which
led to an estimated 28,000 deaths. Many innocent people, including many elite
members of the society, were blacklisted and victimized.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will relax its immigration rules from the end of February to make it
easier for foreign investors to obtain permanent  residency  in the country,  as
part of the government's efforts to attract investment and boost employment, the
National Immigration Agency (NIA) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>When  the amended  regulations  take effect,  the minimum requirement for
foreign investors who wish to apply for permanent residency  in Taiwan will be
an investment  of NT$15 million (US$430,900) and the provision of three local
jobs for at least five years, the NIA said.</P>
      <P>Currently, the minimum investment under this category of applications for an
alien permanent residency certificate (APRC) is NT$30 million.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors are also eligible to apply for permanent residency if they put
NT$30 million into the NIA's "investment immigration fund" for five years, the
agency said.</P>
      <P>The NIA grants alien residency permits (ARC) to foreign investors in several
different categories based on the amount invested. Such investors who hold ARCs
for a minimum of five consecutive years and have remained in Taiwan for at least
183 days of each of those years may apply for APRCs.</P>
      <P>At present, 330 foreign investors in Taiwan hold ARCs, while 52 hold APRCs,

      <P>Eight government agencies and enterprises have joined a program to sponsor an
educational trip to Taipei for 500 underprivileged students in central and
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The program was initiated by Chang Chia-chun, a legislator of the ruling
Kuomintang. Chang represents Yunlin County, and at 28 is the youngest lawmaker
in the current legislature.</P>
      <P>Chang told reporters Sunday that she launched the program because she knows that
many students from poor families in remote areas of central and southern Taiwan
have never had an opportunity to see what life is like in a metropolis like
Taipei.</P>
      <P>The educational program would allow 500 pupils from poor families to visit
various establishments in Taipei, including Taipei Zoo, where a pair of giant
pandas from China and other rare animals, such as koala bears and King Penguins,
have become major attractions.</P>
      <P>Three government agencies -- the Children's Bureau under the Ministry of the
Interior, the Ministry of Education, and the Cabinet-level Environmental
Protection Administration -- have pledged their support for the program. Four

      <P>The public Taichung Hospital announced Sunday that elderly people from low- and
mid-income families in the city may apply for a city government subsidy to help
cover the cost of dentures.</P>
      <P>In an effort to ensure the oral health of the city's elderly, the Taichung city
government launched a program Feb. 3 under which economically disadvantaged
people aged 65 and over are entitled to a subsidy of up to NT$40,000 (US$1,150)
to cover the cost of dentures, according to Lu Yu-hsiu, a dentist at the
hospital.</P>
      <P>While nutrition is the key to good health among the elderly, most of them do not
get adequate nutrition because of eating problems associated with bad teeth,
therefore, oral health is very important, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Citing as an example a 72-year-old man, 176 cm tall, who lives alone, Lu said he
once weighed 90 kg but he lost weight and was in poor physical condition because
his bad teeth made it difficult for him to chew and he therefore became
malnourished. The problem was that he could not afford to pay for dentures, Lu
added.</P>
      <P>However, by taking advantage of the subsidy program, the elderly man can now eat
any kind of food he wants, he added.</P>
      <P>Missing teeth and tooth decay can not only lead to poor nutrition, but can also
affect social interaction and communication among the elderly, Lu noted.</P>
      <P>He urged eligible seniors to first go to the hospital, which has a contract with
the city government, and apply for an assessment and verification of their
condition by Oct. 30.</P>
      <P>Once the applicants receive the verification report, they can send it to the
Taichung City Dental Association for approval and await further notification by
the city government, he said.</P>
      <P>Under the program, each person can obtain a subsidy of up to NT$40,000 to help
cover the cost of a full set of dentures, or NT$20,000 for removable partial
dentures.</P>

      <P>Taichung City in central Taiwan and a mobile food bank run by the non-profit
Hsingshih  Foundation distributed food packages to low-income families and
homeless people Sunday at a local activity center.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that the city and the foundation were teaming up to make
use of the mobile food bank service. Some 380 food packages  were distributed
to members  of 100 underprivileged households and 120 cooked meals were handed
out to homeless people.</P>
      <P>According to Taichung City Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi, most of the people who
received the food packages were from single-parent or impoverished households.
Each package contained meat, canned food, rice noodles, fruit and vegetables in
a quantity equivalent to one month's supply for a single person.</P>
      <P>"The city government will make the distribution process more convenient and
flexible if this is done again," Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>He made the comment after observing that in some cases the packages were
collected by children whose parents were at work and after learning that some
people had come a long way from other districts to obtain the packages from the
food bank, which was parked near an activity center in the city's north
district.</P>
      <P>The Shingshih Foundation set up Taiwan's first mobile food bank in Taichung City
in 2002 to provide aid to the underprivileged. The food bank helps poor people
and avoids waste by delivering to them packages of adequate but not excessive
amounts of food.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Judicial Yuan President Lai In-jaw, in his capacity a special envoy of
President Ma Ying-jeou, called on St. Lucia Prime Minister Stephenson King
Saturday on the occasion of the Caribbean nation's 30th anniversary of
independence.</P>
      <P>Lai delivered a letter from Ma and relayed the president's greetings to King.
Lai thanked St. Lucia for its support for Taiwan's bid to join international
organizations and invited King to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response, King expressed appreciation for Taiwan's assistance to his island
country in the areas of infrastructure, aqua culture, orchid cultivation and
e-government.</P>
      <P>He reiterated St. Lucia's firm support for Taiwan and asserted that his country
will continue to back Taiwan's bid to participate in international
organizations, including the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Lai also met with St. Lucia Foreign Minister Rufus Bousquet and Industry and
Commerce Minister Tessa Mangal over lunch.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Taiwan's Ambassador to St. Lucia Tom Chou and St. Lucia's
Agriculture Minister Ezechiel Joseph, Lai later in the day visited a mental
hospital, a telecommunications technology center and a model farm -- all
cooperative ventures established by the two countries.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, Taiwan and St. Lucia resumed diplomatic ties in April 2007,
after a ten year break during which the Caribbean country maintained ties with
China.</P>
      <P>With the resumption of diplomatic links, Taiwan dispatched technical teams to
St. Lucia in July 2007 to help the Caribbean country with its production of
orchids, vegetables, fresh water fish and shrimp and to build its information
technology sector, he said.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago,  the two countries jointly held an orchid exhibition in Castries,
at which thousands of orchid plants from Taiwan were sold out, Chou said. This
prompted the St. Lucia agriculture ministry to step up its efforts to expand the
input of Taiwan expertise into orchid cultivation in the Caribbean country, he
added.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, Lai also paid a call on St. Lucia Governor General Pearlette
Louisy, who highly praised the close cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Lai left Taiwan last Wednesday at the head of an official delegation  that
traveled  to St.  Lucia for its independence celebrations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent forecast by an economist with British Economist Magazine on Taiwan's
economic prospects for 2009 was challenged Sunday by a local economist as "too
pessimistic."</P>
      <P>Yang Chia-yen, director of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research's (TIER's)
Research Division VI, said Kil Dosanjh's forecast that Taiwan's economy will
post a negative growth of 9 percent this year, with no recovery in sight until
2013, is like saying that it will take five years for the U.S. economy to begin
to recover.</P>
      <P>Yang said various authoritative  economic think-tanks  have differing opinions
on whether and when the U.S. economy will bottom out, but that a prediction of
five years before the U.S. economy begins to rise would be "too pessimistic."</P>
      <P>Yang quoted a Global Insight forecast two weeks ago as indicating that the
global economy will post a negative growth of 1.2 percent this year, while the
U. S. economy will post a negative growth of 2.7 percent, and Taiwan's will
record a negative 2 percent growth.</P>
      <P>He also cited an International Monetary Fund forecast one month ago that stated
the global economy will grow by 0.5 percent this year, while the U.S.' will show
negative 1.6 percent and Asia's Four Little Dragons' will record negative 3.9
percent.</P>
      <P>He said Dosanjh's forecast of a negative 9 percent growth in Taiwan's economy
for 2009 was too far removed from the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics (DGBAS) prediction last week of a negative 2.97 decline growth.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS forecast should be considered by think tanks as one of the important
references, Yang contended, adding that it would be "too biased" if researchers
thought that all official statistical agencies are being manipulated by their
governments.</P>
      <P>Yang, nevertheless, cautioned that Taiwan will not emerge from the current
global financial tsunami unscathed. Taiwan's export oriented  economy  has been
hard hit by the global downturn, particularly as a result of the trade
protection polices adopted by the United States, one of Taiwan's major export
markets, he said.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Central News Agency Saturday, Dosanjh, the senior
economist with the London-based Economist Intelligence Unit, said that Taiwan's
economic growth will hit negative 9 percent in 2009 as a result of the global
economic recession and a sharp decline in demand in the world's electronics and
high-tech markets.</P>
      <P>Dosanjh forecast that some 1.1 million people in Taiwan will be jobless as of
the end of this year, with the country's unemployment rate soaring to 10
percent.</P>
      <P>Forecasting that 2009 will be the "worst" year for the Taiwan economy, Dosanjh
said the tide will not begin to turn until late 2010.</P>

      <P>A Taiwan-based Buddhist non-governmental organization will become the first
Taiwanese civic group to set up a representative office to manage its affairs
with the U.N. in New York, a leader of the organization said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Venerable Master Yung Ku,  deputy secretary-general of the Buddha's Light
International Association (BLIA), expressed hopes that with the establishment of
the office in May, the BLIA will forge cordial ties with the American mainstream
society.</P>
      <P>The office will occupy two floors in a building, with one floor to be used as a
tea house in which BLIA-related publications will be displayed, while the other
level will be used for office work by the BLIA and other NGOs, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan officials stationed abroad said that the plan reflects the keen interest
of the country's civic groups to take part in U.N. activities in the areas of
religion, human rights, culture, arts and women's rights.</P>
      <P>The BLIA was invited last year to an annual conference in France organized by
the U.N.'s Department of Public Information (DPI) and attended by affiliated
NGOs.</P>
      <P>Several other civic groups from Taiwan are registered with the U.N. as NGOs,
including the Confederation of Asia-Pacific Chambers of Commerce and Industry
(CACCI), the World League for Freedom and Democracy, the SimplyHelp Foundation
and the Tzu Chi Foundation.</P>
      <P>However, the CACCI is the only Taiwanese organization affiliated with the U.N.
that has listed Taiwan as its place of registration, despite the fact that it
has headquarters in both Taipei and New York. The other groups have registered
through their overseas branches.</P>
      <P>A number of Taiwan women groups and scholars are also involved in the U.N.'s
NGO-Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) and have been active in CSW annual
meetings and forums at the U.N. headquarters in recent years.</P>
      <P>In 2003, the BLIA was granted special consultative status with the U.N.'s
Economic and Social Council and NGO association status with the DPI.</P>
      <P>Apart from its headquarters in Taipei and New York, the BLIA also has more than
170 branches in some 80 countries around the world.</P>

      <P>The Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, which was renamed the Taiwan Democracy
Memorial Hall in May 2007 by the then Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
government, will have its original title restored in July, Presidential Office
spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wang told a press conference after a Presidential Office meeting that one of the
decisions made at the meeting was that the government should act in accordance
with the law and replace the Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall name plaque above
the main entrance with the original name plate.</P>
      <P>Wang said the Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall name plaque may still be useful, as
the Ministry of Education will try to find a new location for the display of
exhibits that portray the development of democracy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that the word "memorial" in the title may be inappropriate
because democracy in Taiwan is not dead, but rather has continued to grow from
strength to strength.</P>
      <P>As to whether the plaza around the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall will retain the
name, Freedom Square, as it was called by the DPP government, Wang said that
will be determined by consensus reached through public forums.</P>
      <P>In April 2007, the then DPP government used an executive order to scrap the
Provisions Governing the Organization of the CKS Memorial Hall Administration
Office -- a law passed by the legislature in 1975 and promulgated a year later.</P>
      <P>Opposition lawmakers at the time pointed out that the move was illegal because
according to the nation's Constitution, only the legislature has the right to
pass, amend or invalidate a law. But the DPP government insisted that it did not
need the legislature's approval to change the name of the CKS Memorial Hall.</P>
      <P>The name change was part of a campaign spearheaded by then Minister of Education
Tu Cheng-sheng from 2005 to remove from public places vestiges of Chiang Kai-
shek, who ruled Taiwan for 25 years until his death in 1975.</P>
      <P>Although many people saw the campaign as politically motivated in the run-up to
the legislative and presidential elections, the DPP government intensified the
campaign it started in late 2005.</P>
      <P>Without consulting the public or holding public hearings, the DPP government
also removed Chiang's statues from public places across the island, deleted his
name from the international airport in Taoyuan, and closed his mausoleum in
Taoyuan County that had attracted over 1 million visitors a year.</P>
      <P>The DPP later lost overwhelmingly in both elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT official warns of dire consequence if CECA is not achieved</HEADLINE>

      <P>If Taiwan and China fail to sign a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement
(CECA), the consequences for Taiwan will be dire, Chang Jung-kung, vice
secretary-general of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) warned Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang, who doubles as head of the KMT's mainland affairs department, said in a
statement that a CECA between Taiwan and China would be an accord to achieve
mutual benefits within the framework of the current political situation where
the two sides are under separate rule.</P>
      <P>Chang also lashed out at the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and
the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), saying that they are intimidating the Taiwan
people by quoting a Chinese scholar who stated Feb. 21 in the Washington Post
that a Taiwan-China CECA would open the way for eventual unification between the
two sides.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei threatened Sunday to initiate a vote in the
Legislative Yuan to recall President Ma Ying-jeou if Taiwan inks a CECA with
China and if the government gives permission for Chinese students to study in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang said the two opposition parties' attempts to block economic cooperation
across the Taiwan Strait would only lead to Taiwan's marginalization, given East
Asia's planned economic integration, and will ruin the cross-Taiwan Strait
status quo.</P>
      <P>Under the eight-year rule of the DPP, which ended in May 2008, Taiwan had become
an outcast in the region as a result of its anti-China policy, he said.</P>
      <P>The CECA proposal was a campaign promise by President Ma before he assumed
office in May last year, therefore, it is time for the government to honor that
promise, as it won a mandate from the people with Ma's election, he asserted.</P>
      <P>Due to the global financial crisis and the planned opening in 2010 of a regional
free trade market that will include China and the member states of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, many prominent business leaders have
been urging the government to forge a CECA with China in response to a six-point
overture made by Chinese President Hu Jintao, he said.</P>
      <P>Although China has not eased its political stance regarding Taiwan, he said,
Taiwan must not abandon its efforts to maintain the cross-strait status quo
through sound economic exchanges and a pragmatic approach that does not broach
either independence or unification.</P>
      <P>The opposition parties' objection to a CECA with China is meant to promote
independence for Taiwan by turning a deaf ear to the real demands of the people,
which in turn could incite China to step up its suppression of Taiwan and
jeopardize Taiwan's interests, he warned.</P>

      <P>Participants at a national affairs conference organized by the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) called Sunday for the country's economics and
financial chiefs to resign.</P>
      <P>The participants at the Taiwan Citizen Conference on National Affairs said that
minister of the finance, minister of the economic affairs and the chief of the
Directorate  General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) under the
Executive Yuan should step down.</P>
      <P>They claimed that the minister of finance and the chief of the DGBAS had failed
in their duty to hold firmly the strings of the country's purse.</P>
      <P>They also criticized Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming for causing
disruption on the stock market by misleading local investors into believing that
the government would bail out a cash-strapped DRAM manufacturer.</P>
      <P>The calls for the officials' resignation were made in a 10-point conclusion
reached at the end of the two-day meeting Sunday noon.</P>
      <P>The  participants  also  urged  President  Ma  Ying-jeou's administration to
push Beijing to end its discriminatory treatment of Taiwan businessmen operating
in China and to stop its politically motivated interference in their business.</P>
      <P>They cautioned the administration not to unreservedly open up trade and economic
exchanges with China.</P>
      <P>Their other recommendations  to the administration included extending
unemployment subsidies from six months to one year; offering more soft loans to
small- and medium-sized enterprises, and reviewing it policy of tax cuts for
entrepreneurs.</P>
      <P>The participants  also  warned  the administration  against proceeding with its
proposal to sign a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement with China
before securing public consensus on the plan.</P>
      <P>The meeting was the first phase of a national affairs conference that will
include a second meeting on a yet unspecified date in March and a third in
April.</P>
      <P>The organizers had invited tens of thousands people to attend the meeting, but
more people than expected showed up at the venue Sunday and some of them had to
be seated in an adjoining room to watch the proceedings on closed-circuit TV.</P>

      <P>Dharma Drum Buddhist College announced Sunday that students admitted to its
undergraduate and graduate programs this spring semester will not have to pay
tuition.</P>
      <P>Executives of the college, located in Chinshan township in Taipei County, said
if the new students are monks or nuns, their attendance at the college will be
completely free, and that if they are lay people, they will need to pay only
sundry fees, as all tuition will be waived.</P>
      <P>They explained that the school made the decision in consideration of the fact
that the adverse conditions caused by the global economic downturn might deprive
many potential applicants of a chance to enroll in the Buddhist college.</P>
      <P>Interested  students  have until March 16 to submit their applications to the
college's admission office. Dharma Drum Buddhist College was founded in 2007,

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan public should be aware of China's 'Red Terror': academics</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 22 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Before supporting the government's policy of pursuing closer ties with China,
the Taiwanese people should be aware that China has never stopped its inhumane
treatment of dissidents and unapproved religious groups, a group of academics
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference in Taipei organized by the Northern Taiwan
Society to discuss China's "Red Terror," Laogai Research Foundation (LRF)
Director Liao Tien-chi said that the Taiwan public should not be fooled by
China's propaganda and should be aware of China's extensive system of forced-
labor prison camps.</P>
      <P>Liao stressed that as citizens of a democratic country, the Taiwan public should
be aware of the human violations that have been committed by the Communist Party
of China (CPC), before deciding to support closer ties with China dictated by
economic expediency.</P>
      <P>According to Liao, China and the Chinese have lived in "Red Terror" since Peng
Pai and Mao Zedong launched the rascal-proletariat peasant movements in 1927.
Peng Pai once claimed that communist law would be simply the execution of
landlords once they were caught.</P>
      <P>"The Communist Party of China never stopped its bloody terror campaigns since
its inception, and its claws can be seen in the most recent crackdowns on Falun
Gong practitioners, " said Liao.</P>
      <P>Despite China's impressive economical development in the past two decades, the
CPC has continued its systematic violation of human rights, he added.</P>
      <P>"Public executions, the harvesting of organs from executed prisoners, the
coercive enforcement of China's 'one-child' policy, and the persecution of
religious believers are proof of what the CPC is capable of when it comes to the
protection of its ideals, " said Liao.</P>
      <P>China's Laogai, which means reform through labor, refers to a vast system of
forced-labor prison camps in China established under Mao Zedong and modeled on
the Soviet Gulag, Liao explained.</P>
      <P>He said that although ordinary criminals and dissidents alike are imprisoned
within the Laogai, it is not a normal penal system as the Chinese government
claims.</P>
      <P>"It functions as a brutal mechanism to suppress dissents and generate economic
profits for China's totalitarian regime and is the source of many of its most
egregious human rights abuses," said Liao.</P>
      <P>As citizens of a free and democratic nation, Taiwanese should help expose and
end China's human right violations, Liao said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a committee member of the Taiwanese Youth Anti-Communist National
Salvation Corps, Paul Lin, said that Taiwan should not fall in to China's trap
by accepting its one-China principle and it "one country, two systems" formula,
as Hong Kong did in 1997.</P>
      <P>Unlike Hong-Kong, Taiwan was ruled by the Kuomintang for more than half a
century, and has a great number of pro-unification citizens who would eventually
be brainwashed by the CPC, said Lin.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Hong Kong managed to remain somewhat democratic compared to
other parts of China because of the democratic views of its residents.</P>
      <P>"Because Hong Kong was ruled by the British for more than 150 years, its
political system and government agencies have done an acceptable job of fending
off many of Beijing's political agendas," said Lin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Opposition parties vow protests if government inks CECA with China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The signing of a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) with China
will jeopardize Taiwan's sovereignty and pave the way for the unification of the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait, therefore, the opposition parties will stage
nationwide protests if the government continues to pursue such an agreement,
said a former chairman of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party Su Tseng-
chang Sunday.</P>
      <P>Citing a Feb. 21 report in the Washington Post, leaders of the opposition party
said a CECA would possibly be a step toward unification of China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the second day of a weekend conference on national affairs, Su said that the
Ma Ying-jeou administration has "used the wrong medicine to treat the ailing
economy" and that a CECA with China would be unwise.</P>
      <P>Su said that the Ma administration has been arrogant and useless in its efforts
to rescue the nation's economy, and the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) has failed to
listen to the opinions of the people.</P>
      <P>"If the KMT continues to make unilateral decisions concerning the economic and
political development of the nation, it would force the opposition parties to
gather the power of the people and take to the streets," said Su.</P>
      <P>Ma's administration should immediately stop all attempts to sign a CECA with
China, he urged, adding that it would be most unfortunate if the opposition
parties were forced to stage a nationwide protest over this issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen agreed that if the government seals a
CECA with China without careful consideration or public consensus, it could
cause social unrest.</P>
      <P>Local industry and business groups have been pushing for the government to forge
closer economic links with China by signing a CECA and to move quickly to
liberalize cross-Taiwan Strait trade through actions such as the removal of
tariffs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Local economist challenges foreign counterpart's forecast for Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent forecast by an economist with British Economist Magazine on Taiwan's
economic prospects for 2009 was challenged Sunday by a local economist as "too
pessimistic."</P>
      <P>Yang Chia-yen, director of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research's (TIER's)
Research Division VI, said Kil Dosanjh's forecast that Taiwan's economy will
post a negative growth of 9 percent this year, with no recovery in sight until
2013, is like saying that it will take five years for the U.S. economy to begin
to recover.</P>
      <P>Yang said various authoritative  economic think-tanks  have differing opinions
on whether and when the U.S. economy will bottom out, but that a prediction of
five years before the U.S. economy begins to rise would be "too pessimistic."</P>
      <P>Yang quoted a Global Insight forecast two weeks ago as indicating that the
global economy will post a negative growth of 1.2 percent this year, while the
U. S. economy will post a negative growth of 2.7 percent, and Taiwan's will
record a negative 2 percent growth.</P>
      <P>He also cited an International Monetary Fund forecast one month ago that stated
the global economy will grow by 0.5 percent this year, while the U.S.' will show
negative 1.6 percent and Asia's Four Little Dragons' will record negative 3.9
percent.</P>
      <P>He said Dosanjh's forecast of a negative 9 percent growth in Taiwan's economy
for 2009 was too far removed from the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics (DGBAS) prediction last week of a negative 2.97 decline growth.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS forecast should be considered by think tanks as one of the important
references, Yang contended, adding that it would be "too biased" if researchers
thought that all official statistical agencies are being manipulated by their
governments.</P>
      <P>Yang, nevertheless, cautioned that Taiwan will not emerge from the current
global financial tsunami unscathed. Taiwan's export oriented  economy  has been
hard hit by the global downturn, particularly as a result of the trade
protection polices adopted by the United States, one of Taiwan's major export
markets, he said.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Central News Agency Saturday, Dosanjh, the senior
economist with the London-based Economist Intelligence Unit, said that Taiwan's
economic growth will hit negative 9 percent in 2009 as a result of the global
economic recession and a sharp decline in demand in the world's electronics and
high-tech markets.</P>
      <P>Dosanjh forecast that some 1.1 million people in Taiwan will be jobless as of
the end of this year, with the country's unemployment rate soaring to 10
percent.</P>
      <P>Forecasting that 2009 will be the "worst" year for the Taiwan economy, Dosanjh
said the tide will not begin to turn until late 2010.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Buddhist NGO to establish U.N. representative office</HEADLINE>

      <P>A Taiwan-based Buddhist non-governmental organization will become the first
Taiwanese civic group to set up a representative office to manage its affairs
with the U.N. in New York, a leader of the organization said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Venerable Master Yung Ku,  deputy secretary-general of the Buddha's Light
International Association (BLIA), expressed hopes that with the establishment of
the office in May, the BLIA will forge cordial ties with the American mainstream
society.</P>
      <P>The office will occupy two floors in a building, with one floor to be used as a
tea house in which BLIA-related publications will be displayed, while the other
level will be used for office work by the BLIA and other NGOs, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan officials stationed abroad said that the plan reflects the keen interest
of the country's civic groups to take part in U.N. activities in the areas of
religion, human rights, culture, arts and women's rights.</P>
      <P>The BLIA was invited last year to an annual conference in France organized by
the U.N.'s Department of Public Information (DPI) and attended by affiliated
NGOs.</P>
      <P>Several other civic groups from Taiwan are registered with the U.N. as NGOs,
including the Confederation of Asia-Pacific Chambers of Commerce and Industry
(CACCI), the World League for Freedom and Democracy, the SimplyHelp Foundation
and the Tzu Chi Foundation.</P>
      <P>However, the CACCI is the only Taiwanese organization affiliated with the U.N.
that has listed Taiwan as its place of registration, despite the fact that it
has headquarters in both Taipei and New York. The other groups have registered
through their overseas branches.</P>
      <P>A number of Taiwan women groups and scholars are also involved in the U.N.'s
NGO-Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) and have been active in CSW annual
meetings and forums at the U.N. headquarters in recent years.</P>
      <P>In 2003, the BLIA was granted special consultative status with the U.N.'s
Economic and Social Council and NGO association status with the DPI.</P>
      <P>Apart from its headquarters in Taipei and New York, the BLIA also has more than
170 branches in some 80 countries around the world.</P>

      <P>At present, the automatic teller machine (ATM) card service offered by the

      <P>To offer customers greater convenience, the company plans to roll out a Visa

      <P>With the number of savings accounts at the Chunghwa Post totalling approximately

      <P>The postal company is inviting interested parties to participate in the public

feasible solutions to the ailing economy, the Chinese National Association of
Industry and Commerce (CNAIC) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chairman of the CNAIC Theodore M. H. Huang said that as President Ma Ying-jeou
is making great efforts to reverse the country's economic downturn, the CNAIC
and local industrial leaders wish to share their ideas with the government.</P>
      <P>"As Taiwan's industry leaders are greatly concerned about the worsening economy,
the CNAIC has arranged this meeting for local entrepreneurs to put forward their
recommendations to the government," said Huang.</P>
      <P>More than 40 local industry leaders have signed up for the meeting, including
Chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Morris Chang and Chairman
of AU Optronics Corp. Lee Kuen-yao, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The issues to be discussed will include a proposal by Ma for Taiwan to sign a
Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) with China, and the
implementation of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) New Cheng Ho Project.</P>
      <P>The MOEA's NT$9 billion project is aimed at salvaging Taiwan's rapidly falling
exports by focusing on emerging markets and Southeast Asian nations, as orders
from the United States and China have slowed down considerably.</P>
      <P>The depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar will also be high on the meeting's
agenda, as business leaders were alarmed by the fact that the exchange rate
dropped to NT34.9 to the US dollar on Feb. 20, Huang said.</P>

shek, who ruled Taiwan for 25 years until his death in 1975.</P>
      <P>Although many people saw the campaign as politically motivated in the run-up to
the legislative and presidential elections, the DPP government intensified the
campaign it started in late 2005.</P>
      <P>Without consulting the public or holding public hearings, the DPP government
also removed Chiang's statues from public places across the island, deleted his
name from the international airport in Taoyuan, and closed his mausoleum in
Taoyuan County that had attracted over 1 million visitors a year.</P>
      <P>The DPP later lost overwhelmingly in both elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT official warns of dire consequence if CECA is not achieved</HEADLINE>

      <P>If Taiwan and China fail to sign a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement
(CECA), the consequences for Taiwan will be dire, Chang Jung-kung, vice
secretary-general of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) warned Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang, who doubles as head of the KMT's mainland affairs department, said in a
statement that a CECA between Taiwan and China would be an accord to achieve
mutual benefits within the framework of the current political situation where
the two sides are under separate rule.</P>
      <P>Chang also lashed out at the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and
the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), saying that they are intimidating the Taiwan
people by quoting a Chinese scholar who stated Feb. 21 in the Washington Post
that a Taiwan-China CECA would open the way for eventual unification between the
two sides.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei threatened Sunday to initiate a vote in the
Legislative Yuan to recall President Ma Ying-jeou if Taiwan inks a CECA with
China and if the government gives permission for Chinese students to study in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang said the two opposition parties' attempts to block economic cooperation
across the Taiwan Strait would only lead to Taiwan's marginalization, given East
Asia's planned economic integration, and will ruin the cross-Taiwan Strait
status quo.</P>
      <P>Under the eight-year rule of the DPP, which ended in May 2008, Taiwan had become
an outcast in the region as a result of its anti-China policy, he said.</P>
      <P>The CECA proposal was a campaign promise by President Ma before he assumed
office in May last year, therefore, it is time for the government to honor that
promise, as it won a mandate from the people with Ma's election, he asserted.</P>
      <P>Due to the global financial crisis and the planned opening in 2010 of a regional
free trade market that will include China and the member states of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, many prominent business leaders have
been urging the government to forge a CECA with China in response to a six-point
overture made by Chinese President Hu Jintao, he said.</P>
      <P>Although China has not eased its political stance regarding Taiwan, he said,
Taiwan must not abandon its efforts to maintain the cross-strait status quo
through sound economic exchanges and a pragmatic approach that does not broach
either independence or unification.</P>
      <P>The opposition parties' objection to a CECA with China is meant to promote
independence for Taiwan by turning a deaf ear to the real demands of the people,
which in turn could incite China to step up its suppression of Taiwan and
jeopardize Taiwan's interests, he warned.</P>

      <P>Participants at a national affairs conference organized by the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) called Sunday for the country's economics and
financial chiefs to resign.</P>
      <P>The participants at the Taiwan Citizen Conference on National Affairs said that
minister of the finance, minister of the economic affairs and the chief of the
Directorate  General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) under the
Executive Yuan should step down.</P>
      <P>They claimed that the minister of finance and the chief of the DGBAS had failed
in their duty to hold firmly the strings of the country's purse.</P>
      <P>They also criticized Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming for causing
disruption on the stock market by misleading local investors into believing that
the government would bail out a cash-strapped DRAM manufacturer.</P>
      <P>The calls for the officials' resignation were made in a 10-point conclusion
reached at the end of the two-day meeting Sunday noon.</P>
      <P>The  participants  also  urged  President  Ma  Ying-jeou's administration to
push Beijing to end its discriminatory treatment of Taiwan businessmen operating
in China and to stop its politically motivated interference in their business.</P>
      <P>They cautioned the administration not to unreservedly open up trade and economic
exchanges with China.</P>
      <P>Their other recommendations  to the administration included extending
unemployment subsidies from six months to one year; offering more soft loans to
small- and medium-sized enterprises, and reviewing it policy of tax cuts for
entrepreneurs.</P>
      <P>The participants  also  warned  the administration  against proceeding with its
proposal to sign a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement with China
before securing public consensus on the plan.</P>
      <P>The meeting was the first phase of a national affairs conference that will
include a second meeting on a yet unspecified date in March and a third in
April.</P>
      <P>The organizers had invited tens of thousands people to attend the meeting, but

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan public should be aware of China's 'Red Terror': academics</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 22 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Before supporting the government's policy of pursuing closer ties with China,
the Taiwanese people should be aware that China has never stopped its inhumane
treatment of dissidents and unapproved religious groups, a group of academics
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference in Taipei organized by the Northern Taiwan
Society to discuss China's "Red Terror," Laogai Research Foundation (LRF)
Director Liao Tien-chi said that the Taiwan public should not be fooled by
China's propaganda and should be aware of China's extensive system of forced-
labor prison camps.</P>
      <P>Liao stressed that as citizens of a democratic country, the Taiwan public should
be aware of the human violations that have been committed by the Communist Party
of China (CPC), before deciding to support closer ties with China dictated by
economic expediency.</P>
      <P>According to Liao, China and the Chinese have lived in "Red Terror" since Peng
Pai and Mao Zedong launched the rascal-proletariat peasant movements in 1927.
Peng Pai once claimed that communist law would be simply the execution of
landlords once they were caught.</P>
      <P>"The Communist Party of China never stopped its bloody terror campaigns since
its inception, and its claws can be seen in the most recent crackdowns on Falun
Gong practitioners, " said Liao.</P>
      <P>Despite China's impressive economical development in the past two decades, the
CPC has continued its systematic violation of human rights, he added.</P>
      <P>"Public executions, the harvesting of organs from executed prisoners, the
coercive enforcement of China's 'one-child' policy, and the persecution of
religious believers are proof of what the CPC is capable of when it comes to the
protection of its ideals, " said Liao.</P>
      <P>China's Laogai, which means reform through labor, refers to a vast system of
forced-labor prison camps in China established under Mao Zedong and modeled on
the Soviet Gulag, Liao explained.</P>
      <P>He said that although ordinary criminals and dissidents alike are imprisoned
within the Laogai, it is not a normal penal system as the Chinese government
claims.</P>
      <P>"It functions as a brutal mechanism to suppress dissents and generate economic
profits for China's totalitarian regime and is the source of many of its most
egregious human rights abuses," said Liao.</P>
      <P>As citizens of a free and democratic nation, Taiwanese should help expose and
end China's human right violations, Liao said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a committee member of the Taiwanese Youth Anti-Communist National
Salvation Corps, Paul Lin, said that Taiwan should not fall in to China's trap
by accepting its one-China principle and it "one country, two systems" formula,
as Hong Kong did in 1997.</P>
      <P>Unlike Hong-Kong, Taiwan was ruled by the Kuomintang for more than half a
century, and has a great number of pro-unification citizens who would eventually
be brainwashed by the CPC, said Lin.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Hong Kong managed to remain somewhat democratic compared to
other parts of China because of the democratic views of its residents.</P>
      <P>"Because Hong Kong was ruled by the British for more than 150 years, its
political system and government agencies have done an acceptable job of fending
off many of Beijing's political agendas," said Lin.</P>

      <P>The signing of a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) with China
will jeopardize Taiwan's sovereignty and pave the way for the unification of the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait, therefore, the opposition parties will stage
nationwide protests if the government continues to pursue such an agreement,
said a former chairman of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party Su Tseng-
chang Sunday.</P>
      <P>Citing a Feb. 21 report in the Washington Post, leaders of the opposition party
said a CECA would possibly be a step toward unification of China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the second day of a weekend conference on national affairs, Su said that the
Ma Ying-jeou administration has "used the wrong medicine to treat the ailing
economy" and that a CECA with China would be unwise.</P>
      <P>Su said that the Ma administration has been arrogant and useless in its efforts
to rescue the nation's economy, and the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) has failed to
listen to the opinions of the people.</P>
      <P>"If the KMT continues to make unilateral decisions concerning the economic and
political development of the nation, it would force the opposition parties to
gather the power of the people and take to the streets," said Su.</P>
      <P>Ma's administration should immediately stop all attempts to sign a CECA with
China, he urged, adding that it would be most unfortunate if the opposition
parties were forced to stage a nationwide protest over this issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen agreed that if the government seals a
CECA with China without careful consideration or public consensus, it could
cause social unrest.</P>
      <P>Local industry and business groups have been pushing for the government to forge
closer economic links with China by signing a CECA and to move quickly to
liberalize cross-Taiwan Strait trade through actions such as the removal of
tariffs.</P>

the Royal Academy, dies at the age of 69. He is considered one of the most
important figures in the history of English painting.

1836: The siege of the Alamo begins in San Antonio, Texas. The siege ended March

    <HEADLINE>CECA plan purely an economic issue: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 23 (CNA)
02/23/09  13:48:01
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung said Monday that Taiwan's plan to sign a
comprehensive economic cooperation agreement (CECA) with China is purely an
economic issue that is not necessarily directly related to politics.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the CECA plan, which comes under the portfolio of the the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, is aimed mainly at enabling Taiwan to meet the challenges that
would arise from the ASEAN Plus China agreement set to take effect in 2010.</P>
      <P>He said extended regional economic blocs, such as ASEAN Plus One (China) and
ASEAN Plus Three (China, Japan, South Korea), will have a tremendously adverse
impact on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"That is the reason why the administration is pushing for the signing of a CECA
with China," Chiu said.</P>
      <P>According to a report by the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research, when
the ASEAN Plus Three agreement takes effect, it will indirectly result in the
loss of 110,000 jobs in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang Ping-chao, chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of
China, urged the Taiwan public to look clearly at the matter, adding that
signing a CECA with China will not compromise Taiwan's sovereignty. "Is it
likely that Taiwan will become a second Hong Kong or Macau if it signs a CECA
with China? " he asked.</P>
      <P>Painting the CECA as crucially important to Taiwan, Chang said if Taiwan does
not sign the agreement -- which aims to allow free flow of merchandise,
services, and capital between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait -- Taiwan will
be a "dead meat, " because its tariffs would be too high to allow it to compete
with other countries in the region.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Sunday that
Taiwan's plan to sign a CECA with China is purely an economic matter and does
not involve national sovereignty issues.</P>
      <P>Lai said if Taiwan is to enter into negotiations with China over issues
involving national sovereignty, the administration would first have to solicit
the opinions of the nation's 23 million people and obtain their consent through
national referendum.</P>
      <P>But it would be unnecessary to hold a referendum on issues such as the CECA that
have nothing to do with politics, Lai added.</P>
      <P>She made the remarks at a news conference called late Sunday in response to a
threat by opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Chairman Huang Kun-hui
earlier in the day to launch a joint effort with the major opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) to recall President Ma Ying-jeou if Taiwan signs a CECA
with China.</P>
      <P>Also on Sunday, ruling Kuomintang Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung said that the question
of whether and how Taiwan should sign a CECA with China should be open for
discussion.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan should sign the CECA on condition that its sovereignty and international
status are not compromised (in the process) , " Wu stressed.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou welcomed Palau President Johnson Toribiong to Taiwan
Monday with full military honors at a formal ceremony that included a 21-gun
salute.</P>
      <P>At the ceremony held at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall plaza, Ma said that
Palau is Taiwan's "closest ally" and that the two countries have maintained
cordial ties since they established diplomatic relations 10 years ago. This is
evidenced by the fact that Toribiong, one month after taking office, has chosen
Taiwan for his first state visit, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that following closely on Taiwan's second peaceful transfer of power
last May, Palau also elected a new president last November.</P>
      <P>However, in a democracy, "government policies enjoy a continuity that extends
the trust placed in and promises made to its allies, " the president said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has participated in several construction and development projects in
Palau over the last decade, Ma said, pledging that Taiwan will continue to
contribute to the Pacific island nation's growth under the existing framework of
cooperation.</P>
      <P>He also thanked the Palau government and people for their staunch support of
Taiwan's  efforts to become more involved  in the international community, and
expressed the hope that Palau will continue in this vein.</P>
      <P>For his part, Toribiong, who served as Palau's ambassador to Taiwan from
2001-2008, said that the "unwavering and insurmountable support and assistance"
from Taiwan has helped his country immensely over the years.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that Taiwan will continue to work closely with Palau as
the young Pacific republic tries to attain its national goal of sustainable
economic growth.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Yunlin County pushes carbon tax to pressure government</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Yunlin County has approved a local carbon tax that it hopes will pressure the
central government  into reconsidering how it allocates funds to local
governments.</P>
      <P>Yunlin County Magistrate Su Chih-fen on Monday said the county's carbon tax
measure was not proposed to punish companies but rather to compel the central
government to reconsider its "unfair" allocation of funds to local governments.</P>
      <P>The south-central county is home to the Formosa Plastics Group's petrochemical
industrial park, one of the world's biggest, centered around its sixth naphtha
cracker plant.</P>
      <P>The complex generates slightly over one-quarter of Taiwan's carbon  dioxide
emissions  and has long been the target  of environmentalists proposing a carbon
tax.</P>
      <P>Yunlin County believes it is being shortchanged by the central government,
which, according to county calculations, collects NT$47 billion (US$1.36
billion) in business taxes from Formosa Plastics Group companies operating in
the Mailiao complex but only returns NT$500 million in disbursements to the
county government.</P>
      <P>The county estimates it could collect NT$9 billion a year from the complex if
its local carbon tax were imposed.</P>
      <P>The Yunlin County Council recently passed a bill drafted by the county
government to levy a carbon tax, but the feasibility of the bill was reportedly
questioned by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Su questioned why the administration said Yunlin County "might not be permitted"
to take the initiative to impose the tax, and urged the central government to
reconsider its "unfair" distribution of funds to local governments.</P>
      <P>She also appealed to President Ma Ying-jeou to fulfill his campaign pledge to
address the idea of a tax on carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>If the central government is not currently interested in imposing such a tax
nationwide, Su said, the administration should allow the county to impose its
local carbon tax on a trial basis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan-China economic pact tantamount to FTA: economics minister</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
02/23/09  18:15:06
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A comprehensive economic cooperation agreement (CECA) expected to be signed
between Taiwan and China is tantamount to a free trade agreement (FTA) that will
function based on the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO) , Minister
of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yiin said that it is a government policy to sign a CECA with China, but
emphasized that the agreement will be politics-free and will operate under the
WTO framework between two member economies.</P>
      <P>He was speaking following a breakfast meeting with a group of business leaders
sponsored by the Taipei-based Chinese National Association of Industry and
Commerce.</P>
      <P>Yiin said it is necessary for Taiwan to sign a CECA with China to save Taiwan's
industries which are facing a critical juncture. Reaching such an agreement with
China could mean Taiwanese firms would enjoy lower or zero tariffs when trading
with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Maintaining or increasing Taiwanese companies' competitiveness by signing the
agreement is especially important as China and the 10 member states of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are planning to open a regional
free trade market in 2010, Yiin noted.</P>
      <P>"How could Taiwan's petrochemical industry survive if Taiwan's exports to China
are levied a 6.5 percent customs tariff after the formation of 'ASEAN plus
one'?" he asked.</P>
      <P>Without revealing whether there is a timetable for the two sides to reach a CECA
agreement, Yiin nonetheless called the task "an urgent matter."</P>
      <P>The government's plan to clinch a Taiwan-China CECA has sparked grave concern
from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU), which fear such an agreement could erode Taiwan's
sovereignty.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei threatened Sunday to initiate a vote in the
Legislative Yuan to recall President Ma Ying-jeou if Taiwan inks a CECA with
China and if the government gives permission for Chinese students to study in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang accused the government of seeking to open the way for eventual unification
with China through the pact.</P>
      <P>In response to the opposition parties' objection, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs stressed later Sunday that the two sides will conduct exchanges based on
parity and dignity under the WTO framework and that Chinese workers will not be
allowed in Taiwan, if a CECA is signed.</P>
      <P>Apart from a Taiwan-China CECA, the MOEA said it is also planning to sign FTAs
with the United States, Japan and Singapore to help Taiwan companies boost their
globalization amid increased economic integration in East Asia and to lure
foreign investment and create job opportunities for Taiwan's people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>First reference book on classical Taiwan literature released</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 23 (CNA)
02/23/09  18:44:44
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in southern Taiwan introduced Monday the
world's first reference book on literature in Taiwan, titled "Chronology of
Classical Literature in Taiwan: The Ming and Qing Dynasties."</P>
      <P>The 800-page book was published last November after seven years of work by the
two NCKU professors, Shih Yi-lin and Liao Mei-yu, and 27 researchers.</P>
      <P>It traces the development of classical literature in Taiwan from 1651-1895 under
five headings -- "writers events, " "literary and education events, "
"significant events in Taiwan, " "significant events in the Qing Dynasty" and
"significant events in the world."</P>
      <P>In a report on the NCKU Web site, Shih said that the development of classical
literature in Taiwan should have a place in history and should be examined
within the context of significant events of the time to understand the meaning
and value of the literati, works and literary activities during specific
periods.</P>
      <P>Taiwan literature was not regarded as an independent subject to be taught
formally in universities until the middle of the 1990s, Shih stated.</P>
      <P>She said that when she was teaching a course called "History of Classical
Literature in Taiwan" in 2002, she became aware of a dearth of information on
the subject.</P>
      <P>Shih indicated that she was driven to write the book based on this observation
and on the belief that there was a link between the development of classical
literature in Taiwan and the politics and social events of past eras.</P>
      <P>Readers will discover that while the rise and fall of the dynasties in China
hinged on wars, it was literature that reflected the people's lives, social
phenomena of the times and the state of the physical environment, Liao said in
an interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Historical records show that Sheng Kuang-wen (1613-1688) was the first writer
and scholar from China to move to Taiwan -- in 1651, late in the Ming dynasty --
and thus the development of Taiwan literature began.</P>
      <P>By the late Qing period, Taiwan literature had developed to a level almost on
par with China's, Shih said.</P>
      <P>However, the Kuomintang government, which relocated from China to Taiwan in 1949
after losing a civil war, did not place any great importance on Taiwan
literature, and it was not until the 1970s that native literature began to gain
a footing, she said.</P>
      <P>The study of Taiwan literature as a formal course began in the late 1980s after
martial law in Taiwan was lifted.</P>
      <P>The book offers a vast amount of data for research on Taiwan literature, Shih
said, adding that she hopes to chronicle the development of Taiwan literature in
the Japanese colonial era between 1895 and 1945 and that in the post-War World
II period after 1945.</P>

next month, Taipei's National Palace Museum (NPM) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Zheng Xinmiao will come to Taiwan March 1 for a four-day visit, and his
itinerary is now being arranged, NPM deputy director Fung Ming-chu said.</P>
      <P>An NPM official said that a delegation led by NPM Director Chou Kung-shin

Museum, visiting sites that are off limits to the average visitor.</P>
      <P>"The NPM is now arranging to give the same preferential treatment to Zheng and
is even considering opening up the vaults that store valuable treasures to him,"
the official added.</P>
      <P>The official said that Chou reached a nine-point consensus on closer cooperation
and exchanges during her recent visit in China, making breakthroughs without
touching on the sensitive issues of name and governing laws.</P>
      <P>The cooperative  ventures agreed to include long-term  and short-term exchanges
of personnel for up to one year. Researchers from Beijing's Palace Museum will
also be able to come to Taiwan for special research projects starting in 2010.</P>
      <P>The official said there were also breakthroughs on exhibition exchanges and
cooperation.</P>
      <P>He said that while an October exhibition in Taipei on Emperor Yongzheng of the
Qing Dynasty could not be sponsored by the two museums due to name and
regulation problems, Beijing still promised to lend 29 artifacts to Taiwan,
including a set of 13 portraits of the long-serving ruler.</P>
      <P>The official also said that there will be links between the two museums on the

boost the country's plunging export volume.</P>
      <P>Lee Kun-yao, chairman of AU Optronics, the world's third largest flat-panel
display vendor, said, "it's OK" when he was asked by a fellow businessman at a
breakfast meeting whether the Taiwan dollar, which has lost value in recent
weeks, was now at a level that would make Taiwan-exported goods competitive.</P>
      <P>The NT dollar has depreciated 6 percent against the U.S. dollar since the
beginning of the year, and has fallen from NT$33.749 to the greenback on Feb. 2
to NT$34.850 Feb. 20.</P>
      <P>The breakfast meeting was organized by Theodore Huang, the chairman of the
Taipei-based Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce, to solicit
opinions on the local currency's recent depreciation from local business leaders
and the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan).</P>
      <P>According to Huang, CBC Deputy Governor Chou A-Ting said at the meeting that the
local currency's value has been decided by market forces, although the CBC has
also taken currency rate fluctuations in neighboring countries, such as South
Korea, into consideration when assessing daily rates.</P>
      <P>Huang said Chou also cited a CBC research report as indicating that South
Korea's exports have not plunged as dramatically as Taiwan's, mainly because,
unlike Taiwan, South Korea has a diversity of industries, such as steel,
shipbuilding, and oil refining, that receive long-term export orders.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the report said,  Taiwan exports were mostly high-tech goods with
customers concentrated in the United States, leaving its exports more vulnerable
to the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>South Korea's currency was not mentioned as a key factor, even though the Korean
won has lost around 30 percent of its value against the greenback over the past
six months.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Chou also called for people in Taiwan to refrain from
speculating irrationally on the prospects of the local currency, saying that
some have even speculated that the local currency depreciate further to NT$38 or
NT$40 to the U.S. dollar in the near future.</P>
      <P>"This speculation lacks a theoretical basis, " Chou was quoted by Huang as
saying.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Econmic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming also analyzed the reasons
behind Taiwan's steep drop in export volume. Yiin agreed with CBC report, saying
that Taiwan's big export categories are too heavily concentrated in information
technology (IT) and that too many of Taiwan's goods go to the United States.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports fell by a record 44.1 percent in January and are expected to
fall 10 percent for all of 2009.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese travel industry to promote Taiwan golf tour packages</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 50 representatives of the Chinese travel industry will visit golf
courses around Taiwan during the upcoming Cross-Strait Travel Industry Forum
slated for Feb. 25 to design Taiwan golf tour packages,  said Taiwan's Travel
Agent Association (TAA) on Monday.</P>
      <P>TAA Secretary-General Roger K.C Hsu said that as most of the restrictions on
visits to Taiwan by Chinese have been lifted, the travel industries from both
sides wish to develop and design new travel packages.</P>
      <P>Close to 50 members of the Chinese delegation will visit golf courses located
mainly in the western part of the island to design golf tour packages that will
later be promoted in China, said Hsu.</P>
      <P>"We hope to attract more Chinese golfers to Taiwan in the future as the local
green fee is in many cases cheaper than those in Chinese golf courses," said
Hsu.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hsu said that as the climate in central and southern Taiwan is
suitable for golf all year round, the island has already received numerous
groups of Chinese golf players in the past few months.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's golf tour market is still relatively small compared to other
Asian countries, with the recent opening of direct transportation links between
China and Taiwan, Taiwan's travel industry is expecting a rapid increase in the
number of Chinese golf lovers in Taiwan, said Hsu.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, travel industry representatives from both sides of the Taiwan
Strait will gather in Taipei for the first time on Feb. 25 to discuss market
development and to help mainland industry professionals become more familiar
with the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu said that delegates from 30 Chinese provinces, autonomous regions
and municipalities, and more than 450 members of China's travel industry are
expected to attend this year's cross-strait travel forum.</P>
      <P>Serving as this year's organizer,  Taiwan's Travel Quality Assurance Association
(TQAA) has arranged an eight-day trip for the Chinese delegation to travel to
scenic areas located on the eastern and western parts of Taiwan to get a
firsthand look at Taiwan's tourism resources, said Hsu.</P>
      <P>According to the TQAA, Shao Qiwei, chairman of China's National Tourism
Administration, will attend the forum in his capacity as chairman of the Cross-
Strait Tourism Exchange Association and is scheduled to meet with his Taiwanese
counterpart, Janice Lai, director-general  of the Tourism Bureau under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>However, the TQAA said that Shao will only remain in Taiwan for four days,
adding that the vice chairman of China's National Tourism Administration Du
Jiang will lead the Chinese delegation for the remaining four days of the
evaluation trip.</P>

      <P>The Nantou County government is planning to distribute "shopping vouchers" to
Chinese tourists to encourage them to visit the central Taiwanese county.</P>
      <P>Nantou County Magistrate Lee Chou-ching told a county government meeting Monday
that the program will be modeled after the one launched by Hangzhou City in
China, which wants to distribute 1 million yuan (NT$5 million) in shopping
vouchers to tourists from Nantou County.</P>
      <P>Those who travel to Hangzhou may shop with the vouchers, which are actually a
kind of discount coupons, Lee said.</P>
      <P>For example, shoppers only need to pay 30 yuan for a product that is priced at
40 yuan with the Hangzhou-version shopping vouchers, which means they enjoy a
discount of 25 percent, Lee elaborated.</P>
      <P>The discount coupons are valid from March 15 to June 15.</P>
      <P>Lee praised Hangzhou's tourism-stimulus measure as a good idea worthy of being
copied by his county.</P>
      <P>There have been close exchanges between Nantou and Hangzhou City of the Zhejiang
province in recent years since they began discussing a plan to "marry" the
scenic Sun Moon Lake in Nantou and West Lake in Hangzhou in an attempt to boost
tourism, trade and other exchanges between the two sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan should sign CECA with China as soon as possible: KMT caucus</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should ink a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) with
China as soon as possible, on the condition that Taiwan's sovereignty is
preserved, to prevent the country from becoming economically marginalized, a
leading Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yang Chiung-ying, the KMT legislative caucus' secretary-general, said Taiwan
should stop limiting itself in the international arena, as such an action will
only convert the nation into a "frog in a well," a reference to holding a
parochial world view.</P>
      <P>Yang said Taiwan should abandon what she described as the "closed door policy"
of the Democratic Progressive Party, which governed Taiwan from 2000-2008, and
sign a CECA with China as soon as possible under the principle of no sacrifice
of Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Fellow KMT lawmaker Hsiao Ching-tien said that according to the Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research, an extra 110,400 local workers are likely to
lose their jobs after China, South Korea and Japan enter into a free trade
agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>Signing an economic cooperation agreement with China could offset some of the
job losses by giving Taiwanese products exported to China the same import duty
treatment as products from ASEAN competitors or South Korea and Japan.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's economy and society will be deeply impacted if the government fails to
sign a CECA with China," Hsiao warned.</P>
      <P>He argued that the CECA negotiations should be conducted in a fast and decisive
manner and should not be affected by the political leanings of legislators and
the people.</P>
      <P>"We should not let political considerations cloud the real meaning of signing a
CECA with China," Hsiao said. "We will lose many business opportunities if the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) continues to boycott the inking of
a CECA with China."</P>
      <P>The DPP has suggested that such a trade deal with China would jeopardize
Taiwan's sovereignty, but Hsiao said such accusations are premature, as details
of the CECA have not yet been discussed with China.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lo Shu-lei suggested Taiwan would lose its competitiveness if it
fails to sign a CECA with China.</P>
      <P>"Even more people would lose their jobs and have no way to support themselves if
the DPP continues to object to the signing of the agreement with China as
Taiwanese products would lose their competitiveness in the international
market," she argued.</P>
      <P>The CECA would allow Taiwan and China to offer each other economic and trade
privileges, including the elimination of import duties and the lifting of non-
tariff trade barriers, as well as maintaining preferential tariff and trade
policies already in place.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) , there is no
timetable for the signing of such an agreement, and it is not expected to be
broached at the next round of negotiations between quasi-official organizations
representing Taiwan and China.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will showcase selected works that explore the methods and possibilities
of the island becoming involved inforeign affairs-- the theme Taiwanese artists
have chosen to explore in the upcoming Venice Biennale in Italy, a local museum
announced Monday.</P>
      <P>Four distinguished creators, whose pieces represent the current development of
Taiwans trend in contemporary art,  will use contemporary art to reflect on the
countrys identity issue, according to Hsieh Hsiao-yun, director of the Taipei
Fine Arts Museum (TFAM), in a press conference.</P>
      <P>The artists will allow the world to understand the country's "soft power," said
Hsieh.</P>
      <P>TFAMs Biennial and International Office Director Chang Fang-wei explained  that
through  observations,  documenting  or direct involvement, the artists
interact, or even clash, with their own chosen region.</P>
      <P>The art pieces will be displayed in the forms of photography, video
installations and other special devices, she added.</P>
      <P>For instance, Chen Chieh-jen, renowned for his reflective works on the relations
between image and authority, will introduce his new film productionImperial
Borders Iin Venice, whose idea originates from the review mechanism that
Taiwanese people must face when applying for U.S. visas. The piece also takes on
the issue of how modern empires exert their superiority over other places
through intricate manipulation, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an architect artist, Hsieh Ying-chun, will display his eco-friendly
construction projects at the exhibition, Chang said. Through  the projects,  he
attempted  to assist  minority  or underprivileged groups in countries such as
China, Indonesia and Taiwan who suffered from natural disasters.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chang Chien-chi, who has tracked illegal Chinese immigrants
striving to survive in New York over the years via documentary photography,
extends his focus on their families who still remain in China as well as their
offsprings now living in the U.S., Chang said.</P>
      <P>Also, a young, promising artist, Yu Cheng-ta, will explore the role of languages
in communication  and interaction  in his Ventriloquistsseries, Chang said,
adding that he is Taiwans only artist who addresses issues faced by foreigners
living in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 2009 Venice Biennale is slated to kick off on June 7 and will come to an end
on Nov. 22, according to TFAM.</P>

      <P>With bilateral relations between Taiwan and China improving rapidly in recent
months, the two sides need to establish more communication channels to deal with
the growing number of issues facing them, a Mainland Affairs Council official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a reception held by the Foundation on Asia-Pacific Peace Studies,
MAC Deputy Minister Chao Chien-min said that since relations with China have
entered to a new era, both sides need to establish more unofficial communication
channels to further facilitate cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation.</P>
      <P>Business leaders and nongovernment organizations in Taiwan and China should take
the initiative to establish such channels to help solve some of the many
problems hindering cross-strait economic cooperation, Chao said.</P>
      <P>"The number of issues concerning cross-strait economic and cultural cooperation
is only going to increase in the future, " Chao said.</P>
      <P>Chao stressed that Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- the quasi-official
bodies representing the two sides in the absence of formal ties -- cannot
negotiate and solve all the problems and issues that have accumulated during the
past few decades.</P>
      <P>Asked about U.S.Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's visit to China, Chao said
the Barack Obama administration has shown great support for Taiwan's efforts to
lower cross-strait tensions, and that in the future the MAC will continue to
help promote peace and stability in the area as it is beneficial for all parties
involved.</P>
      <P>As for the inking of a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement with China,
Chao said that while there is no timetable for the signing of such an agreement,
carrying out the policy is vital for Taiwan's economic survival.</P>
      <P>The signing of a CECA with China will prevent Taiwan from being marginalized in
the international community once South Korea, China and Japan set up a free
trade area with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, he said.</P>

      <P>Hit hard by the global economic tsunami, Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
only handled 72,213 tons of cargo in January, less than half its level in peak
years, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Continuing a severe decline that began late last year, CAA officials said the
week-long Lunar New Year holiday in late January also contributed to the plunge
in volume.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  largest airport handled 85,278 tons of cargo in December, the first
time the airport's monthly volume had fallen below 100,000 tons since February
2003.</P>
      <P>The airport handled 1.493 million tons of cargo for the whole of 2008, a fall
from 1.606 million tons in 2007, CAA statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Due to the economic downturn, Taiwan's two largest carriers -- China Airlines
and EVA Airways Corp. -- have grounded five of their 36 cargo planes.</P>
      <P>At its peak in 2005, the airport handled 1.705 million tons of cargo for the
year, an average of nearly 150,000 tons per month. The annual volume fell by
less than 10,000 tons in 2006.</P>
      <P>Airport authorities had hoped that the opening of nonstop cross-Taiwan Strait
cargo charter services in mid-December would boost the amount of cargo handled,
but volume has fallen short of expectations.</P>
      <P>China opened Shanghai and Guangzhou airports to exchange cargo charter services
with the airport in Taoyuan in January, but carriers from neither side operated
all 30 cargo charters they were allowed to fly during the month, CAA officials

      <P>Taiwan's growing legion of unemployed men are now looking for jobs in

demand for local caregivers, the head of a local home care center said Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang Kuo-ta, chairman of the Taichung Home Care Services Association, said the
increasing demand for caregivers, resulting from the government's focus in 2009
to expand care to the country's minorities, has attracted more men to sign up
for the association's professional training courses.</P>
      <P>Men comprised 20 percent of the 30 participants in recent courses, he said, with
some of them young and highly-educated.</P>
      <P>Among them, Huang said, was a young man who used to work in the technology
sector but has not been able to find a job since being laid off last year and

      <P>Another participant, a 63-year-old man named Chang Ting-jung, headed a car

society's conventional  stereotypes and gain acceptance, as women are still more

      <P>The Taoyuan County government hired one of Taiwan's greatest baseball players
Monday to help develop the game in the county.</P>
      <P>County Magistrate Eric Liluan Chu disclosed that he decided to hire Li Chu-ming,
known in Taiwan as "Mr. Baseball" because of his 1,000 hits in his professional
baseball career.</P>
      <P>Chu invited Li to his office after learning from news reports that he had been
jobless for more than two months after the Brother Elephants, one of Taiwan's
four professional teams, let him go. Li had served as the team's hitting coach
since 2004.</P>
      <P>Chu said that Taoyuan County has 140 baseball teams, more than any other county
or city in Taiwan, and that Li is the right talent the county needs to develop
the game.</P>
      <P>The magistrate indicated that in the initial stage, Li will serve as  a
consultant  on  the  county's  project  to  build  an international-caliber
baseball stadium, which began in December, and that he will begin to train
baseball teams starting in the fall.</P>
      <P>Li, 40, was a player on the Brother Elephants when it, along with the President
Lions, the Mercuries Tigers, and the Wei Chuan Dragons, launched the Chinese
Professional Baseball Legaue (CPBL) in 1990.</P>
      <P>He left the Brother Elephants in 1999 to join the Taipei Gida in the rival
Taiwan Major League (TML), which was established in 1997.</P>
      <P>In 2003, when the TML terminated operations, two of its four teams were merged
with the CPBL, returning professional baseball to a single market. But the
merger included a "traitors clause" that barred players who had jumped to the
TML from returning to the expanded CPBL.</P>
      <P>Left without a job in baseball, Li opened a coffee shop, but his business was
unsuccessful. The Brother Elephants rehired him as a hitting coach in 2004, but
last year, under the strain of the slumping economy, the team fired him and
three other coaches to cut operating costs.</P>
      <P>Li made headlines after news media found him unemployed. The Taoyuan County
magistrate, who attaches great importance to baseball, contacted him directly
and offered him the job.</P>
      <P>His first challenge will be to help shape the new NT$836.3 million (US$24.16
million) baseball stadium, which the county is building on a 9.7-hectare site
near the Taiwan High Speed Rail's Taoyuan Station.</P>
      <P>The stadium will have 12,000 infield seats, with room for future construction of
outfield stands.</P>
      <P>After the stadium's completion by the end of 2009, Taoyuan County will be able

      <P>A facelift of Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport's Terminal 1 will be
completed by the end of 2011, a year earlier than originally planned, the head
of the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>CAA Director-General Lee Long-wen made the remarks after Minister of
Transportation and Communications Mao Chi-kuo instructed a speedy completion of
the renovation, which is one of the government's new 10 major construction
projects.</P>
      <P>The facelift is needed, Lee said, because the 30-year-old terminal building and
its related facilities are rundown and its space is inadequate to comfortably
handle passenger traffic.</P>
      <P>He said that the CAA had originally planned to renovate the airport area by
area, which will take about three-and-a-half years. To speed up the process, the
CAA also considered the possibility of closing Terminal 1 and moving all
arrivals and departures to Terminal 2.</P>
      <P>After evaluating the situation, the CAA decided to close half of the Terminal
1's arrival and departure areas for renovation and then close the other half
when the first part of the project is completed.</P>
      <P>The total cost of the renovation will be NT$2 billion (US$57.47 million), Lee
added.</P>
      <P>He said that after the completion of the work, the terminal will be able to
handle 15 million passengers per year, up from the current 12 million.</P>
      <P>That total, added to Terminal 2's capacity of 17 million passengers, will enable
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport to handle a total of 32 million passengers
per year.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan has decided to eliminate around 10 of its 37 agencies and
fold their functions into other bodies, Yeh Kuang-shi, vice minister of the
Research, Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yeh noted that in the government's preliminary reorganization plan, the
Executive Yuan will be composed of 13 ministries, eight councils and
commissions, three independent institutions, and four other bodies.</P>
      <P>The complete restructuring plan will be unveiled in March, and Yeh said the
government hopes it will take effect in 2011.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the announcement at the conclusion of the Monday meeting of the
Executive Yuan's organizational reform promotion task force, which focused on a
draft amendment to the Organization of Central Administrative Agencies Basic Law
and the provisional draft statute for the reorganization.</P>
      <P>Under the planned amendment, the basic law will not specify the exact number of
agencies so that the Executive Yuan can maintain some flexibility, Yeh noted.</P>
      <P>The task force has already decided that the Atomic Energy Council will be merged
with the National Science Council, the RDEC will be integrated into the Council
for Economic Planning and Development, and the Sports Affairs Council will join
with the Ministry of Education, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Other mergers of government bodies have yet to be determined, but Yeh said the
plan will likely expand the number of ministries from the current eight to 13,
with those in charge of domestic affairs, finance,  national  defense,  economic
affairs,  education, transportation and development, foreign affairs and justice
to be maintained.</P>
      <P>Ministries  will  also  be made  responsible  for culture, agriculture, the
environment and resources, public health and social welfare, and labor affairs,
which were previously covered by councils and departments.</P>
      <P>The eight planned councils and commissions will take charge of administration in
the fields of science, national development, marine affairs, Hakka affairs,
indigenous peoples affairs, veterans affairs, financial regulation, and mainland
affairs.</P>
      <P>The three  independent  institutions  will be the National Communications
Commission, the Central Election Commission, and the Fair Trade Commission and
the other four bodies will be the Central Bank,  the  National  Palace  Museum,

      <P>The Taipei City Police Department has installed a criminal database to help
prevent and crack down on crime, municipal law enforcement officers said Monday.</P>
      <P>The new databank, which holds the National Police Agency's criminal records from
the past five years and includes a geographic information system (GIS) to
identify "hot spots" where various types of crime occur, is scheduled to be
formally inaugurated in March, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>The GIS system will allow police to view, understand, question, interpret, and
visualize data through maps, reports and charts that reveal relationships,
patterns, and trends.</P>
      <P>Once crime "hot spots" are identified, police patrols will be intensified in
those areas and other crime-prevention measures will be adopted to improve law
and order, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The database was completed last December and has been undergoing testing since
early January, with branch bureaus and precincts using the new information
system in their daily crime-fighting efforts.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, the officials said, the new databank will be formally
inaugurated in March.</P>
      <P>Establishing a criminal database to improve law enforcement was one of Taipei
Mayor Hau Lung-bin's campaign promises.</P>
      <P>The installation of the system, however, has encountered many technical hurdles.
Hau said he directed city agencies to work in concert to overcome the
difficulties after he toured the real-time crime fighting center in New York
City's police headquarters last year.</P>
      <P>"Taking a cue from the New York police department's practice of sorting out
causes and modes of crimes by extensively analyzing criminal records, we have
managed to establish our own database to identify criminal 'hot spots, '" Hau
said after being briefed on the new system at Taipei's police headquarters.</P>
      <P>The new database can also be used as a joint crime-fighting platform by
connecting with the National Police Agency and police bureaus in neighboring

      <P>The long-heralded postal remittance service between Taiwan and China will begin
Thursday, the Department of Posts and Telecommunications under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications confirmed Monday.</P>
      <P>Officials at the department said they had received a notice from postal
authorities in China that the cross-Taiwan Strait postal remittance service will
definitely become operational beginning Feb. 26.</P>
      <P>The two-way remittance service was originally scheduled to begin Feb. 18, but
Taiwan's state-run Chunghwa Post Co. was informed that the date had to be
postponed because the Chinese side needed more time to sort out problems.</P>
      <P>The launching of the service is based on one of four agreements signed Nov. 4
last year in Taipei between Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation
and its Chinese counterpart -- the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits -- that allows Taiwan and China to begin direct mail and postal
remittance services.</P>
      <P>Direct cross-strait mail service began Dec. 15.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  post offices have provided  services for outward remittances bound for
China through Citibank New York since 1991, but have not accepted inward
remittances from China.</P>
      <P>From Feb. 26, the postal remittance service between the two sides will work in
both directions, with Citibank New York continuing to provide currency
settlement services.</P>
      <P>According to Chunghwa Post, the Postal Savings Bank of China will join the Bank
of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China as a newcomer among the
Chinese banks at which remittances can be made.</P>
      <P>All remittances will be made in U.S. dollars, with each transfer limited to

      <P>Some 12,000 people working for direct sales company Amway in China will be
coming to Taiwan on cruises this spring, with a portion of the 12,000 scheduled
to arrive in March and April on six separate sailings, Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) officials confirmed Monday.</P>
      <P>The MOTC has received an application submitted by cruise line Royal Caribbean
International to bring the first group of Amway workers on six separate cruises
to Taiwan in March and April.</P>
      <P>Each cruise will accommodate between 1,000 and 2,000 passengers, according to
officials of the MOTC's Department of Aviation and Navigation.</P>
      <P>The cruises will first stop at Keelung Harbor in northern Taiwan and then
proceed to Hualien Harbor in eastern Taiwan and to Taichung Harbor in central
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MOTC has yet to receive an application from the second cruise line handling
the Amway employees -- Costa Crociere Cruise Line -- which will bring the
remaining Amway employees to Taiwan on three separate cruises.</P>
      <P>The trips are overseas incentive tours arranged by Chinese Amway (China) Co.,
Limited for its workers, who will arrive in Taiwan from Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Taiwan limits the arrival of Chinese tourists on its shores to 3,000 a day, but
the MOTC said it convinced the Mainland Affairs Council not to include the Amway

    <HEADLINE>Former marquee player to help Taoyuan's baseball development</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Taoyuan County government hired one of Taiwan's greatest baseball players
Monday to help develop the game in the county.</P>
      <P>County Magistrate Eric Liluan Chu disclosed that he decided to hire Li Chu-ming,
known in Taiwan as "Mr. Baseball" because of his 1,000 hits in his professional
baseball career.</P>
      <P>Chu invited Li to his office after learning from news reports that he had been
jobless for more than two months after the Brother Elephants, one of Taiwan's
four professional teams, let him go. Li had served as the team's hitting coach
since 2004.</P>
      <P>Chu said that Taoyuan County has 140 baseball teams, more than any other county
or city in Taiwan, and that Li is the right talent the county needs to develop
the game.</P>
      <P>The magistrate indicated that in the initial stage, Li will serve as  a
consultant  on  the  county's  project  to  build  an international-caliber
baseball stadium, which began in December, and that he will begin to train
baseball teams starting in the fall.</P>
      <P>Li, 40, was a player on the Brother Elephants when it, along with the President
Lions, the Mercuries Tigers, and the Wei Chuan Dragons, launched the Chinese
Professional Baseball Legaue (CPBL) in 1990.</P>
      <P>He left the Brother Elephants in 1999 to join the Taipei Gida in the rival
Taiwan Major League (TML), which was established in 1997.</P>
      <P>In 2003, when the TML terminated operations, two of its four teams were merged
with the CPBL, returning professional baseball to a single market. But the
merger included a "traitors clause" that barred players who had jumped to the
TML from returning to the expanded CPBL.</P>
      <P>Left without a job in baseball, Li opened a coffee shop, but his business was
unsuccessful. The Brother Elephants rehired him as a hitting coach in 2004, but
last year, under the strain of the slumping economy, the team fired him and
three other coaches to cut operating costs.</P>
      <P>Li made headlines after news media found him unemployed. The Taoyuan County
magistrate, who attaches great importance to baseball, contacted him directly
and offered him the job.</P>
      <P>His first challenge will be to help shape the new NT$836.3 million (US$24.16
million) baseball stadium, which the county is building on a 9.7-hectare site
near the Taiwan High Speed Rail's Taoyuan Station.</P>
      <P>The stadium will have 12,000 infield seats, with room for future construction of
outfield stands.</P>
      <P>After the stadium's completion by the end of 2009, Taoyuan County will be able
to host national and international baseball tournaments.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Facelift for Taoyuan Airport Terminal 1 to be completed in 2011</HEADLINE>

      <P>A facelift of Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport's Terminal 1 will be
completed by the end of 2011, a year earlier than originally planned, the head
of the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>CAA Director-General Lee Long-wen made the remarks after Minister of
Transportation and Communications Mao Chi-kuo instructed a speedy completion of
the renovation, which is one of the government's new 10 major construction
projects.</P>
      <P>The facelift is needed, Lee said, because the 30-year-old terminal building and
its related facilities are rundown and its space is inadequate to comfortably
handle passenger traffic.</P>
      <P>He said that the CAA had originally planned to renovate the airport area by
area, which will take about three-and-a-half years. To speed up the process, the
CAA also considered the possibility of closing Terminal 1 and moving all
arrivals and departures to Terminal 2.</P>
      <P>After evaluating the situation, the CAA decided to close half of the Terminal
1's arrival and departure areas for renovation and then close the other half
when the first part of the project is completed.</P>
      <P>The total cost of the renovation will be NT$2 billion (US$57.47 million), Lee
added.</P>
      <P>He said that after the completion of the work, the terminal will be able to
handle 15 million passengers per year, up from the current 12 million.</P>
      <P>That total, added to Terminal 2's capacity of 17 million passengers, will enable
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport to handle a total of 32 million passengers
per year.</P>

      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian was summoned by the Taipei District Court to a
pre-trial session Tuesday to pave the way for his trial on corruption and money
laundering charges.</P>
      <P>The session is scheduled to last three days. Tuesday's hearing is expected to
focus on Chen's role in a land deal between the Hsinchu Science Park and Dayu
Development Corp.</P>
      <P>The former president and his wife Wu Shu-jen are accused of siphoning off NT$104
million (US$3.01 million) from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund
during his presidency from 2000 to May 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes worth a total of NT$300 million in
connection with the land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million in
kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project. They allegedly wired and  stashed  the  funds  overseas  secretly
through  various intermediaries.</P>
      <P>The couple is still being probed on suspicion of helping several financial
conglomerates acquire financial holding companies in return for "political
contributions."</P>
      <P>Chen, who has been in custody since Dec. 30, began a hunger strike last week to
protest against what he called continued judicial persecution against him.

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait postal remittance services to begin Feb. 26</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 23 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The long-heralded postal remittance service between Taiwan and China will begin
Thursday, the Department of Posts and Telecommunications under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications confirmed Monday.</P>
      <P>Officials at the department said they had received a notice from postal
authorities in China that the cross-Taiwan Strait postal remittance service will
definitely become operational beginning Feb. 26.</P>
      <P>The two-way remittance service was originally scheduled to begin Feb. 18, but
Taiwan's state-run Chunghwa Post Co. was informed that the date had to be
postponed because the Chinese side needed more time to sort out problems.</P>
      <P>The launching of the service is based on one of four agreements signed Nov. 4
last year in Taipei between Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation
and its Chinese counterpart -- the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits -- that allows Taiwan and China to begin direct mail and postal
remittance services.</P>
      <P>Direct cross-strait mail service began Dec. 15.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  post offices have provided  services for outward remittances bound for
China through Citibank New York since 1991, but have not accepted inward
remittances from China.</P>
      <P>From Feb. 26, the postal remittance service between the two sides will work in
both directions, with Citibank New York continuing to provide currency
settlement services.</P>
      <P>According to Chunghwa Post, the Postal Savings Bank of China will join the Bank
of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China as a newcomer among the
Chinese banks at which remittances can be made.</P>
      <P>All remittances will be made in U.S. dollars, with each transfer limited to
US$30,000. The service charge in Taiwan will be NT$500 for each wire transfer
and NT$400 for each mail transfer.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei City police to inaugurate criminal database in March</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei City Police Department has installed a criminal database to help
prevent and crack down on crime, municipal law enforcement officers said Monday.</P>
      <P>The new databank, which holds the National Police Agency's criminal records from
the past five years and includes a geographic information system (GIS) to
identify "hot spots" where various types of crime occur, is scheduled to be
formally inaugurated in March, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>The GIS system will allow police to view, understand, question, interpret, and
visualize data through maps, reports and charts that reveal relationships,
patterns, and trends.</P>
      <P>Once crime "hot spots" are identified, police patrols will be intensified in
those areas and other crime-prevention measures will be adopted to improve law
and order, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The database was completed last December and has been undergoing testing since
early January, with branch bureaus and precincts using the new information
system in their daily crime-fighting efforts.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, the officials said, the new databank will be formally
inaugurated in March.</P>
      <P>Establishing a criminal database to improve law enforcement was one of Taipei
Mayor Hau Lung-bin's campaign promises.</P>
      <P>The installation of the system, however, has encountered many technical hurdles.
Hau said he directed city agencies to work in concert to overcome the
difficulties after he toured the real-time crime fighting center in New York
City's police headquarters last year.</P>
      <P>"Taking a cue from the New York police department's practice of sorting out
causes and modes of crimes by extensively analyzing criminal records, we have
managed to establish our own database to identify criminal 'hot spots, '" Hau
said after being briefed on the new system at Taipei's police headquarters.</P>
      <P>The new database can also be used as a joint crime-fighting platform by
connecting with the National Police Agency and police bureaus in neighboring
cities and counties, city police officers said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Facelift for Taoyuan Airport Terminal 1 to be completed in 2011</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A facelift of Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport's Terminal 1 will be
completed by the end of 2011, a year earlier than originally planned, the head
of the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>CAA Director-General Lee Long-wen made the remarks after Minister of
Transportation and Communications Mao Chi-kuo instructed a speedy completion of
the renovation, which is one of the government's new 10 major construction
projects.</P>
      <P>The facelift is needed, Lee said, because the 30-year-old terminal building and
its related facilities are rundown and its space is inadequate to comfortably
handle passenger traffic.</P>
      <P>He said that the CAA had originally planned to renovate the airport area by
area, which will take about three-and-a-half years. To speed up the process, the
CAA also considered the possibility of closing Terminal 1 and moving all
arrivals and departures to Terminal 2.</P>
      <P>After evaluating the situation, the CAA decided to close half of the Terminal
1's arrival and departure areas for renovation and then close the other half
when the first part of the project is completed.</P>
      <P>The total cost of the renovation will be NT$2 billion (US$57.47 million), Lee
added.</P>
      <P>He said that after the completion of the work, the terminal will be able to
handle 15 million passengers per year, up from the current 12 million.</P>
      <P>That total, added to Terminal 2's capacity of 17 million passengers, will enable
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport to handle a total of 32 million passengers
per year.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan has decided to eliminate around 10 of its 37 agencies and
fold their functions into other bodies, Yeh Kuang-shi, vice minister of the
Research, Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yeh noted that in the government's preliminary reorganization plan, the
Executive Yuan will be composed of 13 ministries, eight councils and
commissions, three independent institutions, and four other bodies.</P>
      <P>The complete restructuring plan will be unveiled in March, and Yeh said the
government hopes it will take effect in 2011.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the announcement at the conclusion of the Monday meeting of the
Executive Yuan's organizational reform promotion task force, which focused on a
draft amendment to the Organization of Central Administrative Agencies Basic Law
and the provisional draft statute for the reorganization.</P>
      <P>Under the planned amendment, the basic law will not specify the exact number of
agencies so that the Executive Yuan can maintain some flexibility, Yeh noted.</P>
      <P>The task force has already decided that the Atomic Energy Council will be merged
with the National Science Council, the RDEC will be integrated into the Council
for Economic Planning and Development, and the Sports Affairs Council will join
with the Ministry of Education, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Other mergers of government bodies have yet to be determined, but Yeh said the
plan will likely expand the number of ministries from the current eight to 13,
with those in charge of domestic affairs, finance,  national  defense,  economic
affairs,  education, transportation and development, foreign affairs and justice
to be maintained.</P>
      <P>Ministries  will  also  be made  responsible  for culture, agriculture, the
environment and resources, public health and social welfare, and labor affairs,
which were previously covered by councils and departments.</P>
      <P>The eight planned councils and commissions will take charge of administration in
the fields of science, national development, marine affairs, Hakka affairs,
indigenous peoples affairs, veterans affairs, financial regulation, and mainland
affairs.</P>
      <P>The three  independent  institutions  will be the National Communications

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday he hopes to see progress in Taiwan's
relations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) following the
recent improvement of the country's ties with China.</P>
      <P>Ma raised the issue while receiving former President of the Philippines Fidel
Ramos, who is on a visit in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma suggested that Ramos, who is board director of the Boao Forum for Asia, wield
his influence to help Taiwan improve its relations with ASEAN.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that Taiwan and the Philippines are not only very close to each other
geographically, but also maintain deep substantial relations, with more than
90,000 Filipino nationals currently working in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"During my eight years in office as mayor of Taipei City, I realized that if all
those 90,000 people took leave of absence on the same day, part of the city
could be paralyzed," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The large number of Filipino workers in Taiwan has helped promote friendship
between the two sides, he said, recalling that during a trip to Manila, he once
met a Taiwanese couple who was there to visit their Filipino domestic helper.</P>
      <P>Although the number of foreign workers in Taiwan is expected to decrease because
of the current economic downturn, Ma expressed confidence that the situation
will revert to normal after the economy recovers.</P>

      <P>The bureau is planning to deliver NT$5,000 worth of food vouchers to each of
10,000 households in the initial stage of the program that will last until Dec.
31 this year, bureau officials said. In the follow-up stages, more families
experiencing financial difficulties could be included, they added.</P>
      <P>Families residing in Taipei City, but not necessarily with household
registrations here, will be eligible to receive the food vouchers, as long as
they are identified by their local borough chiefs as being in need of assistance
and recommended by the city officials and social workers conducting the
interviews.</P>
      <P>The coupons will be a one-time handout and can only be spent on food such as
lunch boxes, bread and rice balls, at Family Mart convenience stores. They
cannot be used to purchase cigarettes, alcoholic beverages or magazines.</P>
      <P>The economic downturn has resulted in many people in Taiwan losing their jobs,
with parents of school-aged children being the worst affected.</P>

      <P>The Alliance of Referendum for Taiwan (ART) demanded Tuesday that the chairman
of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chiang Pin-kung participate in a
public debate on the government's plan to sign a Comprehensive Economic
Cooperation Agreement (CECA) with China.</P>
      <P>More than 40 members of the ART made the call during a demonstration staged in
front of the SEF building in Taipei to protest against the CECA proposal and to
urge the government to hold a referendum on the issue.</P>
      <P>An ART representative Tsai Tin-kue said that if Taiwan signs a CECA under the
one-China principle, the agreement will symbolize Taiwan's surrender to China.</P>
      <P>"The signing of such an agreement will be an act of betrayal of the Taiwanese
people," said Tsai, adding that the CECA will not only compromise Taiwan's
sovereignty,  but will also jeopardize its economic and political interests.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai,  the public should decide, by national referendum, whether or
not Taiwan should sign a CECA with China.</P>
      <P>"The SEF and other government agencies have no right to make that decision
without public consensus," said Tsai.</P>
      <P>"If Chiang has the determination and courage to sign a CECA with China, then he
should have the courage to participate in a public debate on the issue," Tsai
said.</P>
      <P>After being notified of the protest, an SEF official came out of the building to

      <P>Tainan City police announced Tuesday that they have arrested 18 people in Chiayi
City for allegedly abusing eight Indonesian women after getting them into Taiwan
under false pretexts.</P>
      <P>Tainan City police said they arrested the suspects, who worked for a labor
brokerage  firm in Chiayi City,  after receiving information that the company
got women from Indonesia into Taiwan under the pretext of getting married with
Taiwanese men and then put them to work for low wages.</P>
      <P>A preliminary investigation discovered that the brokers seized the women's
passports and marriage certificates upon arrival and forced them to sign illegal
contracts in which the women accepted to be paid only NT$2,000 (NT$58) of their
nominal NT$24,000 monthly salary, police said.</P>
      <P>The brokers also threatened the women not to go outside on their own. At least
eight Indonesian women fell victim to the scheme, police said.</P>
      <P>Many women from Southeast Asian countries are imported into Taiwan through
illegal means to work here, with many of them forced into prostitution by

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is pushing for bilateral free trade agreements with individual
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members as a more feasible way
for the country to participate in regional economic integration, a Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan is neither an ASEAN dialogue or development partner, it will be
more difficult for the country to forge a free trade pact with the association
as a whole than taking a bilateral approach, said Frances Lee, deputy director-
general of MOFA's Department of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, in a press
briefing.</P>
      <P>With ASEAN countries looking to set up a free trade zone with China, Japan and
South Korea as early as 2010, Taiwan is afraid of being economically
marginalized in the region.</P>
      <P>If it is left behind in the integration process, its goods sold to countries in
the region will face higher duties than those offered by its main competitors.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is currently focusing its efforts on negotiating with ASEAN countries
that have greater trade ties with Taiwan, including Singapore, Malaysia and
Thailand, as bilateral free trade deals with those countries would be mutually
beneficial, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan may also try to work out special arrangements with individual ASEAN
nations to lower tariffs in specific industries, which would have a similar
impact as a free trade deal, she said.</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that Taiwan already has close economic ties with ASEAN states, as
overall trade with the association's 10 members totaled US$63 billion last year.
Taiwan is also among the top three sources of foreign investment in Thailand,
Malaysia, Vietnam and Cambodia.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, around 2 million people traveled between Taiwan and ASEAN countries
in 2008, while there were approximately 357,000 migrant workers from Southeast
Asia employed in Taiwan as of the end of last year, Lee said.</P>

      <P>The proposal for Taiwan and China to sign a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation
Agreement (CECA) can be discussed in the third round of high-level talks between
the intermediaries of the two sides, Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Vice
Chairman Kao Koong-lian said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Kao was referring to the next round of dialogue between SEF Chairman  Chiang
Pin-kung and Chen Yunlin,  president  of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , which is expected to take place in
the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, Taiwan should adopt a step-by-step approach in promoting the
signing of the agreement, and the Chiang-Chen dialogue can be a platform for
preliminary discussions on related issues.</P>
      <P>Kao reassured the public that future CECA negotiations with China will be
carried out under the principles of parity and dignity and that Taiwan will
never accept the one-China  principle  as a precondition for the negotiations.</P>
      <P>He also dismissed concerns that the establishment of a CECA with China would
downgrade  Taiwan's  status to that of a special administrative region like Hong
Kong or Macau, both of which signed a closer economic partnership arrangement
(CEPA) with China in 2003.</P>
      <P>Kao explained that a CECA is similar to a free trade agreement and will function
under the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO), in which Taiwan's
membership status is totally different from that of Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>While Hong Kong entered the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1986 as a
British colony, Taiwan gained accession to the WTO in 2002 as the "Separate
Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu," he said.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) have strongly objected to the proposed Taiwan-China CECA,
arguing that such an agreement would undermine Taiwan's sovereignty and pave the
way for unification with China.</P>
      <P>The DPP has unveiled a plan to stage nationwide demonstrations against the
possible signing of the agreement, and the TSU has threatened to initiate a vote
in the Legislative Yuan to recall President Ma Ying-jeou if the agreement is
inked.</P>

      <P>The passenger volume on the Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system hit a
monthly record high of 4,367,000 in January, increasing 640,000 from the
previous month, according to statistics released Tuesday by the city's MRT
bureau.</P>
      <P>The figure translated into a total of NT$120 million in business revenue, up 20
percent month-on-month, the bureau's director Lee Cheng-pin said at a city
government meeting.</P>
      <P>Attributing the increase in MRT passenger volume to the nine-day Chinese New
Year holiday that began Jan. 25, Lee said that during that period,  many people
visited the southern port city for sightseeing purposes or for the Kaohsiung
Lantern Festival.</P>
      <P>A total of 320,000 passengers took the Kaohsiung MRT on Jan. 28, setting a daily
record high, according to Lee, adding that the average daily passenger volume
during the Chinese New Year holiday was between 250,000 and 300,000.</P>
      <P>However, the passenger volume on shuttle buses to and from Kaohsiung MRT
stations did not increase in proportion to the rise in MRT passenger volume, Lee
noted, adding that some 283,000 passengers took the shuttle buses in January, a
decrease of 37,000 compared with last December.</P>
      <P>Lee said this was probably because most MRT passengers were from outside
Kaohsiung and were therefore not familiar with the shuttle bus service.</P>

      <P>Taiwan received only US$17.68 billion worth of export orders in January, marking
a record annual decline of 41.67 percent, according to the statistics released
Tuesday by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>The figure was in line with the ministry's previous estimate that January's
export orders were to be valued at under US$20 billion, as there were only 17
working days for the full month because of the long Chinese New Year holiday,
according to the ministry.</P>
      <P>Among industries, the value of orders for electronics products in January
decreased by US$2.71 billion, or 38.85 percent, from a year earlier, due mainly
to a decline in demand for consumer electronics.</P>
      <P>The value of orders for information  technology (IT)  and communication products
dropped by US$1.91 billion, or 30.47 percent, because of the sizable shrinkage
in demand for notebook computers.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan hinted Tuesday that he would consider resigning if a
special four-year NT$500 billion (US$14.45 billion) public works expansion
package the Cabinet has proposed fails to pull Taiwan out of its current
economic slump.</P>
      <P>"If the project falls short of its target, I would acknowledge the failure and
fully assume responsibility, " Liu said in answer to a question from an
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker on what the premier would
do if Taiwan's economy contracts by more than 5 percent rather than the 2.97
percent forecast by the government.</P>
      <P>He said he would know whether to stay on or step down.</P>
      <P>Liu also said that the local economy's performance must be measured in
comparison to other countries.</P>
      <P>"A negative 5 percent economic growth rate might be a relatively good
performance by that time," he suggested.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, the four-year NT$500 billion special budget will help create
190,000 to 220,000 job opportunities in 2009 and push Taiwan's gross domestic
product higher by 0.97 percent this year and 1.02 percent in 2010, 2011 and
2012.</P>
      <P>"Taking the 0.97 percent into consideration, Taiwan's GDP will still contract by
2.97 percent in 2009," he asserted.</P>
      <P>In its weekly meeting Feb. 12, the Executive Yuan approved the NT$500 billion
budget to fund a stimulus package that it believes will help mitigate the impact

    <TEXT>
      <P>Indigenous tribes around Taiwan will simultaneously light fires in their
communities on Feb. 28, using the resulting "smoke signals" to send a message to
the government that they are sovereign owners of their land, a spokesman for an
indigenous rights group said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the Taitung County-based Smoke Motion Union, it will be the second
time in a year that indigenous tribes, including the Pinuyumayan, Amis and
Bunun, will act in unison to spread their message in the same way their
ancestors once communicated with the sky and the spirit of the nature.</P>
      <P>Last Feb. 28, dense smoke rose simultaneously from dozens of tribal villages
around the island, conveying the angry voices of indigenous peoples over the
government's ignorance of their natural hunting and fishing rights on their own
land.</P>
      <P>The campaign was formed after a group of Pinuyumayan hunters from the Katatipul
tribe in Taitung City were obstructed by forest police from their annual sacred
hunting ceremony in late 2007 in what they claimed was a rough and disrespectful
manner.</P>
      <P>The incident triggered protests by the Katatipul people, which then developed
into a joint call among indigenous tribes around Taiwan for the government to
respect their natural rights and indigenous sovereignty, said Mateli Sawawan, a
spokesman for the Smoke Motion Union.</P>
      <P>The call turned into a protest rally held by indigenous people from around the
country in front of the Presidential Office on March 8, 2008.</P>
      <P>The call, however, has never been properly answered since then, the union
argued, which is why it is preparing a second round of protests on Feb. 28, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Asked why the group chose that day, Mateli Sawawan explained that Feb. 28 is a
day on which justice has been upheld after the government made a public apology
for the 228 Incident, also known as the 228 Massacre, in 1947.</P>
      <P>The incident was an anti-government, anti-Chinese uprising in Taiwan violently
suppressed by the then-Kuomintang government.</P>
      <P>In its Feb. 28 activity, the indigenous group will advocate forming a
constitution  of the Taiwan indigenous  nation that stipulates it is equal with
the Republic of China regime.</P>
      <P>It will also promote the establishment of a nongovernment organization to handle
incidents where it believes indigenous people have been mistreated by the
Republic of China regime, according to the union.</P>
      <P>Mateli Sawawan said the tribes that join the activity will also make public
their separate calls for government action through the release of smoke.</P>

      <P>Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei on Tuesday instructed the police force in
his county to avoid the unnecessary use of handcuffs while enforcing the law.</P>
      <P>Chou told a county government meeting that he regretted a recent incident in

coeds working part-time at a video and comic book store after discovering
pornographic DVDs there.</P>

by the police was unnecessary because there was no danger that the coeds would
attempt to escape.</P>
      <P>The handcuffing of the two university students followed another incident in
Taichung County in which police handcuffed a woman whom they arrested for
picking two flowers from the side of a road.</P>
      <P>Media reports were critical of the police in both incidents for unnecessarily
intimidating and humiliating offenders.</P>
      <P>The Taipei County magistrate acknowledged that handcuffing is sometimes
necessary for legitimate security reasons, but stressed that any restraint of
suspects' movements when they are arrested must be commensurate with their
offenses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gambling fever sends Penghu land prices soaring</HEADLINE>

      <P>The price of land in Houliao in the island county of Penghu has soared since
Taiwan's legislature legalized gambling on Taiwan held islands Jan. 12, local
sources said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Sung Sen-hu, a tour business operator in Penghu, told the Central News Agency
that land in Houliao has attracted considerable interest since the county
government designated the small village -- about 20 kilometers north of Penghu's
capital city of Makong -- as the main location for casino-oriented tourism.</P>
      <P>Sung said the price of land along main roads has risen the most, rising from
NT$12,000 (US$346) per ping to between NT$30,000 and NT$40,000. One ping equals
3.3057 square meters.</P>
      <P>"The price tripled in less than one and a half months, " he said.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, the government of the island county that lies off Taiwan's
southwestern coast held a presentation in Houliao to lobby local residents for
support of its plan to have international gaming operators build luxurious
resorts with casinos in the village.</P>
      <P>The 150 villagers attending the event seemed to welcome the plan, and some
confirmed that land speculation is on the rise. Recent records on farming land
transactions showed the price has risen to between NT$5,000 and NT$6,000 per
ping.</P>
      <P>Although the legislature passed a law legalizing the operation of casinos on
Taiwan-held islands in January, any move to promote the construction of casinos
on the islands must be approved by island residents in a referendum.</P>
      <P>The Penghu County government has been holding forums to sell the idea, but
groups opposing the proposal are also making their voices heard.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MNF) will send experts later this week to
investigate  abandoned  tombs accidentally discovered in the deep jungles of
Papua New Guinea that belonged to Republic of China soldiers, a Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>While the MNF is the authority in charge of the handling of the issue, the
ministrys representative office in the Pacific country will provide assistance
on the side, said Frances Lee, deputy director-general of the MOFA's East Asian
and Pacific Affairs, in a press briefing.</P>
      <P>She said a plan to visit the tombs at the end of January was disrupted due to a
volcanic eruption there which caused the local airport to be shut down.</P>
      <P>According to a local media report in December, three deserted tombs were
discovered near the Papua New Guinea city of Rabaul, with one of them
unrecognizable and the rest identified as belonging to R.O.C. Army Captain Wu
Kun and Sergeant First Class Kung Hsien-chang, who died in 1945.</P>
      <P>During World War II, over 1,600 R.O.C. soldiers seized by the Japanese army were
sent by the Japanese government to the South Pacific region to work as slaves.
Around 650 died there and never got to return home, according to the report. The
remaining estimated 1,000 others were sent back to China by the United States
after the Japanese were defeated in the war.</P>
      <P>Indigenous people from Taiwan were also forced by the Japanese army to go to the
South Pacific to work as soldiers during the war. Efforts by well-known
aborigines to seek redress on behalf of the victims have not been successful.</P>

      <P>The government plans to halve rental and management  fees charged companies
operating  in the Pingtung Agricultural Biotechnology Park to help them ride out
the current economic slump, Vice President Vincent Siew said Tuesday during a
visit to the park.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting with representatives from park businesses, Siew said
agriculture is one of Taiwan's promising economic sectors and one the country
should count on to develop and expand both domestic demand and exports.</P>
      <P>He said that by creating  value  through  innovation  and biotechnology, the
park is expected to take the leading role in the agricultural sector over the
next 10 years, just as the Hsinchu Science Park drove growth in the science and
technology sector in the years following its launch.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, park businesses suggested that rents on land, factory
buildings and dormitories as well as management fees in the park be cut in half
for the next three years, and Siew asked Council of Agriculture Deputy Minister
Hu Hsing-hua to respond.</P>
      <P>Hu said the Executive Yuan has already approved a plan to halve the park's
rental and management fees this year and that it would be reviewed at the end of
2009.</P>
      <P>Responding to others suggestions, Siew said he will direct relevant government
agencies to study the possibility of establishing a valuation mechanism to allow
developed technologies to be valued as assets, helping the companies get greater
access to financing.</P>
      <P>Hu added that the COA will ask the Agricultural Bank of Taiwan to provide loans

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that Taiwan's people should never forget the
228 Incident and promised that his administration will continue to contribute to
the search for the historical truth of the tragedy.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Lunar New Year Reception of the Taipei 228 Incident Association
held in Taipei, Ma expressed his sympathy for victims of the incident and
promised to step up efforts to promote reconciliation and harmony in Taiwanese
society.</P>
      <P>Ma said the government and the people should learn from past mistakes and that
the events that occurred during the 228 Incident should be emphasized  in school
textbooks  to prevent  future generations from allowing similar tragic events to
occur.</P>
      <P>"We can forgive what people have done in the past, but we can never forget what
happened," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The president promised that the government will continue to provide financial
assitance to the 228 Memorial Foundation through the Ministry of Education and
will establish the legal foundation for the construction of the National Taiwan
228 Museum as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the founder of the Taipei 228 Incident Association, Liao Ji-bin, said
that Ma has demonstrated sincerity in promoting reconciliation of the chasms
among people caused by the incident since he became mayor of Taipei in 1998.</P>
      <P>"I have no doubt in my mindtthat Ma will do even more for the family members of
the 228 Incident now that he is president of the nation," Liao said.</P>
      <P>He urged politicians, however, to stop manipulating the tragedy in order to
monopolize the issue in a bid to win more votes in every major election.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident refers broadly to an uprising beginning at the end of February
1947 that culminated in the killing of tens of thousands of dissidents, elites,
and others in Taiwan by Chinese Nationalist troops.</P>
      <P>An estimated 10,000 to 30,000 people were killed during the Incident and in
ensuing violent crackdowns by the KMT administration in March and April 1947.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) is monitoring the conditions of individuals who
have had contact with a child who was infected with the measles after traveling
to China, a DOH official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chou Jih-haw, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control, said
that although no one has been infected after coming into contact with the baby
boy, the DOH will not let down its guard until mid-March.</P>
      <P>The 15-month-old baby boy who lives in central Taiwan, caught the measles while
he was hospitalized for diarrhea while traveling with his mother in Hunan,
China, Chou said.</P>
      <P>He returned to Taiwan Feb. 5, and developed a bad fever the following day. He
was diagnosed as having the measles and stayed in the hospital for six days.</P>
      <P>Chou noted that since December, there have been four imported measles cases,
adding that recently a baby girl was found to have contracted measles after
returning to Taiwan, and a baby boy in the same ward was infected, while five
others are suspected of being infected.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Taoyuan counties are now tracing those who have had contact with the
baby girl and vaccinated those children who had yet to receive measles shots.</P>
      <P>Chou noted that the outbreak of measles in China over the past three years have
become more serious, with the number rising from 100,000 to 130,000 over that
time. Some 4,600 people have been infected with the disease in China since
January.</P>
      <P>"Those who travel to China with their young children should be on high alert,"
Chou warned.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Yunlin County government and its meat market co-sponsored a fair Tuesday,
inviting the public to taste dishes prepared with locally produced pork to
dispel fears over pork safety prompted by reports that foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD) hit a local pig farm recently.</P>
      <P>Lu Cheng-chang, head of the county's agricultural affairs bureau, urged Taiwan's
consumers not to worry about consuming pork produced in the county, as local
authorities will closely scrutinize the production process to guarantee quality.</P>
      <P>The meat from the Yunlin pork market, Taiwan's largest, is distributed to over
150 distribution points around the country.</P>
      <P>Last year, the market's slaughterhouse culled 402,378 pigs and auctioned 607,271
pigs. As of Feb. 21 this year, 93,443 pigs had been sold at the Yunlin meat
market and 57,843 pigs had been slaughtered at its facility.</P>
      <P>Lee Mou-jen, vice manager of the Yunlin meat market, said the central government
has stationed 14 veterinarians at the market to ensure that the pork processed
by the market meets strict quality control standards.</P>
      <P>Last week, two cases of foot-and-mouth disease that broke out at pig farms in
Yunlin and Changhua counties in central Taiwan earlier this month were brought
to light by the local media.</P>
      <P>Huang Kuo-ching, deputy director of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection  and Quarantine  under the Council of Agriculture (COA) , said Feb.
19 that 15 pigs in a small farm in Yunlin County were found Feb. 4 to have
developed FMD symptoms. "All of the farm's 68 hogs were culled," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang further pointed out that on Feb. 9, 23 pigs in a large-scale farm in
neighboring Changhua County were also detected to have similar symptoms.</P>
      <P>The remaining 609 pigs raised under the same roof as the pigs that fell ill were
culled, while the 5,503 other pigs on the farm received  anti-FMD shots to
prevent the spread of the highly contagious viral disease, he added.</P>
      <P>Adjacent areas within a 3-kilometer radius of the two farms, are all being
closely monitored.</P>
      <P>Taiwan used to raise as many as 12 million pigs per year at the industry's peak,
with 7 million exported to Japan annually, according to COA statistics. Taiwan
now raises only about 6.4 million pigs a year, mainly for local consumption.</P>

      <P>A member of the Taichung County Council urged the public Tuesday to help ease
the tangerine glut in the county.</P>
      <P>County Councilor Hsieh Chung-fa invited representatives from more than 10
elementary and junior high schools, as well as parents associations and catering
services, to join a campaign to save local tangerine farmers.</P>
      <P>According to Chang Feng-sheng, an agriculture official with the Taichung County
government, the county has 2,400 metric tons of tangerines stored in
refrigerated warehouses.</P>
      <P>Chang said that overproduction, the early arrival of the Lunar New Year holiday,
and the economic downturn contributed to the tangerine glut.</P>
      <P>Although the government has agreed to purchase some of the tangerines at a price
of NT$6 per kilogram, the measure is not sufficient to relieve the farmers'
plight, he said.</P>
      <P>The caterers who serve lunches to Taichung County's elementary and junior middle
schools pledged to use tangerines instead of other fruits as part of their
meals.</P>
      <P>Hsieh urged all consumers in the county to buy tangerines for themselves or to
send to relatives and friends as a gift to help farmers survive during this
period of excess supply.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ex-president Chen Shui-bian sent ripples through political circles in Taipei
Tuesday by launching accusations at prominent politicians and prosecutors
handling his case during a hearing in his trial on money laundering and
corruption charges.</P>
      <P>In his appearance at the Taipei District Court, the former president suggested
that President Ma Ying-jeou is gay and that former President  Lee Teng-hui
received between NT$200 million (US$5.74 million) and NT$300 million (US$8.61
million) from Beijing.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks during a one and a half hour defense, in which he also
claimed that the eight prosecutors from the Special Investigation Division under
the Supreme Prosecutors Office who led the probe into his case are politically
biased against him.</P>
      <P>In an apparent attempt to cast doubt on the prosecutors' integrity, the former
president said one of the prosecutors, Chu Chao-liang, withheld evidence that
shows that Lee Teng-hui received aid from Beijing.</P>
      <P>He said Chu did not investigate Lee because he is a leader of the "pan-blue
forces, " referring to the ruling Kuomintang and its political allies.</P>
      <P>But Chu later responded that the evidence Chen referred to was provided by Chen
himself while he was under investigation and was just part of a spate of legal
complaints Chen filed with prosecutors against Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Chu said prosecutors were looking into the evidence against Lee that Chen
provided.</P>
      <P>The former president also claimed that another prosecutor, Wu Wen-chung,
prevented a woman from passing a disk to Frank Hsieh, the Democratic Progressive
Party's 2008 presidential candidate, that recorded her former husband's intimate
relations with then-KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>The woman, Chang Wei-jin, previously gained notoriety for lining up a meeting
between Chen and Wu at the funeral of a Buddhist master in Miaoli that exposed
Wu as having contact with an individual he was investigating.</P>
      <P>Chen also alleged at the hearing that a third prosecutor, Yueh Fang-ju, asked
him while he was still president to pardon a former Ma Ying-jeou aide.</P>
      <P>The aide was sentenced to one year in prison for using the invoices of others to
claim reimbursement from a fund set aside for Ma's use while he served as mayor
of Taipei.</P>
      <P>After Chen refused the prosecutor's request, which he said was relayed to him
through DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, Chen said Yueh indicted five former
ministers under the DPP administration for misappropriating public funds.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan backed up Chen's accusations against Yueh.</P>
      <P>Cheng said Yueh asked Tsai to relay his request to Chen while questioning Tsai
in March or April last year over her usage of a special fund during her term as
vice premier.</P>
      <P>Tsai conveyed Yueh's request to Chen in April that year, according to Cheng.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-nan, the director of the Special Investigation Division, denied,
however, that Yueh asked Chen to pardon Ma's aide.</P>
      <P>"As to the former president's claims about Wu Wen-chung, it has nothing to do
with the case for which he is being tried, " Chen Yun-nan said.</P>
      <P>Wu Wen-chung said he did dissuade Chang, who is a friend of both the former
president and him, from making public the disk on the eve of the 2008
presidential election "because the competition was already chaotic enough."</P>
      <P>He said, however, that he had no power to stop Chang from doing it and that he
had never seen the alleged disk, nor did he have any idea whether its content
was true or not.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office didn't respond to Chen's claims about President Ma
Tuesday, but KMT legislative leader Chang Sho-wen dismissed Chen's claims as
groundless.</P>
      <P>"Chen should pursue a career as a script writer rather than a political figure,"
Chang said.</P>
      <P>Lin Chih-jia, secretary-general of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, which consists
of Lee's political followers and usually speaks for him, said his party was busy
with helping people weather the current economic slump and would not dignify
Chen's claims against Lee with a response.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian was indicted on Dec. 12, 2008 along with 13 family members and
former aides for allegedly siphoning off NT$490 million (US$14.12 million) in
public funds, and stashing part of them in overseas bank accounts.</P>
      <P>He is the only one of the defendants being held in custody as prosecutors
continued to probe alleged irregularities in the former president's handling of
his government's second round of financial reform.</P>
      <P>In a related development Tuesday, Government Information Minister Su Jun-pin
said the Ministry of Justice is studying how to deal with Financial Times
correspondent Robin Kwong, who interviewed Chen Shui-bian in his cell Feb. 18
without the approval of the detention center's authorities.</P>

      <P>The government has not set a timetable for the signing of a Comprehensive

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan hinted Tuesday that he would consider resigning if a
special four-year NT$500 billion (US$14.45 billion) public works expansion
package the Cabinet has proposed fails to pull Taiwan out of its current
economic slump.</P>
      <P>"If the project falls short of its target, I would acknowledge the failure and
fully assume responsibility, " Liu said in answer to a question from an
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker on what the premier would
do if Taiwan's economy contracts by more than 5 percent rather than the 2.97
percent forecast by the government.</P>
      <P>He said he would know whether to stay on or step down.</P>
      <P>Liu also said that the local economy's performance must be measured in
comparison to other countries.</P>
      <P>"A negative 5 percent economic growth rate might be a relatively good
performance by that time," he suggested.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, the four-year NT$500 billion special budget will help create
190,000 to 220,000 job opportunities in 2009 and push Taiwan's gross domestic
product higher by 0.97 percent this year and 1.02 percent in 2010, 2011 and
2012.</P>
      <P>"Taking the 0.97 percent into consideration, Taiwan's GDP will still contract by
2.97 percent in 2009," he asserted.</P>
      <P>In its weekly meeting Feb. 12, the Executive Yuan approved the NT$500 billion
budget to fund a stimulus package that it believes will help mitigate the impact
of the global economic slowdown, and it now hopes the Legislative Yuan will pass
it as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The package contains 20 prime investment projects and 64 plans to serve six
major goals: to upgrade the transportation network, build a safe and anti-
disaster environment, enhance cultural and living standards, strengthen national
competitiveness and infrastructure, improve transport facilities on outlying
islands, and foster high-end talent and stabilize the job market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Indigenous tribes to form united front for sovereignty over land</HEADLINE>

      <P>Indigenous tribes around Taiwan will simultaneously light fires in their
communities on Feb. 28, using the resulting "smoke signals" to send a message to
the government that they are sovereign owners of their land, a spokesman for an
indigenous rights group said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the Taitung County-based Smoke Motion Union, it will be the second
time in a year that indigenous tribes, including the Pinuyumayan, Amis and
Bunun, will act in unison to spread their message in the same way their
ancestors once communicated with the sky and the spirit of the nature.</P>
      <P>Last Feb. 28, dense smoke rose simultaneously from dozens of tribal villages
around the island, conveying the angry voices of indigenous peoples over the
government's ignorance of their natural hunting and fishing rights on their own
land.</P>
      <P>The campaign was formed after a group of Pinuyumayan hunters from the Katatipul
tribe in Taitung City were obstructed by forest police from their annual sacred
hunting ceremony in late 2007 in what they claimed was a rough and disrespectful
manner.</P>
      <P>The incident triggered protests by the Katatipul people, which then developed
into a joint call among indigenous tribes around Taiwan for the government to
respect their natural rights and indigenous sovereignty, said Mateli Sawawan, a
spokesman for the Smoke Motion Union.</P>
      <P>The call turned into a protest rally held by indigenous people from around the
country in front of the Presidential Office on March 8, 2008.</P>
      <P>The call, however, has never been properly answered since then, the union
argued, which is why it is preparing a second round of protests on Feb. 28, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Asked why the group chose that day, Mateli Sawawan explained that Feb. 28 is a
day on which justice has been upheld after the government made a public apology
for the 228 Incident, also known as the 228 Massacre, in 1947.</P>
      <P>The incident was an anti-government, anti-Chinese uprising in Taiwan violently
suppressed by the then-Kuomintang government.</P>
      <P>In its Feb. 28 activity, the indigenous group will advocate forming a
constitution  of the Taiwan indigenous  nation that stipulates it is equal with
the Republic of China regime.</P>
      <P>It will also promote the establishment of a nongovernment organization to handle
incidents where it believes indigenous people have been mistreated by the
Republic of China regime, according to the union.</P>
      <P>Mateli Sawawan said the tribes that join the activity will also make public
their separate calls for government action through the release of smoke.</P>

      <P>The KRTC will accept applications for the card from March 2 to May 31,  and
those applying must submit documents from local government departments
certifying that they are currently receiving unemployment benefits or are

      <P>Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei on Tuesday instructed the police force in
his county to avoid the unnecessary use of handcuffs while enforcing the law.</P>
      <P>Chou told a county government meeting that he regretted a recent incident in
which police in Danshuei township arrested and handcuffed two Tamkang University
coeds working part-time at a video and comic book store after discovering
pornographic DVDs there.</P>
      <P>"The use of handcuffs should be the exception, not the rule," Chou said at the
meeting, attended by police chiefs.</P>
      <P>Chou added that in the case of the arrest of the two coeds, the use of handcuffs
by the police was unnecessary because there was no danger that the coeds would
attempt to escape.</P>
      <P>The handcuffing of the two university students followed another incident in
Taichung County in which police handcuffed a woman whom they arrested for
picking two flowers from the side of a road.</P>
      <P>Media reports were critical of the police in both incidents for unnecessarily
intimidating and humiliating offenders.</P>
      <P>The Taipei County magistrate acknowledged that handcuffing is sometimes
necessary for legitimate security reasons, but stressed that any restraint of
suspects' movements when they are arrested must be commensurate with their
offenses.</P>

      <P>The price of land in Houliao in the island county of Penghu has soared since
Taiwan's legislature legalized gambling on Taiwan held islands Jan. 12, local
sources said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Sung Sen-hu, a tour business operator in Penghu, told the Central News Agency
that land in Houliao has attracted considerable interest since the county
government designated the small village -- about 20 kilometers north of Penghu's
capital city of Makong -- as the main location for casino-oriented tourism.</P>
      <P>Sung said the price of land along main roads has risen the most, rising from
NT$12,000 (US$346) per ping to between NT$30,000 and NT$40,000. One ping equals
3.3057 square meters.</P>
      <P>"The price tripled in less than one and a half months, " he said.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, the government of the island county that lies off Taiwan's
southwestern coast held a presentation in Houliao to lobby local residents for
support of its plan to have international gaming operators build luxurious
resorts with casinos in the village.</P>
      <P>The 150 villagers attending the event seemed to welcome the plan, and some
confirmed that land speculation is on the rise. Recent records on farming land
transactions showed the price has risen to between NT$5,000 and NT$6,000 per
ping.</P>
      <P>Although the legislature passed a law legalizing the operation of casinos on
Taiwan-held islands in January, any move to promote the construction of casinos
on the islands must be approved by island residents in a referendum.</P>
      <P>The Penghu County government has been holding forums to sell the idea, but
groups opposing the proposal are also making their voices heard.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MNF) will send experts later this week to
investigate  abandoned  tombs accidentally discovered in the deep jungles of
Papua New Guinea that belonged to Republic of China soldiers, a Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>While the MNF is the authority in charge of the handling of the issue, the
ministrys representative office in the Pacific country will provide assistance
on the side, said Frances Lee, deputy director-general of the MOFA's East Asian
and Pacific Affairs, in a press briefing.</P>
      <P>She said a plan to visit the tombs at the end of January was disrupted due to a
volcanic eruption there which caused the local airport to be shut down.</P>
      <P>According to a local media report in December, three deserted tombs were
discovered near the Papua New Guinea city of Rabaul, with one of them
unrecognizable and the rest identified as belonging to R.O.C. Army Captain Wu
Kun and Sergeant First Class Kung Hsien-chang, who died in 1945.</P>
      <P>During World War II, over 1,600 R.O.C. soldiers seized by the Japanese army were
sent by the Japanese government to the South Pacific region to work as slaves.
Around 650 died there and never got to return home, according to the report. The
remaining estimated 1,000 others were sent back to China by the United States
after the Japanese were defeated in the war.</P>
      <P>Indigenous people from Taiwan were also forced by the Japanese army to go to the
South Pacific to work as soldiers during the war. Efforts by well-known
aborigines to seek redress on behalf of the victims have not been successful.</P>

      <P>The government plans to halve rental and management  fees charged companies
operating  in the Pingtung Agricultural Biotechnology Park to help them ride out
the current economic slump, Vice President Vincent Siew said Tuesday during a
visit to the park.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting with representatives from park businesses, Siew said
agriculture is one of Taiwan's promising economic sectors and one the country
should count on to develop and expand both domestic demand and exports.</P>
      <P>He said that by creating  value  through  innovation  and biotechnology, the
park is expected to take the leading role in the agricultural sector over the
next 10 years, just as the Hsinchu Science Park drove growth in the science and
technology sector in the years following its launch.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, park businesses suggested that rents on land, factory
buildings and dormitories as well as management fees in the park be cut in half
for the next three years, and Siew asked Council of Agriculture Deputy Minister
Hu Hsing-hua to respond.</P>
      <P>Hu said the Executive Yuan has already approved a plan to halve the park's
rental and management fees this year and that it would be reviewed at the end of

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that Taiwan's people should never forget the
228 Incident and promised that his administration will continue to contribute to
the search for the historical truth of the tragedy.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Lunar New Year Reception of the Taipei 228 Incident Association
held in Taipei, Ma expressed his sympathy for victims of the incident and
promised to step up efforts to promote reconciliation and harmony in Taiwanese
society.</P>
      <P>Ma said the government and the people should learn from past mistakes and that
the events that occurred during the 228 Incident should be emphasized  in school
textbooks  to prevent  future generations from allowing similar tragic events to
occur.</P>
      <P>"We can forgive what people have done in the past, but we can never forget what
happened," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The president promised that the government will continue to provide financial
assitance to the 228 Memorial Foundation through the Ministry of Education and
will establish the legal foundation for the construction of the National Taiwan
228 Museum as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the founder of the Taipei 228 Incident Association, Liao Ji-bin, said
that Ma has demonstrated sincerity in promoting reconciliation of the chasms
among people caused by the incident since he became mayor of Taipei in 1998.</P>
      <P>"I have no doubt in my mindtthat Ma will do even more for the family members of
the 228 Incident now that he is president of the nation," Liao said.</P>
      <P>He urged politicians, however, to stop manipulating the tragedy in order to
monopolize the issue in a bid to win more votes in every major election.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident refers broadly to an uprising beginning at the end of February
1947 that culminated in the killing of tens of thousands of dissidents, elites,
and others in Taiwan by Chinese Nationalist troops.</P>
      <P>An estimated 10,000 to 30,000 people were killed during the Incident and in

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) is monitoring the conditions of individuals who
have had contact with a child who was infected with the measles after traveling
to China, a DOH official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chou Jih-haw, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control, said
that although no one has been infected after coming into contact with the baby
boy, the DOH will not let down its guard until mid-March.</P>
      <P>The 15-month-old baby boy who lives in central Taiwan, caught the measles while
he was hospitalized for diarrhea while traveling with his mother in Hunan,
China, Chou said.</P>
      <P>He returned to Taiwan Feb. 5, and developed a bad fever the following day. He
was diagnosed as having the measles and stayed in the hospital for six days.</P>
      <P>Chou noted that since December, there have been four imported measles cases,
adding that recently a baby girl was found to have contracted measles after
returning to Taiwan, and a baby boy in the same ward was infected, while five
others are suspected of being infected.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Taoyuan counties are now tracing those who have had contact with the
baby girl and vaccinated those children who had yet to receive measles shots.</P>
      <P>Chou noted that the outbreak of measles in China over the past three years have

time. Some 4,600 people have been infected with the disease in China since

      <P>The Yunlin County government and its meat market co-sponsored a fair Tuesday,
inviting the public to taste dishes prepared with locally produced pork to
dispel fears over pork safety prompted by reports that foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD) hit a local pig farm recently.</P>
      <P>Lu Cheng-chang, head of the county's agricultural affairs bureau, urged Taiwan's
consumers not to worry about consuming pork produced in the county, as local
authorities will closely scrutinize the production process to guarantee quality.</P>
      <P>The meat from the Yunlin pork market, Taiwan's largest, is distributed to over
150 distribution points around the country.</P>
      <P>Last year, the market's slaughterhouse culled 402,378 pigs and auctioned 607,271
pigs. As of Feb. 21 this year, 93,443 pigs had been sold at the Yunlin meat
market and 57,843 pigs had been slaughtered at its facility.</P>
      <P>Lee Mou-jen, vice manager of the Yunlin meat market, said the central government
has stationed 14 veterinarians at the market to ensure that the pork processed
by the market meets strict quality control standards.</P>
      <P>Last week, two cases of foot-and-mouth disease that broke out at pig farms in
Yunlin and Changhua counties in central Taiwan earlier this month were brought
to light by the local media.</P>
      <P>Huang Kuo-ching, deputy director of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection  and Quarantine  under the Council of Agriculture (COA) , said Feb.
19 that 15 pigs in a small farm in Yunlin County were found Feb. 4 to have
developed FMD symptoms. "All of the farm's 68 hogs were culled," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang further pointed out that on Feb. 9, 23 pigs in a large-scale farm in
neighboring Changhua County were also detected to have similar symptoms.</P>
      <P>The remaining 609 pigs raised under the same roof as the pigs that fell ill were
culled, while the 5,503 other pigs on the farm received  anti-FMD shots to
prevent the spread of the highly contagious viral disease, he added.</P>
      <P>Adjacent areas within a 3-kilometer radius of the two farms, are all being
closely monitored.</P>
      <P>Taiwan used to raise as many as 12 million pigs per year at the industry's peak,
with 7 million exported to Japan annually, according to COA statistics. Taiwan
now raises only about 6.4 million pigs a year, mainly for local consumption.</P>

      <P>According to Chang Feng-sheng, an agriculture official with the Taichung County
government, the county has 2,400 metric tons of tangerines stored in
refrigerated warehouses.</P>
      <P>Chang said that overproduction, the early arrival of the Lunar New Year holiday,
and the economic downturn contributed to the tangerine glut.</P>
      <P>Although the government has agreed to purchase some of the tangerines at a price
of NT$6 per kilogram, the measure is not sufficient to relieve the farmers'
plight, he said.</P>
      <P>The caterers who serve lunches to Taichung County's elementary and junior middle

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ex-president Chen Shui-bian sent ripples through political circles in Taipei
Tuesday by launching accusations at prominent politicians and prosecutors
handling his case during a hearing in his trial on money laundering and
corruption charges.</P>
      <P>In his appearance at the Taipei District Court, the former president suggested
that President Ma Ying-jeou is gay and that former President  Lee Teng-hui
received between NT$200 million (US$5.74 million) and NT$300 million (US$8.61
million) from Beijing.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks during a one and a half hour defense, in which he also
claimed that the eight prosecutors from the Special Investigation Division under
the Supreme Prosecutors Office who led the probe into his case are politically
biased against him.</P>
      <P>In an apparent attempt to cast doubt on the prosecutors' integrity, the former
president said one of the prosecutors, Chu Chao-liang, withheld evidence that
shows that Lee Teng-hui received aid from Beijing.</P>
      <P>He said Chu did not investigate Lee because he is a leader of the "pan-blue
forces, " referring to the ruling Kuomintang and its political allies.</P>
      <P>But Chu later responded that the evidence Chen referred to was provided by Chen
himself while he was under investigation and was just part of a spate of legal
complaints Chen filed with prosecutors against Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Chu said prosecutors were looking into the evidence against Lee that Chen
provided.</P>
      <P>The former president also claimed that another prosecutor, Wu Wen-chung,
prevented a woman from passing a disk to Frank Hsieh, the Democratic Progressive
Party's 2008 presidential candidate, that recorded her former husband's intimate
relations with then-KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>The woman, Chang Wei-jin, previously gained notoriety for lining up a meeting
between Chen and Wu at the funeral of a Buddhist master in Miaoli that exposed
Wu as having contact with an individual he was investigating.</P>
      <P>Chen also alleged at the hearing that a third prosecutor, Yueh Fang-ju, asked
him while he was still president to pardon a former Ma Ying-jeou aide.</P>
      <P>The aide was sentenced to one year in prison for using the invoices of others to
claim reimbursement from a fund set aside for Ma's use while he served as mayor
of Taipei.</P>
      <P>After Chen refused the prosecutor's request, which he said was relayed to him
through DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, Chen said Yueh indicted five former
ministers under the DPP administration for misappropriating public funds.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan backed up Chen's accusations against Yueh.</P>
      <P>Cheng said Yueh asked Tsai to relay his request to Chen while questioning Tsai
in March or April last year over her usage of a special fund during her term as
vice premier.</P>
      <P>Tsai conveyed Yueh's request to Chen in April that year, according to Cheng.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-nan, the director of the Special Investigation Division, denied,
however, that Yueh asked Chen to pardon Ma's aide.</P>
      <P>"As to the former president's claims about Wu Wen-chung, it has nothing to do
with the case for which he is being tried, " Chen Yun-nan said.</P>
      <P>Wu Wen-chung said he did dissuade Chang, who is a friend of both the former
president and him, from making public the disk on the eve of the 2008
presidential election "because the competition was already chaotic enough."</P>
      <P>He said, however, that he had no power to stop Chang from doing it and that he
had never seen the alleged disk, nor did he have any idea whether its content
was true or not.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office didn't respond to Chen's claims about President Ma
Tuesday, but KMT legislative leader Chang Sho-wen dismissed Chen's claims as
groundless.</P>
      <P>"Chen should pursue a career as a script writer rather than a political figure,"
Chang said.</P>
      <P>Lin Chih-jia, secretary-general of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, which consists
of Lee's political followers and usually speaks for him, said his party was busy
with helping people weather the current economic slump and would not dignify
Chen's claims against Lee with a response.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian was indicted on Dec. 12, 2008 along with 13 family members and
former aides for allegedly siphoning off NT$490 million (US$14.12 million) in
public funds, and stashing part of them in overseas bank accounts.</P>
      <P>He is the only one of the defendants being held in custody as prosecutors
continued to probe alleged irregularities in the former president's handling of
his government's second round of financial reform.</P>
      <P>In a related development Tuesday, Government Information Minister Su Jun-pin
said the Ministry of Justice is studying how to deal with Financial Times
correspondent Robin Kwong, who interviewed Chen Shui-bian in his cell Feb. 18
without the approval of the detention center's authorities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH on guard against measles outbreak</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  24  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) is monitoring the conditions of individuals who
have had contact with a child who was infected with the measles after traveling
to China, a DOH official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chou Jih-haw, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control, said
that although no one has been infected after coming into contact with the baby
boy, the DOH will not let down its guard until mid-March.</P>
      <P>The 15-month-old baby boy who lives in central Taiwan, caught the measles while
he was hospitalized for diarrhea while traveling with his mother in Hunan,
China, Chou said.</P>
      <P>He returned to Taiwan Feb. 5, and developed a bad fever the following day. He
was diagnosed as having the measles and stayed in the hospital for six days.</P>
      <P>Chou noted that since December, there have been four imported measles cases,
adding that recently a baby girl was found to have contracted measles after
returning to Taiwan, and a baby boy in the same ward was infected, while five
others are suspected of being infected.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Taoyuan counties are now tracing those who have had contact with the
baby girl and vaccinated those children who had yet to receive measles shots.</P>
      <P>Chou noted that the outbreak of measles in China over the past three years have
become more serious, with the number rising from 100,000 to 130,000 over that
time. Some 4,600 people have been infected with the disease in China since
January.</P>
      <P>"Those who travel to China with their young children should be on high alert,"
Chou warned.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Locally produced pork safe: Yunlin County</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 24 (CNA)
02/25/09  10:49:34
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Yunlin County government and its meat market co-sponsored a fair Tuesday,
inviting the public to taste dishes prepared with locally produced pork to
dispel fears over pork safety prompted by reports that foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD) hit a local pig farm recently.</P>
      <P>Lu Cheng-chang, head of the county's agricultural affairs bureau, urged Taiwan's
consumers not to worry about consuming pork produced in the county, as local
authorities will closely scrutinize the production process to guarantee quality.</P>
      <P>The meat from the Yunlin pork market, Taiwan's largest, is distributed to over
150 distribution points around the country.</P>
      <P>Last year, the market's slaughterhouse culled 402,378 pigs and auctioned 607,271
pigs. As of Feb. 21 this year, 93,443 pigs had been sold at the Yunlin meat
market and 57,843 pigs had been slaughtered at its facility.</P>
      <P>Lee Mou-jen, vice manager of the Yunlin meat market, said the central government
has stationed 14 veterinarians at the market to ensure that the pork processed
by the market meets strict quality control standards.</P>
      <P>Last week, two cases of foot-and-mouth disease that broke out at pig farms in
Yunlin and Changhua counties in central Taiwan earlier this month were brought
to light by the local media.</P>
      <P>Huang Kuo-ching, deputy director of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection  and Quarantine  under the Council of Agriculture (COA) , said Feb.
19 that 15 pigs in a small farm in Yunlin County were found Feb. 4 to have
developed FMD symptoms. "All of the farm's 68 hogs were culled," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang further pointed out that on Feb. 9, 23 pigs in a large-scale farm in
neighboring Changhua County were also detected to have similar symptoms.</P>
      <P>The remaining 609 pigs raised under the same roof as the pigs that fell ill were
culled, while the 5,503 other pigs on the farm received  anti-FMD shots to
prevent the spread of the highly contagious viral disease, he added.</P>
      <P>Adjacent areas within a 3-kilometer radius of the two farms, are all being
closely monitored.</P>
      <P>Taiwan used to raise as many as 12 million pigs per year at the industry's peak,
with 7 million exported to Japan annually, according to COA statistics. Taiwan
now raises only about 6.4 million pigs a year, mainly for local consumption.</P>

    <HEADLINE>International orchid show slated to open March 6</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan International Orchid Show and Conference 2009, slated to open March 6
in Tainan County, is likely to outdraw last year's show despite the floundering
global economy, the Tainan County government said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>As of Feb. 24, buyers from 29 countries have registered to visit the show, more
than the 24 countries represented at the 2008 show, which generated NT$2.4
billion (US$77.67 million) in orders, the Tainan County Department of
Agriculture said.</P>
      <P>Of the foreign groups, Thailand's contingent of more than 100 buyers will be the
largest, department officials said.</P>
      <P>An international symposium on orchid cultivation will also be held on the first
day of the event, which will run from March 6-16 and is being co-sponsored by
the Taiwan Orchid Growers Association based in Tainan County's Houbi Township.</P>
      <P>Kuo Yi-ping, director of the department, said this year's show is even bigger
than last year's -- which attracted 2,000 foreign visitors -- with the
exhibition space expanded by 3,300 square feet, and a vast orchid nursery added
as an exhibition venue.</P>
      <P>Aside from Thailand, most foreign buyers attending this year's show will be
coming from the United States, Japan and Europe. Other buyers from Latin
American countries and territories, such as Ecuador and Puerto Rico, will be
visiting Taiwan for the first time, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Orchids are one of Taiwan's major exports, accounting for over 50 percent of the
total value of the country's horticultural exports, with the show playing an
important role in Taiwan's increasing orchid exports each year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is known as the "Kingdom of the Butterfly Orchid" because it is the
world's largest exporter of the flower. About half the world's butterfly orchid
varieties are bred in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lu knocks off Hewitt, shows form ahead of Davis Cup</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
02/25/09  13:48:49
(By Luke Sabatier)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Seeded in an ATP Tour event for only the second time in his career, Taiwan's Lu
Yen-hsun lived up to the billing by knocking out a big name.</P>
      <P>Lu, seeded eighth in the 32-player draw, overcame Australia's Lleyton Hewitt
7-5, 2-6, 6-2 Tuesday to advance to the second round of the Delray Beach
International Tennis Championships in southern Florida.</P>
      <P>The victory deprived Hewitt, who turned 28 Tuesday, of a planned on-court
birthday celebration after the match and marked Lu's continuing run of good form
that has seen him defeat Andy Murray at last August's Beijing Olympics and world
No. 11 David Nalbandian at the Australian Open in January.</P>
      <P>Last seeded in an ATP Tour in Chennai, India in 2005, the world No. 59 Taiwanese
appeared to have been hit with an unfavorable draw this week.</P>
      <P>Although Hewitt has fallen out of the top 100 after having hip surgery in
August, he reached the semifinals of a tournament in Memphis last week before
losing to Andy Roddick in three sets and seemed on the road to recovering his
place among the world's elite players.</P>
      <P>"I never thought I would win today, " Lu acknowledged after the match, saying he
handled the wind blowing in from the nearby Atlantic Ocean better than the
Australian.</P>
      <P>After losing the tightly contested first set on a double fault, Hewitt threw Lu
off by playing more defensively and relying heavily on a slice backhand in the
second set.</P>
      <P>"I was in too much of a hurry to attack, and that led to a lot of unforced
errors, " Lu said. He quickly rebounded, however, breaking Hewitt three times in
the third set and running off its last three games to clinch the match.</P>
      <P>Lu will next face 32-year-old Austrian Stefan Koubek, who won the event in 2000
when he was ranked as high as 20th in the world but has since fallen out of the
top 200.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan's next Davis Cup tie set for March 6-8 against India in Kaohsiung,
Lu's good form is well timed.</P>
      <P>Lu missed the Davis Cup tie against Kazakhstan earlier this month with a bad
knee, but Wang Yeu-tzuoo, who was sidelined for much of 2008 with a wrist
injury, filled in admirably, winning both of his singles matches in Taiwan's 4-1
victory.</P>
      <P>The pain in Wang's wrist resurfaced after the two matches, however, and after
consulting with doctors, Wang decided to have surgery Feb. 26 to repair ligament
damage that will keep him out of action for at least five months.</P>
      <P>Without Wang, it will be up to Lu and Chen Ti in singles, and probably Yang
Tsung-hua and Yi Chu-huan in doubles, to take on an Indian team featuring
Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi, both ranked in the world's top 10 in doubles,
and Somdey Dewarman and Rohan Bopanna.</P>
      <P>A victory would put Taiwan one win away -- probably against Australia and
Lleyton Hewitt in mid-July -- from reaching the World Group playoffs for the
first time in history.</P>
      <P>The March 6-8 tie will be played at Kaohsiung's Yang Ming Tennis Center, and
Taiwan's tennis association is taking the unprecedented step of charging
admission. A one-day pass will cost NT$400 and a pass for all three days will be
NT$1,000.</P>

      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng urged the Cabinet Wednesday to allow the
outlying island to introduce tap water from China to solve its water shortage
problem.</P>
      <P>The method would also provide an alternative to local water resources, which
have long been criticized for their poor quality, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee made the call while presiding over the inauguration of one of several
facilities installed by the Kinmen County Waterworks to remove iron and
manganese from potable water in Kinmen and improve its quality.</P>
      <P>He raised the issue ahead of a planned Council for Economic Planning and

    <HEADLINE>President praises late peasant movement leader for selfless love</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 25 (CNA)
02/25/09  15:57:19
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Wednesday praised Chien Chi, who led peasant movements
in 1926 during the Japanese colonial era and after the 228 Incident in 1947, for
his selflessness in helping exploited farmers.</P>
      <P>"Chien's selfless love and devotion to Taiwan by choosing to stand with helpless
peasants  is the main reason why he is remembered, " Ma said at the opening
ceremony of an exhibition titled "Taiwan Agriculturist Movement -- Revolutionist
Chien Chi" being held at the National Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall.</P>
      <P>Chien established the "Taiwanese Federation of Farmers' Unions" in 1926 to
counter the exploitation of local farmers by Japan, which colonized Taiwan from
1895-1945.</P>
      <P>After the 228 Incident occurred in 1947, Chien formed the "self-governing allied
forces" to fight against the then ruling Kuomintang (KMT) troops. He was
arrested and sentenced to death in 1950.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident refers to an uprising that began on Feb. 28, 1947, and resulted
in a brutal crackdown by Kuomintang (KMT) troops in March and April of that year
led to the deaths of as many as 30,000 people.</P>
      <P>Many other innocent people, including many elite members of society, were
blacklisted and suffered victimization.</P>
      <P>"By thrusting himself to fight against injustice in society, Chien showed
extraordinary passion and courage," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the same occasion, Chien Ming-ren, Chien's youngest son and
president of the CGCH Foundation For Education, said that Ma's attendance at the
event showed the government's respect for the people and regret over the 228
Incident.</P>
      <P>"Only by unearthing the historical truth and restoring the historical status and
clearing the names of those who sacrificed for the country and people can we
soothe the pain of the past and march toward a peaceful future," he said.</P>
      <P>People today might not understand the feeling of living under fear, but the
happiness that people enjoy now was the result of efforts made by those who
fought the authortarian regime years ago, he said.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which is being organized by the National Cultural Association,
the National Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, and the CGCH Foundation For
Education, will run from Feb. 25 to March 5 and feature photographs of Chien Chi
and Taiwan's agricultural movements.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's (KMT's) Clean Government Committee (CGC) is pushing for
the early enactment of an amendment to the Anti-Corruption Act that would
incriminate public office holders holding assets whose sources cannot be
identified.</P>
      <P>The CGC resolved Tuesday to invite Lin Yi-shih, the executive director of the
KMT's Central Policy Committee, to brief the KMT anti-corruption committee in
March on the progress made in pushing the amendment through the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lin said he hopes the amendment can be passed in this legislative session so
that it can quickly take effect.</P>
      <P>At Tuesday's meeting, CGC member Wu Tung-ming proposed that the KMT put more
pressure on the legislature to get the amendment passed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Noting that the measure has been pending in the legislature for years, Wu said
the corruption and money-laundering scandal involving former President Chen
Shui-bian and his family could probably have been avoided if such a statute were
in place years ago.</P>
      <P>The amendment would hold public officials criminally liable if they could not
identify the sources of or account for dubious assets in their possession.</P>
      <P>The former first family has been indicted by prosecutors on charges of
embezzling or taking bribes worth a total of nearly NT$500 million, with the
sources of some the family's financial holdings still being questioned.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife contend  the funds  were all political contributions to
finance his election campaigns.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) warned Wednesday that the
unemployment situation in Taiwan may be worse than most people realize, with the
actual number of people out of work more than double the official figure.</P>
      <P>According to DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang, the results of a recent survey
conducted by the DPP showed that the country's unemployment rate stands at 9.47
percent, with the number of jobless workers totalling 1.25 million.</P>
      <P>The figures are significantly higher than the latest data released Jan. 22 by
the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) , which
revealed that the unemployment rate was 5.03 percent in December, with 549,000
people out of work then, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The DPP survey, which was carried out Feb. 17-18 among 1,238 people,  adopted
the same criteria  as the DGBAS  to define "unemployed, " namely the respondents
were out of work, looking for jobs and ready to assume employment immediately,
he said.</P>
      <P>The survey found that half of the unemployed respondents lost their jobs
involuntarily.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that 590,000 people were laid off by their employers and another
130,000 first-time job seekers failed to land a job, while 520,000 gave up their
jobs voluntarily, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Among those who still hold a job, 10 percent have had a pay cut, and 4.7 percent
have been forced to take unpaid leave.</P>
      <P>The results of another DPP survey conducted Feb. 17-18 among 1,140 adults
revealed that 63.3 percent of those who are jobless do not think the
government's measures will help solve the worsening unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>Slightly more than 74 percent of the respondents said they believe the
government's economic policy emphasizes only short-term effects, while 72.9
percent disagreed with President Ma Ying-jeou's prediction that the economy will
begin to improve in the second quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>Also Wednesday, Wu Jui-ying, operations manager of the online employment broker
1111 Job Bank, said 350,000 people are currently looking for jobs through the
job bank, but there are only 150,000 openings up for grabs.</P>
      <P>Wu predicted that the unemployment situation will worsen in June, when 300,000
fresh college graduates are expected to enter the job market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The paradise fish -- a small freshwater fish once commonly found in rivers and
creeks around Taiwan -- is nearly extinct in the wild in Taiwan, but one fish
breeding station has been successfully breeding the species in captivity.</P>
      <P>Lin Hung-kuei, the director of Hualien County's Fish Breeding Propagation
Station, said that pollution and competitive immigrant fish have driven the
native fish from their natural breeding places and have made it nearly
impossible to reintroduce it to the wild and replenish its stocks.</P>
      <P>After the fish was designated by the government as a protected species in August
1990, however, the station began studying ways to help revive it and has
successfully breeded the fish in controlled environments and preserved the
species of the fish endemic to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The station's breeding technique is now being passed on to schools for use as an
educational tool in their experimental ponds, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Paradise fish (Macropodus opercularis)  are approximately 6 centimeters in
length and live in shallow freshwater environments where the water flow is
gentle and slow.</P>
      <P>According to the fish breeding propagation station, although they are rarely
seen in the wild, paradise fish with their green-blue and light red stripes are
popular in the aquatic species market for display in private fish tanks.</P>
      <P>Lin said that most of the paradise fish traded in the market are bred
artificially, while some are imported from Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Apart from being appreciated for its appearance, the fish can also be used to
eradicate mosquitoes because it eats mosquito larva. According to Lin, a
paradise fish can swallow over 300 larvae in a day.</P>

lead a group of local farmers to Japan next month to promote the county's farm
produce and hopefully chalk up more than NT$100 million (US$2.97 million) in
business deals.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference held at the county headquarters, where some of the

the way for locally produced goods to break into Northeast Asian markets, apart
from the Chinese and Southeast Asian markets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Anti-unemployment measures to show results in three months: premier</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.   25  (CNA)
02/25/09  19:14:25

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan expressed confidence Wednesday that the measures
introduced by the government to combat unemployment will produce better results
in the coming two or three months.</P>
      <P>Liu pledged that the government will work to control this year's unemployment
situation "within acceptable limits."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate soared to 5.03 percent in December 2008, hitting the
highest level since October 2003 and marking the first time in five years that
the monthly jobless rate topped 5 percent. The average unemployment rate for
2008 was 4.14 percent, which represented a four-year high.</P>
      <P>The premier addressed the issue during a meeting with personnel officials, in
which he urged government employees to do their jobs to the best of their
ability so as to put themselves over the top.</P>
      <P>Liu said the government may be a bit optimistic by forecasting that Taiwan's
gross domestic product will shrink only by 2.97 percent this year, but he
stressed the forecast is not based on "blind optimism."</P>
      <P>Liu said he is confident in the government's ability to get things done,
pointing to the growth in government investment in the fourth quarter of last
year and the fact that as many as 53 percent of the government's stimulus
package to boost domestic demand have been implemented over the past five
months.</P>
      <P>He argued that the recent decrease in bank lending does not mean a failure of
the government's policy to encourage banks to provide financing boldly to
healthy businesses, but reflects a fall in demand.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, Taiwan's export volume has decreased by NT$200 billion due
to a contraction in global market demand.</P>
      <P>At present, the government's most urgent tasks are to look for new export
markets and stimulate investment and exports, Liu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government began to purchase surplus ponkan tangerines from farmers in
Taichung County's Dongshih township Wednesday and turn them into compost in an
attempt to stabilize the market for the fruit.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Agriculture  and Food Agency under the Cabinet-level Council
of Agriculture said they will buy 500 metric tons of second-grade ponkan
tangerines at NT$6 per kilogram before March 6 and send the fruit to another
Taichung County township, Wufeng, to have it processed into green fertilizer.</P>
      <P>Dongshih township head Yeh Yu-chin said it pained him to see the fruits of the
farmers' year of labor being carried away by the truckload, knowing they will be
scrapped.</P>
      <P>An elderly woman among the onlookers kept sighing and calling it "such a waste."
She said there was nothing wrong with the tangerines, which were sweet and
succulent, except that they were only a bit smaller than top grade fruit.</P>
      <P>According to Taichung County agriculture officials, the county still has 2,400
metric tons of tangerines stored in refrigerated warehouses. They attributed the
glut to overproduction, the early arrival of the Lunar New Year holiday, and the
ongoing economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Dongshih ponkan tangerines are one of the most famous fruits in Taiwan. They are
sweet, fragrant and succulent and full of vitamins A and C.</P>
      <P>The fruit is harvested from late September to late December and can be stored
for several months. Farmers usually sell a portion of their harvest on the
market while keeping the rest wrapped in individual plastic bags and stored in
refrigerated warehouses until January or March of the following year to fetch
better prices.</P>
      <P>Local  agriculture  officials,  who fear that  the central government's bulk
purchase is not enough to relieve the farmers' plight, have launched a campaign
to call on the public to consume more tangerines to ease the glut and help the
farmers.</P>

02/25/09  19:34:49
(EPA) pledged Wednesday to review the use of polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration in manufacturing and packaging
applications because of environmental concerns.</P>
      <P>The agency was responding to calls by environmental groups to ban the widely
used plastic in food packaging and medical accessories because of its
detrimental effect on the environment throughout its life cycle, from production
to disposal.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Ho-lin, secretary-general of the Taiwan Watch Institute, a private group
dedicated to protecting Taiwan's natural environment, said the plasticizing and
stabilizing agents in PVC -- such as DEHP, DOP, cadmium and lead -- may harm
people's kidneys or reproductive systems or lower their intelligence.</P>
      <P>Those toxic substances can be released from PVC articles not just at high
temperatures but also at normal room temperatures, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He therefore urged the government to immediately ban the use of PVC in food
packaging, phase out PVC water pipes and bar the recycling of PVC waste in
incinerators to reduce the accumulation of dioxin in the environment.</P>
      <P>Other environmental groups also urged the government to ban the use of the
widely used plastic in medical accessories, such as blood bags and gloves.</P>
      <P>Addressing the appeals, Ho Shun-chin, director-general of the EPA's Solid Waste
Management Bureau, said the EPA had canvassed the opinion of medical
professionals and found they opposed a ban of the material in the medical field
because of the lack of readily available substitute materials.</P>
      <P>As to the use of PVC in water  piping  for construction applications, Ho said
PVC remains the optimal material because of its good ductability and suggested
that a ban on its use in piping also might not be feasible.</P>
      <P>As for food packaging, Ho said the EPA will conduct an overall review and
seriously evaluate the possibility of prohibiting PVC use in food packaging and
the production of food containers.</P>
      <P>At present, Ho said, the EPA collects higher recycling fees from manufacturers
of PVC containers than from those making non-PVC products.</P>

      <P>Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. (TRTC) unveiled a 105.3-meter long vegetal wall at
the metro's Taipei City Hall Station, displaying the first vertical garden to be
erected at a mass transportation station in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>TRTC President Tsay Huei-sheng presided over the ceremony, which was part of a
series of activities organized by the company in the lead-up  to 10th  Asia-
Pacific  Assembly  of the International Association of Public Transport (UITP)
slated for March 10-13 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the meeting's theme, "Helping Cities Breathe, " the TRTC built
the indoor vegetal wall and installed a device that will show how much carbon
dioxide (CO2) it absorbs, the TRTC said.</P>
      <P>According to the company, the 263.25-square meter vertical garden contains 16
different kinds of green plants, including Formosa Spleenwort, Malabar chestnut
and Devil's ivy.</P>
      <P>During the two-month exhibition period, the wall is expected to absorb 35,445
grams of CO2 and release 26,094 grams of oxygen, functioning much the same as a
20-year-old tree, the TRTC said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the wall is equipped with a locally designed automatic water
recycling system that has an efficiency of over 90 percent. The system can also
water the plants based on their needs.</P>
      <P>According to the TRTC, the vegetal wall can serve to adjust the indoor
temperature by effectively functioning as a heat shield in summer and a foil
against the cold in winter. This means that the vertical  garden  has energy
saving  as well as environmental attributes, the company said.</P>
      <P>The UITP,  which has its headquarters in Belgium,  is an international network
for public transport authorities and operators, policy decision-makers,
scientific  institutes  and the public transport supply and service industry.</P>
      <P>The organization covers all modes of public transport, including metro, bus,
light rail, regional and suburban rail and waterborne transport, and acts as a
platform for worldwide co-operation, business development and the sharing of

      <P>Wang Teh-hua, a dermatologist at National Cheng Kung University Hospital, said
bedsore deaths occur mainly when the lesions become infected.</P>

      <P>The 16th round of fisheries talks between Taiwan and Japan will open in Taipei
Thursday after a hiatus of nearly four years, with both sides seeking to resolve
fishing rights issues and disputes, a Taiwan official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Je-yao, deputy director-general of the Fisheries Agency under the Cabinet-
level Council of Agriculture (COA) , said COA officials will fully coordinate
with their Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) peers in the meeting to safeguard
the rights and interests of Taiwanese fishermen.</P>
      <P>"The right of Taiwan fishermen to operate in their traditional fishing grounds
and their security will be our top priority in the talks," he said.</P>
      <P>Disputes  between Taiwan and Japan over fishing rights in overlapping marine
territory have long been a source of contention in the relations between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Tokyo have held 15 rounds of fisheries talks since 1996, with the
last round taking place in July 2005 in Tokyo. But sharp differences remain
between the two countries.</P>
      <P>In June last year, a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat, the Lienho, based in
Taipei County collided with a Japan Coast Guard (JCG) vessel in the disputed
waters near the Tiaoyutai Islands, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japanese.</P>
      <P>The Lienho sank after it collided with the JCG patrol vessel that was allegedly
trying to chase it away from the disputed Tiaoyutai waters. The Taiwanese
skipper and his two crew members were detained by Japanese authorities for
questioning after they and 13 Taiwanese recreational fishermen who were on board
the boat were rescued by the JCG officers.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese skipper accused the Japanese patrol of deliberately ramming his
boat and demanded that Japan compensate him for the damage to his vessel.</P>
      <P>The incident touched a nerve in the sensitive sovereignty issue, as the
Tiaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea are claimed by Taiwan, China, and Japan.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the incident caused an escalation of tensions between
the two countries, Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H. L. Ou suggested
shelving the sovereignty issue and called for joint management and exploration
of the disputed area.</P>

      <P>The year-end elections for city/county chiefs, councilors and township heads
will be held Dec.5 and the polls will be open from 7 a.m. through 5 p.m., a
Central Election Commission (CEC) official announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CEC Secretary-General Teng Tien-yow said the polls will stay open for two hours
longer than usual to give voters enough time to vote in the elections for city
mayors/county  magistrates,  city/county councilors and township chiefs that
day.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1995, Teng said, the polling time for various public elections was 8
a.m. to 5 p.m., but since 1995 the polls have been closing an hour earlier at 4
p.m.</P>
      <P>"For the year-end 'three-in-one' elections, it will be the first time ever in
Taiwan that polling will start as early as 7 a.m.," Teng said.</P>
      <P>According to the current Public Officials Election and Recall Law, Teng said,
the three elections should be completed before Dec.10 in line with the
requirement that the election of public officials should be finalized 10 days
before the incumbents' terms of the office expire.</P>
      <P>"The CEC commissioners unanimously selected Dec.5 so that there will be no big
time gap between the polls and the inauguration of the winning candidates," Teng
said.</P>
      <P>In the past, the elections were traditionally held on either the second or the
fourth Saturday of the month, both of which are known as "big weekends" when
most private businesses are closed for vacation, Teng said.</P>
      <P>As Dec. 5 this year does not coincide with that time, Teng said, the CEC decided
to keep the polls open for an additional two hours to accommodate those who have

      <P>A DNA mimic protein discovered by Taiwan scientists in their research into a
disease in crustaceans a year ago holds the potential for the development of a
cancer treatment, leaders of the research team said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lo Chu-fang, dean of the College of Life Science of National Taiwan University,
and Andrew H.-J. Wang, research fellow and vice president of Academia Sinica,
told reporters that their nine-member team discovered ICP11 -- the most highly
expressed nonstructural gene of the white spot syndrome virus -- when they tried
to find the cause of a disease that was affecting crustaceans worldwide.</P>
      <P>The research results were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences of the United States of America in April 2008.</P>
      <P>Lo and Wang said the research team has found that ICP11, one of a handful of
presently known "mimic proteins," has the ability to destroy cells, leading to
their programmed demise.</P>
      <P>Lo said because of this particular function, the DNA mimic holds great potential
for cancer treatment.</P>
      <P>He said more research is needed to study the effect of ICP11 on cancer cells in
clinical experiments, and if the mimic protein is as good as the researchers
believe it is, the world will have a new approach to cancer treatment.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that engagements between Poland and the
Republic of China are not in violation of the "one China" principle because it
is upheld by both sides of the Taiwan Strait, despite their divergence over its
definition.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a meeting with Stefan Niesiolowski, deputy speaker of
the lower house of the Polish parliament.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Ma conferred the Order of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon
on Niesiolowski in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the promotion
of friendship and cooperation between the two countries over the past years.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties, relations between Taiwan and
Poland have been growing stronger since Taiwan opened a representative office in
Warsaw in 1992 and Poland reciprocated in 1995.</P>
      <P>Although Poland formally recognizes China, its engagement with Taiwan does not
violate Beijing's "one China" principle since Taiwan's Constitution is also
based on the "one China" framework, Ma explained, adding that Taiwan's "one
China" refers to the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Ma further said that since his inauguration last May, his administration has
been promoting pragmatic diplomacy, an approach it has been using to maintain
close ties with its diplomatic allies, while at the same time improving
relations with China.</P>
      <P>"Our pragmatic  efforts have won wide recognition  in the international
community as evidenced by the improvement in our relations with the European
Union, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>Britain's recent decision to grant Taiwanese tourists visa-free treatment for
stays of up to six months is a good example of the progress achieved, he added.</P>
      <P>If more EU countries follow suit, Ma said, civilian exchanges between Taiwan and
EU member states will definitely increase in the future.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan-Poland ties, Ma said he looks forward to continued expansion of
bilateral exchanges in the fields of tourism, trade, culture and education.</P>
      <P>For his part, Niesiolowski said Taiwan and Poland have had similar experiences
in the development of democracy. Saying that he admires Taiwan's success in
democratization and economic development, the Polish lawmaker added that he
believes that with perseverance and ingenuity, Taiwan will be able to ride out
the current economic storm.</P>

lead a group of local farmers to Japan next month to promote the county's farm
produce and hopefully chalk up more than NT$100 million (US$2.97 million) in
business deals.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference held at the county headquarters, where some of the
county's farm products were also displayed, Lee said he hopes the trip will pave
the way for locally produced goods to break into Northeast Asian markets, apart
from the Chinese and Southeast Asian markets.</P>
      <P>Lu Cheng-chang, director of the county's agricultural affairs, said a Yunlin
delegation will depart for Japan on March 3 and will take part in the 34th Food

through March 6.</P>
      <P>The delegation will exhibit farm and fishery produce cultivated in the county to
the Japanese public.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to push local farm produce to go international, Yunlin
County has been actively organizing promotion tours to various countries since

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan expressed confidence Wednesday that the measures
introduced by the government to combat unemployment will produce better results
in the coming two or three months.</P>
      <P>Liu pledged that the government will work to control this year's unemployment
situation "within acceptable limits."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate soared to 5.03 percent in December 2008, hitting the
highest level since October 2003 and marking the first time in five years that
the monthly jobless rate topped 5 percent. The average unemployment rate for
2008 was 4.14 percent, which represented a four-year high.</P>
      <P>The premier addressed the issue during a meeting with personnel officials, in
which he urged government employees to do their jobs to the best of their
ability so as to put themselves over the top.</P>
      <P>Liu said the government may be a bit optimistic by forecasting that Taiwan's
gross domestic product will shrink only by 2.97 percent this year, but he
stressed the forecast is not based on "blind optimism."</P>
      <P>Liu said he is confident in the government's ability to get things done,
pointing to the growth in government investment in the fourth quarter of last
year and the fact that as many as 53 percent of the government's stimulus
package to boost domestic demand have been implemented over the past five
months.</P>
      <P>He argued that the recent decrease in bank lending does not mean a failure of
the government's policy to encourage banks to provide financing boldly to
healthy businesses, but reflects a fall in demand.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, Taiwan's export volume has decreased by NT$200 billion due
to a contraction in global market demand.</P>
      <P>At present, the government's most urgent tasks are to look for new export
markets and stimulate investment and exports, Liu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government began to purchase surplus ponkan tangerines from farmers in
Taichung County's Dongshih township Wednesday and turn them into compost in an
attempt to stabilize the market for the fruit.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Agriculture  and Food Agency under the Cabinet-level Council
of Agriculture said they will buy 500 metric tons of second-grade ponkan
tangerines at NT$6 per kilogram before March 6 and send the fruit to another
Taichung County township, Wufeng, to have it processed into green fertilizer.</P>
      <P>Dongshih township head Yeh Yu-chin said it pained him to see the fruits of the
farmers' year of labor being carried away by the truckload, knowing they will be
scrapped.</P>
      <P>An elderly woman among the onlookers kept sighing and calling it "such a waste."
She said there was nothing wrong with the tangerines, which were sweet and
succulent, except that they were only a bit smaller than top grade fruit.</P>
      <P>According to Taichung County agriculture officials, the county still has 2,400
metric tons of tangerines stored in refrigerated warehouses. They attributed the
glut to overproduction, the early arrival of the Lunar New Year holiday, and the
ongoing economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Dongshih ponkan tangerines are one of the most famous fruits in Taiwan. They are
sweet, fragrant and succulent and full of vitamins A and C.</P>
      <P>The fruit is harvested from late September to late December and can be stored
for several months. Farmers usually sell a portion of their harvest on the
market while keeping the rest wrapped in individual plastic bags and stored in
refrigerated warehouses until January or March of the following year to fetch
better prices.</P>
      <P>Local  agriculture  officials,  who fear that  the central government's bulk
purchase is not enough to relieve the farmers' plight, have launched a campaign
to call on the public to consume more tangerines to ease the glut and help the
farmers.</P>

(EPA) pledged Wednesday to review the use of polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration in manufacturing and packaging
applications because of environmental concerns.</P>
      <P>The agency was responding to calls by environmental groups to ban the widely
used plastic in food packaging and medical accessories because of its
detrimental effect on the environment throughout its life cycle, from production
to disposal.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Ho-lin, secretary-general of the Taiwan Watch Institute, a private group
dedicated to protecting Taiwan's natural environment, said the plasticizing and
stabilizing agents in PVC -- such as DEHP, DOP, cadmium and lead -- may harm
people's kidneys or reproductive systems or lower their intelligence.</P>
      <P>Those toxic substances can be released from PVC articles not just at high
temperatures but also at normal room temperatures, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He therefore urged the government to immediately ban the use of PVC in food
packaging, phase out PVC water pipes and bar the recycling of PVC waste in
incinerators to reduce the accumulation of dioxin in the environment.</P>
      <P>Other environmental groups also urged the government to ban the use of the
widely used plastic in medical accessories, such as blood bags and gloves.</P>
      <P>Addressing the appeals, Ho Shun-chin, director-general of the EPA's Solid Waste
Management Bureau, said the EPA had canvassed the opinion of medical
professionals and found they opposed a ban of the material in the medical field
because of the lack of readily available substitute materials.</P>
      <P>As to the use of PVC in water  piping  for construction applications, Ho said
PVC remains the optimal material because of its good ductability and suggested
that a ban on its use in piping also might not be feasible.</P>
      <P>As for food packaging, Ho said the EPA will conduct an overall review and
seriously evaluate the possibility of prohibiting PVC use in food packaging and
the production of food containers.</P>
      <P>At present, Ho said, the EPA collects higher recycling fees from manufacturers
of PVC containers than from those making non-PVC products.</P>

      <P>Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. (TRTC) unveiled a 105.3-meter long vegetal wall at
the metro's Taipei City Hall Station, displaying the first vertical garden to be
erected at a mass transportation station in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>TRTC President Tsay Huei-sheng presided over the ceremony, which was part of a
series of activities organized by the company in the lead-up  to 10th  Asia-
Pacific  Assembly  of the International Association of Public Transport (UITP)
slated for March 10-13 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the meeting's theme, "Helping Cities Breathe, " the TRTC built
the indoor vegetal wall and installed a device that will show how much carbon
dioxide (CO2) it absorbs, the TRTC said.</P>
      <P>According to the company, the 263.25-square meter vertical garden contains 16
different kinds of green plants, including Formosa Spleenwort, Malabar chestnut
and Devil's ivy.</P>
      <P>During the two-month exhibition period, the wall is expected to absorb 35,445
grams of CO2 and release 26,094 grams of oxygen, functioning much the same as a
20-year-old tree, the TRTC said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the wall is equipped with a locally designed automatic water
recycling system that has an efficiency of over 90 percent. The system can also
water the plants based on their needs.</P>
      <P>According to the TRTC, the vegetal wall can serve to adjust the indoor
temperature by effectively functioning as a heat shield in summer and a foil
against the cold in winter. This means that the vertical  garden  has energy
saving  as well as environmental attributes, the company said.</P>
      <P>The UITP,  which has its headquarters in Belgium,  is an international network
for public transport authorities and operators, policy decision-makers,
scientific  institutes  and the public transport supply and service industry.</P>
      <P>The organization covers all modes of public transport, including metro, bus,
light rail, regional and suburban rail and waterborne transport, and acts as a
platform for worldwide co-operation, business development and the sharing of

      <P>Wang Teh-hua, a dermatologist at National Cheng Kung University Hospital, said
bedsore deaths occur mainly when the lesions become infected.</P>
      <P>Wang said that bedridden patients are 33 percent more likely to develop bedsores

complications are four times higher than other inpatients.</P>
      <P>He said that patients with chronic skin lesions should seek help from a skin

because of financial problems or busy work schedules.</P>
      <P>Consequently, some of the patients, including 10 percent to 30 percent of

      <P>The 16th round of fisheries talks between Taiwan and Japan will open in Taipei
Thursday after a hiatus of nearly four years, with both sides seeking to resolve
fishing rights issues and disputes, a Taiwan official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Je-yao, deputy director-general of the Fisheries Agency under the Cabinet-
level Council of Agriculture (COA) , said COA officials will fully coordinate
with their Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) peers in the meeting to safeguard
the rights and interests of Taiwanese fishermen.</P>
      <P>"The right of Taiwan fishermen to operate in their traditional fishing grounds
and their security will be our top priority in the talks," he said.</P>
      <P>Disputes  between Taiwan and Japan over fishing rights in overlapping marine
territory have long been a source of contention in the relations between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Tokyo have held 15 rounds of fisheries talks since 1996, with the
last round taking place in July 2005 in Tokyo. But sharp differences remain
between the two countries.</P>
      <P>In June last year, a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat, the Lienho, based in
Taipei County collided with a Japan Coast Guard (JCG) vessel in the disputed
waters near the Tiaoyutai Islands, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japanese.</P>
      <P>The Lienho sank after it collided with the JCG patrol vessel that was allegedly
trying to chase it away from the disputed Tiaoyutai waters. The Taiwanese
skipper and his two crew members were detained by Japanese authorities for
questioning after they and 13 Taiwanese recreational fishermen who were on board
the boat were rescued by the JCG officers.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese skipper accused the Japanese patrol of deliberately ramming his
boat and demanded that Japan compensate him for the damage to his vessel.</P>
      <P>The incident touched a nerve in the sensitive sovereignty issue, as the
Tiaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea are claimed by Taiwan, China, and Japan.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the incident caused an escalation of tensions between
the two countries, Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H. L. Ou suggested
shelving the sovereignty issue and called for joint management and exploration
of the disputed area.</P>

      <P>The year-end elections for city/county chiefs, councilors and township heads
will be held Dec.5 and the polls will be open from 7 a.m. through 5 p.m., a
Central Election Commission (CEC) official announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CEC Secretary-General Teng Tien-yow said the polls will stay open for two hours
longer than usual to give voters enough time to vote in the elections for city
mayors/county  magistrates,  city/county councilors and township chiefs that
day.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1995, Teng said, the polling time for various public elections was 8
a.m. to 5 p.m., but since 1995 the polls have been closing an hour earlier at 4
p.m.</P>
      <P>"For the year-end 'three-in-one' elections, it will be the first time ever in
Taiwan that polling will start as early as 7 a.m.," Teng said.</P>
      <P>According to the current Public Officials Election and Recall Law, Teng said,
the three elections should be completed before Dec.10 in line with the
requirement that the election of public officials should be finalized 10 days
before the incumbents' terms of the office expire.</P>
      <P>"The CEC commissioners unanimously selected Dec.5 so that there will be no big
time gap between the polls and the inauguration of the winning candidates," Teng
said.</P>
      <P>In the past, the elections were traditionally held on either the second or the
fourth Saturday of the month, both of which are known as "big weekends" when
most private businesses are closed for vacation, Teng said.</P>
      <P>As Dec. 5 this year does not coincide with that time, Teng said, the CEC decided
to keep the polls open for an additional two hours to accommodate those who have
to work and cannot adjust their schedules.</P>
      <P>Since the longer polling day might add to the workload of local election
workers, the CEC will step up communications with city and county election

      <P>A DNA mimic protein discovered by Taiwan scientists in their research into a
disease in crustaceans a year ago holds the potential for the development of a
cancer treatment, leaders of the research team said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lo Chu-fang, dean of the College of Life Science of National Taiwan University,
and Andrew H.-J. Wang, research fellow and vice president of Academia Sinica,
told reporters that their nine-member team discovered ICP11 -- the most highly
expressed nonstructural gene of the white spot syndrome virus -- when they tried
to find the cause of a disease that was affecting crustaceans worldwide.</P>
      <P>The research results were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences of the United States of America in April 2008.</P>
      <P>Lo and Wang said the research team has found that ICP11, one of a handful of
presently known "mimic proteins," has the ability to destroy cells, leading to
their programmed demise.</P>
      <P>Lo said because of this particular function, the DNA mimic holds great potential
for cancer treatment.</P>
      <P>He said more research is needed to study the effect of ICP11 on cancer cells in
clinical experiments, and if the mimic protein is as good as the researchers
believe it is, the world will have a new approach to cancer treatment.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that engagements between Poland and the
Republic of China are not in violation of the "one China" principle because it
is upheld by both sides of the Taiwan Strait, despite their divergence over its
definition.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a meeting with Stefan Niesiolowski, deputy speaker of
the lower house of the Polish parliament.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Ma conferred the Order of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon
on Niesiolowski in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the promotion
of friendship and cooperation between the two countries over the past years.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties, relations between Taiwan and
Poland have been growing stronger since Taiwan opened a representative office in
Warsaw in 1992 and Poland reciprocated in 1995.</P>
      <P>Although Poland formally recognizes China, its engagement with Taiwan does not
violate Beijing's "one China" principle since Taiwan's Constitution is also
based on the "one China" framework, Ma explained, adding that Taiwan's "one
China" refers to the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Ma further said that since his inauguration last May, his administration has
been promoting pragmatic diplomacy, an approach it has been using to maintain
close ties with its diplomatic allies, while at the same time improving
relations with China.</P>
      <P>"Our pragmatic  efforts have won wide recognition  in the international
community as evidenced by the improvement in our relations with the European
Union, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>Britain's recent decision to grant Taiwanese tourists visa-free treatment for
stays of up to six months is a good example of the progress achieved, he added.</P>
      <P>If more EU countries follow suit, Ma said, civilian exchanges between Taiwan and
EU member states will definitely increase in the future.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan-Poland ties, Ma said he looks forward to continued expansion of
bilateral exchanges in the fields of tourism, trade, culture and education.</P>
      <P>For his part, Niesiolowski said Taiwan and Poland have had similar experiences
in the development of democracy. Saying that he admires Taiwan's success in
democratization and economic development, the Polish lawmaker added that he
believes that with perseverance and ingenuity, Taiwan will be able to ride out
the current economic storm.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Elections for local chiefs, councilors slated for Dec.5</HEADLINE>

      <P>The year-end elections for city/county chiefs, councilors and township heads
will be held Dec.5 and the polls will be open from 7 a.m. through 5 p.m., a
Central Election Commission (CEC) official announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CEC Secretary-General Teng Tien-yow said the polls will stay open for two hours
longer than usual to give voters enough time to vote in the elections for city
mayors/county  magistrates,  city/county councilors and township chiefs that
day.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1995, Teng said, the polling time for various public elections was 8
a.m. to 5 p.m., but since 1995 the polls have been closing an hour earlier at 4
p.m.</P>
      <P>"For the year-end 'three-in-one' elections, it will be the first time ever in
Taiwan that polling will start as early as 7 a.m.," Teng said.</P>
      <P>According to the current Public Officials Election and Recall Law, Teng said,
the three elections should be completed before Dec.10 in line with the
requirement that the election of public officials should be finalized 10 days
before the incumbents' terms of the office expire.</P>
      <P>"The CEC commissioners unanimously selected Dec.5 so that there will be no big
time gap between the polls and the inauguration of the winning candidates," Teng
said.</P>
      <P>In the past, the elections were traditionally held on either the second or the
fourth Saturday of the month, both of which are known as "big weekends" when
most private businesses are closed for vacation, Teng said.</P>
      <P>As Dec. 5 this year does not coincide with that time, Teng said, the CEC decided
to keep the polls open for an additional two hours to accommodate those who have
to work and cannot adjust their schedules.</P>
      <P>Since the longer polling day might add to the workload of local election
workers, the CEC will step up communications with city and county election
commissions to seek their support for the plan, Tseng said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Centuries-old village wins battle to preserve historic houses</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/26/09  12:45:19</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It was a small victory hardly mentioned by Taiwan's mainstream media,  but in
the opinion of residents of Taiwan's outlying archipelago Penghu, a giant step
toward saving an important piece of history.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 23 last year, the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA)
agreed to list a cluster of old coral-built houses in Chungshe village, Penghu's
Wanan islet as an "important settlement, " after several decades of efforts by
local residents to obtain government protection of the centuries old homes.</P>
      <P>The quiet Chungshe village, which locals call by its ancient name Hua Zai, or
"Flower Village, " is believed to have existed as a settlement since Han Chinese
from mainland China began settling there three centuries ago.</P>
      <P>The new designation  for Hua Zai may finally bring about much-needed government
support for the challenging work of preserving the houses in the village, which
is considered the largest and most well-preserved early Han settlement in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Chungshe residents have waited for more than 20 years for this moment, " said
Tzeng Ching-hsin, secretary-general of the Taiwan Hua Zai Settlement
Preservation Association -- a civic group founded by local residents and
homeowners in 2005.</P>
      <P>The central government's move comes as Taiwan is desperately trying to attract
more tourists to boost its lagging economy and as local governments are
increasingly recognizing that what tourists want to see are not tall new
buildings, but traditional houses that teach them something about the local
culture and history.</P>
      <P>Over the past two decades, residents have made repeated requests to government
offices seeking government restrictions  against destroying the homes and
funding to preserve them - but to no avail.</P>
      <P>While waiting for government protection over the years, Hua Zai has paid the
price, Tzeng said, as more than half of the village's approximately 150 old
houses were either damaged inadvertently or intentionally destroyed by some
residents who prefer to build new homes with modern conveniences. Although some
50 structures still remain intact, the landscape has partly been marred by the
new buildings.</P>
      <P>Harsh weather has also taken a toll on the houses. In the summer of 2008 alone,
three powerful typhoons badly damaged the village, as many of the dwellings'
holed roofs provided little protection against rainfall.</P>
      <P>Yet the settlement is fertile ground for renovation because most of the houses,
which date back 75 to 150 years, have not been modified and reflect designs
handed down from early Han settlers.</P>
      <P>In a 2006 survey of the village, the Tainan-based nonprofit Foundation of
Historic City Conservation and Regeneration Foundation (FHCCR) found that of the
village's 158 buildings, 73 percent had not been changed in any way.</P>
      <P>Ironically, the village's remote location and exodus of people looking for work
in more populated areas have been critical to preserving its unique identity.</P>
      <P>"A serious population outflow is the reason why Chungshe has been able to keep
its original appearance, " said Yen Hsin-hsiung, chairman of the Taiwan Hua Zai
Settlement Preservation Association.</P>
      <P>Even today, some of the remaining 100 villagers -- mostly senior citizens and
children -- live the same way their ancestors did, fishing, collecting seaweed
and growing their own food.</P>
      <P>"They take what nature offers, " said the FHCCR's Chang. "It is the old wisdom
of living in harmony with nature that is valuable, and deserves to be preserved,
protected and passed on. "</P>
      <P>Despite the settlement's long history,  the houses' unique architectural
features  and historical  significance  were not appreciated until Lin Huei-
cheng, now a professor in Taipei National University of the Arts' Graduate
School of Architecture and Historic Preservation, stumbled upon them in the late
1970s.</P>
      <P>"I was amazed by their architectural structure and their abundant cultural
significance when I first caught sight of the settlement 30 years ago, " Lin
said, adding that he immediately began what was to become a lifetime study of
the houses.</P>
      <P>Lin measured every house, recorded details of their decoration and analyzed the
skillful way the coral stones were stacked and held together by a lime and mud
mortar.</P>
      <P>Coral was the main building material used in the old days because of the lack of
trees or other natural resources on the islet and residents inability to afford
imported wood. Even then, villagers only had access to coral that washed up on
beaches after storms.</P>
      <P>The houses typically consist of a main building with two wings adorned with
elegant bell-shaped roofs. The main building, called the "toa chuh sin" --
meaning "big house" in Taiwan's mainstream ethnic dialect Hoklo -- is the most
important part of the U-shaped enclosure.</P>
      <P>Skillful architectural techniques ensured that the houses were built to
withstand the notoriously strong howling winds in Penghu. Small windows blocked
by cement bars and attachable wood panels kept the wind out. The structures were
also environmentally friendly -- warm in the winter and cool in the summer.</P>
      <P>Preservationists tried for years to get formal recognition for these
architectural  marvels  before succeeding  in having the settlement put on the
2004 World Monuments Watch List of the 100 most-endangered sites by the New
York-based World Monuments Funds (WMF) , a private nonprofit organization
dedicated to saving the world's most treasured places.</P>
      <P>Being  listed  by the WMF reinforced  Hua Zai  residents' determination to
preserve the old houses and also prompted the central government's recognition
of the place as an "important settlement."</P>
      <P>Yet even the newly-won designation may be an empty victory.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's Cultural Heritage Preservation Law, the relevant authorities are
only obliged to subsidize 60 percent of the cost of preserving and restoring the
old houses, with the rest to be footed by local residents.</P>
      <P>In other words, the residents still must take the initiative to maintain the
settlement, and if through negligence it loses its unique character, it might be
stripped of the designation, a Penghu County official said.</P>
      <P>"Our biggest hope now is for the government to set regulations on how to
preserve and restore the old houses and prevent tourists from disturbing the
lives of the people who still live there," Tzeng said.</P>
      <P>He also urged the government to amend rules that would help bypass the tangled
ownership histories of the houses that have made getting approval for renovation
projects cumbersome. Time, he said, is of the essence.</P>
      <P>"We hope the Council for Cultural Affairs will act quickly, " Tzeng said,
expressing concern that by the time the government finally begins to take
action, there might be nothing left to protect.</P>

      <P>The U.S. government commended Taiwan's efforts in upholding freedom of speech
and of the press in its annual human rights reports released Wednesday, despite
criticism that civil liberties were being suppressed under the administration of
President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>According to the 2008 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices published by the
U.S. State Department, the press in Taiwan remained vigorous and active last
year.</P>
      <P>Shortly after taking office in May 2008, President Ma announced that the
authorities should not attempt to influence the political process through the
media, that the budget for official advertising should be evenly distributed
among media outlets and the two major political parties, and that the military
should not get involved in media operations, the reports said.</P>
      <P>In July, Taiwan extended the maximum stay of Chinese journalists from 30 days to
three months and decided to allow up to five Chinese regional news outlets to
station journalists in Taiwan, in addition to the five Chinese national outlets
already allowed, the reports pointed out.</P>
      <P>However,  the Hong Kong-based  Phoenix Satellite Television expressed
frustration over the denial of its request to broadcast in Taiwan, and both the
International Federation of Journalists and Reporters Without Borders were
concerned about alleged government interference in the Taiwan media, the reports
said.</P>
      <P>Also,  the reports stated,  opposition  groups and student demonstrators
complained that police violated their right to free expression during protests
against the visit of Chen Yunlin, who as president of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits acts as China's chief
negotiator with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Other problems mentioned in the report on Taiwan were corruption by officials,
violence and discrimination against women, trafficking in persons, and abuses of
foreign workers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CECA will be free lunch for big businesses paid for by workers: TSU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
02/26/09  14:01:00
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Chairman Huang Kun-hui said Thursday that signing
a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) with China would be like
giving a "free lunch" to big businesses, while the majority of laborers would
have to pay the price.</P>
      <P>"There is no such a thing as free lunch, " Huang said. "(President) Ma Ying-jeou
should explain and clarify exactly what a CECA is and how it will affect
Taiwan's industries and laborers."</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks at a press conference at which he raised 11 questions
related to the CECA that he would like Ma to answer in his scheduled television
interview Friday.</P>
      <P>The possibility of signing a CECA with Beijing has been widely debated over the
past few months, and has spurred fierce criticisms from the opposition parties,
which fear that it will involve delicate political issues that will give rise to
serious social conflicts in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang said that instead of scaring the public with the argument that the
economic situation for Taiwan will be dire if it fails to ink a CECA with
Beijing, Ma should once and for all clarify the concept, content, and
consequences of signing such an agreement.</P>
      <P>The TSU head argued that the content of the agreement should be discussed with
the Legislative  Yuan before being put on the negotiation table with China and
should be subject to legislative review and a referendum before a deal is signed
with Beijing.</P>
      <P>"In light of China's ultimate goal to annex Taiwan -- not so much a conspiracy
or anything -- a referendum is necessary, since this is a matter of the long-
term survival and development of the entire Taiwanese society," Huang said.</P>
      <P>One question Huang would like Ma to answer is that what type of industries would
benefit from a CECA with China, and to what extent. The TSU head would also like
to know how much the government would have to spend to help those enterprises
that would suffer as a result of the agreement.</P>
      <P>A CECA should be signed only if China promises to resolve the numerous cases
involving problems experienced by Taiwanese businesses that have investments in
China, he argued.</P>
      <P>Moreover, noting that the Ma administration keeps comparing the proposed CECA to
the economic integration of the European Union and has said that it has nothing
to do with political issues and sovereignty, Huang suggested that Ma follow the
example of the EU and hold a referendum on the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC pushing for passage of refugee law</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) is pushing for the Legislative Yuan to pass a
refugee law in the hope that asylum seekers from China, Hong Kong, Macau and
Tibet will be able to stay legally in Taiwan, a MAC spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Although the regulations on refugee matters fall under the the Ministry of the
Interior, the MAC is very concerned about the law, because over the past few
years, most alien citizens seeking asylum and assistance in Taiwan have been
from China, according to MAC spokesman Liu Teh-hsun.</P>
      <P>If the law clears the legislative floor, it would provide a legal basis for the
government to handle affairs related to refugees and give local people a clear
concept of refugee issues, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Currently, most refugees seeking asylum in Taiwan are from Tibet or are
descendants of the remnants of a Kuomintang force that was stranded in northern
Thailand while trying to follow the KMT government to Taiwan at the end of the
Chinese civil war in 1949.</P>
      <P>Apart from these refugees, two Chinese pro-democracy activists, Cai Lujun and Wu
Yalin, have also sought sanctuary in Taiwan, Liu added.</P>
      <P>Cai, sneaked into Taiwan last year and was held for six months at the Hsinchu
detention center for illegal Chinese immigrants, while Wu sought political
asylum after he arrived in Taiwan last year as a tourist, Liu said. Both of them
have now obtained temporary resident status in Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>The two men came under the media spotlight last September when they scaled the
wall of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) compound to ask for political
asylum in the United States.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan does not have a political refugee or asylum law, the government has
not been able to grant political asylum to the two Chinese political activists,
but they have been allowed to remain in Taiwan temporarily based on humanitarian
considerations, Liu said.</P>
      <P>The MAC is providing a monthly stipend of between NT$10,000 and NT$20,000 to
help with their living expenses because they are not allowed to work in Taiwan,
Liu said, adding that this will continue to be a financial burden on the agency
as it is an additional expenditure.</P>
      <P>The MAC hopes that the law will soon be passed to allow political asylum seekers
to gain resident status and work in Taiwan once they are certified as refugees,
he said.</P>

      <P>Over 40 percent of the Taiwanese companies that maintain business operations in
China will consider returning part of their investments to Taiwan in two years'
time, the intermediary Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Twenty-two Taiwanese companies operating in China said in a recent survey
conducted by the SEF that two years down the road they probably would channel
funds back to Taiwan for new investment projects.</P>
      <P>The figure represented 41.51 percent of the total number of China-based
Taiwanese companies that responded to the SEF survey conducted in January.</P>
      <P>Nine other Taiwanese  companies,  or 16.98 percent of the respondents, said they
plan to channel funds back to Taiwan within one or two years to start new
investments.</P>
      <P>"This indicates that Taiwanese businesses have started to rethink their
investment strategies since the changes in China's investment climate and
regulations, " said Lin Chen-yen, director of Chung Yuan Christian University's
Office of Research and Development.</P>
      <P>SEF officials conducted the survey when they visited Taiwanese companies based
in Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces in January. Among the respondents, 34 percent
were manufacturers of electronics or electrical parts, while the others were
manufacturers of plastic products and companies in the financial and service
sectors.</P>
      <P>On China's gross domestic product (GDP), most of the respondents speculated that
it would grow this year by 4-6 percent or 6-8 percent, while a few said it would
reach 8 percent or higher.</P>
      <P>"This indicates that the Taiwanese businessmen do not have much faith in the
Chinese authorities' forecast that the country's economic growth will top 8
percent for 2009," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The poll found that most of the respondents were apathetic about China's efforts
to bolster economic growth by expanding domestic demand, as they believe that
they would have little chance to capitalize on the plan, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Most of the Taiwanese  companies said they would consider upgrading their
products and manufacturing process as well as hiring more managerial-level
professionals in order to survive in China's harsher investment environment, Lin

seek business prospects in the African country's big domestic market of 15
million people, said Liu Bang-zyh, deputy director-general of the ministry's
Department of African Affairs.</P>
      <P>While the global economic downturn is affecting investment sentiments worldwide,
Africa has enjoyed an annual economic growth rate of 6 percent to 8 percent in
the past few years, which could make it a good alternative investment
destination for Taiwanese businesses, Liu told a press briefing.</P>
      <P>The volume of bilateral trade between Taiwan and Africa is still relatively low,
Liu said, with the amount totaling around US$10.4 billion from January to
November last year.</P>
      <P>The figure is less than 10 percent of the trade volume between China and Africa
over the same period, Liu added.</P>
      <P>Burkina Faso is Taiwans 125th largest trading partner, with the bilateral trade
volume in 2007 totaling $16.7 million, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu said the MOFA will also continue to work toward boosting economic
and trade relations with Taiwans other diplomatic allies in Africa -- Swaziland,
Sao Tome and Principe and The Gambia, which, he said, would in turn help expand
Taiwan's overall economic ties with the African continent.</P>
      <P>With the opening of the office in Burkina Faso, TAITRA currently has seven
offices in Africa, with the others being in Algeria, Morocco, Nigeria, Egypt,
South Africa, and Kenya.</P>

    <HEADLINE>European trade offices issue practical guide on Taiwan market</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
02/26/09  19:40:50
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Economic and Trade Office (EETO) and the French Institute in Taipei
announced Thursday that they will issue a business brochure to raise awareness
in Europe about Taiwan's market potential and to better facilitate bilateral
economic and trade relations between Taiwan and the European Union.</P>
      <P>EETO head Guy Ledoux told the Central News Agency in an exclusive interview
that while there are already quite a few European international  companies doing
businesses  in Taiwan,  the new initiative targets small and medium sized
companies (SMEs) in Europe and is intended to spur their interest in Taiwanese
market.</P>
      <P>The business guide, titled "A Practical Guide to the Taiwanese Market -- How to
export or invest in Taiwan, " is a collaborative effort by the EETO, the French
Institute in Taipei and other European trade offices in Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>Starting Friday, 6,000 copies of the brochure will be given to the European
trade councilors and representatives based in Taiwan for distribution to the
SMEs at various events held by European business communities and regional
chambers of commerce, Ledoux said.</P>
      <P>"If it's properly distributed and if it's accompanied by direct stimuli by
European trade councilors and representatives, it will have a big impact," said
the de facto European Union ambassador to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Emmanuel Ly-Batallan, head of the economic and commercial section of the French
Institute in Taipei, told the CNA that the brochure is very concise and contains
all the basic information that European businesses would need to understand the
Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>With a population of merely 23 million, Taiwan is the world's 15th largest
importer, with imports totalling 150 billion euros (US$192 billion) in 2007,
ahead of India's 149 billion euros, Ly-Batallan noted, saying that this is a
good indicator of Taiwan's market potential. Added to that is the fact the
consumption level in Taiwan is high, with the purchasing power parity per capita
being US$30,000, he said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the quality of infrastructure and the regulatory environment  make
Taiwan an attractive  market,  according  to Ly-Batallan.</P>
      <P>"If you look at international markets in general, the quality of the legal
environment in Taiwan is very strong," Ly-Batallan said, adding that a highly
skilled workforce is another asset.</P>
      <P>Describing Taiwan as a market "underestimated  by European companies, " the
brochure states that since taking office May 20, 2008, President Ma Ying-jeou
has adopted numerous economic and financial measures to improve relations with
China, which present new opportunities for not only Taiwanese but also foreign
businesses.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Taiwan can serve as the launch pad for businesses to begin their
"Chinese success story" because operating from Taiwan enables European companies
to benefit from Taiwans privileged links to China while taking advantage of
Taiwan's developed legal and business environment, it adds.</P>
      <P>Another incentive for European business is the fact that citizens of 24 of the
27 EU member states are allowed visa-free entry to Taiwan with maximum stay of
up to 30 days, an incentive that Ledoux and Ly-Batallan said is beneficial to
bilateral economic relations.</P>
      <P>Detailed information regarding the practical guide will be posted on the EETO
Web site at www.deltwn.ec.europa.eu and on the Web site of the European
Commissions Directorate-General for Trade by next week, according to Ledoux.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The real earnings of Taiwanese workers shrank by 3.37 percent in 2008, marking
the worst contraction since 1980, mainly due to a high inflation and an economic
slump, according to statistics released Thursday by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>During the same period, real regular earnings -- which include only base salary
plus fixed subsidies or bonuses -- decreased by 3.13 percent, also the worst
performance since 1980.</P>
      <P>The statistics showed that in 2008, the average monthly earnings per employee in
the industrial and service sectors increased by just 0.03 percent from the
previous year to NT$45,125 (US$1,300), and the average regular earnings per
employee rose by 0.28 percent to NT$36,867.</P>
      <P>However, a 3.52 percent rise in the consumer price index during the year more
than offset any nominal gains in earnings.</P>
      <P>According to Huang Chien-chung, deputy chief of the DGBAS's Fourth Department in
charge of census and sampling surveys, although inflation moderated in October,
there was a sharp decrease in regular earnings in November and December, owing
to a drop in work hours as a result of many workers being forced to take unpaid
leave amid sluggish business.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's jobless rate reaches record high in January</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate soared to 5.31 percent in January, marking a record
high for January since the first official unemployment survey was launched in
1978, according to a report released Thursday by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>Last month, the actual number of people out of work in Taiwan topped 578,000,
also marking a record high in 31 years, DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>The 5.31 percent jobless rate was the fourth highest in history for all months,
trailing only the 5.35 percent posted in August 2001, 5.33 percent in October
2001 and 5.32 percent in September 2002, said Huang Chien-chung, a deputy chief
of the DGBAS's Fourth Department in charge of census and sampling surveys.</P>
      <P>Of the 578,000 jobless workers in January, 291,000 lost their jobs because of
business closure or downsizing, up 41,000 from December 2008, and marking the
highest monthly level since 1978, he added.</P>
      <P>Huang said the January jobless increase rate, a month-on-month increase of 0.28
percentage points, was relatively mild compared to that posted in December 2008,
which soared by 0.39 percentage points as compared with the November level.</P>
      <P>He attributed the relatively "milder" increase to the growth in demand for
temporary workers in January during the Chinese New Year holiday  and the
historic  distribution  of shopping  vouchers nationwide.</P>
      <P>The number of employed workers in Taiwan totaled 10.30 million in January,
marking a month-on-month decline of 51,000 from December 2008 and a year-on-year
fall of 88,000 from January 2008, hitting the greatest monthly decline since
1991, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"It indicates that the growth dynamic of the country's overall workforce has
lost steam, mainly as a result of the current economic recession, which has
triggered a wave of layoffs across the country," said Huang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung said later in the day that the
government is planning to create some 341,000 jobs this year, which will
hopefully contribute to controlling the country's unemployment rate to under 4.5
percent for the year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Shanghai museum head arrives in Taiwan for visit</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A four-member delegation from the Shanghai Museum arrived in Taiwan Thursday for
a return visit to the country's National Palace Museum (NPM), bringing what an
NPM official described assurprisesto a museums planned exhibition.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference, Shanghai Museum Director Chen Xiejun, who heads
the delegation, announced that his museum would lend one set, or two items, of
its colored enamel porcelains from the period of the Qing Dynasty's Emperor
Yongzheng to be displayed at the NPMs exhibition on the emperor to be held in
October.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that since the two museums did not formally discuss the
feasibilities of lending the NPMs artifacts to be exhibited at the Shanghai
World Expo 2010 when NPM Director Chou Kung-shin visited his city last week,
they will not touch on the issue either as his current visit to Taipei is a
purely reciprocal one.</P>
      <P>Chou said Thursday that during Chen's visit, the two museums will work on
details on the implementation of the nine-point consensus reached on her recent
visit to China. The consensus involved building closer cooperation and exchanges
in areas such as academics, archive and art conservation,  as well as
publication  and exhibition arrangements.</P>
      <P>She added that the set of porcelains mentioned by Chen are unique because their
colored drawings are uncommonly influenced by the western painting style.</P>
      <P>The NPM plans to showcase 138 sets, or around 180 items of Yongzheng-related
artifacts in its October exhibition, said Chou, with around 27 sets borrowed
from the Beijing-based Palace Museum and one set from the Shanghai Museum.</P>
      <P>Chou described her recent visit to China assuccessfulbecause it has drawn
intensive publicity in Chinas media even continuing until now, which has made
the NPM a household name in China and would motivate more mainland Chinese to
visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While the Shanghai delegation will leave Taiwan on March 1, another Chinese
delegation headed by the director of Beijing's Palace Museum is slated to arrive
in Taiwan on the same day for a reciprocal four-day visit.</P>
      <P>Chou visited the Palace Museum in Beijing and the Shanghai Museum during her
"ice-breaking" trip to China in earlier this month.</P>
      <P>The National Palace Museum in Taiwan holds more than 600,000 pieces of
treasures, from paintings to jades, representing the best collection of Chinese
cultural artifacts in the world. The items were taken from the Beijing Palace
Museum to avoid the collection falling in the hands of the Japanese invading
army during World War II. They were later shipped to Taiwan when the
Nationalists in China lost a civil war to the Communists in 1949.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung city government is working to have 2,000 bus stop signs in the
city replaced with bilingual ones and more LED display devices installed along
the Kaohisung metro system, as part of its preparations for the 2009 World
Games, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the inauguration of 81 full-color LED intelligent information
display panels at all the stations on the Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit (MRT)
system's Red Line, Wang Kwo-tsai, director of the city's Transportation Bureau
said that the devices are aimed at providing passengers with real time travel
information.</P>
      <P>Another 35 of this type of LED display panels will also be installed at stations
along the Kaohsiung MRT's Orange Line before the World Games opens in July,
according to Wang.</P>
      <P>Wang added that the panels featuring Chinese and English bilingual markings were
designed to quickly familiarize hordes of foreign tourists who will flow into
the city during the World Games with the city's public transport system.</P>
      <P>Already, the bureau has received an average of 10,000 phone calls per day for
bus information, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>He added that he hopes that by rolling out the bilingual signage systems to
provide easier access to transportation information, more foreign tourists would
be lured into visiting the city during the World Games.</P>
      <P>Each LED display panel costs NT$100,000 (US$2,870), while the 2,000 bilingual
bus stop signs would cost NT$3 million, according to bureau official Chang Su-
chuan.</P>
      <P>As another part of its efforts to provide a more friendly environment for
foreigners, the city government is also offering English language courses for
bus and taxi drivers to enhance their English conversation ability so that they
can communicate with foreign tourists and help answer questions the visitors may
have.</P>

      <P>Chinese authorities will take measures to boost tourist arrivals to Taiwan in
the shortest period possible and to promote an integration of tourism resources
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Shao Qiwei, director of China's
National Tourism Administration, said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shao said Taiwan and China should jointly craft diverse and fresh products to
lure tourists and study the possibility of devising tours that could take
Chinese tourists to various stops in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau in one trip,
such as on cruises.</P>
      <P>The two sides should cooperate closely to minimize the impact of the global
economic crisis on the cross-strait tourism market, Shao said.</P>
      <P>It is also important to set up a cross-Taiwan Strait information exchange and
monitoring center to deal with emergencies that might arise, he added.</P>
      <P>Shao made the remarks at the opening of the 12th Cross-Strait Travel Industry
Forum, held for the first time in Taipei by the Taipei-based Travel Quality
Assurance Association (TQAA).</P>
      <P>TQAA Chairman Lin Chin-jung, meanwhile, said he was hopeful that the number of
Chinese tourist arrivals to Taiwan would break the daily mark of 1,000 in April.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan relaxed restrictions and opened its doors to more Chinese tourists
in July last year, a total of 89,988 tourists from mainland China have come to
Taiwan -- with an average of 300 people per day in 2008 and 600 people per day
in 2009, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Zuo Yixiang, deputy director of Jiangsu Province's tourism association, who was
also traveled to Taiwan for the forum, said the province has launched a drive
promoting tours to Taiwan and the first batch of some 10,000 Jiangsu tourists
will arrive on Friday.</P>
      <P>Shao arrived Wednesday in Taiwan at the head of a large delegation of tourism
officials and travel industry representatives from China's 30 major provinces.
The trip is organized to help them gain a better understanding of the Taiwan
market.</P>
      <P>The visit is Shao's third to Taiwan to try to expand cross-Taiwan Strait
tourism.</P>
      <P>The entire 485-member delegation was the largest of its kind to ever visit
Taiwan. Delegation members are to arrive in Taiwan in various groups starting
from Wednesday.  Shao is slated to meet Taiwan's Tourism Bureau Director-General
Janice Lai while here.</P>
      <P>The TQAA will arrange for the Chinese delegation to travel to scenic areas
around Taiwan to get a firsthand look at Taiwan's tourism resources before the
members return to China on March 4.</P>
      <P>On March 1, more than 300 of the visiting Chinese tour operators will head for
Alishan, a noted mountain resort in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County, which is
one of the most popular destinations among Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan tour operators also said they are optimistic that the number
of Chinese tourist arrivals will soon surpass 1,000 per day, but expressed
concern that a price war might ruin the market.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's Tourism Bureau has stipulated that local tour agencies must
take on each Chinese tourist at the minimum price of US$80 per day, to ensure
the quality of the tours, tour operators complained that some of Taiwan's
operators have begun offering cheaper packages at a price of US$30 or US$40 per
day.</P>
      <P>In response to the charge, Tourism Bureau officials said the US$80 requirement
must be complied with and that they will step up checks against those breaching
the regulation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Number of foreign laborers in Taiwan expected to drop by 30,000</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of foreign blue-collar workers employed in Taiwan is expected to drop
by 30,000 this year as a result of the global economic recession and government
measures to combat soaring unemployment, a ranking Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The CLA passed an amendment Thursday, suspending the import of foreign laborers
by manufacturers operating three shifts and lowering the cap on foreign workers
allowed to work for major manufacturers from 30 percent to 20 percent of the
companies' total work force, said Chen Yi-min, director-general of CLA's
Employment and Vocational Training Administration.</P>
      <P>The amendment is slated to be promulgated and put into force next week, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Chen said the CLA proposed the amendment on the grounds that domestic workers
are now more willing to work night-shift jobs in the face of rising unemployment
and that the import of foreign laborers -- a supplementary measure -- should not
affect the rights of domestic workers.</P>
      <P>He noted that due to declined orders received by domestic manufacturers as a
result of the global economic recession, the number of foreign workers employed
in Taiwan had reduced by 8,400 and 9,000 in December 2008 and January,
respectively.</P>
      <P>As a result of these factors, the number of foreign workers employed in Taiwan's
manufacturing sector is expected to fall by 30,000 this year after the amendment
takes effect, Chen added.</P>
      <P>According to CLA statistics, the number of foreign laborers in Taiwan totaled
365,000 at the end of December 2008.</P>

      <P>The number of people on the dole in Taiwan might exceed  90,000 by the end of
February  with a soaring unemployment rate, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
predicted Thursday.</P>
      <P>More than 20,000 people who have recently lost jobs became first-time claimants
of unemployment subsidies in February, at a time when the country's jobless rate
soared to 5.31 percent in January, a 31-year high, according to the CLA.</P>
      <P>Over 30,000 people claimed the welfare payments last December, representing an
unprecedented onefold increase, with 26,773 claimants succeeding in receiving
benefits, CLA officials said.</P>
      <P>As of the end of December 2008, the CLA has approved unemployment payments for
63,251 people in the country, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The figure was between 20,000 and 30,000 in January and February, respectively,

    <TEXT>
      <P>A former head of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said
Thursday that Taiwan's economic interests would be better served if negotiations
with China on a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) go hand-in-
hand with those with other countries on free trade agreements (FTAs).</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference, Hong Chi-chang, who headed the quasi-official
intermediary body in exchanges with China in the absence of official ties during
the late years of the previous Democratic  Progressive  Party administration,
said that while negotiating a CECA with China, Taiwan should try to push for the
signing of FTAs with nations with which Taiwan has close trade relations, such
as members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>That way,  he said,  Taiwan could resist further economic dependence on China,
which would happen if only the CECA is signed.</P>
      <P>The government is proposing signing the agreement with China, largely to ensure
Taiwan enjoys preferential treatment in trade like other countries that reach
trade agreements with China. But critics warn such an agreement could make
Taiwan too economically dependent on China and could hurt Taiwanese businesses.</P>
      <P>Although the CECA could slow down the process of Taiwan being marginalized in
the ongoing regional economic integration, Hong said it should not be viewed as
the ultimate solution to the countrys sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the government should inform the public of the details of the
agreement in a transparent manner and conduct thorough evaluations on its
potential positive and negative impacts on different sectors, as well as Taiwans
economy as a whole, Hong said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hong called on the government to first map out a comprehensive
economic development strategy, instead of pushing for a CECA simply in response
to the calls of a few particular industries.</P>
      <P>Hong stressed that he was opposed to the CECA negotiations being carried out by
the SEF, which is in charge of negotiations with China in the absence of
official relations, and the China-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) , because the two bodies' previous negotiations on four
agreements that were signed last year had proven non-transparent and had
jeopardized the public's trust.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on the CECA should be conducted by the National Security Council,
Hong proposed, adding that Taiwan should also negotiate with China as two World
Trade Organization members, which would put Taiwan on an equal footing with
China.</P>
      <P>Additionally, he stressed that the legislature should be allowed participation
in the negotiation processes.</P>

      <P>Of the total, 46.2 percent were tourists or holidaymakers, up 7.7 percent from
the 2007 level, the report said. It added that the increase in tourists had

global economic recession.</P>
      <P>By areas, the number of travelers from Hong Kong and Macau posted the largest
gain in 2008, up 25.9 percent year-on-year; and the number of tourists from
South Korea also registered an 11.7 percent increase.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the number of visitors from Japan suffered the biggest slump of 6.8
percent, followed by travelers from the United States, down 2.7 percent from the

percent year-on-year growth.</P>
      <P>However, local people made fewer visits to most other areas, with the number of

"0800-770885". A corrected version follows. Premier promotes hotline service for
drug addicts

Taipei, Feb. 26 (CNA) Premier Liu Chao-shiuan urged drug addicts Thursday to
kick the habit by seeking assistance through a 24-hour toll-free hotline service
that will be activated March 1.

Speaking at an event to promote the hotline 0800-770885, Liu said that with one
percent of the population, or 230,000 people, in the grips of drug addition, the
country is facing a serious problem.

He encouraged drug addicts make good use of the hotline to access the
government's rehabilitation service and set themselves on the path to a new
life.

Liu said that substance abuse not only causes a host of public health and social
problems, but also contributes to an escalation in crime rates and leads to the
spread of communicable diseases.

Given that most drug addicts in Taiwan are young people and the rate of relapse
among recovering addicts is 90 percent, the problem has had a huge negative
impact on the nation's work force, according to Liu.

The premier said that there is ample room for a revision of the country's anti-
drug policies and programs, as there are very few signs that the drug abuse
problem in the country is easing.

Therefore, the Ministry of Justice, in collaboration with the Department of
Heath, has been promoting a new policy under which drug addicts will be treated
as patients rather than as criminals, under a a rehabilitation program launched
earlier in the month, Liu said.

Under the program, drug abusers who take the initiative to seek rehabilitation
will be exempt from punishment or will be given deferred sentences, according to
Liu.

Starting March, drug addicts will be able to obtain assistance by calling the
hotline without identifying themselves,  Liu said. Professionals at various drug
prevention and control centers around the country will be available for
consultations and will offer suggestions on medical treatment, schooling and
employment, he added.

      <P>Taiwans trade promotion body has recently set up an office in Burkina Faso, the
first in West Africa, in an effort to facilitate business exchanges with the
African country as well as the nearby region, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Trade Center established by the Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) in the capital Ouagadougou will aim to help Taiwanese firms
seek business prospects in the African country's big domestic market of 15
million people, said Liu Bang-zyh, deputy director-general of the ministry's
Department of African Affairs.</P>
      <P>While the global economic downturn is affecting investment sentiments worldwide,
Africa has enjoyed an annual economic growth rate of 6 percent to 8 percent in
the past few years, which could make it a good alternative investment
destination for Taiwanese businesses, Liu told a press briefing.</P>
      <P>The volume of bilateral trade between Taiwan and Africa is still relatively low,
Liu said, with the amount totaling around US$10.4 billion from January to
November last year.</P>
      <P>The figure is less than 10 percent of the trade volume between China and Africa
over the same period, Liu added.</P>
      <P>Burkina Faso is Taiwans 125th largest trading partner, with the bilateral trade
volume in 2007 totaling $16.7 million, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu said the MOFA will also continue to work toward boosting economic
and trade relations with Taiwans other diplomatic allies in Africa -- Swaziland,
Sao Tome and Principe and The Gambia, which, he said, would in turn help expand
Taiwan's overall economic ties with the African continent.</P>
      <P>With the opening of the office in Burkina Faso, TAITRA currently has seven
offices in Africa, with the others being in Algeria, Morocco, Nigeria, Egypt,
South Africa, and Kenya.</P>

    <HEADLINE>European trade offices issue practical guide on Taiwan market</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
02/26/09  19:40:50

    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Economic and Trade Office (EETO) and the French Institute in Taipei
announced Thursday that they will issue a business brochure to raise awareness
in Europe about Taiwan's market potential and to better facilitate bilateral
economic and trade relations between Taiwan and the European Union.</P>
      <P>EETO head Guy Ledoux told the Central News Agency in an exclusive interview
that while there are already quite a few European international  companies doing
businesses  in Taiwan,  the new initiative targets small and medium sized
companies (SMEs) in Europe and is intended to spur their interest in Taiwanese
market.</P>
      <P>The business guide, titled "A Practical Guide to the Taiwanese Market -- How to
export or invest in Taiwan, " is a collaborative effort by the EETO, the French
Institute in Taipei and other European trade offices in Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>Starting Friday, 6,000 copies of the brochure will be given to the European
trade councilors and representatives based in Taiwan for distribution to the
SMEs at various events held by European business communities and regional
chambers of commerce, Ledoux said.</P>
      <P>"If it's properly distributed and if it's accompanied by direct stimuli by
European trade councilors and representatives, it will have a big impact," said
the de facto European Union ambassador to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Emmanuel Ly-Batallan, head of the economic and commercial section of the French
Institute in Taipei, told the CNA that the brochure is very concise and contains
all the basic information that European businesses would need to understand the
Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>With a population of merely 23 million, Taiwan is the world's 15th largest
importer, with imports totalling 150 billion euros (US$192 billion) in 2007,
ahead of India's 149 billion euros, Ly-Batallan noted, saying that this is a
good indicator of Taiwan's market potential. Added to that is the fact the
consumption level in Taiwan is high, with the purchasing power parity per capita
being US$30,000, he said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the quality of infrastructure and the regulatory environment  make
Taiwan an attractive  market,  according  to Ly-Batallan.</P>
      <P>"If you look at international markets in general, the quality of the legal
environment in Taiwan is very strong," Ly-Batallan said, adding that a highly
skilled workforce is another asset.</P>
      <P>Describing Taiwan as a market "underestimated  by European companies, " the
brochure states that since taking office May 20, 2008, President Ma Ying-jeou
has adopted numerous economic and financial measures to improve relations with
China, which present new opportunities for not only Taiwanese but also foreign
businesses.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Taiwan can serve as the launch pad for businesses to begin their
"Chinese success story" because operating from Taiwan enables European companies
to benefit from Taiwans privileged links to China while taking advantage of
Taiwan's developed legal and business environment, it adds.</P>
      <P>Another incentive for European business is the fact that citizens of 24 of the
27 EU member states are allowed visa-free entry to Taiwan with maximum stay of
up to 30 days, an incentive that Ledoux and Ly-Batallan said is beneficial to
bilateral economic relations.</P>
      <P>Detailed information regarding the practical guide will be posted on the EETO
Web site at www.deltwn.ec.europa.eu and on the Web site of the European
Commissions Directorate-General for Trade by next week, according to Ledoux.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The real earnings of Taiwanese workers shrank by 3.37 percent in 2008, marking
the worst contraction since 1980, mainly due to a high inflation and an economic
slump, according to statistics released Thursday by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>During the same period, real regular earnings -- which include only base salary
plus fixed subsidies or bonuses -- decreased by 3.13 percent, also the worst
performance since 1980.</P>
      <P>The statistics showed that in 2008, the average monthly earnings per employee in
the industrial and service sectors increased by just 0.03 percent from the
previous year to NT$45,125 (US$1,300), and the average regular earnings per
employee rose by 0.28 percent to NT$36,867.</P>
      <P>However, a 3.52 percent rise in the consumer price index during the year more
than offset any nominal gains in earnings.</P>
      <P>According to Huang Chien-chung, deputy chief of the DGBAS's Fourth Department in
charge of census and sampling surveys, although inflation moderated in October,
there was a sharp decrease in regular earnings in November and December, owing
to a drop in work hours as a result of many workers being forced to take unpaid
leave amid sluggish business.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate soared to 5.31 percent in January, marking a record
high for January since the first official unemployment survey was launched in
1978, according to a report released Thursday by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>Last month, the actual number of people out of work in Taiwan topped 578,000,
also marking a record high in 31 years, DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>The 5.31 percent jobless rate was the fourth highest in history for all months,
trailing only the 5.35 percent posted in August 2001, 5.33 percent in October
2001 and 5.32 percent in September 2002, said Huang Chien-chung, a deputy chief
of the DGBAS's Fourth Department in charge of census and sampling surveys.</P>
      <P>Of the 578,000 jobless workers in January, 291,000 lost their jobs because of
business closure or downsizing, up 41,000 from December 2008, and marking the
highest monthly level since 1978, he added.</P>
      <P>Huang said the January jobless increase rate, a month-on-month increase of 0.28
percentage points, was relatively mild compared to that posted in December 2008,
which soared by 0.39 percentage points as compared with the November level.</P>
      <P>He attributed the relatively "milder" increase to the growth in demand for
temporary workers in January during the Chinese New Year holiday  and the
historic  distribution  of shopping  vouchers nationwide.</P>
      <P>The number of employed workers in Taiwan totaled 10.30 million in January,
marking a month-on-month decline of 51,000 from December 2008 and a year-on-year
fall of 88,000 from January 2008, hitting the greatest monthly decline since
1991, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"It indicates that the growth dynamic of the country's overall workforce has
lost steam, mainly as a result of the current economic recession, which has
triggered a wave of layoffs across the country," said Huang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung said later in the day that the
government is planning to create some 341,000 jobs this year, which will
hopefully contribute to controlling the country's unemployment rate to under 4.5
percent for the year.</P>

      <P>A four-member delegation from the Shanghai Museum arrived in Taiwan Thursday for
a return visit to the country's National Palace Museum (NPM), bringing what an
NPM official described assurprisesto a museums planned exhibition.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference, Shanghai Museum Director Chen Xiejun, who heads
the delegation, announced that his museum would lend one set, or two items, of
its colored enamel porcelains from the period of the Qing Dynasty's Emperor
Yongzheng to be displayed at the NPMs exhibition on the emperor to be held in
October.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that since the two museums did not formally discuss the
feasibilities of lending the NPMs artifacts to be exhibited at the Shanghai
World Expo 2010 when NPM Director Chou Kung-shin visited his city last week,
they will not touch on the issue either as his current visit to Taipei is a
purely reciprocal one.</P>
      <P>Chou said Thursday that during Chen's visit, the two museums will work on
details on the implementation of the nine-point consensus reached on her recent
visit to China. The consensus involved building closer cooperation and exchanges
in areas such as academics, archive and art conservation,  as well as
publication  and exhibition arrangements.</P>
      <P>She added that the set of porcelains mentioned by Chen are unique because their
colored drawings are uncommonly influenced by the western painting style.</P>
      <P>The NPM plans to showcase 138 sets, or around 180 items of Yongzheng-related
artifacts in its October exhibition, said Chou, with around 27 sets borrowed
from the Beijing-based Palace Museum and one set from the Shanghai Museum.</P>
      <P>Chou described her recent visit to China assuccessfulbecause it has drawn
intensive publicity in Chinas media even continuing until now, which has made
the NPM a household name in China and would motivate more mainland Chinese to
visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While the Shanghai delegation will leave Taiwan on March 1, another Chinese
delegation headed by the director of Beijing's Palace Museum is slated to arrive
in Taiwan on the same day for a reciprocal four-day visit.</P>
      <P>Chou visited the Palace Museum in Beijing and the Shanghai Museum during her
"ice-breaking" trip to China in earlier this month.</P>
      <P>The National Palace Museum in Taiwan holds more than 600,000 pieces of
treasures, from paintings to jades, representing the best collection of Chinese
cultural artifacts in the world. The items were taken from the Beijing Palace
Museum to avoid the collection falling in the hands of the Japanese invading
army during World War II. They were later shipped to Taiwan when the
Nationalists in China lost a civil war to the Communists in 1949.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung city government is working to have 2,000 bus stop signs in the
city replaced with bilingual ones and more LED display devices installed along
the Kaohisung metro system, as part of its preparations for the 2009 World
Games, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the inauguration of 81 full-color LED intelligent information
display panels at all the stations on the Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit (MRT)
system's Red Line, Wang Kwo-tsai, director of the city's Transportation Bureau
said that the devices are aimed at providing passengers with real time travel
information.</P>
      <P>Another 35 of this type of LED display panels will also be installed at stations
along the Kaohsiung MRT's Orange Line before the World Games opens in July,
according to Wang.</P>
      <P>Wang added that the panels featuring Chinese and English bilingual markings were
designed to quickly familiarize hordes of foreign tourists who will flow into
the city during the World Games with the city's public transport system.</P>
      <P>Already, the bureau has received an average of 10,000 phone calls per day for
bus information, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>He added that he hopes that by rolling out the bilingual signage systems to
provide easier access to transportation information, more foreign tourists would
be lured into visiting the city during the World Games.</P>
      <P>Each LED display panel costs NT$100,000 (US$2,870), while the 2,000 bilingual
bus stop signs would cost NT$3 million, according to bureau official Chang Su-
chuan.</P>
      <P>As another part of its efforts to provide a more friendly environment for
foreigners, the city government is also offering English language courses for
bus and taxi drivers to enhance their English conversation ability so that they
can communicate with foreign tourists and help answer questions the visitors may

      <P>Chinese authorities will take measures to boost tourist arrivals to Taiwan in
the shortest period possible and to promote an integration of tourism resources
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Shao Qiwei, director of China's
National Tourism Administration, said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shao said Taiwan and China should jointly craft diverse and fresh products to
lure tourists and study the possibility of devising tours that could take
Chinese tourists to various stops in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau in one trip,
such as on cruises.</P>
      <P>The two sides should cooperate closely to minimize the impact of the global
economic crisis on the cross-strait tourism market, Shao said.</P>
      <P>It is also important to set up a cross-Taiwan Strait information exchange and
monitoring center to deal with emergencies that might arise, he added.</P>
      <P>Shao made the remarks at the opening of the 12th Cross-Strait Travel Industry
Forum, held for the first time in Taipei by the Taipei-based Travel Quality
Assurance Association (TQAA).</P>
      <P>TQAA Chairman Lin Chin-jung, meanwhile, said he was hopeful that the number of
Chinese tourist arrivals to Taiwan would break the daily mark of 1,000 in April.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan relaxed restrictions and opened its doors to more Chinese tourists
in July last year, a total of 89,988 tourists from mainland China have come to
Taiwan -- with an average of 300 people per day in 2008 and 600 people per day
in 2009, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Zuo Yixiang, deputy director of Jiangsu Province's tourism association, who was
also traveled to Taiwan for the forum, said the province has launched a drive
promoting tours to Taiwan and the first batch of some 10,000 Jiangsu tourists
will arrive on Friday.</P>
      <P>Shao arrived Wednesday in Taiwan at the head of a large delegation of tourism
officials and travel industry representatives from China's 30 major provinces.
The trip is organized to help them gain a better understanding of the Taiwan
market.</P>
      <P>The visit is Shao's third to Taiwan to try to expand cross-Taiwan Strait
tourism.</P>
      <P>The entire 485-member delegation was the largest of its kind to ever visit
Taiwan. Delegation members are to arrive in Taiwan in various groups starting
from Wednesday.  Shao is slated to meet Taiwan's Tourism Bureau Director-General
Janice Lai while here.</P>
      <P>The TQAA will arrange for the Chinese delegation to travel to scenic areas
around Taiwan to get a firsthand look at Taiwan's tourism resources before the
members return to China on March 4.</P>
      <P>On March 1, more than 300 of the visiting Chinese tour operators will head for
Alishan, a noted mountain resort in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County, which is
one of the most popular destinations among Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan tour operators also said they are optimistic that the number
of Chinese tourist arrivals will soon surpass 1,000 per day, but expressed
concern that a price war might ruin the market.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's Tourism Bureau has stipulated that local tour agencies must
take on each Chinese tourist at the minimum price of US$80 per day, to ensure
the quality of the tours, tour operators complained that some of Taiwan's
operators have begun offering cheaper packages at a price of US$30 or US$40 per
day.</P>
      <P>In response to the charge, Tourism Bureau officials said the US$80 requirement
must be complied with and that they will step up checks against those breaching
the regulation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of foreign blue-collar workers employed in Taiwan is expected to drop
by 30,000 this year as a result of the global economic recession and government
measures to combat soaring unemployment, a ranking Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The CLA passed an amendment Thursday, suspending the import of foreign laborers
by manufacturers operating three shifts and lowering the cap on foreign workers
allowed to work for major manufacturers from 30 percent to 20 percent of the
companies' total work force, said Chen Yi-min, director-general of CLA's
Employment and Vocational Training Administration.</P>
      <P>The amendment is slated to be promulgated and put into force next week, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Chen said the CLA proposed the amendment on the grounds that domestic workers
are now more willing to work night-shift jobs in the face of rising unemployment
and that the import of foreign laborers -- a supplementary measure -- should not
affect the rights of domestic workers.</P>
      <P>He noted that due to declined orders received by domestic manufacturers as a
result of the global economic recession, the number of foreign workers employed
in Taiwan had reduced by 8,400 and 9,000 in December 2008 and January,
respectively.</P>
      <P>As a result of these factors, the number of foreign workers employed in Taiwan's
manufacturing sector is expected to fall by 30,000 this year after the amendment
takes effect, Chen added.</P>
      <P>According to CLA statistics, the number of foreign laborers in Taiwan totaled
365,000 at the end of December 2008.</P>

      <P>The number of people on the dole in Taiwan might exceed  90,000 by the end of
February  with a soaring unemployment rate, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
predicted Thursday.</P>
      <P>More than 20,000 people who have recently lost jobs became first-time claimants
of unemployment subsidies in February, at a time when the country's jobless rate
soared to 5.31 percent in January, a 31-year high, according to the CLA.</P>
      <P>Over 30,000 people claimed the welfare payments last December, representing an
unprecedented onefold increase, with 26,773 claimants succeeding in receiving
benefits, CLA officials said.</P>
      <P>As of the end of December 2008, the CLA has approved unemployment payments for
63,251 people in the country, the officials said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A former head of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said
Thursday that Taiwan's economic interests would be better served if negotiations
with China on a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) go hand-in-
hand with those with other countries on free trade agreements (FTAs).</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference, Hong Chi-chang, who headed the quasi-official
intermediary body in exchanges with China in the absence of official ties during
the late years of the previous Democratic  Progressive  Party administration,
said that while negotiating a CECA with China, Taiwan should try to push for the
signing of FTAs with nations with which Taiwan has close trade relations, such
as members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>That way,  he said,  Taiwan could resist further economic dependence on China,
which would happen if only the CECA is signed.</P>
      <P>The government is proposing signing the agreement with China, largely to ensure
Taiwan enjoys preferential treatment in trade like other countries that reach
trade agreements with China. But critics warn such an agreement could make
Taiwan too economically dependent on China and could hurt Taiwanese businesses.</P>
      <P>Although the CECA could slow down the process of Taiwan being marginalized in
the ongoing regional economic integration, Hong said it should not be viewed as
the ultimate solution to the countrys sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the government should inform the public of the details of the
agreement in a transparent manner and conduct thorough evaluations on its
potential positive and negative impacts on different sectors, as well as Taiwans
economy as a whole, Hong said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hong called on the government to first map out a comprehensive
economic development strategy, instead of pushing for a CECA simply in response
to the calls of a few particular industries.</P>
      <P>Hong stressed that he was opposed to the CECA negotiations being carried out by
the SEF, which is in charge of negotiations with China in the absence of
official relations, and the China-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) , because the two bodies' previous negotiations on four
agreements that were signed last year had proven non-transparent and had
jeopardized the public's trust.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on the CECA should be conducted by the National Security Council,
Hong proposed, adding that Taiwan should also negotiate with China as two World
Trade Organization members, which would put Taiwan on an equal footing with
China.</P>
      <P>Additionally, he stressed that the legislature should be allowed participation
in the negotiation processes.</P>

      <P>Of the total, 46.2 percent were tourists or holidaymakers, up 7.7 percent from

global economic recession.</P>

gain in 2008, up 25.9 percent year-on-year; and the number of tourists from
South Korea also registered an 11.7 percent increase.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the number of visitors from Japan suffered the biggest slump of 6.8
percent, followed by travelers from the United States, down 2.7 percent from the
2007 level.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MOTC said the number of Taiwan visitors to Japan continued to
rise to 1.31 million in 2008, from 1.28 million a year ago, marking a 2.3
percent year-on-year growth.</P>
      <P>However, local people made fewer visits to most other areas, with the number of
visitors to Macau registering the biggest decline of 22.5 percent. The numbers

    <HEADLINE>CECA and FTAs should go hand-in-hand: ex-SEF head</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
02/27/09  10:30:36
(By Jian Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former head of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said
Thursday that Taiwan's economic interests would be better served if negotiations
with China on a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) go hand-in-
hand with those with other countries on free trade agreements (FTAs).</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference, Hong Chi-chang, who headed the quasi-official
intermediary body in exchanges with China in the absence of official ties during
the late years of the previous Democratic  Progressive  Party administration,
said that while negotiating a CECA with China, Taiwan should try to push for the
signing of FTAs with nations with which Taiwan has close trade relations, such
as members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>That way,  he said,  Taiwan could resist further economic dependence on China,
which would happen if only the CECA is signed.</P>
      <P>The government is proposing signing the agreement with China, largely to ensure
Taiwan enjoys preferential treatment in trade like other countries that reach
trade agreements with China. But critics warn such an agreement could make
Taiwan too economically dependent on China and could hurt Taiwanese businesses.</P>
      <P>Although the CECA could slow down the process of Taiwan being marginalized in
the ongoing regional economic integration, Hong said it should not be viewed as
the ultimate solution to the countrys sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the government should inform the public of the details of the
agreement in a transparent manner and conduct thorough evaluations on its
potential positive and negative impacts on different sectors, as well as Taiwans
economy as a whole, Hong said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hong called on the government to first map out a comprehensive
economic development strategy, instead of pushing for a CECA simply in response
to the calls of a few particular industries.</P>
      <P>Hong stressed that he was opposed to the CECA negotiations being carried out by
the SEF, which is in charge of negotiations with China in the absence of
official relations, and the China-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) , because the two bodies' previous negotiations on four
agreements that were signed last year had proven non-transparent and had
jeopardized the public's trust.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on the CECA should be conducted by the National Security Council,
Hong proposed, adding that Taiwan should also negotiate with China as two World
Trade Organization members, which would put Taiwan on an equal footing with
China.</P>
      <P>Additionally, he stressed that the legislature should be allowed participation
in the negotiation processes.</P>

so profit by what you say to him as to change his conduct. If you speak to a man
in parables, he will probably be pleased with your story; but the important

      <P>The funeral business was once a field of work that most people tried to avoid,
but this has changed as many are struggling to stay afloat in the current
economic storm.</P>
      <P>According to the results of an open poll released Friday by www.ejob.gov.tw, an
employment service Web site run by the Council of Labor Affairs, obtaining a
license as a funeral professional was the fifth most popular choice among the
respondents who were given 10 fields to choose from as their second choice of
profession.</P>
      <P>The poll, which was launched Feb. 1, had drawn 7,242 participants as of Feb. 26,
11.53 percent of whom indicated that they were interested in entering the
funeral business.</P>
      <P>This was a more popular choice than financial services, which has been on the
downturn as result of the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>In the poll, funeral services ranked fifth behind computer software and hardware
work, which drew 18.02 percent of the vote; restaurant and bakery business, with
16.64 percent; child care services, with 15.21 percent; and employment services,
with 11.95 percent.</P>
      <P>Ranking from sixth to 10th were beauty and skin care services; caregiving;
mechanics,  electrical and plumbing work;  finance services; and domestic

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou advocated Friday the signing of a cross-strait economic
cooperation framework, saying that it would be part of Taiwan's global
positioning efforts.</P>
      <P>"If we don't do it today, we'll regret it tomorrow, " Ma said during an
exclusive interview with the local cable TV ERANews.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the proposed agreement between Taiwan and China for closer economic
cooperation would be beneficial not just to China. Rather, he said, it is part
of Taiwan's efforts to better position itself in the world economic landscape.</P>
      <P>It was the president's first specific public comment this year on the proposed
pact, which has given rise to much debate and political bickering over the past
weeks.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to calm opponents of the proposal, Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung
said earlier this week that it is purely an economic issue that is not
necessarily directly related to politics.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the proposed agreement, which comes under the portfolio of the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, is aimed mainly at enabling Taiwan to meet the
challenges that would arise from the ASEAN Plus China agreement set to take
effect in 2010.</P>

      <P>Leading a 10-member Chinese delegation, China's top tourism official arrived in
the Taiwan's outlying island of Penghu Friday for a half-day visit.</P>
      <P>Shao Qiwei, director of China's National Tourism Administration, and his group
first boarded a motor boat to cruise waters north of Penghu, which lies off
Taiwan's southwestern coast.</P>
      <P>The group then visited  other tourist attractions  in the archipelago, including
the big ancient banyan tree in the Tungliang area, the Penghu Cross-sea Bridge,
a museum showcasing the island group's unique geology, the Waian Lighthouse and
the Hsitai Castle.</P>
      <P>Shao arrived in Taiwan Wednesday at the head of a large delegation of tourism
officials and travel industry representatives from China's 30 major provinces to
attend the 12th Cross-Strait Travel Industry Forum, held for the first time in
Taipei by the Taipei-based Travel Quality Assurance Association (TQAA).</P>
      <P>Members of the 485-member Chinese delegation have begun to visit other tourist
attractions around Taiwan in separate groups in order to gain a better
understanding of the country's tourism market.</P>
      <P>Shao and his group are scheduled to proceed to the Taiwan-held island of Kinmen
Saturday, from where he will head back to China on a passenger ferry sailing
between Kinmen and China's southeastern port city of Xiamen.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan relaxed restrictions and opened its doors to more Chinese tourists
in July last year, nearly 90,000 tourists from China have come to Taiwan -- at
an average of 300 per day in 2008 and 600 per day in 2009 -- according to TQAA
Chairman Lin Chin-jung.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the number of Chinese tourist arrivals to Taiwan will surpass a
daily average of 1,000 in April this year, Lin said Friday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Transnational marriage rate drops amid economic downturn</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 27 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The rate of transnational marriages between Taiwan citizens and foreign
nationals has been declining in recent years as a result of a stricter
immigration interview system and the effects of a weak economy, the Ministry of
the Interior (MOI) and observers said Friday.</P>
      <P>The rate of cross-border marriages had climbed from 15.69 percent in 1998 to
31.86 percent in 2003, according to MOI statistics. The 2003 figure translated
into about one out of every three marriages in the country, with 50 percent of
the cross-border marriages involving a Chinese spouse, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>However, after 2003, the rate of transnational marriages began declining and by
2008 had dropped to 14 percent, with one out of seven marriages in the country
being transnational, the statistics indicated.</P>
      <P>The biggest decline, 16 percent, was recorded for marriages between Taiwanese
and Chinese spouses, followed by a 13 percent drop in legal unions between
Taiwanese and Southeast Asian spouses.</P>
      <P>The MOI attributed the drop in the cross-border marriage rate to a tighter
immigration interview system introduced by the government and a comparative
improvement in the economy of the home countries of most potential foreign
spouses.</P>
      <P>The National Immigration Agency has put in place a system under which Chinese
spouses are interviewed upon entry into Taiwan, in an attempt to close the fake
marriage loophole.</P>
      <P>All foreign  spouses  from Southeast  Asian countries  are interviewed both in
their home countries and at the point of entry into Taiwan, in accordance with
the Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs' regulations.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's sluggish economy has probably also contributed to the decline in the
number of cross-border marriages, " said Wang Shi-hou, an international marriage
broker.</P>
      <P>"In this time of economic recession, Taiwan men are showing less interest in
marrying foreign women, " Wang said, citing the fact that it costs about
NT$300,000 to arrange a marriage with a Vietnamese bride through a marriage
broker.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, many people are deferring their plans to marry," Wang added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the economic downturn is also dampening the enthusiasm of foreign
women to marry Taiwanese men, as they fear that they would not be able to make
ends meet, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>Moreover, with the growth of China's economy in recent years, many Chinese women
are no longer seeing Taiwan as a top choice for finding a husband, but rather
are turning their attention more to Japan and South Korea, he said.</P>
      <P>According to MOI statistics for last year, 66.7 percent of the Taiwanese men who
married non-nationals chose women from China, Hong Kong and Macau, while 22
percent married Vietnamese wives, and 4.4 percent tied the knot with Indonesian
women.</P>
      <P>Also in 2008, some 869 Taiwanese women married Japanese men, 621 married men
from China, Hong Kong and Macau, and 521 tied the knot with Americans, the
statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The statistics are in line with the so-called "marriage gradient theory" that
men tend to marry women slightly below their own levels of achievement, in terms
of education, income, and career, and social and economic status, according to
Wang Yun-tung, an assistant professor of Social Work at National Taiwan
University.</P>

      <P>In response to questions from opposition Democratic Progressive Party lawmakers,
Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan gave her assurances that the
Legislative Yuan would have to screen the agreement as required in Article 5 of
the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and
the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the process of negotiating and signing a CECA -- which in
theory will allow the free flow of merchandise, services, and capital between
Taiwan and China -- will be conducted under the statute's legal guidelines.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lai said the CECA would be purely economic in nature and not have
any implications for Taiwan's sovereignty, adding that the government would not
make any arrangements that would jeopardize the country's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan reiterated Friday that there is no timetable
for the signing of such an agreement, but he said it is not expected to be
broached at the next round of negotiations between Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), scheduled for later this year.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official organizations designated by their
respective governments to handle cross-strait matters in the absence of official
ties. The MAC supervises SEF operations.</P>
      <P>Liu promised that all related government agencies will do their best to assess
the benefits and impact of signing a cross-strait economic cooperation framework
with China and bringing this plan to fruition is a goal every government agency
should pursue.</P>
      <P>As to concerns raised by DPP legislators that most people are unclear about the
content of a potential agreement, Liu pledged that the government would inform
the public and lawmakers of the content and meaning of the cooperation framework
before inking such an agreement with China.</P>

      <P>Countries that Taiwan's people enjoy visiting are those the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) will try to convince to give local tourists visa-free treatment,
with Thailand and Ireland high on the list, a MOFA official said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry,  Ireland may follow the United Kingdom's recent move
to give all Taiwan passport holders six-month visa-free privileges to visit
Britain for business or pleasure beginning March 3.</P>
      <P>Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrew Hsia said Ireland's consideration of
the issue is because Ireland and Britain belong to a "common travel zone."</P>
      <P>As to Thailand, which has recently promised all foreign travelers including
those from Taiwan exemptions from paying visa fees from March 5 to June 3, Hsia
said the ministry will continue efforts to persuade Thailand to grant Taiwanese
travelers visa-free treatment.</P>
      <P>The MOFA on Thursday welcomed Thailand's announcement of its temporary move not
to charge for visas and expected it would boost the number of Taiwanese tourists
visiting the Southeast Asian country and boost already extensive bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>In 2008,  Thailand  attracted  330,000 visits by Taiwanese travelers, according
to government figures, and economic relations have also been close.</P>
      <P>Bilateral trade between Taiwan and Thailand reached US$8.8 billion in 2007, and
as of the end of that year, Taiwanese companies had investments in Thailand
worth US$12.1 billion, making Taiwan the third largest foreign investor there.</P>
      <P>In addition, Thailand is the 13th largest source of Taiwan's imports and the
ninth largest market for Taiwan's exports.</P>
      <P>There are also 80,000 Thais currently working in Taiwan, making Thailand the
fourth largest source of Taiwan's migrant workers.</P>

      <P>Travel industry representatives from Taiwan and China participated in a cross-
strait travel industry golf tournament in northern Taiwan Friday to strengthen
contacts and lay the groundwork for Chinese to visit Taiwan on golfing
vacations.</P>
      <P>David Hsieh, deputy director-general of Taiwan's Tourism Bureau, teed off first
at the Miramar Golf &amp; Country Club to open the one-day competition, being
held for the fifth consecutive year but the first time in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Travel Agent Association (TAA) Chairman Yao Ta-kuang said that with the Cross-
Strait Travel Industry Forum, and consequently the golf tournament, being held
in Taiwan, the TAA and the Taipei-based Travel Quality Assurance Association
(TQAA) will do their best to promote the integration of tourism resources
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>With most restrictions on visits to Taiwan by Chinese nationals having been
lifted, the travel industries in both Taiwan and China are seeking to develop
and design new travel packages in Taiwan, including packages with golf themes,
Ya said.</P>
      <P>He added that the TAA and the TQAA have arranged for close to 50 members of the
485-member Chinese delegation in Taiwan for the forum to visit golf courses in
the western part of the island to help them design golf packages that will be
promoted in China.</P>
      <P>The director of China's National Tourism Administration, Shao Qiwei, and the
Chinese delegation, arrived Feb. 25 in Taiwan to gain a better understanding of
Taiwan's market.</P>
      <P>The full delegation, the largest of its kind ever to visit Taiwan,  is composed
of tourism officials and travel industry representatives from China's 30
provinces.</P>
      <P>Attending this year's forum in his capacity as chairman of the Cross-Strait
Tourism Exchange Association, Shao is scheduled to meet with his Taiwanese
counterpart, Janice Lai, director-general of the Tourism Bureau, before
returning to China.</P>
      <P>According to the TQAA, Shao will only remain in Taiwan until Feb. 28,  and  the
deputy  director  of China's  National  Tourism Administration, Du Jiang, will
lead the Chinese delegation for the remaining four days of its stay.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A batch of fresh cabbage from Taiwan has hit supermarket shelves in the Chinese
capital Beijing recently, marking the first of its kind to appear in northern
China since direct cross-Taiwan Strait shipping links were opened last December.</P>
      <P>Nearly 8,000 kgs of the cabbage, which arrived in Beijing after 10 days of
transportation, including several days aboard a ship, have been sold to
retailers around Beijing in the past two days, said Lu Ching-liang, owner of
afruit and vegetable co-operative based in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County,
where the cabbage originated.</P>
      <P>They were part of a total 50 tons of cabbage shipped to Beijing by the co-
operative over the last several days.</P>
      <P>It is the beginning of what Taiwan's government and farmers hope will be a new
market for Taiwan's farm produce, which in the past did not make a huge impact
on the mainland China despite the proximity, due to the lack of direct flights
and shipping links, which made transportation costs high and reduced the shelf
life of the produce.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a sales promotion, Lu said although the retail price of Taiwanese
cabbage is about 67 percent higher than that of the round Chinese cabbage
produced locally near Beijing -- 5 yuan per kg against 3 yuan per kg -- the new
arrival was welcomed and hotly sought after.</P>
      <P>At the promotion, a man, after sampling stir-fried Taiwanese cabbage, said "it's
crisp and tasty, " and a woman, after sampling another cabbage dish, said "it's
tastily tender."</P>
      <P>Compared to Taiwanese fruits, which have been exported to Beijing and sold at
"prohibitively high" prices, Taiwanese cabbage's retail price is relatively more
affordable and "down to earth," Lu said.</P>
      <P>"With its high quality and taste, Taiwanese cabbage is not expensive," Lu
stressed.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, a total of 50 tons of cabbage have been shipped to Beijing this
time for a trial sale and another 60 tons will probably be shipped to Shanghai
for sale in the near future.</P>
      <P>An official with the Taiwan External Trade Development Council, which has helped
push import of Taiwanese cabbage in Beijing, said increased exports to China
will help alleviate price contraction of Taiwan-produced vegetables,
particularly during the winter when production of vegetables is seasonably
massive in Taiwan, inevitably driving down the retail prices.</P>

      <P>An amendment that was passed into law in January will benefit low-income single
fathers and families with grandparents as the sole providers when it takes
effect March 1, the Executive Yuan reported Friday.</P>
      <P>From March 1, families in which the father is a single parent or grandparents
are the sole providers will be entitled to government subsidies, Executive Yuan
officials said.</P>
      <P>The benefits will include emergency  daily allowances  for families,  medical
subsidies,  stipends  for legal proceedings, allowances for children and their
education, and loans to start up a business.</P>
      <P>The amendment revised the Statute on Assisting the Families of Women in
Difficult Circumstances, which already enabled families in difficult
circumstances headed by single mothers to qualify for the welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>The revised version of the statute allowed fathers who are single parents or
victims of domestic violence and grandparents acting as the sole guardians of
their grandchildren to also become eligible for the benefits.</P>
      <P>The statute also stipulated that education subsidies for children or
grandchildren from these disadvantaged families studying at the university level
or higher be raised from the current 30 percent of a student's tuition to 60
percent.</P>
      <P>There were roughly 540,000 single-parent families in Taiwan in 2004, with 54
percent of the families headed by a single mother and 45 percent headed by a
single father, according to the Ministry of the Interior.</P>

      <P>Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd, Taiwan's fourth-largest maker of liquid crystal
display (LCD) panels, said Friday it was negotiating with creditors to postpone
the repayment of NT$40 billion (US$1.1 billion) in loans but insisted it was not
seeking financial relief from the government.</P>
      <P>Responding to media reports that the cash-strapped company was seeking a
government handout, Chief Financial Officer James Wu said Chunghwa Picture Tubes
still had cash reserves but wanted to keep more working capital to weather the
global economic downturn, which could last another year or two.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, Chunghwa Picture Tubes will need to soon repay NT$10 billion in
one-year loans and over NT$30 billion over the longer term to several banks,
including the state-owned Bank of Taiwan, Land Bank of Taiwan and Taiwan
Cooperative Bank.</P>
      <P>Wu said Chunghwa Picture Tubes would like to repay part of the loans while
asking its creditors to allow the company to extend repayments of the remaining
loans by up to two years.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Picture Tube and other major panel makers in Taiwan have suffered from
shrinking market demand and slipping panel prices due to the global economic
recession.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reassured the public Friday that the proposed economic
cooperation agreement with China is non-political and will not involve the issue
of unification and independence, as he stressed the urgency of reaching the
agreement to maintain Taiwan's economic competitiveness.</P>
      <P>With China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) set to form a
free trade area in 2010, a Taiwan-China economic agreement has now become
imperative, Ma said.</P>
      <P>After the establishment of the China-ASEAN free trade area, Taiwan's
petrochemical, electronics, textile and machine tool exports to China, which are
subject to a 6.5 percent import duties, will face unfavorable competition from
those from ASEAN members states, he said.</P>
      <P>Ma warned that the situation is likely to trigger a business exodus to Southeast
Asia, leading to the loss of 114,000 jobs in Taiwan and a decrease of one
percentage point in Taiwan's gross domestic product.</P>
      <P>The president addressed the issue during an interview with the local cable
television  network ERANews,  after the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
and Taiwan Solidarity Union voiced strong objection to the proposed
comprehensive economic cooperation agreement (CECA), which they argued would
downgrade Taiwan's status and pave the way for unification with China.</P>
      <P>The opposition is concerned that the CECA, though carrying a different name, is
similar to the closer economic partnership arrangement (CEPA) signed in 2003
between China and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>Ma, however, said the agreement that Taiwan wants to sign with China is
"certainly not a CEPA." It would also be different from an ordinary FTA,
although it would be signed under the WTO framework and function similarly as an
FTA, he added.</P>
      <P>"The situation between Taiwan and the mainland is very special, which allows for
the existence of certain specialities in bilateral agreements, " he said.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the agreement would cover a wide range of economic issues, such
as tariffs, non-tariff measures, investment protection, prevention of double
taxation, intellectual property right protection and the establishment of a
mechanism for dispute mediation.</P>
      <P>As the two sides are unlikely to reach consensus on all these issues at the same
time, Ma suggested that the two sides sign separate agreements on each of the
issues.</P>
      <P>Ma reiterated that the agreement would not lead to the opening of Taiwan's
market to Chinese laborers or further opening to Chinese agricultural products,
stressing that the government will make sure that any liberalization measures
toward China are in the interests of Taiwan and its people.</P>
      <P>Instead of calling the proposed pact a CECA, Ma proposed during Friday's
interview that the pact be renamed an "economic cooperation framework
agreement."</P>
      <P>Ma noted that various kinds of free trade agreements (FTAs) called by seven
different names are now registered with the World Trade Organization (WTO),
including CECA and CEPA.</P>
      <P>The president also argued that with China's isolation against Taiwan in the
international community, the signing of the cross-strait economic agreement
would facilitate Taiwan's efforts to ink FTAs with other WTO members.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that since Taiwan gained accession to the WTO in 2002, the
country has so far only succeeded in signing five FTAs, all of which are with
its diplomatic allies in Latin American.</P>
      <P>Among Taiwan's major trade partners, the United States, Japan and Southeast
Asian nations are all expecting Taiwan to seal an agreement with China first
before they would begin FTA talks with Taiwan, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma promised the agreement with China will be signed in accordance with the
principles of parity, reciprocity and dignity, and that authorities concerned
will deliver a report to the Legislative Yuan before negotiating with China.</P>

      <P>More than 1,000 people in Taichung City turned out for a blood drive launched by
a local restaurant Friday as stocks in the country's blood banks have run low.</P>
      <P>With only four days of blood stocks left, a steak house in the central city held
the blood drive aimed at bringing together 1,000 people to roll up their sleeves
and donate blood, according to restaurant executive Chen Li-teng.</P>
      <P>To encourage more people to pitch in, the restaurant provided NT$5 million worth
of giveaways as rewards, Cheng said. Each of the first 1,000 blood donors was to
be given a meal voucher and a coupon giving a dinner party of four a 10 percent
discount.</P>
      <P>The drive drew the participation  of crowds of university students.</P>
      <P>"It's good to act in the interest of others and get a free meal voucher in the
process, " said a National Chung Hsing University student, surnamed Luo, who
showed up in the early morning.</P>
      <P>"I never thought an economic recession would reduce people's willingness to
donate blood, but blood donations in the country have actually fallen 40 percent
during the recent downturn, " said Lin Kuo-sin, chairman of the Taiwan Blood
Services Foundation.</P>
      <P>Friday's blood drive collected an estimated 1,000 bags, or 250,000 cc of blood,
Lin said, which should help temporarily mitigate the blood shortage the
foundation is facing, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Each of the foundation's blood donation vehicles have been collecting an average
of less than 60 bags of blood per day in recent months, compared to the 100 bags
per day averaged last year, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>Because of the smaller amounts collected, the foundation's chairman said it only
had about four days' worth of supplies, short of the standard seven-day safety
reserve, before Friday's activity took place.</P>
      <P>Lin estimated that all six of its blood centers would be facing acute shortages
up until the end of March, especially for type O and type A blood.</P>

      <P>American pop singer and songwriter Jason Mraz will perform in Taipei Saturday in
front of a packed house as he promotes his latest album, "We Sing. We Dance. We
Steal Things, " concert organizers said Friday.</P>
      <P>"All tickets were sold out weeks before Mraz even departed for Asia, " the
organizers said when asked if any tickets were left for his performance at the
National Taiwan University Sports Center.</P>
      <P>The sellout is not surprising giving Mraz's recent success. "We Sing. We Dance.
We Steal Things," released in May 2008, was nominated for "Best Non-Classical
Engineered Album" at the 2009 Grammy Awards, while "I'm Yours, " the first
single from the album, was nominated for Song of the Year and Best Male Pop
Vocal Performance.</P>
      <P>"I'm Yours" also became Mraz's first top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in
September 2008, and as of Oct. 14, 2008 his album had sold over 500,000 copies
in the United States alone.</P>
      <P>At a press conference Friday, Mraz said he has been preparing hard for the
concert since arriving in Taiwan and therefore had little time to see the
country.</P>
      <P>"The concert is not mine but the ticket holders', " said Mraz, explaining that
he wanted to be in perfect shape to give a spectacular performance in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Asked if his songs and on-stage performing style will satisfy the Taiwanese
public's taste, Mraz said music has no boundaries and that his songs are written
to embrace life and connect people.</P>
      <P>"Political and cultural borders are only thoughts in people's minds and good
music can break all boundaries and connect people from different cultures," he
said.</P>
      <P>As Asian fans tend to be more shy and conservative, Mraz said he would do his
best to inspire them with his music and "get people awake within themselves."</P>
      <P>"I don't want my fans to sit there and stare at me while I perform. It would be
better if they can sing with me during the concert," he said.</P>
      <P>Asked about his 5-acre avocado farm in San Diego, Mraz said that now that he has
his "own patch of earth to care for, " he has payed more attention to the issue
of environmental protection and how people can save natural resources by
reducing waste and recycling energy.</P>
      <P>Mraz is currently on the third leg of an Asian tour that has already taken him
to South Korea and Japan. After leaving Taiwan, Mraz will head to Hong Kong,
Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, the organizers said.</P>
      <P>He will then fly to Europe, where he will tour more than 20 cities, and
Australia before heading back to the United States.</P>
      <P>Mraz attended The American Musical and Dramatic Academy in New York City, for a
short time, studying musical theater, before moving to San Diego. His stylistic
influences include reggae, pop, rock, folk, jazz, and hip hop.</P>

      <P>The only Taiwanese passenger on the Turkish Airlines airplane which crashed in
Amsterdam earlier this week said Friday that he feels lucky to be alive.</P>
      <P>Chen Shi-yin, an engineer at a high-tech company based in Jhubei, Hsinchu County
in northern Taiwan, arrived at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport Friday
from Holland where he survived the accident which has killed nine people.</P>
      <P>Recalling his narrow escape from death Wednesday, Chen told reporters that when
the crash happened, his first thought was "So this is what a plane crash is."</P>
      <P>The Boeing 737-800 airplane, with 135 people on board, crashed on landing at
Amsterdam's Schiphol international airport, killing nine people and injuring 84,
six critically, according to wire reports from Amsterdam Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen said his job needed him to travel frequently overseas. He took the mishap
plane in Istanbul destined for Holland en route home after finishing work in
Turkey.</P>
      <P>Chen recalled that the flight became rough several seconds before the crash.
Then the plane suddenly dropped for one or two seconds and he sensed the captain
tried to pull it up.</P>
      <P>In no time the aircraft hit the ground and the passengers started to scream.</P>
      <P>"I feel I am very lucky" after knowing many people died in the crash, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The plane crashed in a field near a motorway and broke into three pieces.</P>
      <P>"Because I am the only Oriental on the plane, I got the attention of Chinese
media after being sent to a nearby hospital," Chen added.</P>
      <P>Chen flew back to Taiwan on a China Airlines flight.</P>
      <P>Upon arriving at the Taoyuan airport, he was observed wearing worn shoes and
having a scrape on his forehead. He only had his passport and a plastic bag with
him because his luggage was left at the scene of the crash.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he fears taking flights again, Chen said he feels safer taking
Taiwanese airlines' flights.</P>
      <P>The first thing he wants to do after returning to Taiwan is go home to his wife
and five-year-old child, Chen added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Most voters reject vote-buying: poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's electorate is growing increasingly resistant to vote-buying, with less
than one percent of voters willing to accept bribes from candidates and vote for
them, according to the results of a public opinion poll unveiled by the Central
Election Commission (CEC) Friday.</P>
      <P>The results were found in the first large-scale public opinion poll on graft
practices conducted by a polling company commissioned by the CEC.</P>
      <P>Most of those surveyed said the practice of vote-buying in the presidential
election in 2008 was slight, but that vote-buying in the city and county council
member elections were serious.</P>
      <P>In other words, the more localized the election and the smaller the
constituency, the more rampant vote-buying was.</P>
      <P>The survey found that only about five percent of those polled found vote-buying
was serious in the 2008 presidential election, while nine percent said the
legislative elections in early 2008 and the city and county chief elections in
late 2005 were serious.</P>
      <P>But 13 percent said vote-buying in the last elections for township and city
leaders was worrisome.</P>
      <P>Less than one percent of those polled said that they would take bribes from
candidates and vote accordingly, while 12 percent said they would take the
bribes without voting for the candidates. Eleven percent said they would accept
the bribes and make their own judgment in choosing who to vote for.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that new approaches to bribe voters have made it hard to
tell whether it is bribery or not.</P>
      <P>Over 80 precent of the people surveyed would recognize that handing out cash,
coupons, sponsored trips or pilgrimages or subsidies for taking part in
promotional rallies were vote-buying.</P>
      <P>But only 75 percent said free banquets for constituents constituted vote-buying,
and only 70 percent said that subsidizing the activities of civic groups was
vote-buying.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that most people do not think that the practice of
entertaining voters with free pleasure trips or banquets is illegal.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between Dec. 17-20 on 2,011 people over age 20, with a
margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.</P>

      <P>Officials of Taiwan's National Palace Museum (NPM) and China's Shanghai Museum
provided details in Taipei Friday on the nine-point consensus reached during the
NPM director's recent visit to China and said that closer cooperation and
exchanges would be of mutual benefit.</P>
      <P>NPM Deputy Director Fung Ming-chu reiterated that the two museums have agreed to
cooperate in substantive ways without touching on sensitive designation and
legal issues.</P>
      <P>She said, for instance, that the two museums will set up a strategic partnership
to exhibit foreign collections in both museums while the collections are in Asia
to reduce expenses such as loan fees, insurance, and transportation costs.</P>
      <P>The two museums will also develop a reciprocal sales system to enable souvenirs
to be sold at each other's museum, Fung said. Officials from the two museums
will also visit each other on a yearly basis.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Shanghai  Museum Director  Chen Xiejun formally announced that his
museum will lend one set of its treasures -- colored enamel porcelains from the
period of the Qing Dynasty's Emperor Yongzheng -- to supplement the NPM's
exhibition on the emperor to be held in October.</P>
      <P>In the area of exchanges in cultural and creative industries, he said that both
museums could take advantage of local competitive edges -- Taiwan's research and
creativity combined with China's relatively lower manufacturing costs -- to
produce creative products.</P>
      <P>The four-member delegation from the Shanghai Museum is currently visiting Taiwan
following NPM Director Chou Kung-shin's recent ice-breaking trip to China, which
also included a stopover at the Palace Museum in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chou's historic visit to the NPM's counterpart in China marked the first
official contact ever between the two museums.</P>
      <P>The National Palace Museum in Taiwan holds more than 600,000 works of art, from
paintings to jades, and is recognized as having the leading collection of
Chinese art in the world.</P>
      <P>The items were removed from the Beijing Palace Museum in the 1930s to prevent
the collection from falling in the hands of the invading Japanese army. They
were later shipped to Taiwan when the Nationalists lost China's civil war to the
Communists in 1949.</P>

      <P>A court invalidated the election of Legislator Chiang Lien-fu, a member of the
ruling party Kuomintang from Taichung County, Friday on the grounds that he
engaged in vote buying.</P>
      <P>The Taichung District Court ruled that Chiang, who was caught on a video tape
offering NT$50,000 (US$1,431) to a local voter, Chen Lien-ji, before the
legislative election on Jan. 12, 2008, intended to buy Chen's vote with money.</P>
      <P>The court dismissed Chiang's argument that he was set up by his political rivals
and the money was meant for Chen to organize campaign rallies for him, rather
than as a reward for his personal ballot.</P>
      <P>The court's ruling was made in a case initiated by Chiang's Democratic
Progressive Party rival in that election, Chien Chao-dung.</P>
      <P>Chien made public the tape on Dec. 18, 2007 and requested the prosecutors
initiate a probe.</P>
      <P>As a result, Chiang was indicted by prosecutors on Jan. 29, 2008 for violating
the election law and for forgery, but was found not guilty by a panel of judges
of the Taichung District Court on April 30.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors had already appealed against the ruling in that case to the Taiwan
High Court.</P>
      <P>Chiang has vowed to appeal the court's decision Friday.</P>
      <P>He is one of five lawmakers whose election on Jan. 12, 2008 were challenged by
their political rivals.</P>
      <P>Among them only Lee Yi-ting a KMT member from Miaoli County has been stripped of
his legislator's status so far. His election was invalidated by the Taiwan High
Court, which has the final say in such cases.</P>

      <P>Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC), hit hard by the local recession, announced
plans Friday to streamline its operations, with 126 rides per week to be
suspended and chairwoman Nita Ing opting not to collect her monthly salary.</P>
      <P>Beginning March 16, weekly services will be reduced from 942 rides to 816 rides,
a cut of 13.37 percent. The move represents the first time the company has
reduced service since the high speed rail line was inaugurated Jan. 5, 2007,
THSRC said.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, two-way train service will be cut from 130-142 rides to 106-134
a day, according to a THSRC statement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ing will stop collecting her salary from this month because the
company's pay day falls at the end of a month. Beginning in March, monthly
salaries for 110 top executives will be cut by between 10 percent and 20
percent.</P>
      <P>The company said it currently has no plans to ask workers to take unpaid leave

    <HEADLINE>High court revokes ruling on ex-president's detention</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court revoked Friday a lower court's ruling keeping former
President Chen Shui-bian in custody before and during his trial on corruption
and money laundering charges and demanded that the lower court deliver a new
ruling in the case.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has been detained since Dec. 30, appealed his case to the high court
last Friday after the Taipei District Court rejected his request to repeal its
decision to detain him.</P>
      <P>Taipei District Court spokesman Chen Chun-ming said that once the court receives
the high court ruling, a panel of judges will decide when to open a new hearing
on the case.</P>
      <P>In revoking the district court's ruling to detain Chen, the high court stated in
its verdict that only those highly suspected of having committed major crimes
and show signs of fleeing the country or tampering with evidence as stipulated
in Article 101 of the Criminal Procedure Law should be detained prior to trial.</P>
      <P>In the former president's case, the verdict said the district court failed to
provide sufficient evidence to back its argument that Chen Shui-bian was very
likely to be involved in major cirmes and might flee Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife have been indicted on charges of siphoning off NT$104 million
(US$3.12 million) from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund during
his presidency from 2000 to May 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes in connection with a land
procurement deal and receiving kickbacks by helping a contractor win the tender
for a government construction project.</P>
      <P>The high court said the nature and reimbursement procedures of the Presidential
Office's discretionary fund remain unclear and require further examination
before it can be determined if Chen broke the law.</P>
      <P>As to Chen's role in the Lungtan land procurement deal, the high court said
prosecutors did not provide concrete evidence to prove their claim that Chen
collaborated with Lee Chien-mu, a former head of the Hsinchu Science Park
Administration who has confessed to taking bribes in striking the deal.</P>
      <P>Based on these arguments, the high court said the district court violated rules
of logic in reasoning that there was a strong suspicion that Chen committed
major crimes to justify its decision to keep Chen behind bars.</P>
      <P>The high court also questioned prosecutors' arguments that Chen had to be
detained because he was a flight risk.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors contended in their previous appeals seeking Chen's detention that
Chen might flee Taiwan because he had served as president for eight years, had
wired money abroad and might possessed a large sum of assets that have not yet
been confiscated, and many foreign  leaders  in similar  cases had fled abroad
to evade prosecution.</P>
      <P>The high court ruled, however, that such arguments were not enough to prove that
Chen could flee Taiwan if remaining free.</P>
      <P>The high court also said the district court needs to further investigate whether
prosecutors' accusations that Chen could tamper with or destroy evidence were
true.</P>
      <P>Chen was first taken into custody Nov. 12 as prosecutors prepared their case
against him. He was released after being indicted Dec. 13, but was jailed again
Dec. 30 when a new judge assigned to the case in the Taipei District Court
agreed with a prosecutors' request to hold him in custody.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court had previously revoked lower court rulings to free Chen
without bail.</P>
      <P>The district court began a new round of pretrial sessions earlier this week.</P>

      <P>Renowned film director Liu Jia-chang and his wife -- a former movie actress
under the stage name Chen Chen -- voluntarily returned to Taiwan from Hong Kong
Friday to face the law, as the two have been wanted on suspicions of embezzling
funds from two private art companies.</P>
      <P>Liu and his wife, Chang Chia-chen, have been on the wanted list since May 2007.
Immigration records show that they left Taiwan in 2001 for Hong Kong, with their
whereabouts unknown ever since.</P>
      <P>According to the National Immigration Agency, the couple informed judicial
authorities that they would return to Taiwan Friday to cooperate with
prosecutors' investigation regarding their involvement in a joint investment
case that ended with their partners accusing them of siphoning funds from their
two art companies.</P>
      <P>Liu, accompanied by his wife, showed up at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
with an expired Republic of China passport. They were questioned by immigration
officials at the airport and then transferred to the Public Prosecutors Office
of the Taipei District Court for further questioning concerning their alleged
offenses.</P>
      <P>Liu said that he and his wife decided to come back to face the law because
Taiwan's judicial system had returned to normal.</P>
      <P>He added that he and his wife's return to Taiwan is proof that they have full
confidence in the judiciary.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecutors, Liu and his wife raised NT$619.92 million
(US$17.71 million) from shareholders of two private art companies in August 1999
under the pretext of increasing the companies' paid-in capital.</P>
      <P>A month later, however, Liu used NT$693 million of the companies' funds to buy a
property worth only NT$388 million from his wife and wired the money to his
wife's foreign bank account.</P>
      <P>The transaction harmed the interests of Liu's partners and he had been
subpoenaed repeatedly by the prosecutors office to be questioned on the breach
of trust allegations.</P>
      <P>After repeated attempts to summon the couple to appear in court failed, the
Taipei District Court issued a warrant for their arrest, which was to remain
valid until Dec. 25, 2018.</P>
      <P>Liu, 68, was a well-known music composer before becoming a film director. He has
written nearly 2,000 songs, including 200 that became popular hits in the 1970s
and 1980s.</P>
      <P>His wife, 60, was an award-winning actress who divorced her first husband of two
years -- a movie actor in Hong Kong -- in 1976 and married Liu in 1978.</P>

      <P>The 16th round of fishery talks between Taiwan and Japan reached a consensus on
several issues, including an agreement to set up an emergency notification
mechanism to handle fishery disputes, an official of the quasi-official
Association of East Asian Relations (AEAR) said Friday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ming-yao, AEAR secretary-general, made the remarks after Friday's
conclusion of this round of talks, the first since July 2005.</P>
      <P>He said that both sides also agreed to set up a private consultation  channel,
with  Taiwan's  Provincial  Fisherman's Association  and Japan  Fisheries
Association  acting  as the organizations handling civilian cases, such as
collisions at sea, the impounding of fishing vessels and the tangling of fishing
nets.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan came to the negotiating table determined to safeguard the
sovereignty of its territory and jurisdiction over its territorial waters.</P>
      <P>"Both sides adopted a pragmatic attitude during the talks, " Tsai said, adding
that the talks had "focused on how to mitigate fishery disputes between Taiwan
and Japan and enhance information exchanges."</P>
      <P>The talks did not touch on the sensitive issue of the disputed waters near the
Tiaoyutai Islands, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan, in the East China sea,
Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Both sides agreed that the fishery disputes should be handled in a rational and
peaceful way without compromising the long-standing friendly and cooperative
relations between the two, he said.</P>
      <P>"To continue to advance friendly bilateral ties and mutual trust and narrow the
perception gap between the two, both sides also agreed to hold further
consultations if needed," he added.</P>
      <P>To efficiently handle a crisis, both sides agreed to set up an emergency
notification mechanism, Tsai said,  noting that such notification would normally
pass through the AEAR and Japan Interchange Association.</P>
      <P>But both sides agreed to set up other notification channels -- the Naha branch
of Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Japan, and Japan's
Fisheries Agency.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Tokyo have held 15 rounds of fisheries talks since 1996, with the
last round occurring in July 2005 in Tokyo, but sharp differences remain between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>In June last year, a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat, the Lienho, based in
Taipei County, collided with a Japan Coast Guard (JCG) vessel in the disputed
waters near the Tiaoyutai Islands.</P>
      <P>The Lienho sank after it collided with the JCG patrol vessel that was allegedly
trying to chase it out of the disputed Tiaoyutai waters.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese skipper and his two crew members were detained by Japanese
authorities for questioning after they and 13 Taiwanese recreational fishermen
who were on board the boat were rescued by the JCG officers.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese skipper accused the Japanese patrol of deliberately ramming his
boat and demanded that Japan compensate him for the damage to his vessel.</P>
      <P>The incident touched a raw nerve in the region, as the Tiaoyutai Islands in the
East China Sea are claimed by Taiwan, China, and Japan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>High court revokes ruling on ex-president's detention</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court revoked Friday a lower court's ruling keeping former
President Chen Shui-bian in custody before and during his trial on corruption
and money laundering charges and demanded that the lower court deliver a new
ruling in the case.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has been detained since Dec. 30, appealed his case to the high court
last Friday after the Taipei District Court rejected his request to repeal its
decision to detain him.</P>
      <P>Taipei District Court spokesman Chen Chun-ming said that once the court receives
the high court ruling, a panel of judges will decide when to open a new hearing
on the case.</P>
      <P>In revoking the district court's ruling to detain Chen, the high court stated in
its verdict that only those highly suspected of having committed major crimes
and show signs of fleeing the country or tampering with evidence as stipulated
in Article 101 of the Criminal Procedure Law should be detained prior to trial.</P>
      <P>In the former president's case, the verdict said the district court failed to
provide sufficient evidence to back its argument that Chen Shui-bian was very
likely to be involved in major cirmes and might flee Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife have been indicted on charges of siphoning off NT$104 million
(US$3.12 million) from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund during
his presidency from 2000 to May 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes in connection with a land
procurement deal and receiving kickbacks by helping a contractor win the tender
for a government construction project.</P>
      <P>The high court said the nature and reimbursement procedures of the Presidential
Office's discretionary fund remain unclear and require further examination
before it can be determined if Chen broke the law.</P>
      <P>As to Chen's role in the Lungtan land procurement deal, the high court said
prosecutors did not provide concrete evidence to prove their claim that Chen
collaborated with Lee Chien-mu, a former head of the Hsinchu Science Park
Administration who has confessed to taking bribes in striking the deal.</P>
      <P>Based on these arguments, the high court said the district court violated rules
of logic in reasoning that there was a strong suspicion that Chen committed
major crimes to justify its decision to keep Chen behind bars.</P>
      <P>The high court also questioned prosecutors' arguments that Chen had to be
detained because he was a flight risk.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors contended in their previous appeals seeking Chen's detention that
Chen might flee Taiwan because he had served as president for eight years, had
wired money abroad and might possessed a large sum of assets that have not yet
been confiscated, and many foreign  leaders  in similar  cases had fled abroad
to evade prosecution.</P>
      <P>The high court ruled, however, that such arguments were not enough to prove that
Chen could flee Taiwan if remaining free.</P>
      <P>The high court also said the district court needs to further investigate whether
prosecutors' accusations that Chen could tamper with or destroy evidence were
true.</P>
      <P>Chen was first taken into custody Nov. 12 as prosecutors prepared their case
against him. He was released after being indicted Dec. 13, but was jailed again
Dec. 30 when a new judge assigned to the case in the Taipei District Court
agreed with a prosecutors' request to hold him in custody.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court had previously revoked lower court rulings to free Chen
without bail.</P>
      <P>The district court began a new round of pretrial sessions earlier this week.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan, Japan agree to emergency notification mechanism</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 16th round of fishery talks between Taiwan and Japan reached a consensus on
several issues, including an agreement to set up an emergency notification
mechanism to handle fishery disputes, an official of the quasi-official
Association of East Asian Relations (AEAR) said Friday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ming-yao, AEAR secretary-general, made the remarks after Friday's
conclusion of this round of talks, the first since July 2005.</P>
      <P>He said that both sides also agreed to set up a private consultation  channel,
with  Taiwan's  Provincial  Fisherman's Association  and Japan  Fisheries
Association  acting  as the organizations handling civilian cases, such as
collisions at sea, the impounding of fishing vessels and the tangling of fishing
nets.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan came to the negotiating table determined to safeguard the
sovereignty of its territory and jurisdiction over its territorial waters.</P>
      <P>"Both sides adopted a pragmatic attitude during the talks, " Tsai said, adding
that the talks had "focused on how to mitigate fishery disputes between Taiwan
and Japan and enhance information exchanges."</P>
      <P>The talks did not touch on the sensitive issue of the disputed waters near the
Tiaoyutai Islands, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan, in the East China sea,
Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Both sides agreed that the fishery disputes should be handled in a rational and
peaceful way without compromising the long-standing friendly and cooperative
relations between the two, he said.</P>
      <P>"To continue to advance friendly bilateral ties and mutual trust and narrow the
perception gap between the two, both sides also agreed to hold further
consultations if needed," he added.</P>
      <P>To efficiently handle a crisis, both sides agreed to set up an emergency
notification mechanism, Tsai said,  noting that such notification would normally
pass through the AEAR and Japan Interchange Association.</P>
      <P>But both sides agreed to set up other notification channels -- the Naha branch
of Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Japan, and Japan's
Fisheries Agency.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Tokyo have held 15 rounds of fisheries talks since 1996, with the
last round occurring in July 2005 in Tokyo, but sharp differences remain between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>In June last year, a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat, the Lienho, based in
Taipei County, collided with a Japan Coast Guard (JCG) vessel in the disputed
waters near the Tiaoyutai Islands.</P>
      <P>The Lienho sank after it collided with the JCG patrol vessel that was allegedly
trying to chase it out of the disputed Tiaoyutai waters.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese skipper and his two crew members were detained by Japanese
authorities for questioning after they and 13 Taiwanese recreational fishermen
who were on board the boat were rescued by the JCG officers.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese skipper accused the Japanese patrol of deliberately ramming his
boat and demanded that Japan compensate him for the damage to his vessel.</P>
      <P>The incident touched a raw nerve in the region, as the Tiaoyutai Islands in the
East China Sea are claimed by Taiwan, China, and Japan.</P>

      <P>Renowned film director Liu Jia-chang and his wife -- a former movie actress
under the stage name Chen Chen -- voluntarily returned to Taiwan from Hong Kong
Friday to face the law, as the two have been wanted on suspicions of embezzling
funds from two private art companies.</P>
      <P>Liu and his wife, Chang Chia-chen, have been on the wanted list since May 2007.
Immigration records show that they left Taiwan in 2001 for Hong Kong, with their
whereabouts unknown ever since.</P>
      <P>According to the National Immigration Agency, the couple informed judicial
authorities that they would return to Taiwan Friday to cooperate with
prosecutors' investigation regarding their involvement in a joint investment
case that ended with their partners accusing them of siphoning funds from their
two art companies.</P>
      <P>Liu, accompanied by his wife, showed up at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
with an expired Republic of China passport. They were questioned by immigration
officials at the airport and then transferred to the Public Prosecutors Office
of the Taipei District Court for further questioning concerning their alleged
offenses.</P>
      <P>Liu said that he and his wife decided to come back to face the law because
Taiwan's judicial system had returned to normal.</P>
      <P>He added that he and his wife's return to Taiwan is proof that they have full
confidence in the judiciary.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecutors, Liu and his wife raised NT$619.92 million
(US$17.71 million) from shareholders of two private art companies in August 1999
under the pretext of increasing the companies' paid-in capital.</P>
      <P>A month later, however, Liu used NT$693 million of the companies' funds to buy a
property worth only NT$388 million from his wife and wired the money to his
wife's foreign bank account.</P>
      <P>The transaction harmed the interests of Liu's partners and he had been
subpoenaed repeatedly by the prosecutors office to be questioned on the breach
of trust allegations.</P>
      <P>After repeated attempts to summon the couple to appear in court failed, the
Taipei District Court issued a warrant for their arrest, which was to remain
valid until Dec. 25, 2018.</P>
      <P>Liu, 68, was a well-known music composer before becoming a film director. He has
written nearly 2,000 songs, including 200 that became popular hits in the 1970s
and 1980s.</P>
      <P>His wife, 60, was an award-winning actress who divorced her first husband of two
years -- a movie actor in Hong Kong -- in 1976 and married Liu in 1978.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Schengen countries mulling visa-free treatment for Taiwan citizens</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Germany and other Schengen Agreement countries are considering offering visa-
free treatment to Taiwan passport holders now that the United Kingdom has
decided to do so starting March 3, diplomatic sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese official stationed in Germany told the Central News Agency that the
German government is considering following Britain's lead in granting visa-free
privileges to Taiwanese citizens for short-term stays.</P>
      <P>"Voices of support are growing increasingly louder in German society and a
positive development is hoped for in the foreseeable future," said the official,
who refused to be identified.</P>
      <P>The official's remarks follow a recent statement by Maik Reichel, a German
Bundestag member, who said during a recent visit in Taipei that Germany's
Federal Ministry of the Interior is considering whether to follow the U.K. and
accord visa-free treatment to Taiwan passport holders.</P>
      <P>The British government announced Feb. 9 that it will waive visa requirements for
Taiwanese citizens for visits on business or for pleasure for up to six months,
effective March 3. Britain is the first major Western country to grant such a
privilege to Taiwanese nationals.</P>
      <P>According  to Reichel,  the German Institute --  Germany's representative office
in Taiwan -- issues about 70,000 visas to Taiwanese citizens annually.</P>
      <P>Germany is a member state of the Schengen Area -- a borderless zone created by
the Schengen Agreement that currently consists of 25 European countries.</P>
      <P>Schengen countries include European Union member states, such as France,  Italy
and Poland, as well as such non-EU states as Switzerland and Norway.</P>
      <P>Besides Germany, the official said, several other Schengen countries  are also
gauging the feasibility  of waiving  visa requirements for Taiwan passport
holders as the measure can help boost commercial and tourist exchanges.</P>
      <P>Guy Ledoux, director of the European Economic and Trade Office which represents
EU interests in Taiwan, said in a recent interview with the Central News Agency
that Taiwan's issuance of electronic passports and its expansion of visa-free
treatment for citizens from EU member states have laid the groundwork for the
European Union to discuss whether its member states should reciprocate.</P>
      <P>Schengen  countries  presently  offer three-month  visa-free privileges for
citizens from several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Singapore
and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty incorporated the Schengen Agreement into the mainstream of
European Union law. Two EU members -- Ireland and the United Kingdom -- do not
take part in Schengen's border control arrangements, but do participate in
certain provisions relating to judicial and police cooperation.</P>
      <P>According to the Taiwanese official, none of the Schengen countries  have
reached a final decision yet on the proposed visa-waiver  program  for  Taiwan
passport  holders  as  the decision-making mechanism inside the EU is rather
complex and may take a while.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is inviting international experts to take part in planning a proposed
Taoyuan aerotropolis to ensure that it meets world-class standards, Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA) Director-General Lee Long-wen said Saturday.</P>
      <P>A bidders conference scheduled for March 17 in Taiwan will be open not only to
local consulting firms, but also to those from Canada,  the United States, the
United Kingdom,  France,  the Netherlands, Germany, Australia, Japan and
Singapore, Lee said.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the Taoyuan aerotropolis project is the first of its kind in
Taiwan, and the government should not conjure it up "out of pure imagination"
but should instead heed the opinions of domestic and foreign experts.</P>
      <P>The consulting firm that wins the bid will be responsible for helping the
government collect information on the success and failure of similar projects in
other countries, analyze industrial and transportation development strategies,
and predict the future air traffic volume at Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The firm will also need to submit a proposal on the allocation of airport
resources, the use of surrounding land, and the development of peripheral
transportation networks, he added.</P>
      <P>The plan to develop the surrounding areas of the Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport into an aviation city is one of the "i-Taiwan 12 Projects, " a
centerpiece of the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>The project would involve the expansion of airport terminals and the
establishment of an aerospace industrial park and special zones for cargo,
passenger and logistics services.</P>
      <P>The bidding for the aerotropolis blueprint is expected to completed by the end
of April, with the successful bidder required to submit its final report by the
end of January 2010. The Cabinet is scheduled to complete its review of the
report by June 2010, according to the CAA.</P>

      <P>Headed by members of the Taiwan Association of University Professors (TAUP) ,
1,246 people sat in silence and spelled out the Chinese characters for "Never
Forget 228" in Taipei's Liberty Square to commemorate the 228 Incident of 1947.</P>
      <P>TAUP Chairman Chen Yi-sheng said the 228 Incident -- a brutal crackdown of a
popular uprising that began on Feb. 28, 1947 that left up to 30,000 people dead
-- concerns not only the family members of the victims but also Taiwan's society
as a whole.</P>
      <P>"Social reconciliation cannot be achieved if the historical truth of the
massacre that occurred some 62 years ago is not revealed," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He contended that Taiwan's people and the family members of the victims will
never rest until the people responsible for the 288 Incident are brought to
justice.</P>
      <P>"The TAUP urges all members of Taiwan's society, regardless of their political
leaning, to reflect on the issue to prevent history from repeating itself," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>The activity, which eschewed slogans and speeches, remained calm and peaceful. A
pre-recorded video of the events marking the brutal crackdown was shown to
remind the public of the historical tragedy that has affected Taiwan's society.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the chairman of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Huang Kun-huei told
reporters that he felt proud and honored to participate in the event and would
continue to contribute to the search for the historical truth of the 228
Incident.</P>
      <P>"Activities like these can promote social justice, human rights and peace,"
Huang said.</P>
      <P>He asserted that the people can forgive what the Kuomintang (KMT) has done in
the past but should never forget the "costly historical lesson."</P>
      <P>Asked about the government's decision to change the name of the Taiwan Democracy
Memorial Hall (where Liberty Square is located) back to its original name -- the
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall -- Huang said switching the hall's name back and
forth might cause anger in society, and he urged President Ma Ying-jeou's
administration to act prudently on the issue.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident was an anti-government uprising in Taiwan that was triggered on
Feb. 27, 1947 by a dispute between a government agent and a female cigarette
vendor.</P>
      <P>The government quickly cracked down on the spontaneous uprising and imposed
martial law and then negotiated with local elites for the next week.</P>
      <P>But when reinforcements from China arrived in Taiwan March 8, the troops were
dispatched over the next six weeks to kill and suppress local elites who were
calling for more local autonomy. Thousands of civilians also lost their lives in
the massacre.</P>

      <P>The government will continue to promote baseball in Taiwan by providing more
incentives and encouragement to interested companies and public enterprises,
Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Saturday.</P>
      <P>On a visit to the construction site of an international baseball stadium in
Taoyuan County, Liu said baseball has always been Taiwan's national sport and
that in the future the government will provide incentives to encourage local
companies and military units to contribute to the sport's growth.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, the Cabinet-level Sports Affairs Council (SAC) has already
developed a plan to stimulate the development of the national pastime, which
includes offering local companies, government organizations, and military units
incentives to help establish new baseball teams.</P>
      <P>"I'm happy to know that Taoyuan County is preparing to establish a Taoyuan
County aviation city baseball team, " Liu said, hoping that in the future local
baseball fans will have a chance to see the birth of even more new teams.</P>
      <P>"With the cooperation of local companies, government agencies, and the military,
we expect to see the establishment of at least 8 to 10 new teams in the near
future," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Though Liu did not specify if the teams to be added would compete at the amateur
or professional level, he suggested that the creation of more teams would bring
more fans out to ballparks and add to the sport's popularity.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County is currently building a new NT$980 million (US$28 million)
baseball stadium on a 9.7-hectare plot near the Taiwan High Speed Rail's Taoyuan
Station.</P>
      <P>Scheduled to be finished by the end of 2009, the stadium will have 12,000
infield seats, with room for future construction of outfield stands.</P>
      <P>After the stadium's completion, Taoyuan County will be able to host national and
international baseball tournaments.</P>

      <P>Asia's top judo players from over 25 countries will gather in Taipei in May to
compete in the second most important judo event on the continent, the
tournament's organizer said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Joan Wang,  secretary-general  of the Chinese  Taipei Judo Federation  in charge
of organizing  this year's  Asian Judo Championships, said that Taiwan's
14-member team, participating under the name of "Chinese Taipei," is expected to
capture one silver medal and four bronzes during the event.</P>
      <P>To win the five medals, however, Taiwan's women will have to overcome stiff
competition from South Korea, China and Japan, while the men will face even
bigger challenges from the three East Asian powers as well as Mongolia, Iran and
Uzbekistan, she said.</P>
      <P>Che Kuong-hon, the sports director of the Judo Union of Asia (JUA) who
concurrently heads the Macau Judo Association, said in Taipei that achange in
the ranking points system will spur teams to send their best athletes to the
championships.</P>
      <P>Unlike the past when ranking points from each tournament were credited to a
country to determine how many slots its athletes could secure in the Olympics,
they will now be credited to individual athletes, who will need to accumulate
points to qualify for major tournaments on their own.</P>
      <P>The race for ranking points forces the continent's top judo stars to compete at
all major events, Che said.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Taipei Judo Federation said it may offer free admission to the
championships, second only in importance in Asia to the Asian Games, to get more
people to cheer on home athletes. The championships will be held at Taipei Arena
May 23-24.</P>
      <P>Taiwan only won one bronze medal at last year's tournament, held in South Korea,
Wang said.</P>
      <P>As one of the founding members of the JUA, Taiwan hosted the event in 1970 in
the southern port city of Kaohsiung and won one silver and four bronzes at the
time, Wang added.</P>

      <P>The Chinese government will forbid its citizens from visiting casinos while
encouraging them to travel to Taiwan for pleasure, a top Chinese tourism
official said Saturday in the island county of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>"It is Taiwan's own business to legalize gaming. The mainland's law makes it
very clear that gambling is not permitted, " said Shao Qiwei, director of
China's National Tourism Administration.</P>
      <P>Shao made the remarks when asked by reporters  about the possibility of Chinese
citizens visiting Kinmen to gamble at casinos in the future.</P>
      <P>Kinmen, along with other Taiwan-held outlying islands such as Penghu and Matsu,
has become a potential site for Taiwan's first legal casino, following the
passage by the Legislative Yuan in January of an amendment to the statute
governing the development of outlying islands that permits the opening of
casinos on these islands.</P>
      <P>Leading a large delegation of tourism officials and travel industry
representatives from China's 30 major provinces, Shao is currently visiting
Taiwan to boost cross-Taiwan Strait tourism. He was scheduled to return to China
later Saturday via the ferry service between Kinmen and the Chinese city of
Xiamen.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan opened its doors to more Chinese tourists in July 2008 and
expanded the daily quota of arrivals to 3,000, Taiwan received only 300 Chinese
tourists per day on average during the six months to December.</P>
      <P>The average number has doubled to 600 people per day during the first two months
of this year, but it still remains far behind the target.</P>
      <P>In a bid to help increase the number of Chinese visitors to Taiwan, tourism
groups in Jiangsu and Shandong provinces have launched a campaign to promote
tours to Taiwan, with the goal of seeing 10,000 residents from each of the
provinces traveling to Taiwan between late February and June.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, more than 12,000 sales representatives of the direct selling company
Amway China will travel to Taiwan aboard cruise liners between March and May.</P>
      <P>The visitors, who will arrive separately in nine groups, will stop in the ports

    <HEADLINE>Finding 228 Incident truth best way to remember it: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou pleged Saturday to establish  a national memorial museum
that would continue  to investigate the truth behind the 228 Incident because
that would be the best way to commemorate the incident and mark the first step
toward achieving social reconciliation.</P>
      <P>Confronting history and discussing the issue, and facing victims' families and
putting ourselves in their shoes will greatly help social and ethnic
reconciliation, Ma said, speaking in Hoklo, at a memorial ceremony held by the
Taipei city government's Department of Cultural Affairs and Taipei 228 Memorial
Museum.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident refers to an uprising that began on Feb. 28, 1947, and resulted
in a brutal crackdown by Kuomintang (KMT) troops in March and April of that
year, leading to the deaths of as many as 30,000 people.</P>
      <P>Many other innocent people, including many elite members of society, were
blacklisted and suffered victimization.</P>
      <P>Noting that even though the tragedy occurred before he was born and even before
his parents came to Taiwan when the KMT retreated to the island in 1949 after
losing a civil war to the Communists, Ma said he felt the responsibility of
finding out the truth of the 228 Incident after he entered public service.</P>
      <P>When I was attending the national-level ceremony of the 228 Incident in
Kaohsiung earlier today, I was deeply touched by a clergyman who said to me that
I don't have the burden of original sin but rather the responsibility to unearth
the truth about the 228 Incident,the president said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the truth will be revealed eventually no matter how many years
have passed by, Ma said the memorial foundation of 228 will continue to operate
and pledged to establish a national 228 Incident memorial museum to investigate
the crackdown.</P>
      <P>Whatever cannot be done, is not dared to be done or is not feasible to be done,
I will do it if I have a chance, Ma said, reassuring members of the victims'
families that the government will shoulder the responsibility of finding the
truth.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the same occasion, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin noted that the Taipei
city government has worked to learn from the past and publicize the truth of the
228 Incident by establishing the memorial park and museum and holding over 40
exhibitions that have attracted over half a million visitors.</P>
      <P>He said everybody should learn from the tragic past and turn such a pain into
strength so that no one will repeat the same mistake.</P>
      <P>Tolerance, respect and reconciliation are the most important spirit of the 228
Incident and we must put them into practice to seek the greatest happiness for
Taiwan,Hau said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Swine Association, expert request halt to pig vaccine plan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based Swine Association strongly urged the government Saturday not to
vaccinate the country's pigs against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) , despite
outbreaks of the disease in central Taiwan earlier this month.</P>
      <P>The practice of vaccinating pigs against the disease had nearly been eliminated
in Taiwan by the end of last year, but with the recent outbreaks at two farms in
Yunlin and Changhua counties, the Council of Agriculture (COA) reportedly
intends to resume the practice nationwide.</P>
      <P>The COA Bureau of Animal and Plant Health declined to comment on the reports,
but said "it is about the science. We will make the final decision after talking
with the Swine Association and experts."</P>
      <P>Swine Association Chairman Pen Lien-chou said the reported move would  waste the
efforts  of the past 12 years to build  a "zero-vaccine" environment in Taiwan,
a key requirement needed to be designated as FMD-free by the Paris-based World
Organization for Animal Health (OIE).</P>
      <P>Pen urged the government to remain determined to wipe out the FMD virus and turn
Taiwan into an "FMD-free" country.</P>
      <P>Lai Shiow-suey, a professor in National Taiwan University's Department of
Veterinary Medicine, stressed that it is very important for Taiwan to become an
"FMD-free" country again in consideration of domestic pig farmers' benefits.</P>
      <P>Only by being declared "FMD-free" can Taiwan resume pork exports, which will
help raise local pig farmers' income and improve Taiwan's image and
competitiveness in the industry, Lai said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government devote the funds allocated to a renewed
vaccination campaign to paying pig farmers subsidies worth 80 percent of the
cost of pigs culled during sudden bouts with disease.</P>
      <P>That would encourage the farmers to report outbreaks earlier and make it easier
to eradicate the disease.</P>
      <P>Lai urged the government to continue to move toward the goal of eliminating all
FMD vaccines by March.</P>
      <P>Taiwan launched a program beginning in April 2007 to stop giving hogs anti-FMD
vaccines. Through the program, the proportion of pigs on the island not
receiving vaccines increased from 10 percent in 2007 to over 90 percent as of
November 2008.</P>
      <P>FMD vaccinations were expected to be terminated in March, but the schedule has
been disrupted due to the recent outbreak, Pen said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was first hit by FMD outbreaks in 1997, which forced the government to
cull 3.8 million pigs and delivered a heavy blow to Taiwan's pork exports.</P>
      <P>Taiwan once raised as many as 12 million pigs per year at its peak, with 7
million exported to Japan annually. Exports have stopped since the outbreak and
Taiwan now raises about 6.4 million pigs a year, mainly for local consumption.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The top European Union (EU) representative in Taiwan said Britain's  decision
to include Taiwan in its visa-waiver program will trigger a debate in the
Schengen area over the possibility of granting a similar visa exemption.</P>
      <P>What is clear is that the U.K. has granted a visa exemption for Taiwanese
citizens and I think that is probably going to bring members of the Schengen
area to assess the situation regarding Taiwan,said Guy Ledoux, head of the
Taipei-based European Economic and Trade Office (EETO) in a recent interview
with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>The British government announced Feb. 9 that it will waive visa requirements for
Taiwanese citizens who visit the U.K. on business or for pleasure for up to six
months, effective March 3.</P>
      <P>Britain is the first major Western country to include Taiwan in its visa waiver
program.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan and the EU have close economic and trade relations, Ledoux
said granting a visa exemption would probably be good for bilateral commercial
ties and would attract more Taiwanese tourists to visit Europe.</P>
      <P>I think it would be in the interest of Europe to work toward following the same
path as the U.K., the de facto EU ambassador to Taiwan said.</P>
      <P>He expressed reservations about the discussion of the issue in the EU, however,
saying that he was unclear about the agenda of meetings in Brussels at this
time.</P>

      <P>The Yeh family in Taiwan's island county of Penghu was bombarded with
congratulatory visitors and calls Saturday after it was announced that its four-
year-old boy had won a free year-long holiday on one of the archipelago's
uninhabited islands.</P>
      <P>Yeh Chien-wei, who was named a winner by Penghu County Magistrate Wang Chien-fa
in a lucky draw Friday, became the first of three special winners of the
vacation. The two other winners will be announced sometime in the future.</P>
      <P>The young Yeh, who had no idea what it means to win a big prize, was
nevertheless happy when he was told that he "will enjoy really fun water
activities."</P>
      <P>Yeh Sheng-chin, the boy's father, said that when Magistrate Wang called him
Friday night to tell him the good news, he thought it was some kind of a hoax
from a fraud ring.</P>
      <P>The prize drawing was an incentive to get people to spend their NT$3,600 in
consumption vouchers -- distributed to all of Taiwan's citizens starting on Jan.
18 -- in Penghu to boost the local area's economy.</P>
      <P>The boy will be entitled to spend three days and two nights per month for a
period of one year on the uninhabited island of Sianjiaoyu, which has become a
popular vacation spot in recent years after serving as the main setting for the
romance drama series "The Plain Summer."</P>
      <P>He will also be able to invite seven other companions to join him, with the
package covering ferry services, villa accommodation, romantic meals, waterside
activities and cruises to neighboring islands.</P>
      <P>But Yeh Sheng-chin said he was "beginning to worry" about how to use the special
prize.</P>
      <P>He said that the family has never been to the islet and it wants to go, but as
Yeh Chien-wei and his younger sister are young children, they probably cannot
stay on the islet for three days.</P>
      <P>If only the adults go, however, the children will be left at home, he said.</P>

      <P>More than 30 indigenous units belonging to 10 different tribes in Taiwan
released traditional "smoke signals" in unison Saturday to tell the government
that they are sovereign owners of their lands.</P>
      <P>The unified action was organized by the Taitung County-based Smoke Motion Union,
an indigenous rights group that held a similar protest last Feb. 28., to convey
the angry voices of indigenous peoples over the government's lack of respect for
their natural hunting and fishing rights on their traditional lands.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, a fire was lit at the union's headquarters at Chulu village in
Taitung County's Beinan township around noon. The fire sent dense smoke into the
air, announcing the beginning of the release of smoke by indigenous Amis on
Taiwan's eastern coast and other tribes residing in western Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Aside from the sending their smoke "signals, " some tribal units also held
concerts in their communities, using music and songs to urge the government to
respect their natural rights and sovereignty.</P>
      <P>In Taitung, a group of over 100 Pinuyumayan people marched along highway 26 from
Nantien to Shuhai townships, protesting against the possibility of a nuclear
waste depot being built on the Pinuyumayan's traditional lands in Nantien.</P>
      <P>Smoke Motion Union spokesman Mateli Sawawan said Feb. 28 is the day when the
country pays homage to victims of the 228 Incident, which inspired its
designation as the Day of Peace.</P>
      <P>However, the same justice the 228 Incident victims enjoy has never been granted
to indigenous people, who Mateli said have been the target of government
persecution administratively, judicially, and in the area of law-enforcement.</P>
      <P>"Indigenous people do not sense the coming of peace, " he added.</P>
      <P>Asked why they used smoke signals to send their message, Mateli explained that
releasing smoke was the traditional way for indigenous peoples to spread
warnings, especially when a tribal unit was in danger of being attacked.</P>

sports and outdoor/water sports equipment, according to TAITRA.</P>
      <P>Overseas exhibitors, including a delegation from China, will have their own
section at the trade fair.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the event is expected to attract approximately 1,000 overseas buyers
from 70 countries, including heavyweights from Mexico, India, United Arab
Emirates, South Korea, Japan and Poland, the organizer said.</P>
      <P>Several half- or one-day tours to major tourist attractions in Taipei and other
cities will also be available for a fee for foreign buyers to explore the
island's rich culture and natural beauty, TAITRA added.</P>
      <P>Similar to last year, the 2009 TaiSPO will again be held in conjunction with
Taipei CYCLE -- the world's 3rd largest bicycle show -- to broaden buyers'
business prospects. Taipei Cycle will be held in Taipei's Nangang Exhibition
Hall from March 17-20.</P>
      <P>With the two exhibitions overlapping on March 19 and 20, shuttle buses will be

    <HEADLINE>Local director urges youth to remember the 228 Incident through film</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>World acclaimed director Hou Hsiao-hsien encouraged Taiwan's youth on Saturday
to remember the 228 Incident through his 1989 film "A City of Sadness."</P>
      <P>The Lung Ying-tai Cultural Foundation hosted a screening of Hou's film at Taipei
City's Zhongshan Hall to encourage a new generation of Taiwanese to watch and
discuss the film and understand the history surrounding the events it depicts.</P>
      <P>"The film stirred up considerable controversy 20 years ago because its subject
matter examined the events surrounding the 228 Incident," the history of which
had yet to be disclosed, Hou said. "I wasn't surprised by the government's
negative reaction to the film."</P>
      <P>Martial law had only been lifted two years before he started to shoot the film
and many thought the depiction of violence and repression suffered by Taiwanese
at the hands of Kuomintang (KMT) soldiers would open up old wounds, Hou
recalled.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident refers to a popular uprising sparked on Feb. 27, 1947 when a
KMT soldier beat an elderly black-market vendor after she refused to hand over
the cigarettes she was selling.</P>
      <P>In the next two months, the government cracked down on those leading calls for
greater local autonomy and even independence, leaving up to 30,000 people dead.</P>
      <P>Though some potential viewers are turned off by the movie's length and complex
narrative, Hou stressed that young people should still think about the issues
the movie raises as it is a vital part of Taiwan's history.</P>
      <P>Hou's complex tale depicts one family's experiences during the period. The
eldest brother is murdered by a Shanghai mafia boss, the middle brother is
driven insane in a KMT jailhouse, and the youngest brother is a mute who wants
to flee to the mountains with his friends to fight in the anti-KMT resistance
movement.</P>
      <P>By the end of the film only the youngest brother remains alive to tell, in
writing, the story of his family's destruction.</P>
      <P>The film won the Golden Lion Award at the 1989 Venice Film Festival.</P>
      <P>Saturday's screening of the film and lecture titled "Lighting the Darkness --
Taiwan's Political Awakening" was the first in a series of discussions that the
foundation will hold to examine Taiwan's political, economic and social history
through the eyes of its artists.</P>
      <P>According to the foundation, popular actress Brigitte Lin will speak on March
21, followed by novelist and children's writer Huang Chun-ming on April 1.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will open a drought response center
Monday in anticipation of a possible water shortage this summer due to lower-
than-usual rainfall in the past two months, an official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen Shen-hsien, director-general of the MOEA's Water Resources Agency, made the
remarks after accompanying Premier Liu Chao-shiuan on a visit of Shihmen
Reservoir in Taoyuan County, a major source of potable water in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As February's rainfall was only 19 percent of the typical average amount, Chen
said, Shihmen Reservoir's water level has fallen far below the minimum supply
level.</P>
      <P>Given its dwindling water supply, Shihmen Reservoir has now cut its daily raw
water supply for industrial and household use to 1.2 million tons from the
original 1.7 million tons, Chen said, adding that the supply gap has to be
bridged by Feitsui Reservoir in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>As to water supply for agricultural use, Chen said his agency will discuss the
issue with relevant government departments and hopes to come to a decision next
week on whether to restrict water supply for farmland irrigation.</P>
      <P>Asked whether local farmers will be asked to leave their land fallow, Chen said
his agency will adopt a relatively conservative perspective in dealing with the
agricultural irrigation issue in order to ensure adequate water supplies for
manufacturers and households.</P>
      <P>If weather conditions permit, Chen said his agency would not rule out the
possibility of seeding clouds to induce rainfall.</P>
      <P>According to a decision reached at a meeting of officials from the water company
and farmland irrigation associations in the Taoyuan area on Friday, Shihmen
Reservoir will slash its water supply for agricultural irrigation by 25 percent
starting March 1 and cut water supply for household use by 10 percent starting
March 5.</P>
      <P>Shihmen Reservoir administration officials said the Taipei Water Department will
supply 380,000 tons of raw water to make up for the reservoir's shortfall.</P>
      <P>In addition to supply water for Taoyuan residents, Shihmen Reservoir also
provides raw water for the Bansin water purification plant, which supplies
drinking water for one-third of the population in Taipei County,  particularly
those residing in Banciao and Sinjhuang.</P>
      <P>During his visit to Shihmen Reservoir, Premier Liu said March's rainfall will
decide whether Taiwan will be gripped by a water shortage this summer.</P>
      <P>Liu said he has directed the Water Resources Agency and other water management
units to collaborate closely to ensure sufficient water supply for local
manufactuers and families as well as farmers in addition to fighting flooding
during the coming typhoon season.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will offer special incentives  to convince government
employees  to accept early retirement in tandem with its downsizing plan, a
senior official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Soong Yu-hsia,  deputy head of the Cabinet-level Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission, said the Examination Yuan -- the government branch in
charge of civil service management -- has drawn up a provisional draft statute
that would provide incentives to encourage early retirement of qualified civil
servants during a transition period to facilitate government restructuring.</P>
      <P>The provisional statute, along with a draft amendment to the Organization of
Central Administrative Agencies Basic Law, will be submitted to the Legislative
Yuan in mid-March for approval to pave the way for a sweeping government
reorganization, Soong said.</P>
      <P>Under the incentive statute, civil servants who agree to early retirement
provided they meet relevant requirements will receive an additional pension
payment of up to their seven months' salaries.</P>
      <P>"About 2,000 of the 182,000 civil servants on the government's current operating
payroll will be qualified for early retirement under the Executive Yuan's
restructuring plan," Soong said.</P>
      <P>According to the government's reorganization plan, around 10 of the Executive
Yuan's current 37 agencies will be eliminated, with their functions folded into
other bodies.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, Soong said, the streamlined government will come into
operation in 2011 and the provisional incentive statute will take effect June 1,
2010.</P>
      <P>Under the statute, those who have been in public service for 20 full years and
those who have been in service for 10 full years and reach 50 years of age or
older will be eligible to apply for early retirement.</P>
      <P>The statute is applicable to civil servants, contract government employees,
security personnel and janitors, but political appointees, faculty members and
administrative staff at public schools and employees of state-run enterprises
will be excluded from the privileges.</P>
      <P>According to the government's preliminary reorganization plan, the restructured
Executive Yuan will be composed of 13 ministries, eight councils and
commissions, three independent institutions, and four other bodies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Soong said the revised basic organic law will not specify the exact
number of agencies so that the Executive Yuan can maintain some flexibility.</P>
