    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: Reverse logistics center unnecessary</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>05/31/10  14:59:16
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Transportation  and Communications  Mao Chi-kuo recently proposed
that a reverse logistics center be set up in Kaohsiung  Harbor to enhance  the
port's competitiveness.  The feasibility and importance of this proposal
requires in-depth study and discussion.</P>
      <P>If the minister has hired professionals to assess the proposal's feasibility,
the first thing  they will look at is Taiwan's comparative advantages, including
its maintenance and logistics costs.</P>
      <P>Maintenance relies mainly on the labor force. With Taiwan's relatively high
wages, most maintenance will probably incur higher costs in Taiwan than in other
developing countries in the region. Taiwan is competitive only in maintenance
work that requires complex skills or expensive equipment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan does not enjoy an obvious competitive edge in terms of logistics costs,
either. Many people,  including President Ma Ying-jeou, have often claimed that
Taiwan is positioned in the center of East Asia, with the sailing time between
Kaohsiung and other major ports in the region averaging only 53 hours. However,
this comparison does not take into account the South Korean port of Busan and
the Chinese ports of Shenzhen, Qingdao, Ningbo, Guangzhou and Tianjin, all of
which can also be considered centrally located in terms of sailing times.</P>
      <P>We must recognize the fact that Kaohsiung does not have a particularly
advantageous geographical position, and biased figures should not be allowed to
mislead our future policy direction. (May 31, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECFA likely to be inked in June: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China will likely be
signed in mid-June if all goes smoothly, Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs
Huang Chung-chiou said at a legislative session Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang was responding to media reports that said the fifth round of talks between
Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
, and his Chinese counterpart, Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS) President Chen Yunlin, is scheduled to be held June 15-20 in
Shanghai.</P>
      <P>According to the United Daily News, Taiwan and China had planned to defer the
fifth Chiang-Chen meeting to July, but decided to hold the negotiations as
scheduled after most significant details were ironed out.</P>
      <P>The proposed trade pact will be the main focus of the fifth round of cross-
strait talks and is therefore expected to be signed during the meeting, Huang
said.</P>
      <P>Huang said talks on the pact's "early harvest lists" have entered the final
stage, but the content of the lists cannot be made public because negotiations
are still underway.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the trade pact will be signed by June 15, Huang said: "That is our
goal, and we will work toward achieving it."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang Chih-peng, director general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade, a
major negotiator on the ECFA issues during the previous rounds of unofficial
talks with China, said that the planning of the fifth Chiang-Chen meeting has
being handled by the SEF and ARATS and that he knows nothing about the details.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Shih Yen-shiang also said that he has not received any
information about the matter and refused to comment on what progress has been
made on the "early harvest lists."</P>
      <P>However, he said during a business forum that China has become the major
manufacturing center and the biggest consumption market in the world, and that
Taiwanese businesses with alliances to Chinese firms will see their value
boosted if the pact is signed.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwanese businesses in China have collaborated with their Chinese
counterparts for about 20 years, Shih said they can take advantage of their
standing in China to explore the vast Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will be the ideal partner for multi-national enterprises eager to venture
into the Chinese market, because of a shared culture and language, Shih added.</P>
      <P>The minister also said that the government plans to invest NT$24 billion (US$750
million) over the next five years to develop the cloud computing industry and
would spend NT$12.7 billion in research and development with the aim of creating
50,000 jobs and NT$1 trillion in turnover for the industry.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the administration has tried to help the manufacturing industry
generate NT$100 billion in production value, Shih said.</P>
      <P>He added that about half of information technology (IT) spare parts worldwide
are made in Asia, with the production value of the IT parts sector of Taiwan,
Hong Kong and China accounting for two-thirds of the total in Asia.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 1.07 percent Monday on active bargain hunting as
investors shrugged off a Wall Street fall at the end of last week, dealers said.</P>
      <P>Gains in other major regional markets, including Japan and South Korea, also
prompted investors in Taiwan to take advantage of recent heavy losses, leaving
behind worries about tensions on the Korean Peninsula, they said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index closed up 78.66 points at the day's high of 7,373.98, off an
earlier low of 7,292.54, with turnover at NT$67.93 billion (US$2.12 billion).</P>
      <P>The cement sector posted the biggest gains, up 1.33 percent, followed by the
paper sector's 1.18 percent, the construction sector's 1.17 percent, the
plastics and chemicals sector's 1.11 percent and the financial sector's 1.05
percent.</P>
      <P>The food sector closed up 1.01 percent, the machinery and electronics sector
rose 0.97 percent and the textile sector was 0.2 percent higher.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,489 stocks closed up and 1,168 down, with 363 unchanged.</P>
      <P>"After last week's heavy losses, investors tended to pick up stocks with
attractive valuations, in particular small and medium shares," President
Securities analyst Vickie Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said old-economy stocks remained the favorites of bargain hunters.</P>
      <P>She said investors rushed to buy cement and construction stocks after the
government announced a three-stage plan to expand Taipei's Songshan Airport to
accommodate more passenger and cargo flights.</P>
      <P>"The airport expansion plan could boost demand in the cement and construction
sectors, as well as dress up their bottom lines, " Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Universal Cement gained 1.80 percent to NT$14.15 and Taiwan Cement added 1.30
percent to NT$27.35.</P>
      <P>Dacin Construction gained 6.76 percent to NT$18.15 and Hung Poo Real Estate rose
2.69 percent to NT$41.95.</P>
      <P>China Airlines closed up 4.23 percent at NT$14.80 on hopes that growing demand
for cross-strait air links will boost its earnings, dealers said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President advocates restraint in exercising power</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The late U.S. President Thomas Jefferson, who advocated soft power, would have
nodded in his tomb if he heard President Ma Ying-jeou saying Monday that those
with power should know restraint when exercising it.</P>
      <P>Paraphrasing Jefferson's quote of 1815 that "the less we use our power, the
greater it will be, " Ma made the comments during a meeting with the
representatives of the Judges Association of the Republic of China (Taiwan) at
the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>He told them he has in the past expressed reservations about appeals from
several civic groups to preside over judicial reforms by setting up a committee
under his office.</P>
      <P>"I don't want to make the Office of the President a supreme executive
organization," the president said.</P>
      <P>Under the Constitution, the president is chief of state, while the premier heads
the government.</P>
      <P>Judicial reform such as the protection of human rights does not always require
legislation or promulgation by the president. It can sometimes simply be a case
of setting precedent, said the president, who holds a doctorate in law from
Harvard.</P>
      <P>However,  the president complained that his reluctance  to interfere with the
judiciary is often held up by critics as evidence that he is "spineless."</P>
      <P>"My efforts to keep the judiciary free from interference have sometimes not gone
down well with those who do not see eye to eye with me on the meaning of
justice," Ma observed.</P>
      <P>The president  touted his administration's  efforts to end investigators'
illegal eavesdropping,  adding that eavesdropping should only be conducted when
absolutely necessary and legal.</P>
      <P>Ever since investigators have had to seek court approval to carry out
eavesdropping, the numbers of eavesdropping applications have fallen
significantly, he said.</P>
      <P>The president also promised to support the association's bid to host the 2011
annual conference of the International Association of Judges (IAJ).</P>
      <P>Noting  that the IAJ is one of only a few international non-government
organizations to which the country has been admitted under its official name of
Republic of China, the president said Taiwan can use the occasion to enhance its
international profile and showcase the independence of its judiciary.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Almost third of job seekers encounter fraud: survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 30 percent of job seekers said they had encountered fraud, with young
females the most common victims, according to the results of a recent survey.</P>
      <P>Of 1,085 job seekers who responded to a poll by 1111 job bank, 32.58 percent
said they had encountered dishonest employers, and of those who reported the
experience, the average person had run into the problem twice.</P>
      <P>Two surveys were conducted by the job bank from May 13-28, with one focusing on
dangers that job seekers face and the other on what companies value during
recruitment.</P>
      <P>The most problems were reported in the service sector and the information
technology industry, with people seeking sales, trade and management positions
the most likely targets.</P>
      <P>The biggest problem job seekers face is that their actual work does not fit the
description advertised or what was discussed in interviews. If they discovered
the fraud, 55.45 percent said they would decline the offer right away. Some
54.46 percent of those who had the experience said it had affected their
confidence in applying for other jobs.</P>
      <P>More than 60 percent said they would take measures to prevent the problem, such
as looking for information about the companies before an interview or declining
an interview in an odd location.</P>
      <P>According to the other survey of 384 companies, 97.6 percent said punctuality is
important in their hiring decisions, and 79.64 percent said they expect
applicants to provide detailed cover letters describing themselves along with
their resumes. Some 53 percent said the resume should include a photo of the
applicant.</P>
      <P>Top reasons companies gave for rejecting applicants included supplying a false
resume, being late for an interview and knowing nothing about the job.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed 33.63 percent of the companies have experience with
applicants who don't show up for interviews. Some 36.53 percent of companies
said they would not give a second chance to candidates who don't show up for an
interview without an excuse or those hired who fail to report to work.</P>

    <HEADLINE>French, Taiwanese photographers record Taiwan's contrasts</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>05/31/10  16:49:01</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>What are the differences in the photos taken by a French and a local
photographer?</P>
      <P>One such French photographer is Eric Rechsteiner, a freelancer based in Tokyo
who has spent more than seven years collecting the faces of Taiwanese people
with his camera and who has recently been searching for a Taiwanese publisher to
publish a series of photos as part of a project titled "Facing Taipei."</P>
      <P>Asked why he chose to come to Taiwan, the photographer could not explain the
exact reason. "Probably because I am from Japan, I feel Taipei is a place with a
combination of new and old, a relaxing and serious atmosphere, which is what
caught my eye the first time I came here about 12 years ago," he said.</P>
      <P>"Since then, I have come to Taiwan almost every year, and it is like a second
home to me now," he told CNA in an interview.</P>
      <P>Since he cannot speak Mandarin, Rechsteiner communicates with people here using
his cameras. Asked how many photos he has taken, he replied simply: "Too many to
count."</P>
      <P>Looking at his pictures, there is one of a little boy praying in the temple,
while others show a grandmother bathing a baby in a basin on the street, a
couple having their wedding photos taken by the Tamsui River and many others,
all of which reflect the contrasts of a city that is modern but still has a
great deal of older areas, as well as the contrasts in the relaxed yet sometimes
rather serious expressions on his subjects' faces.</P>
      <P>Shooting Taipei for so many years, Rechsteiner worries that the old Taipei is
gradually disappearing, just as with other Asian cities. "The past is important,
but those old brick houses in Taipei have been gradually vanishing in recent
years," he said.</P>
      <P>Compared with Rechsteiner's work, a Taiwanese photographer shows another side of
Taiwan, in that most of her photos over the last seven years have been taken in
the southern and western parts of Taiwan or on the outlying islands such as
Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>"I have taken over 200,000 photos in almost seven years, " said 20-year-old Shen
Hsin-ling, a sophomore at National Tsing Hua University who has already held
exhibitions in Taipei and Beijing in 2008.</P>
      <P>She records the lives of farmers and poor people, most of whom live in
southwestern Taiwan, and her purpose is to reveal their difficulties and their
needs to the public.</P>
      <P>Growing up in Yunlin County, in the central part of Taiwan, Shen has been
involved in charity work since she was 12.</P>
      <P>She has helped her hometown to promote agricultural products using the Internet
and has also established a free website to teach children, work that has brought
her many awards and honors.</P>
      <P>"The reason I record people's lives in remote areas of Taiwan is because I am
planning to set up a database for people here in the future," she told CNA.</P>
      <P>Asked why, Shen said it is because she has witnessed many of the senior
generation passing away and wonders what the situation will be 10 years from
now, "so I felt I could not hesitate any more and that I had to do something."</P>
      <P>During her shooting trips, she said, she prefers chatting with local people,
trying to understand their lives and telling their stories with her photos.</P>
      <P>Among her photos is one titled "Red Envelope." She said she will never forget
that story. "It was an old woman in the countryside many years ago. I saw her
and greeted her, whereupon the woman smiled at me and told me she received `a
red envelope' today, " Shen said.</P>
      <P>I thought at first that she had probably won the lottery or received a gift that
day, but instead, her answer was that one of her thumbs was bleeding, " she
said, adding that the woman, an oyster farmer, had cut her thumb while working.</P>
      <P>The old grandmother told that it was nothing and that she was happy just to have
the ability to work and earn money to support her family.</P>
      <P>"I have many stories about things that have happened on my journeys and I will
keep taking photos to illustrate those stories, " Shen said, adding that she
will publish her photos next year in an effort to speak out for those vulnerable
groups in society. Photo Nos. 43, 44 (By Sunnie Chen, CNA staff reporter)/J .</P>

      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will kick off a series of rallies in
Kaohsiung on June 5 to promote a national referendum on a proposed trade pact
with China, DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said Monday.</P>
      <P>A "made in Taiwan" market fair featuring locally made products and craftwork
will be held at Glory Pier in the afternoon before the rally, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, elected DPP officials, academics and experts will
review the current administration's performance as well as address the economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) in the evening, Tsai added.</P>
      <P>The events are expected to attract 10,000 participants, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's Referendum Review Committee is slated to meet on June 3 to
decide whether a referendum proposal initiated by the DPP and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) conforms to legal requirements.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chi-chang expressed hope that members of the committee will ensure people's
rights to express their will through a referendum and not to use political
maneuvering or bureaucracy to hinder them.</P>
      <P>He added that because the ECFA is crucial and will lead to a large
redistribution of wealth in Taiwan, the government should allow the public to
participate in discussions and the decision-making process.</P>
      <P>In a protest against the government's plan to complete the signing of the
proposed  ECFA with China in June,  the TSU, pro-independence groups and former
Premier Frank Hsieh held anti-ECFA sit-ins and speeches around the country
earlier in the month.</P>
      <P>The government says the proposed ECFA will boost economic growth in Taiwan and
prevent the island from being marginalized, but critics have said it will lead
to job losses and could make Taiwan too economically dependent on and
politically vulnerable to China.</P>

      <P>Taiwan did not renege on a tacit agreement to solve the Lafayette frigate case
dispute with France as has been reported and will not opt for a mediated
solution in the future, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The ministry said in a statement that it has not made contact with French
defense contractor Thales over a possible out-of-court settlement and that it
would resolve the case based on the law.</P>
      <P>"We insist that the dispute be solved in accordance with the verdict of the
International  Court of Arbitration  under the International Chamber of
Commerce," the MND said.</P>
      <P>The ICC court on May 3 ordered contractor Thales and the French government to
pay a penalty of more than US$591 million to Taiwan for paying commissions on
the sale of six Lafayettte-class frigates to the country's Navy in 1991, in
violation of the contract on the deal.</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times reported Monday that because Taiwan reneged on a consensus
that the commission dispute would be solved out of court, France is closing down
its military liaison office under its de facto embassy in Taiwan, the French
Institute in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-language newspaper also said that as part of an out-of-court
settlement, France had agreed to sell new weapons to Taiwan, help raise the
technical levels of the Lafayette frigates and French-made Mirage jet fighters,
and offer more technical services to Taiwan's military.</P>
      <P>The MND denied the report, saying it was completely off base. It said that
logistics, technical maintenance and personnel training related to the Lafayette
frigates and Mirage fighters have proceeded smoothly and normally according to
existing contracts.</P>
      <P>If the contracts were violated, Taiwan's military could sue the French
suppliers, the MND statement said.</P>
      <P>The court case was launched in 2001 by Taiwan's Navy to investigate claims that
much of the US$2.8 billion paid for the warships were for commissions to
middlemen, politicians and military officers in Taiwan, China and France, in
violation of Article 18 of the procurement contract.</P>
      <P>The court gave its ruling only this year.</P>
      <P>Thales and the French government, which would be liable for nearly 75 percent of
the overall penalty because of its critical role in the contract, were expected
to have to pay a total of up to US$861 million when interest, litigation fees
and other expenses were added in, according to a Navy attorney.</P>
      <P>Thales issued a statement on May 3 saying that the company will fight the
ruling, including requesting the Paris Court of Appeals to revoke it.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Ko Kuang-yueh,  deputy secretary-general of the National Security
Council, said at a legislative meeting Monday that although France is closing
down its military liaison office in Taiwan in July, the French government will
come up with a better substitute plan.</P>
      <P>"Existing exchange programs, including military and technical support and
services will not be affected, " Ko said at a hearing of the Legislature's
Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee.</P>
      <P>Also speaking on the issue at the meeting, Foreign Minister Timothy Yang said
the Lafayette arbitration was a business issue and would not have any adverse
impact on bilateral relations between Taiwan and France.</P>
      <P>Yang said it remains to be verified whether the French government will indeed
close its military liaison office in Taiwan in July.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Timothy C.T. Yang said Monday that a Japanese plan
to redraw its air defense identification  zone (ADIZ)  west of its Yonaguni
Island  is "unacceptable."</P>
      <P>The decision to refuse to approve the Japanese plan was made jointly by his
ministry and the Ministry of National Defense, Yang told the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>"Although Japan can redraw the zone unilaterally according to its own laws, as
Japan's next door neighbor to the west, we have to make our stance clear to
Japan," Yang said.</P>
      <P>Yonaguni, Japan's westernmost territory and the last of the Ryukyu chain of
islands, lies just 108 km off Taiwan's east coast.</P>
      <P>Yang said Taiwan's Association of East Asian Relations, which is in charge of
dealing with Japan in the absence of diplomatic ties, relayed Tokyo's plan to
Taipei May 21.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, the ADIZ 12 nautical miles west of Yonaguni will be moved a
further two nautical miles west toward Taiwan in June, following a request by
residents of the island.</P>
      <P>"Japan should consult with Taiwan about the move, which will affect Taiwan's air
defenses. We have made known to Japan that its plan is unacceptable," Yang said.</P>
      <P>Turning to the tension on the Korean Peninsula triggered by the March 26 sinking
of a South Korean warship by North Korea, the minister accused North Korea of
damaging stability in Northeast Asia.</P>
      <P>He said the ministry has issued a grey travel alert for South Korea and a orange
alert for North Korea, and is working on plans to evacuate Taiwanese there.</P>
      <P>Under the Foreign Ministry's four-level alert system, grey represents no
perceived danger, while an orange alert suggests that people should avoid
traveling to the region in question and to be on high alert if travel is
unavoidable.</P>

      <P>Hsu compared the booming market in men's cosmetics to Taipei's tallest building

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der said Monday that the government's finances are
tight but remain stable and that the debt to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio
remains at an acceptable level.</P>
      <P>Lee said the current debt to GDP ratio is still within the acceptable 40 percent
level, adding that rising debt means the government finances are tight, but not
intolerable.</P>
      <P>Outstanding  government debt totals NT$4.2 trillion (US$131 billion), or about
32 percent of GDP, and the figure is expected to rise to NT$4.5 trillion next
year or 35 percent of GDP, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee said that as the government spends the next couple years repaying part of
its debt for several special budgets, including NT$120 billion for
reconstruction after the Typhoon Morakot battered the island in August 2009, the
debt level is expected to fall accordingly.</P>
      <P>He did not elaborate on how much debt the government will repay over the next
two years.</P>
      <P>Lee made the comments as he answered questions in a legislative session that
reviewed a proposed amendment to the Value-Added and Non-Value Added Business
Tax Act.</P>
      <P>He said raising debt for government operations is similar to the strategies many
companies adopt to meet their day-to-day financial needs.</P>
      <P>The Alliance for Fair Tax Reform has accused the administration of cutting taxes
by more than NT$700 billion since President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May
2008, imposing a heavy burden on the government.</P>
      <P>Lee said the government had only cut around NT$70 billion and that the
alliance's accusation was groundless.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee said that negotiations on a cross-strait taxation agreement are
still under way, but that it could take several years for Taiwan and China to
reach a consensus before signing a taxation agreement.</P>
      <P>He added although both sides failed to sign any taxation agreement in the fourth
round of cross strait talks at the end of last year, it did not mean the
negotiations had broken down.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH planning a surcharge on alcohol</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  May 31 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) has begun drafting a law to control the harmful
use of alcohol that would authorize "health" surcharges on alcohol and require
bottles of liquor to carry warning labels, DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Yaung said he would support the legislation but expected it would be tougher to
prevent alcohol abuse than the hazards from smoking cigarettes.</P>
      <P>"Drinking mildly may not harm one's health but alcoholism or abusive drinking is
a big problem, " he said during a hearing at the Legislature's Social Welfare
and Environmental Hygiene Committee.</P>
      <P>The bill, he said, would only be proposed after a series of public hearings are
held nationwide and society reaches a consensus on the drive to combat alcohol
abuse.</P>
      <P>The health minister also suggested that the DOH cooperate with the John Tung
Foundation -- a nonprofit organization dedicated to public welfare in Taiwan
that spearheaded the no-smoking campaign -- to use its clout in promoting the
anti-alcohol campaign.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chiou Shu-ti, director-general of the DOH's Bureau of Health
Promotion, said that according to practices abroad, imposing alcohol taxes or
surcharges  is an effective way of reducing alcohol-related abuse.</P>
      <P>Chiou said measures aimed at lowering alcohol hazards abroad vary but include
the imposition of alcohol taxes according to the liquor's proof and minimum
price schemes.</P>
      <P>Nothing similar has been finalized yet in Taiwan, and Chiou said some experts
have even suggested that alcohol surcharges can be levied in accordance with the
Health Promotion Act, making an alcohol hazards prevention bill redundant.</P>
      <P>During a meeting of the World Health Assembly (WHA) in Geneva on May 21, Chiou
extended Taiwan's support for a WHA strategy to reduce the harmful use of
alcohol.</P>
      <P>The WHA passed a resolution to reduce the harmful use of alcohol by,  among
other things,  regulating  advertising,  encouraging abstinence, imposing limits
on the availability of alcohol and offering treatment for heavy drinkers.</P>
      <P>She also said Taiwan will follow World Health Organization guidance to enact a
law to help achieve those goals, including levying  "health"  charges  and
adding  health  warnings  to alcohol-related containers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Warning labels not the solution to reduce choking in children: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  May 31 (CNA)
05/31/10  20:05:00
(By Jenny W. Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) said Monday that mandatory cautionary labeling on
food items is not the solution to lowering the incidence of choking among
children in Taiwan, but agreed that more education is needed to raise awareness
of the issue.</P>
      <P>Last month, an eight-month-old girl died, allegedly after choking on a konjac
jelly candy -- a popular children's snack in Taiwan that can be easily sucked
out whole from a plastic cup the size of a coffee creamer and can lodge intact
in a child's windpipe.</P>
      <P>In April, a six year-old died after a small fish ball became stuck in his
airway, and at around the same time, a 78 year-old man lost his life when he
choked on a piece of unchewed lychee.</P>
      <P>Although the government does not maintain figures on food choking-related
deaths, the media reports similar cases almost every year.</P>
      <P>Since 2005, the DOH has required all mini konjac jelly cup makers to put labels
on the packaging warning that the sweets should not be given to children under
5.</P>
      <P>However, other items that are easy to choke on, such as hot dogs, popcorn, raw
carrots and nougat are not subject to the mandatory labeling.</P>
      <P>In the United States, the American Academy of Pediatrics is now urging the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) to require warning labels on foods that are known
as choking hazards and calling on manufacturers to redesign some of their most
dangerous food products.</P>
      <P>According to the U.S.-based group, in 2000, 160 children there died from
obstruction of the respiratory tract.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's FDA Deputy Director Feng Jun-lan pointed out that all food, if
not consumed properly, can be a potential choking hazard and that it therefore
would be impracticable to require warning labels to be placed on every single
food item.</P>
      <P>"What really matters is the size and the design of the food item itself and not
the type of food. We are still doing research on the issue but the most
important thing is not mandatory labeling but increasing public awareness of
potential choking hazards," she said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Pediatric Association Executive Director Lee Ping-ing said that although
warning labels can be useful, some parents are just not vigilant enough on what
their children put in their mouths.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive nationwide effort from the DOH, the Ministry of Education, and
the Bureau of National Health, even down to the media, is needed in order to
raise public awareness of the danger of food that is easily choked upon.</P>
      <P>However, Kuo Yun-ting, chief of the pediatric department of Taipei Medical
University Shuang-ho Hospital, advocated mandatory labeling, saying that more
should be done to warn parents about items that are potential choking hazards.</P>
      <P>"I cannot predict how effective such labels would be, but the more warnings we
give to parents, hopefully, the lower the chance of their children choking on
food," he said.</P>

      <P>Computex Taipei, the world's second-largest computer trade show, will not see a
big increase in the number of international visitors this year, despite the
recovering global economy, the organizer predicted Monday.</P>
      <P>"We don't expect a huge increase in the number of international visitors this
year for two reasons, " said Moses Yen, executive director of the exhibition
department of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>TAITRA is the semi-official trade promotion body that, along with the Taipei
Computer Association, co-organizes Computex, now in its 30th year.</P>
      <P>He said that flight tickets are very expensive at present, as well as being the
beginning of the peak vacation season.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at a press briefing the day before the opening of Computex
Taipei for a five-day run.</P>
      <P>Yen's deputy, Jeremy Horng, said fear of another repeat of the volcanic eruption
in Iceland that threw European air travel into chaos several weeks ago is
another reason.</P>
      <P>"Unexpected volcanic eruptions make people reluctant to plan their trips early,"
he told reporters at the press briefing.</P>
      <P>Horng, however, said he does expect a rise in the number of pre- registration
international buyers this year, as that number for this year has already
surpassed 11,000.</P>
      <P>"Last  year,  we had fewer  than  10,000  pre-registration international buyers,
while 34,000 foreign buyers turned out at the event," he noted.</P>
      <P>Asked if the European debt crisis and the tension on the Korean Peninsula have
caused an impact on participating companies, Horng said that on the contrary,
more than 100 companies are still on the waiting list to take part in the event.</P>
      <P>"Our problem is that we do not have enough space at the venue, " he said.</P>
      <P>Horng noted that a new hall will open in 2013 in Taipei, which will provide
space for at least an additional 2,500 booths.</P>
      <P>Consumers cannot buy products at Computex as companies use the event to showcase
their products that are to be launched in the near future, but overseas buyers
can use the event to place orders for these products, he said.</P>
      <P>Consumers will have to wait until early August to buy the products at the Taipei
Computer Applications Show, Horng noted.</P>
      <P>Computex this year has a record 1,715 manufacturers presenting their products
and technologies in 4,861 booths. The booth number is up 8 percent from last
year's figure.</P>
      <P>This year,  the products highlighted will include e-reader devices, cloud-
computing technologies, 3D displays and various computer peripherals.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese inmates at a high-security prison in Bangkok do not have it easy,
suffering from malnutrition and isolation, but once a year their spirits are
lifted by visits of volunteer dentists from back home.</P>
      <P>Dentists Huang Chun-fung and Yang Chung-ho recently returned from this year's
mission to Bangkok, in which they provided free dental treatment to Taiwanese
jailed at the Klong Prem Central Prison.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwanese inmates suffer from dental problems, Huang said, primarily
because of long-term malnutrition and the lack of access to proper medical care.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, he and Yang had plenty of work on their recent trip,
cleaning and extracting teeth, performing root canal procedures, and teaching
their patients about oral hygiene.</P>
      <P>But what they did and said may have had less of an impact than simply showing
up.</P>
      <P>"When they heard me speaking Taiwanese, they all felt homesick, " Huang said.
"Sometimes,  giving them mental comfort was more significant than the dental
treatment."</P>
      <P>Yu Ting-chen, chairperson of a Taipei County-based association of family members
of Taiwanese inmates in Thai prisons, said most inmates who returned home after
completing their sentences in Thailand suffered from serious dental problems.</P>
      <P>Some had even loss many of their teeth, Yu said, attributing the problem to
"different water, diet and language."</P>
      <P>"If Taiwanese are affected with dental problems in Thai prisons, they usually
have to endure the pain for three to six months before having a chance to get
treated," Yu noted.</P>
      <P>She expressed gratitude to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in
Thailand -- Taiwan's de facto embassy in the country -- for sending physicians
to Thai prisons every year to provide free services to Taiwanese inmates.</P>
      <P>It was the second time since 2008 that Huang, who runs a dental clinic in Taipei
County's Banciao, and Yang, from Makong in Penghu County, volunteered to make
the journey.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 200 Taiwanese imprisoned in Thailand, mostly for drug
trafficking and financial fraud.</P>
      <P>The TECO has offered free medical treatment to the Taiwanese inmates every year
since 1998 as part of the services it provides to overseas compatriots.</P>

    <HEADLINE>e-dictionary preserves dying indigenous languages, cultures</HEADLINE>

      <P>An e-dictionary of the languages and cultures of Taiwan's indigenous people has
been compiled to help preserve indigenous mother tongues and collective memories
that are quickly dying out, the Ministry of Education said Monday.</P>
      <P>The MOE urged people, particularly Taiwan's aborigines, to take advantage of the
e-dictionary, which can be found on the Web site http:
//citing.hohayan.net.tw/default.asp.</P>
      <P>The ministry said the reference work would help users reinforce, learn or revive
these dying languages and cultures before it is too late. It covers the mother
tongues of 14 indigenous mountain tribes and the Pingpu plains (low-lying areas)
aborigines.</P>
      <P>The e-dictionary also has sections on 16 cultural subjects, including  religions
and worship,  myths and legends,  social organizations and functions, languages
and philology, archeological sites and relics, and history.</P>
      <P>The need for the e-dictionary  on indigenous cultures was highlighted by the
eye-opening visit to Taipei of a member of the Tao (Yami) tribe on Orchid
Island, located about 49 nautical miles off Taiwan's southeastern coast.</P>
      <P>The Tao man, known as Chou Lung-fa in Chinese, was in Taipei to collect his
prize money after winning a contest to quit smoking. But what shocked people had
nothing to do with giving up cigarettes.</P>
      <P>Instead, in accepting the award, Chou spoke in the Tao language because he
"didn't know how to speak Mandarin Chinese, " a rare phenomenon  at a time when
most indigenous people in Taiwan, particularly younger generations, don't speak
their mother tongues.</P>
      <P>Even on Orchid Island, where the Tao have lived in relative isolation from
ethnic Chinese for over 800 years after migrating from Batan, the Philippines,
the tribe's language has only been well preserved in two of the six villages on
the island.</P>
      <P>In other villages, the language is dying out, with only elders speaking it.</P>
      <P>By linguistic or philological classification, both the Tao dialect and the Batan
dialect belong to the Batanic language group, a subgroup of the Malayo-
Polynesian group of Austronesian languages, the MOE said.</P>
      <P>According to Robert Blust,  a prominent linguist with the University of Hawaii's
Department of Linguistics, the Formosan languages form nine of the 10 primary
branches of the Austronesian language family, making them a vital resource.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's indigenous languages, however, are dying out because of cultural
assimilation, according to National Dong Hwa University in Hualien, which was
one of the compilers of the e-dictionary.</P>

      <P>ASUSTeK Computer Inc. (Asus), a leading Taiwanese computer maker, unveiled its
answer to the iPad called the "Eee Pad, " which it said was expected to hit the
market in the first quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>Coming with either a 10-inch or 12-inch screen, the Eee Pad has an embedded
virtual keyboard and can also be fit into the socket of a specially  designed
keyboard,  turning  the  product  into  a quasi-desktop, the company said.</P>
      <P>Asus also showcased a tablet with a 10-hour battery life, called the "Eee

      <P>The government's stance on a proposed referendum on a trade pact currently being
negotiated with China is that it should not be a question put to a referendum, a
ranking official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The official, who asked for anonymity, made the point three days before the
Referendum Screening Committee under the Executive Yuan is due to decide on
whether a referendum proposal initiated by the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) can be a valid one.</P>
      <P>The TSU has proposed a referendum asking "do you agree that the government
should sign an economic cooperation framework (ECFA) with China?"</P>
      <P>The official noted that during a public hearing on the proposed referendum May
27, representatives from both the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said that the pact will involve mainly the
issues of "taxes" and "investment," and therefore, cannot be made into a
referendum proposal.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the pact, which the government hopes to sign in June, will be subject
to the monitoring of the legislature and therefore has no need for a referendum.</P>

      <P>State-owned Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp. (TTL) was showered with honors at
the prestigious Monde Selection awards this past weekend, winning dozens of
medals and five special trophies for its beer, spirits, cigarettes, and
cosmetics.</P>
      <P>TTL received a total of 43 medals, including 10 grand gold medals -- the highest
possible honor -- and 17 gold medals. The other 16 were silver and bronze
medals.</P>
      <P>TTL Chairman Wei Po-tao and Vice President Lin Tzann-feng were at the award
ceremony in Wiesbaden, Germany Sunday to collect the awards on behalf of the
company -- Taiwan's biggest maker and distributor of alcohol and cigarettes.</P>
      <P>"The awards are expected to help TTL further open markets in the United States,
Japan, Southeast Asia and mainland China, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>The Monde Selection awards represent a seal of quality for TTL products because
the quality screening standards in Europe, known for prioritizing environmental
protection and food hygiene, are regarded as stricter than those in the U.S.,
Lin said.</P>
      <P>Aside from its haul of medals, TTL also received "International High Quality
Trophies" for its canned Gold Medal Taiwan Beer, Yulu Burdock Wine, Vinata
Essence Intense Hydration Anti-Wrinkle cream, Vinata Night Cream Revival Anti-
Wrinkle cream, and Long Life Classic cigarettes.</P>
      <P>The trophy is given to products that have received grand gold or gold medals for
three consecutive years.</P>
      <P>Monde Selection, founded in Belgium in 1961, is considered one of the most
important food and beverage certification institutions in the world. It screens
the quality of more than 2,000 different products from over 80 countries every

    <TEXT>
      <P>For those politicians in power or ready to come to power, the year-end mayoral
elections in five special municipalities represent just five more political
opportunities to gain power, or five more springboards to future national-level
elections.</P>
      <P>To the residents of these five metropolitan areas, however, what matters is
whose leadership will be the most favorable to their well-being.</P>
      <P>As the formula to distribute revenue among localities has not been revised, the
problem of funding shortages is expected to continue  despite these districts'
upgraded status as special municipalities. If roads cannot be repaired properly,
schools cannot turn on their lights, and administrative efficiency cannot be
enhanced despite the upgrade, what difference does it make if all the political
superstars get elected?</P>
      <P>If the mayoral elections  are the precursor  of the 2012 presidential race, then
the two major political camps must not overlook the other localities besides the
five holding elections. Nobody would want to be treated as a second-class
citizen. We hope the blues and greens, besides seeking victory, will present a
vision to contribute to Taiwan's overall development. (June 1, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Commercial Times: Need for reflection on tax reforms</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/01/10  11:22:44
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"Increasing taxes" was a consensus shared by Japan, Australia and New Zealand
when they recently unveiled plans for fiscal reforms. This idea, however, is a
political taboo in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Over the past 18 months since a tax reform committee was set up by the
administration of President Ma Ying-jeou, a number of tax cuts have been
announced, including lowering the gift and estate tax rates to 10 percent, and
dropping the corporate income tax rate to 17 percent.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, many items that would contribute to the fairness and
soundness of the tax system were put aside, such as plans to abolish income tax
exemptions for military personnel and public school teachers and to impose an
energy tax and luxury housing tax.</P>
      <P>Such reforms can simply be described as "cuts only, no hikes." It is predicted
that tax revenue as a percentage of Taiwan's gross domestic product will hit a
record low of 11.3 percent in 2011. The figure will probably be the world's
lowest as well.</P>
      <P>Despite such a major fiscal crisis, the administration has been engaging in some
under-the-table dealings, such as seeking to evade the government debt ceiling
and using unprofessional bookkeeping tricks to try to cover up its budget
deficits.</P>
      <P>From the examples of Japan, Australia and New Zealand, we can see that tax
reforms must be considered as a comprehensive package. In Taiwan, what is
lacking is the determination and fortitude of our policy-makers, rather than
professional know-how. (June 1, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A string of daytime gunfights among gangsters in Taichung City streets recently
prompted the National Police Agency to order the deployment of 40 SWAT team
members in the central city Monday.</P>
      <P>It was the fourth time in the past 11 years that special service police members
have been stationed  in Taichung to help with maintaining law and order in the
central city.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>With public order out of control in Taichung City, the National Police Agency
(NPA) decided Monday to have 40 SWAT team members stationed in the central city
to deter criminal rings from engaging in street gunfights again.</P>
      <P>Hu Mu-yuan, director of the Taichung City Police Bureau, said the SWAT team will
conduct spot checks of major streets around the city day and night in a high-
intensity campaign to deter organized crime and improve public order.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu admitted that the recent spate of street shootings in
broad daylight were ominous signs that the city's public order was getting out
of control.</P>
      <P>Hu said he hopes the deployment of SWAT team will help deter the recurrence of
similar incidents.</P>
      <P>The mayor said that since assuming office nine years ago, he has spared no
effort to clamp down on illegal businesses in the city. To date,  he added,  the
number of illegal businesses  in eight controversial lines of business has
dropped from 399 to eight.</P>
      <P>In fact, Hu said, the city's public order has improved steadily, and he is not
sure where exactly the problem lies. (June 1, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>There have been a series of shooting incidents in Taichung in recent months.
During a question and answer session at the Taichung City Council, several city
councilors grilled Mayor Hu on what has gone wrong with the city's public order.</P>
      <P>Over the past nearly nine years, the councilors said the city's police budget
has increased from NT$3 billion to NT$5 billion and the number of police
officers has expanded from 2,500 to 4,052.</P>
      <P>But many city dwellers are still haunted by daylight gunfights on the city's
streets, the councilors said. Every time, shooting incidents happen, they said,
the mayor tends to declare a war on gangsters or organized crime, but those
declarations have not shown satisfactory results.</P>
      <P>The city councilors,  including  Chen Shu-hua,  Chang Liao Wang-chien and Ho
Ming-chen, said the mayor should consider stepping down and let somebody else
deal with the issue. (June 1, 2010). United Daily News:</P>
      <P>On city councilors' demand that he resign to take the blame for Taichung's poor
public order, Hu rejected the idea, saying his resignation would amount to
surrendering to criminal rings.</P>
      <P>"We will work to the best of our ability to prevent a recurrence of similar
shooting incidents, " Hu said, adding that to him, every bullet fired by
gangsters was like a shot at him.</P>
      <P>Taichung City Police Bureau chief Hu Mu-yuan said the city's criminal incidence
rate used to double the national average six years ago, but the ratio already
dropped to the national average last year. Since progress has been made, he
said, the city police force will redouble efforts to make further improvements.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Discounting a Liberty Times report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
late Monday that the French government has not yet finalized a decision to close
down its military liaison office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued Monday evening, the MOFA said the French government has
told Taiwan that based on budgetary and personnel considerations,  it is
downsizing  its overseas representation, including the military liaison office
under its de facto embassy in Taiwan, the French Institute in Taipei.</P>
      <P>But the ministry said France has not finalized the plan.</P>
      <P>"It is a French internal matter, and the MOFA will not comment on when the
military liaison office in Taiwan will be closed down, " the statement said.</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times reported Monday that because Taiwan reneged on a consensus
that the commission dispute involving the sale of six Lafayette-class frigates
would be solved out of court, the French government has ordered that the
military liaison office in Taiwan be closed down in July.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-language newspaper also said that as part of an out-of-court
settlement, France had agreed to sell new weapons to Taiwan, help raise the
technical levels of the Lafayette frigates and French-made Mirage jet fighters,
and offer more technical services to Taiwan's military.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense denied the report the same day, saying it was
completely off base. It said that logistics, technical maintenance and personnel
training related to the Lafayette frigates and Mirage fighters have proceeded
smoothly and normally according to existing contracts.</P>
      <P>The International Court of Arbitration under the International Chamber of
Commerce on May 3 ordered French defense contractor Thales and the French
government to pay a penalty of more than US$591 million to Taiwan for paying
commissions on the Lafayette frigate sale to Taiwan's Navy in 1991, in violation
of the contract on the deal.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Timothy Yang also said Monday that the Lafayette arbitration
was a business issue and would not have any adverse impact on bilateral
relations between Taiwan and France.</P>
      <P>Yang said it remains to be verified whether the French government will indeed
close its military liaison office in Taiwan in July.</P>
      <P>Contrary  to  Yang's  remarks,  Ko  Kuang-yueh,  deputy secretary-general of the
National Security Council, said at a legislative meeting Monday that although
France is closing down its military liaison office in Taiwan in July, "the
French government will come up with a better substitute plan."</P>
      <P>"Existing exchange programs, including military and technical support and
services will not be affected," Ko said.</P>

      <P>Some 6,000 employees of enterprises run by the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) are expected to join a planned demonstration in Taipei Wednesday to
demand that a law that fails to clearly define their status be amended.</P>
      <P>Pan Hsin-chung, the spokesman for the Taiwan Electric Power Labor Union (TPLU),
said Tuesday that more than 4,000 TPLU members will be present  in the parade
to appeal  for the revision  of the "Administrative Law of State-Run
Enterprise."</P>
      <P>"All we want is that our status is clearly classified because right now we are
neither public servants nor corporate employees, "Pan said.</P>
      <P>Over 13,000 people at state-run utility Taipei Power Company (Taipower) are so-
called "fake public servants" who are "public servants with the status of
employees," according to Pan.</P>
      <P>They are not eligible for pensions paid in monthly installments or savings
accounts with a preferred interest rate of 18 percent, as is the case for most
civil servants, and they are not covered under the new labor insurance pension
plan that took effect Jan. 1, 2009, Pan said.</P>
      <P>Under the Labor Standards Act passed in 1984 to protect workers' rights and
benefits, state-run company employees are offered the choice to preserve their
public servant insurance or to transfer to the labor insurance program.</P>
      <P>Those who choose to be covered under the public servant insurance program are
considered to be "public servants with the status of employees." Currently there
are over 40,000 workers at state-run enterprises who hold this status.</P>
      <P>TPLU executive member Chiu Wen-chang, a worker at the Taipower Dalin Thermal
Power Plant in Kaohsiung City, said the union has issued a call for all its
members to join the parade.</P>
      <P>The protesters will set off from the Legislative Yuan, walking to the Control
Yuan on Zhongshan South Road to deliver their petition, Chiu said.</P>
      <P>They will then head to Qingdao East Road, Linsen South Road and Jinan Road
before returning to the legislature.</P>
      <P>Most TPLU members, from managers and department directors to grassroots workers,
have expressed support for the parade, Lin said.</P>

      <P>According to the paper, Lee "did not deny" Lai's comment, and the minister said

      <P>An official with Taiwan's embassy in Guatemala was taken hostage at gunpoint
Monday in the country's capital but managed to escape after drawing out the
situation and getting help from local police, multiple sources said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Shyo-shiun, deputy director of Taiwan's Technical Liaison Office in
Guatemala, was abducted by a group of armed youths while he was driving to work.</P>
      <P>But he was later freed after police chased the kidnappers to an area just
outside Guatemala City, according to an AFP report.</P>
      <P>An embassy spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Central News
Agency by phone that Lin helped his cause by not upsetting the armed men.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman and details released by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, the two kidnappers sat in the front seat and ordered Lin to sit in the
back, setting off the car's alarm.</P>
      <P>Fearing that the noise would irritate the gunmen and make them trigger-happy,
Lin offered to move behind the wheel so he could silence the alarm.</P>
      <P>Just as the men were changing positions in the car, a police car passed by. The
officers were alerted by the strange movement in Lin's car and ordered it to
pull over, according to the spokesman, who did not specify if there was a chase
as reported.</P>
      <P>Fearing that if the police discovered they had interrupted a kidnapping, a
gunfight would be unavoidable, Lin told the police that the two men were his
friends, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>The police remained suspicious, however, and asked the three men to step out of
the car.</P>
      <P>The police searched them and found that all was clear -- the gunmen having left
their guns in the car -- but Lin whispered to the police that he was kidnapped,
leading them to arrest the kidnappers and allow him to escape.</P>

      <P>Acer Inc., the world's largest notebook computer vendor, is expected to expand
its reach in the Greater China area through a newly announced bond issuance
plan, analysts said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Acer is expected to take advantage of its global strength to penetrate the
emerging Greater China market, with a focus on the mainland, " said Edward Chen,
vice president of the Research Department at First Capital Management.</P>

      <P>The company said its board of directors has approved the bond sale proposal.</P>

      <P>Acer was not immediately available for comment on the Founder acquisition
reports, but Chen said the scenario was plausible.</P>
      <P>"As the world's largest notebook computer vendor, Acer's market share in China
is not significant at all. I do not rule out the possibility," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen said Acer now has about NT$33 billion (US$1.03 billion) in cash on hand,
and the bond issues are expected to further boost the company's capacity for
future development.</P>
      <P>"Regardless of whether Acer buys Founder or not, the cash to be raised is
expected to create about NT$100 billion in production value for the company. I
am very positive about the bond sale," he said.</P>
      <P>In the first quarter, Acer accounted for seven percent of China's notebook
computer sales, making it the fifth largest notebook computer vendor in that
market. Founder trailed with a four percent market share.</P>
      <P>Acer and Founder signed a memorandum of understanding last week that will give
the Taiwan-based  company  access to Founder's comprehensive distribution
network to sell its products.</P>
      <P>Acer had previously said it will introduce a new notebook computer exclusively
tailored to Chinese consumers by the end of this year, after the company listed
China's market as its top marketing priority.</P>
      <P>Henry King, an analyst at Goldman Sachs (Asia) said earlier that the cooperation
with Founder is expected to help Acer reach its goal of boosting its market
share in China to 10 percent by the end of 2010.</P>
      <P>Mars Hsu, an analyst with Grand Cathay Securities, agreed that the funds Acer is
raising will be used to strengthen its presence in China but said an acquisition
of Founder may not be Acer's purpose.</P>
      <P>"Acer wants to go deeply into China's tier four to six cities, which have
populations of no more than 20,000, and it is a huge task that requires a lot of
money," he said.</P>
      <P>Hsu said Acer is also likely to acquire smartphone production capacity with the
new funds as the company has been eager to diversify into that business.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan welcomes China's further opening to tourist exchanges: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
06/01/10  15:11:06
(By Lee Shu-hua and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The people of Taiwan, regardless of their party affiliation, should welcome
China's further opening to tourist exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) spokesman Su Jun-pin said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Taipei office of the Beijing-based Cross-Strait Tourism Association (CSTA)
announced the previous day that China will allow residents of six remote areas
-- Gansu and Qinghai provinces and the autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia,
Tibet, Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uyghur -- to visit Taiwan for pleasure, with
effect from July 18.</P>
      <P>They are the last batch of Chinese administrative districts to lift restrictions
on travel to Taiwan by their residents. In July 2008, the China government
formally began allowing citizens in 13 provinces and large metropolises to visit
Taiwan for vacation purposes.</P>
      <P>Responding to the CSTA announcement, Su said he believes Taiwan's two major
political camps -- the KMT-led "pan-blue" camp that favors closer ties with
China and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) -led "pan-green"
camp that advocates Taiwan's separate statehood -- should welcome China's
decision to fully open its doors for its citizens to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CSTA Taipei office Director Fan Guishan said in a recent interview
with the Chinese-language United Daily News that with the lifting of the travel
restrictions in China, the annual number of Chinese tourist arrivals in Taiwan
will break the 1 million mark soon.</P>
      <P>In the period July 2008 to April 20 this year, the total number of Chinese
tourists to Taiwan had exceeded 1 million, according to the latest CSTA tallies.</P>
      <P>The CSTA is a quasi-official organization authorized to handle tourist exchanges
with Taiwan in the absence of official ties, and its Taipei office is the first
office of any kind to be established by China in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To get a better understanding of Taiwan's travel environment, Fan said, he plans
to lead CSTA staff on an islandwide tour soon, focusing on the attractions of
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Southern Taiwan is known as a traditional  pan-green camp stronghold.</P>
      <P>On the appeal by some Taiwanese tour operators for China to allow its citizens
to make "individual visits" to Taiwan, Fan said Chinese authorities are studying
the feasibility of the proposal.</P>
      <P>"The issues being studied include mode of travel, issuance of documents,
experimental procedures, and problems that may arise during individual travel,"
Fan said.</P>
      <P>However,  there  is no timetable  for concluding  such an arrangement, Fan said.
If individual visits are allowed, they will start with residents of major
cities, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 1.14 percent Tuesday on profit taking after the
market moved closer to the nearest technical resistance level of around 7,400
points, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index closed down 84.65 points at 7,289.33, off a low of 7,276.52
and a high of 7,348.56 on turnover of NT$69.54 billion (US$2.17 billion).</P>
      <P>A total of 1,176 stocks closed lower and 949 higher, while 300 were unchanged.</P>
      <P>The market opened 0.64 percent lower as investors pocketed the gains posted in
the previous trading sessions, and the downtrend continued until the end of the
session on lingering concerns over the debt problems in Europe, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The plastics/chemical sector suffered the heaviest losses, dropping 2.0 percent,
followed by the financial sector, which fell 1.9 percent, and the textile
sector, which lost 1.7 percent.</P>
      <P>The construction and food sectors each closed 0.9 percent lower, while the
machinery/electronics and paper sectors each lost 0.8 percent and the cement
sector 0.7 percent.</P>
      <P>In the plastics sector, Nan Ya Plastics shares fell 2.46 percent to NT$51.60 and
Formosa Plastics dropped 2.17 percent to NT$63.20 on concerns over falling
product prices, dealers said.</P>
      <P>Among financial stocks, Cathay Financial dropped 2.74 percent to NT$46.15 and
Fubon Financial decreased 1.50 percent to NT$36.15.</P>
      <P>The touch panel sector bucked the downside on introduction of new tablet
computer models at Computex Taipei, the world's second largest computer
exhibition which opened Tuesday, with Young Fast Optoelectronics finishing up
6.68 percent at NT$244.00.</P>
      <P>"The market moved in thin trade on a lack of new leads. After the bourse posted
gains for four sessions in a row, it was time for profit taking," MasterLink
Securities analyst Tom Tang said.</P>
      <P>Tang noted that while the market had risen in the previous sessions, trading
volume failed to expand. This indicated that not many investors were willing to
chase prices, he said.</P>
      <P>"Amid uncertainty over the European debt crisis, keeping cash on hand could be a
smart strategy at the moment," he said.</P>
      <P>Tang said the market was basically in consolidation mode and can be expected to
move in a narrow range over the next few sessions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied the existence of a military liaison
office in Taiwan in a press briefing Monday after Taiwanese media reported that
the office has been closed over the handling of a warship sale dispute.</P>
      <P>According to the Web site of the French Foreign Ministry, its spokesman denied
the existence of a military liaison office under the French Institute in Taipei,
which represents French interests in Taiwan in the absence of bilateral
diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>"We do not have a military liaison office in Taipei. There are no changes
foreseen in the French Institute in Taipei, " the French Foreign Ministry
spokesman said in response to a reporter's question.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-language Liberty Times newspaper reported Monday that the French
government ordered that the military liaison office in Taiwan be closed down in
July because Taiwan reneged on a pledge to settle a dispute  over commissions
paid on the sale of six Lafayette-class frigates in 1991 out of court.</P>
      <P>The French Institute in Taipei told the Central News Agency Monday that it had
no comment on the matter.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Navy brought the case to the International Court of Arbitration under
the International Chamber of Commerce in 2001, and on May 3, the court ruled
against French defense contractor Thales, which was Thomson-CSF, when the sale
was made.</P>
      <P>The court ordered Thales and the French government, which had a major stake in
the contract, to pay a penalty of more than US$591 million to Taiwan for paying
commissions on the US$2.8 billion sale to Taiwan's Navy, in violation of the
deal's contract.</P>
      <P>Asked about the French government's position, James Chang, a spokesman for
Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) , said Taiwan was informed as early
as last year by French authorities of the closure of the office because of
budgetary and personnel considerations.</P>
      <P>He did not deny the existence of such an office.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Timothy Yang said Monday that it remains to be verified whether
the French government will indeed close its military liaison office in Taiwan in
July.</P>
      <P>He described the Lafayette arbitration process as a business issue and said it
would not have any adverse impact on bilateral relations between Taiwan and
France.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Quanta Computer Inc. (Quanta) and the Minnesota-based 3M Touch Systems,
Inc. (3M) jointly announced Tuesday a business alliance to expand collaboration
on touch-enabled technology and applications.</P>
      <P>"We value 3M's 25 years of experience in developing  and manufacturing touch
screen electronics, firmware and sensors to help meet the current and future
interactive needs of our customers," said C.C. Leung, vice chairman and
president of Quanta, the world's largest manufacturer of notebooks and other PC
related products.</P>
      <P>Quanta currently offers customers a touch solution based on 3M propriety
components, Leung noted during the announcement at Computex Taipei, Asia's
largest computer trade show.</P>
      <P>Soon, Quanta will offer portable devices, including notebooks, netbooks, and
other consumer electronic applications that will employ a range of 3M technology
solutions with single and multi-touch capabilities, Leung said.</P>
      <P>"The advantage of projected capacitive technology (3M PCT) is that it allows for
true multi-touch, and we can handle up to 40 (finger multi-touch inputs), " said
Herve Gindre, vice president and general manager of 3M Electronic Solutions
Division.</P>
      <P>"I think this is pretty much the best product in the market place right now, "
Gindre added, referring to its fast response time of 0.5-0.7 nanosecond.</P>
      <P>Quanta has been using the multi-touch  technology  in its All-in-One (AIO) PCs,
and is expected to release multi-touch tablet PCs in the latter half of the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) announced Tuesday a new promotion offering
deeper discounts to frequent travelers, but passengers purchasing the tickets
will not be able to reserve their seats.</P>
      <P>The company said an existing promotion, offering passengers discounts of either
15 percent or 35 percent (usually for off-peak travel) on designated seats
daily, will be replaced by the new program when it is launched on July 1.</P>
      <P>Under the new promotion, passengers can get a 15 percent discount on eight rides
or a 52 percent discount for unlimited rides between two specific stations on
the high-speed line, but all travel must be completed within 30 days.</P>
      <P>Passengers can buy the discounted tickets for 27 different sections along the
345-kilometer line, not including Taipei to Banciao.</P>
      <P>The bullet train now stops at eight stations -- Taipei, Banciao, Taoyuan,
Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi, Tainan and Zuoying.</P>
      <P>Under the new 52 percent discount promotion, a 30-day unlimited pass for non-
reserved travel between Taipei and Hsinchu will cost NT$8,230, nearly NT$3,000
less than the NT$11,100 currently charged based on the 35 percent discount.</P>
      <P>THSRC also said the new discounted tickets will be able to be used on national
holidays and weekends, unlike discounted tickets under the current plan.</P>
      <P>Although the 52 percent discount targeting commuters appears attractive, THSRC
recommended that only those who take the train daily should take advantage of
the deal.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, starting July 1, the company will also increase its scheduled trains
892 per week from the current 879, with the additional trains to be operated
during peak hours.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Computex Taipei, the world's second largest computer trade show, saw a record
attendance of Chinese exhibitors on its opening day Tuesday, reflecting efforts
by Taiwan and China to forge closer trade and commercial ties.</P>
      <P>"The number of participating Chinese companies jumped 179 percent and the number
of booths rose 151 percent, " said Wang Chih-kang, the chairman of the Computex
co-host Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), said in his opening
address.</P>
      <P>A total of 106 companies from China are taking part in the show's special cross-
Taiwan Strait section, occupying 171 booths, he noted.</P>
      <P>Last year was the first time TAITRA worked with its Chinese counterparts,
including the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, in setting
up the section.</P>
      <P>Computex, now in its 30th year, also grew marginally in other areas because of
the global economy's recovery, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The number of exhibitors edged higher, to 1,715 from 1,712, and the number of
booths has risen 8 percent to 4,861, from 4,498 last year, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Despite competition from Chinese exhibitions, Computex remains Asia's largest
computer trade show, generating US$20 billion in business every year, and is
critical to Taiwan's economy because of the importance of the country's ICT
industry.</P>
      <P>"The information and communications technology (ICT) industry has become
Taiwan's biggest economic backbone over the past 30 years, "said John Hsuan, the
convener of the Taipei Computer Association (TCA) that co-hosts Computex.</P>
      <P>The industry in Taiwan has an annual output value of US$200 billion, Hsuan said.</P>
      <P>Before  Hsuan  thanked  the  government  for  providing  a business-friendly
environment, a group of workers staged a protest against heads of major high-
tech companies and accused them of making profits from sweatshops.</P>
      <P>Holding photos of corporate heads on posters, the protestors shouted slogans
including "No more sweatshops, I want happiness back."</P>
      <P>The targeted heads included Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs, Terry Gou, the chairman
of Taiwan's Hon Hai Group (also known as Foxconn Technology Group) that makes
Apple Inc.'s popular products, and Cher Wang, the chairwoman of HTC Corp., a
leading Taiwanese smartphone maker.</P>
      <P>Gou's company has recently faced serious scrutiny after more than 10 workers at
its Foxconn complex in southern China jumped to their deaths, reportedly because
of too much pressure on the job.</P>

      <P>An official with Taiwan's embassy in Guatemala was taken hostage at gunpoint
Monday in the country's capital but managed to escape after drawing out the
situation and getting help from local police, according to the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>Lin Shyo-shiun, deputy director of Taiwan's Technical Liaison Office in
Guatemala, was abducted by a group of armed youths while he was driving to work.</P>
      <P>But he was later freed after police chased the kidnappers to an area just
outside Guatemala City, according to an AFP report.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman James Chang said at a press briefing that the incident was a
random kidnapping case and that Lin was not hurt and appeared to be in good
condition.</P>
      <P>An spokesman from Taiwan's embassy in Guatemala, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told the Central News Agency by phone that Lin helped his cause by
not upsetting the armed men.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman and details released by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, the two kidnappers sat in the front seat and ordered Lin to sit in the
back, setting off the car's alarm.</P>
      <P>Fearing that the noise would irritate the gunmen and make them trigger-happy,
Lin offered to move behind the wheel so he could silence the alarm.</P>
      <P>Just as the men were changing positions in the vehicle, a police car passed by.
The officers were alerted by the strange movement in Lin's car and ordered it to
pull over, according to the spokesman, who did not specify if there was a chase
as reported.</P>
      <P>Fearing that if the police discovered they had interrupted a kidnapping, a
gunfight would be unavoidable, Lin told the police that the two men were his
friends, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>The police remained suspicious, however, and asked the three men to step out of
the car.</P>
      <P>The police searched them and found that all was clear -- the gunmen having left
their guns in the car -- but Lin whispered to the police that he was kidnapped,
leading them to arrest the kidnappers and allow him to escape.</P>
      <P>Sun Ta-cheng,  Taiwan's ambassador to Guatemala,  expressed admiration for Lin's
poise in dealing with the situation, which could have ended up in disaster, the
embassy spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Many of the same details were confirmed by Pan Sheng-tsai, the technical mission
chief of Taiwan's embassy in the Central American country.</P>
      <P>According to the AFP report, the two men arrested were Jorge Isaac Garcia, 27,
and Nestor Juarez Perez, 24, and two pistols were confiscated at the scene.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Only spirits to be levied with health surcharge: health minister</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
06/01/10  16:37:05
(By Chen Ching-fang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Tuesday that the DOH
has begun drafting a bill that will authorize a "health surcharge" on hard
liquor.</P>
      <P>The bill, which will require bottles of spirits to carry warning labels, will
only require spirits to be levied, while wine or other low-proof alcoholic
products will be exempt, said Yaung.</P>
      <P>The local definition or classification of spirits, however, will have to be
discussed and determined, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Yaung, people should not consider the surcharge as tax. "Your money
will remain in your pocket if you do not use it to buy spirits, " he said. He
also offered his opinion that "money should be used to buy food that is good for
your health."</P>
      <P>His comments have stirred up widespread debate since they were brought up a day
earlier.</P>
      <P>Asked by a reporter whether the surcharge will have any adverse impact on
people's daily lives if rice wine, an important ingredient in Taiwanese cooking
and a distillate -- which classifies it as a spirit -- will also be subject to
an extra "health surcharge," Yaung said only that he would support the
legislation of an alcohol hazard prevention act, but would also tell the bill
authors not to make it "too controversial."</P>
      <P>Alcohol abuse in Taiwan is overwhelmingly related to rice wine, which is by far
the cheapest potable strong alcohol available in the country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chiou Shu-ti, director-general of the Bureau of Health Promotion
under the DOH, said that according to practices abroad, imposing alcohol taxes
or surcharges is an effective way of reducing alcohol abuse.</P>
      <P>Chiou said measures aimed at lowering alcohol abuse vary from country to
country, but include the imposition of alcohol tax according to the spirit proof
and minimum pricing schemes. Proceeds of the alcohol taxes or surcharges are in
turn used to boost health education, health and medical services or education in
other fields, according to Chiou.</P>
      <P>She said the alcohol hazard prevention bill will be proposed only after a series
of public hearings are held nationwide and after society reaches a consensus on
how the surcharges should be imposed and by what amount.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, a former DOH minister and an academician with Academia Sinica,
Taiwan's top research institute, said it will be meaningless if the proceeds of
the "health surcharge" are not used to beef up efforts to improve public health.</P>
      <P>Chen Chiao-chi, superintendent of Taipei City Hospital's Songde Branch, said
that between 5 percent and 10 percent of Taiwan's population are alcoholics and
that it remains to be seen whether the proposed alcohol "health surcharge" will
help combat alcohol abuse.</P>
      <P>He also warned that the surcharge imposition might help shore up liquor prices,
spurring more problems with bootlegging.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture launched an online fruit marketing platform Tuesday
to promote banana sales as part of ongoing efforts to help local banana farmers
cope with a fall in the price of the fruit.</P>
      <P>According to the council's Agriculture and Food Agency (AFA) ,
www.afa.gov.tw/FarmerOrderList.asp is aimed at facilitating group purchases by
schools as well as by public and private sector workers.</P>
      <P>The fruit is being sold in 15 kg and 6 kg packages for NT$300 and NT$280,
respectively, and customers who order five boxes or more will be provided with
free delivery, the agency said.</P>
      <P>AFA Chief Secretary Hsu Han-ching said local banana farmers have suffered from
falling banana prices this year, partly because exports to Japan -- Taiwan's
main overseas banana market -- have been lackluster.</P>
      <P>Since the start of this year until May 25, banana export volume to Japan totaled
4,807 metric tons, compared with around 6,000 metric tons during the same period
of last year, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Thanks to efforts to stimulate banana exports, another 237 metric tons of
bananas have been exported to Japan over the past week, he said, adding that a
total of 800 metric tons of bananas will be shipped to Beijing and Shanghai by
the end of June.</P>

      <P>Sixteen Taiwanese wood carvers have been invited to exhibit their artworks in a

southeastern Chinese province of Fujian in June, a museum official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-wang, curator of the Sanyi Wood Sculpture Museum in northern Taiwan's
Miaoli County, said the artists will showcase a total of 45 carvings in the
exhibition scheduled for June 30-July 20.</P>
      <P>In connection with the exhibition, three seminars will also be staged, allowing
wood carvers from Taiwan and China to share and exchange experiences in
developing and promoting their craft, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, Zhangzhou is well known for wood crafts such as carved
puppets and carvings featuring the traditional Chinese zodiac signs. However,
the craft is dying there due to the fast industrial growth in China.</P>
      <P>Tsai said Miaoli has much to share with Zangzhou in helping the artform find a
new lease on life.</P>
      <P>Over the years, he said, the Miaoli county government has organized many
international events and competitions to connect wood carving to tourism, which
has helped with a revival of the craft, which could be a good example for
Zhangzhou.</P>

has proposed would place tight restrictions on their movements and actions while
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Local university  associations,  which have criticized  the restrictions as
overly harsh in the past, urged the committees to discuss the policy rationally
and not delay or boycott the issue any longer.</P>
      <P>Previous reviews of the policy in committee have resulted in skirmishes on at
least two occasions.</P>
      <P>Ho Jow-fei, the director of the MOE's Department of Higher Education, said that
if the amendment fails to clear the joint committee meeting, it would be subject
to a month of consultations by the full Legislature and could not be reviewed
and approved until after July 2 in a special legislative session.</P>
      <P>If the amendment were passed in July, amendments to two other laws, the
University Act and the College School Act, would also have to be passed, and the
process would not be completed until August, Ho said.</P>
      <P>"Even if the revisions are approved by that time, local colleges and
universities will not have sufficient time to make preparations for the
enrollment of Chinese students for the next academic year starting in
September," Ho added.</P>
      <P>The only exception is for those who study in double degree programs jointly
sponsored by universities in Taiwan and China, as such programs are unrelated to
enrollment issues, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Hospitals to offer home service for Barthel testing: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1 (CNA)
06/01/10  17:25:10
(By Justin Su and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has decided not to change its prerequisites for permission to employ
foreign caregivers, but will authorize a number of health institutions to
provide a home service to assess the need for such caregivers, the Department of
Health (DOH) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yuan Lu-fang, a technical specialist at the DOH, said that within 10 days the
department will complete its plans for the health institutions to send staff to
applicants' homes to administer the Barthel Index assessment that measures a
person's level of daily functioning.</P>
      <P>The results of the assessment, rather than age, will continue to be used to
determine whether an individual qualifies to apply for the services of a foreign
caregiver, it was decided Monday at a meeting of the Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA), the DOH, the Ministry of the Interior, and representatives of social
welfare organizations.</P>
      <P>The issue was discussed in response to a request by lawmakers that senior
citizens aged 90 and over be unconditionally allowed to employ foreign
caregivers.</P>
      <P>However, the meeting concluded that the main criterion should remain a Barthel
score of 60 or lower, which is considered the level for marked dependence, the
CLA said.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, in order to make it easier for potential applicants to obtain the
Barthel Index test, the DOH will authorize 170 health facilities countrywide to
carry out home assessments, said Lin San-quei, director-general of the CLA
Bureau of Employment and Vocational Training.</P>
      <P>The home testing service is being implemented against the background of
complaints by a Hsinchu resident Liu Teh-liang, who said that his 90-year-old
father died on May 29 of cardiorespiratory failure as a result of a bacterial
infection that he had contracted while he was in hospital for the Barthel Index
assessment.</P>
      <P>Liu said he had to hire an ambulance to transport his father, who had been bed-
ridden for 10 years and was in the process of applying for a permit to hire a
foreign caregiver, to a hospital in Taoyuan City to have the Barthel test done
because there was no home service.</P>
      <P>"The system kills people," Liu said.</P>
      <P>The Barthel Index, scored on a 0-100 point scale, is an evaluation of daily
living activities in relation to personal care and mobility of a patient and is
used to assess the amount of nursing aid required.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the results of the test are used to determine whether or not an
individual qualifies to apply for the services of a foreign caregiver.</P>

      <P>Recent trends in consumer electronics created by Apple Inc. have not changed
Microsoft Corp.'s investment strategies, as the software giant has focused
heavily on consumers, a Microsoft executive said Tuesday at a computer show in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>"We already  have a strong focus on consumers,  " Steven Guggenheimer,  the
corporate vice president  of the U.S.-based company's Original Equipment
Manufacturer (OEM) Division, told the Central News Agency at a Microsoft
luncheon at Computex Taipei.</P>
      <P>Computex, the world's second largest and Asia's largest computer trade show,
opened Tuesday and will run through June 5.</P>
      <P>"If you look at our investment portfolio, it's already very strong in consumer.
So whether we increase or decrease has nothing to do with market cap analysis.
It's about driving innovation into the marketplace for consumers," he said.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on Apple's replacing Microsoft as the world's largest
technology company by market value, Guggenheimer said that Microsoft does not
gauge itself by market capital.</P>
      <P>"You know, the stock market moves up and down very quickly, so we don't really
look at market cap as a judge of success," he said.</P>
      <P>"So I think when you look at the innovation impact on society, on, you know,
individuals, on businesses, we think we're doing a great job."</P>
      <P>Apple's rise, however, has clearly drawn attention at this year's show.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Li Chang, deputy secretary-general of the Taipei Computer
Association's Overseas Department, said that Apple's rise in market cap is
"quite an obvious sign that the so-called PC era has officially turned into a
non-PC era."</P>
      <P>Microsoft and other companies are trying to harness some of the momentum Apple
has generated, showcasing products similar to Apple's iPad tablet PC in their
booths.</P>
      <P>Guggenheimer said that Microsoft considers tablet PCs "a good extension of the
PC category."</P>
      <P>"We think it will be a good addition and complement to the existing PC space."</P>
      <P>Eddie Wu, general manager of Microsoft's OEM Asia, told reporters he believes
that most tablet PCs will eventually run on Microsoft's operating system.</P>
      <P>"Now more than 90 percent of netbook computers on the market use Windows
operating system. We believe that similar situation will also happen to slate
computers," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Sales of netbooks have grown rapidly in the past two years, but competition has
driven down margins, leaving computer makers to look for other engines of
growth.</P>
      <P>One strategy, Chang said, is to follow the trend created by "Apple style"
products,  where "IT products are more consumer electronics-focused" and are
aimed at winning consumers' hearts when they see them at first sight.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese companies are jumping on the bandwagon, though they might not to able
to earn big profits from smartphones, tablet PCs or other consumer electronics
products as they did in the PC era.</P>
      <P>"They have no choice but to try to get a piece of the market, as the market has
the potential to grow," Chang said.</P>

      <P>In Allan Weston's spacious fourth floor office, there is much to look at, but
what he finds most pleasing is the view of the school playground from the wide
window near his desk.</P>
      <P>"I have a fantastic view from here because I can see the kids playing outside, "
said Weston, who took up the post of CEO of the Taipei European School (TES)
last August.</P>
      <P>Weston described his relatively new job as rewarding and exciting, but indicated
that his true passion lies in spending time in the classrooms interacting with
the students.</P>
      <P>"Perhaps the most difficult part of the job is making sure I have the
opportunity to keep in touch with the kids, which is something I have done all
my life working directly with students, " he said in an exclusive interview with
the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>When he was growing up in Australia, Weston said, his aspiration was to be
either a fighter pilot or a teacher.</P>
      <P>At age 18, he decided flying was not his calling so he enrolled in James Cooke
University where he earned a degree in primary education and since then, "I have
never looked back," he said.</P>
      <P>As an educator with more than three decades of experience working in Australia,
the U.S., Hong Kong, and now Taiwan, Weston believes that a school executive's
top priorities are the students scholastic achievements and academic excellence.</P>
      <P>However, it is even more important create a generation of "global citizens" who
understand and, furthermore, practice the principles of humility, sensitivity,
and empathy, he said.</P>
      <P>At TES, students are not only encouraged to study hard, they are also taught to
fulfill their social responsibility and to bring about positive changes in the
world, according to Weston.</P>
      <P>For example, nine TES high school students recently took the initiative to
launch a six-month fundraising campaign for a school that was badly battered by
Typhoon Morakot last year, he said.</P>
      <P>The goal was NT$50,000 but the group ended up collecting nearly NT$1 million in
total, he added.</P>
      <P>TES volunteers can also be frequently seen volunteering at local charity
organizations such as Harmony Home, a shelter for people with HIV/AIDS and
Animals Taiwan where they help to walk and bathe stray animals.</P>
      <P>In addition, TES high school students each year participate in a Habitat for
Humanity project to build homes in Cambodia for disadvantaged people, over a
two-week period.</P>
      <P>Apart from setting  goals to create culturally  sensitive, altruistic, and well-
rounded young adults, Weston said, he also strives to maintain a community-like
setting at the school.</P>
      <P>The school plans to expand the infrastructure of the secondary campus in Yang
Ming Shan, but TES executives do not wish to see the institution become a "super
school" with a huge student body, he said.</P>
      <P>"What we want is a village, not a city, " Weston stressed. "We want each student
to know they are valued and personally cared for."</P>
      <P>Currently, 57 nationalities are represented among the 1,150 students at the
school.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, Weston said, TES is expected to be accredited by two world
renowned accrediting bodies -- the Council of International Schools  that is
based in Europe and the U.S.-based  Western Association of Schools Colleges.</P>
      <P>"At TES, it is about the bigger view, " he stressed. "We want our students to
not only be tremendous in academics, but well-rounded compassionate citizens of
their communities and of the world."</P>

      <P>TPK Holding Co. Ltd., a China-based touch panel technology application provider,
is expected to launch a primary listing on Taiwan's bourse in the fourth quarter
of this year, its underwriter said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>TPK is expected to be the second foreign company to launch a primary listing in
Taiwan after Integrated Memory Logic (IML) , a U.S.--based integrated circuit
designer, made its debut in mid-May.</P>
      <P>Underwriter Yuanta Securities said TPK's listing application has already passed
a preliminary review by a screening panel at the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp.</P>
      <P>A stock exchange official in charge of TPK's listing said the screening panel
will forward the application to its board of directors, which is scheduled to
meet June 15 for a further review. The listing also needs approval from the
Financial Supervisory Commission, he added.</P>
      <P>While the official did not give any timetable for the TPK listing, he agreed
that it could occur in the fourth quarter once the company has gone through the
screening process.</P>
      <P>According to TPK's prospectus, the company, which was founded in 2005 and is
currently capitalized at NT$1.8 billion (US$56.26 million) , is planning to
issue 28 million new shares at NT$188 each in the listing to raise funds for
future operations.</P>
      <P>TPK's production base is located in Xiamen, in China's Fujian Province, while
its management team is largely from Taiwan, the company said.</P>
      <P>It said touch panel technology applications are mainly used by handheld devices
and mobile phones, smartphones in particular.</P>
      <P>In 2009, TPK posted net profits of NT$2.32 billion, compared with NT$388 million
recorded a year earlier.</P>
      <P>IML began its listing on the Taiex May 18 and rose almost 70 percent on the
first day of trading from its listing price of NT$143.00.</P>
      <P>Dealers said the strong performance has been very encouraging to foreign
companies, who eye Taiwan as their primary fundraising site.</P>
      <P>So far, 57 foreign companies have expressed interest in launching primary
listings in Taiwan, Taiex officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government's ECFA referendum stance misleading: TSU</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) said Tuesday that the government's
position that a proposed trade pact with China should not be put to a referendum
"is misleading."</P>
      <P>"The decision of the public should prevail over any resolution reached by the
government should they run contrary to each other, " TSU Chairman Huang Kung-
huei  said at an international  press conference, citing an example of a recent
referendum in Iceland.</P>
      <P>Huang,  whose tiny opposition party initiated a referendum proposal on the
proposed cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , was
referring to a March 6 referendum in which around 90 percent of Iceland's voters
vetoed a government debt payment plan to Britain and the Netherlands even though
the plan had been endorsed by Iceland's parliament.</P>
      <P>The Referendum Screening Committee under the Executive Yuan is to decide
Thursday on whether the ECFA referendum proposal is valid.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Mainland Affairs Council
insisted at a public hearing on the ECFA referendum last week that the ECFA
should not be subject to a referendum.</P>
      <P>Accusing "high-ranking government and ruling Kuomintang officials in a meeting
Monday of having reached a decision to nip the ECFA referendum in the bud, "
Huang urged the referendum committee to exercise its jurisdiction independently,
professionally and fairly.</P>
      <P>"If the ECFA referendum proposal is rejected, the TSU will call on the public to
regard the year-end special municipality elections as a "referendum" and to vote
down all KMT candidates, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>The elections are widely regarded as a crucial indicator to the 2012
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Former Vice President Annette Lu said at the press conference that Taiwan and
China -- both of which are members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) --
should seek to sign a free trade agreement according to the spirit of the WTO,
and that a cross-strait ECFA will only lead the international community to
believe that Taiwan no longer insists that it is an independent and sovereign
country.</P>
      <P>Lu said China will use the ECFA to forge cross-strait "economic integration" as
a prelude to its eventual goal of "political integration."</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said earlier that same day that the government respects the
people's right to referendums, as long as they are held legally and
constitutionally.</P>
      <P>But the TSU-initiated ECFA referendum is not the case, as the content of the
proposed China pact has not been announced. "How can we hold a referendum on a
subject with content that has yet to be fixed?" he asked.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called Tuesday for the application of WiMAX wireless
broadband communication technology in disaster prevention.</P>
      <P>After attending a demonstration of how the technology could be used to improve
medical care, the president said that if it could also be applied to
transferring data on monitoring landslides and river levels, it would be helpful
for disaster prevention.</P>
      <P>Ma said that three  years ago when he attended  a WiMAX demonstration, Taipei
City, of which he was mayor at the time, was pushing for the spread of an inner
city wireless network using Wi-fly technology.</P>
      <P>"Taipei boasted the island's first ambulance fleet equipped with a Wi-fly
communication system," he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that many people were killed in landslides and flooding caused by Typhoon
Morakot Aug. 8, 2009, Ma said that if disaster monitoring stations in landslide-
prone areas could communicate their data to disaster-prevention centers and
issue timely warnings, the death toll would not be so heavy.</P>
      <P>All of the 25 counties and cities in the country carry out regular disaster-
prevention drills, but WiMAX is not widely used, he said.</P>
      <P>During Tuesday's demonstration, a film was screened to show a case in which a
tourist suffered heart attack while sightseeing on Penghu.</P>
      <P>A heart monitoring device the man wore sent automatic warnings to a Taipei-based
health center, which located the whereabouts of the man with the aid of a global
positioning system and asked the nearest fire department to dispatch an
ambulance to pick up the patient.</P>
      <P>While the ambulance rushed the patient to a hospital on Penghu, doctors at the
Taipei health center examined the patient through a camera installed in the
ambulance and instructed the ambulance crew to provide the man with paramedical
aid.</P>
      <P>The system, which communicates through WiMAX, is especially helpful for heart
attack patients and has succeed in allowing 8.5 percent of patients who are
clinically dead upon arrival at hospitals to survive, according to its
inventors.</P>
      <P>The demonstration took place on the sidelines of Computex Taipei 2010, one of
the world's leading computer trade shows, which opened Tuesday and will run
through June 5.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan is set to screen a draft amendment to the Physicians Act
Wednesday that will create big changes to the fates of Taiwanese students who
have obtained medical education in foreign countries.</P>
      <P>The draft amendment was passed by the Executive Yuan last June, requiring
Taiwanese students who have obtained medical education in foreign countries to
pass qualification tests and internships before being allowed to sit the state
medical licensing examination.</P>
      <P>Some students and their parents who either support or oppose the draft amendment
were preparing to visit the Legislative  Yuan Wednesday to express their
concerns.</P>
      <P>The two sides of the debate have already been trading barbs via websites such as
Facebook and through newspaper ads over the past year on whether returning
Taiwanese medical students, particularly those from Poland, should be allowed to
sit the national licensing exam without going through the first two stages.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the existing Physicians Act,  Taiwanese graduates of medical
schools in countries other than the United States, Japan and seven others, can
take the state licensing exam only after passing the qualification tests first.</P>
      <P>The draft amendment to Article 4 of the Physicians Act seeks to add a new
challenge for medical school students educated abroad -- by asking them to
complete internships -- in addition to passing qualification tests, before they
can sit the exam.</P>
      <P>The students supporting the draft amendment have been pushing for its early
passage, saying that Taiwanese graduates from Polish medical schools will
degrade Taiwan's medical services if there is no such amendment.</P>
      <P>They say that Taiwanese students do not have to take an examination to enter
Polish medical institutes and that in recent years, local agents have made
lucrative profits by recruiting Taiwanese senior high school students to study
in the East European country, where tuition is cheaper and the entry threshold
is lower.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwanese graduates from Polish medical schools ran an ad in local
newspapers that day to oppose the introduction of the draft amendment,
describing it as a "door-closing policy."</P>

      <P>Four companies have been granted permission by the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit
Corporation (KRTC) to open shops rent-free in the commercial street areas of the
city's mass rapid transit system, KRTC Vice General Manager Chang Cheng-chiou
announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the four businesses -- an aromatherapy shop, a dental
clinic, a Kaohsiung association for ichthyosis patients center and a chain
coffee shop -- will be allowed to open premises in the exclusive areas without
paying any rent to KRTC for a one-year period.</P>
      <P>The four business owners were given the special treatment because of the
creative ideas they showed for running their businesses, with which the KRTC
hopes to lure more passengers and shoppers to the city's mass transit system,
which has seen low ridership since it began operations in early 2008.</P>
      <P>"The four shops are expected to open in June or July at the Red Line's Cingpu
and Metropolitan Park stations and at the Orange Line's Fongshan Junior High
School and Daliao stations, " Chang said, expressing belief that the shops will
help attract crowds for both transport and shopping.</P>
      <P>The KRTC's commercial street area can house 132 shops, although only 68 are
being rented to private businesses, and the KRTC will see a shortfall of NT$2
million (US$61,500)  in revenue from its affiliated  companies this year as a
result of the rent-free treatment, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the KRTC will start another activity next month to entice
more businesses to open shops in the station areas along the system's lines. In
conjunction with the planned measure, companies will have to pay only NT$100

      <P>Two high school students have been inspired to become lifetime volunteers, after
they joined a mission to Swaziland that was led by their teacher, according to a
senior education official said Monday.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with the students and the teacher Lu Hsing-chung, Deputy Minister
of Education Lin Tsong-ming said Lu had taught his students a valuable lesson by
getting them involved in overseas volunteerism.</P>
      <P>In July 2008, Lu, the chief librarian at Chunghua Senior High School in central
Taiwan, led a group of 25 students on a volunteer trip to Swaziland, there they
worked at the Heart for Africa charity in what Lu described as a campaign to
"complete reading though real action."</P>
      <P>Since the Africa trip, many students have learned to view the world from a
different perspective and care more about it, Lu said.</P>
      <P>The founder of Heart for Africa Janine Maxwell, who is currently in Taiwan and

    <HEADLINE>Central government to help Taichung improve public order: premier</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
06/01/10  20:02:11
(By Lee Hsi-chang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Police Agency (NPA) will work with the Taichung city government and
its police bureau to fight crime in an effort to improve the central city's
public order, Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Responding to media reports that the NPA has agreed to post 40 SWAT officers in
the central city after a string of gunfights among gangsters on the city streets
in broad daylight have been reported in the past three months, Wu said
Taichung's public order faces complex challenges commonly seen in other emerging
metropolises around the world.</P>
      <P>"To deal with its increasingly complicated crime-fighting duties, the city's
police force might be inadequate and might need assistance from the central
government, " Wu said, adding that the NPA has not hesitated to assign SWAT
personnel to help with the city's battle against organized crime.</P>
      <P>It is the fifth time since 1999 that the Taichung city police bureau has sought
SWAT assistance to maintain public order.</P>
      <P>Saying that remarkable progress has been made in Taichung's infrastructure
construction and economic development in recent years, Wu said the central
government will collaborate with its city administration  and police bureau in
an attempt to prevent a recurrence of daytime street gunbattles.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the city's public order has deteriorated, however, Wu said
Taichung's public order has been "improving steadily" in terms of national
criminal incident figures.</P>
      <P>"However,  the public invariably demands stricter and more effective crime-
fighting measures whenever a major criminal case arises," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Saying that the number of felonies has been on a steady decline in Taiwan, while
the solving rate for major criminal cases is rising, Wu said the government will
not be complacent about improvements that are just statistics.</P>
      <P>"Law enforcement officers will be reminded not to gauge their achievements just
in terms of numerical assessments, Wu said, adding that they will be told to pay
equal attention to people's feelings by resolving the many pending burglary
cases.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hu Mu-yuan, head of the Taichung City Police Bureau, said the
bureau's application for SWAT team aid is not prompted by its loss of control of
the city's public order but rather by the fact that many of its police officers
have been assigned to carry out special criminal investigations.</P>
      <P>The 40 SWAT team members are expected to begin their mission in Taichung from
Wednesday at the earliest, Hu said, adding that the officers, trained to combat
terrorism and other felonies, will conduct spot checks day and night over the
coming two months on major city streets and other places known to be frequented
by gangsters.</P>
      <P>During a question and answer session at the Taichung City Council Monday,
several city councilors grilled Mayor Jason Hu on what has gone wrong with the
city's public order.</P>
      <P>Over the past nearly nine years, the councilors said the city's police budget
has increased from NT$3 billion to NT$5 billion and the number of police
officers has expanded from 2,500 to 4,052.</P>
      <P>But many city dwellers are still haunted by daylight gunfights on the city's
streets, the councilors said. Every time, shooting incidents happen, they said,
the mayor tends to declare a war on gangsters or organized crime, but those
declarations have not shown satisfactory results.</P>
      <P>The councilors, including Chen Shu-hua, Chang Liao Wang-chien and Ho Ming-chen,
said the mayor should consider stepping down and let somebody else deal with the
issue.</P>
      <P>On the councilors' demand that he resign to take the blame for Taichung's poor
public order, Hu rejected the idea, saying his resignation would amount to
surrendering to criminal rings.</P>
      <P>"We will work to the best of our ability to prevent a recurrence of similar
shooting incidents, " Hu said, adding that to him, every bullet fired by
gangsters was like a shot at him.</P>

      <P>The employed population in July will be 93,300 more than it was in April,
according to a prediction based on the results of a survey conducted by the
Council of Labor Affairs and released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The figure, which will be a record high for the last three years, is a clear
sign of the economic recovery that has led to an increase in demand for labor,
according to council analysts.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the council between April 16 and May 5 among
business units with more than 30 employees.</P>
      <P>The respondents were asked to estimate their employment by the end of July
compared to that of April, with 3,020 valid samples collected, according to the
authors of the survey.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 32.51 percent of the respondents forecast an increase in
employees, against 4.39 percent who forecast a decrease, 57.03 percent who said
their workforce would remain unchanged and 6.07 percent who said they could not
give an estimate.</P>
      <P>In total, there will be an increase of 103,000 employees, against a decrease of
9,700, giving a net increase of 93,300, according to the predictions.</P>
      <P>The growth will be a record high since the survey began in 2007, and the fifth
growth in as many quarters, said the authors, ascribing the results to the
steady recovery of the global and domestic economy, a boosting of consumer
confidence, and the arrival of the summer travel season, which have combined to
bolster the demand for workers.</P>
      <P>By industry sector, the manufacturing industry makes up the bulk of the growth
with a predicted increase of 55,400 employers, including 25,100 in electronic
component manufacture, 8,200 in computers and optical products and 12,800 in the
wholesale and retail industry.</P>
      <P>By types of work, unskilled and manual workers account for the biggest increase
of 24,300, followed by skilled and machine operators at 20,400 and service and
sales personnel at 14,300.</P>

      <P>This year's famine campaign by World Vision Taiwan has drawn a record number of
50,000 participants and raised around NT$90 million (US$3 million) so far, an
executive at the charity said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The 21st "30 Hour Famine Humanitarian Relief" campaign which kicked off in
January, has drawn more than 270 groups that are taking part in the "DIY Famine"
program that encourages them to fast for 30 hours, at their own convenience, to
experience what is like to be hungry.</P>
      <P>It is hoped the campaign will raise NY$172 million this year, said Kuo Hsiu-
ling,  director  of the Department  of Resource Development of World Vision
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>People who sign up for the campaign could choose whether they want their
donations to be used for a particular purpose such as supporting needy families
in Taiwan, feeding hungry people overseas or helping with disaster relief, Guo
said.</P>
      <P>World Vision is urging more people to join the campaign, under the slogan
"weeping with those who weep, " by making donations or attending a famine event
that will be held August 7-8, Kuo said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Peking opera maestro to infuse touches of modern dance styles</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A renowned Peking opera actor known for his ability to adapt old plays to modern
influences and to create new operatic works, will present four epic classics
later this week to mark the 20th anniversary of his career in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Li Baochun, head of the Taipei-based Li-Yuan Chinese Opera Theatre, said in a
recent news conference that the performances at the Novel Hall for Performing
Arts in Taipei will be part of his feedback to Taiwanese Peking opera audiences.</P>
      <P>Li will lead his opera group and students from National Taiwan College of
Performing Arts in presenting the four plays -- "The Secret of the Long Feng
Chamber" (June 3); "The Sacred Lotus Lantern" (June 4) ; "Wu Zi-Xu the Innocent
Fugitive" (June 5) ; and "The Legendary Lady Warriors of the Yang Family" (June
6).</P>
      <P>For him, Li said, all four plays carry special significance in his operatic
career development. For instance, "The Secret of the Long Feng Chamber" is the
first Peking opera that he learned to sing in his childhood.</P>
      <P>To infuse new life into "The Sacred Lotus Lantern," Li adds a new dance episode
titled "The Dance of the Myriad, " which incorporates touches of modern dance
styles and traditional operatic kungfu acrobatics.</P>
      <P>Li, 60, said he hopes the addition will add modernity and dramatic appeal to the
play.</P>
      <P>Born into a family of celebrated Chinese opera singers that include the
legendary Li Shaochun, his father, Li began to study Peking opera at the age of
9. Following in his father's footsteps, he specializes in both "Lao-sheng"
(bearded man) and "Wu-sheng" (combat hero) roles.</P>
      <P>At the age of 10, he was admitted to the Peking Opera School where he studied
until he graduated at the age of 18. He was then assigned to China's most
prestigious Chinese opera troupe in Beijing.</P>
      <P>During China's Cultural Revolution, Li's family was labeled political dissidents
and he was forced into hard farm labor. He suffered the loss of both his parents
and grandparents during that tragic period, but still continued practicing their
tradition of opera training.</P>
      <P>After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Li went to the United States to teach
the art of Peking opera and in 1990, he made his debut in Taipei at the National
Theater.</P>
      <P>He has since collaborated with the Koo's Cultural and Educational Foundation in
presenting classic and creative Peking operas. In 1997, he founded his own
troupe to promote the traditional Chinese artform.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed an amendment to the Trade Labor Union Law Tuesday
making it compulsory for all employees of enterprises to be members of their
trade unions.</P>
      <P>However, the amendment does not stipulate any penalties for those who refuse to
join.</P>
      <P>Under the revised law, teachers are allowed to join teachers associations but
are forbidden from organizing trade unions in their schools or staging strikes,
and all servicemen and staffers of arms-related manufacturing businesses under
the Ministry of National Defense are banned from forming trade unions.</P>
      <P>The revised law rules that employers or management should not try to punish
employees who organize trade unions, are union members or cadres, or take part
in union-sponsored activities, by firing or demoting them, or by cutting their
salaries.</P>
      <P>The law gives further protection to foreign trade union members by allowing them
to sit on their unions' boards of directors or act as union supervisors.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the revision, the Taiwan Federation of Trade Unions said it's
regrettable, however, that dispatch workers are banned from joining trade unions
and that teachers are not allowed to establish unions on campuses.</P>
      <P>The National Teachers Association blasted the revision, saying that it provides
"mainly symbolic" protection to teachers' rights and looks like "a bowl of beef
noodles without any beef."</P>
      <P>Council of Labor Affairs Minister Wang Ju-hsuan said the revised law, expected
to take effect May 1 next year, will turn a new page in protecting the rights of
workers.</P>
      <P>Passage of the amendment was postponed from last October to Tuesday after dozens
of trade unions staged protests, alleging that many trade unions nationwide will
not be sustainable if the revision fails to impose any compulsory membership
requirement.</P>

      <P>The monsoon precipitation over the last week has ended the drought in southern
Taiwan and has ensured sufficient irrigation water for the region's second rice
crop this year, Yang Wei-fu, director-general of the Water Resources Agency
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yang said, the monsoon rain, which began May 28, has effectively eased the
drought in southern Taiwan,  with 2,300 CMS (cubic meters/second) of water
flowing over the Kaoping Weir in Kaohsiung County's Dashu Township every second
on May 31.</P>
      <P>The rain brought by the monsoon will ensure sufficient water supplies for
southern Taiwan until the end of July, when the typhoon season will begin,
bringing abundant torrential rain.</P>
      <P>Only if there are no typhoons -- which would be unusual -- will southern Taiwan
feel the pinch of draught again this year.</P>
      <P>Although the drought is over, the agency will still follow a decision last month
by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to ride out the water shortage by postponing
the start of irrigation of the second rice crop by two weeks to June 21, Yang
said.</P>
      <P>The irrigation water will come from the Zengwen and Wushantou reservoirs, which
currently have about 160 million tons between them, enough for half of the water
needed for the second rice crop.</P>
      <P>If the monsoon rain continues until June 21, than there will be enough
irrigation water for southern Taiwan for the whole year and the present rotating
irrigation water supplying mechanism for six areas will be ended, Yang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An international financial service company said Tuesday that Taiwanese banks
could target Chinese banks in small towns and villages when considering making
inroads into China.</P>
      <P>Jason Liu, a partner and managing director of Financial Advisory services of
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Taiwan said they could invest in these Chinese
banks, underwrite operations of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and
buy into the banks.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks as the financial advisory company unveiled the results of
the PwC China's interviews with the general managers and senior executives of 42
foreign banks in China in January and February.</P>
      <P>Liu said that in past surveys, the biggest challenge to foreign banks in China
has been the country's supervisory environment, whereas this year it has been
competition from Chinese banks.</P>
      <P>The phenomenon shows that the competitive edge of China's banks is rising
rapidly, he said, noting that Chinese banks have enjoyed an edge in the number
of branches they are allowed to open, as well as preferential supervisory
regulations on deposits and lending.</P>
      <P>In view of the signing of a cross-Taiwan Strait trade pact with China that will
help accelerate the opening of China's market to Taiwanese banks, Taiwanese
banks will face similar competition pressure if they want to move in, Liu said.</P>
      <P>He therefore suggested the possible options of underwriting operations of SMEs,
as well as buying into Chinese banks.</P>
      <P>He noted that foreign banks have already begun to invest in China's banks in
smaller towns and villages, mainly because they find it hard to compete with
Chinese banks for large business clients.</P>
      <P>However, there are 900 million people living in smaller Chinese towns and
villages, and the interest rates there are higher than those in the urban areas.
If the risk management can be handled well, Taiwanese banks could have better
opportunities in such towns and villages, he said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan should utilize its advantage in technology and manufacturing to develop
more world renowned brands and improve its competitiveness, said Ralph Wiegmann,
president of the International Forum Design GmbH, Tuesday.</P>
      <P>At a signing ceremony for a memorandum of understanding with the Taiwan Design
Center to promote the International Design Alliance (IDA) congress that will be
held in Taipei next year, Wiegmann praised Taiwan design industries for their
eagerness to compete at an international level.</P>
      <P>"The unbelievable willingness to permanently improve and become better and
better is something which impressed me very much in Taiwan," Wiegmann said.</P>
      <P>He said that he has seen much potential in local businesses to upgrade to world
famous brands, thanks to the input of vigorous designing elements.</P>
      <P>However, Wiegmann said a stronger combination of strategic government policies
and visionary entrepreneurship is needed if Taiwan wants to become really
competitive on the international stage.</P>
      <P>The support of design-oriented branding from both the authorities and the
industries is the key, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, as one of the front runners in the field of technology and
manufacturing, should capitalize on that strength and focus more on how to
promote itself globally through its products, he suggested.</P>
      <P>For example, although Taiwan's Giant Manufacturing Company, the world's largest
bicycle manufacturer, is recognized as a "giant " in terms of profits, there is
still room for improvement so that customers worldwide can immediately identify
it as a Taiwan company when the brand pops up, he said.</P>
      <P>"A country needs internationally known brands for the country's image," he said.</P>
      <P>Wiegmann also suggested that Taiwan use the advantages of its geographically
small size, one of which is that it is easy for entrepreneurship  and brilliant
ideas to be communicated among stakeholders in the country.</P>
      <P>"Size is not everything," he said.</P>
      <P>After a one-year selection process, Taipei won the bid from a field of 19 global
competitors to host the 2011 IDA congress, a prestigious international design

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan urged to focus on branding to improve global competitiveness</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should utilize its advantage in technology and manufacturing to develop
more world renowned brands and improve its competitiveness, said Ralph Wiegmann,
president of the International Forum Design GmbH, Tuesday.</P>
      <P>At a signing ceremony for a memorandum of understanding with the Taiwan Design
Center to promote the International Design Alliance (IDA) congress that will be
held in Taipei next year, Wiegmann praised Taiwan design industries for their
eagerness to compete at an international level.</P>
      <P>"The unbelievable willingness to permanently improve and become better and
better is something which impressed me very much in Taiwan," Wiegmann said.</P>
      <P>He said that he has seen much potential in local businesses to upgrade to world
famous brands, thanks to the input of vigorous designing elements.</P>
      <P>However, Wiegmann said a stronger combination of strategic government policies
and visionary entrepreneurship is needed if Taiwan wants to become really
competitive on the international stage.</P>
      <P>The support of design-oriented branding from both the authorities and the
industries is the key, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, as one of the front runners in the field of technology and
manufacturing, should capitalize on that strength and focus more on how to
promote itself globally through its products, he suggested.</P>
      <P>For example, although Taiwan's Giant Manufacturing Company, the world's largest
bicycle manufacturer, is recognized as a "giant " in terms of profits, there is
still room for improvement so that customers worldwide can immediately identify
it as a Taiwan company when the brand pops up, he said.</P>
      <P>"A country needs internationally known brands for the country's image," he said.</P>
      <P>Wiegmann also suggested that Taiwan use the advantages of its geographically
small size, one of which is that it is easy for entrepreneurship  and brilliant
ideas to be communicated among stakeholders in the country.</P>
      <P>"Size is not everything," he said.</P>
      <P>After a one-year selection process, Taipei won the bid from a field of 19 global
competitors to host the 2011 IDA congress, a prestigious international design
event.</P>

      <P>Taipei's  Songshan  Airport  will launch direct flights to Shanghai's Hongqiao
Airport June 14 and to Tokyo's Haneda Airport Oct. 31, and is planning to
further provide direct flights to Seoul's Kimpo Airport.</P>
      <P>We very  much  look forward  to the economic  development opportunities brought
by the close links between Taipei and the three major Northeast Asian cities.
The air services will be very helpful to promoting  bilateral exchanges and
attracting  international business and leisure travelers.</P>
      <P>Songshan Airport, Hongqiao Airport and Haneda Airport are all located downtown,
which means that travel time can be significantly shortened with the help of MRT
systems. In order words, a "one-day living circle" can be realized between
Taipei, Shanghai and Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Before Songshan Airport sees a sharp traffic increase, however, we need to make
full preparations in advance and seek to improve the airport's infrastructure.
The space,  design and facilities of Songshan Airport have long been
insufficient to meet the needs of an international airport. For example, Boeing
747s cannot land or take off at the airport because its runways are too short.</P>
      <P>The support of many quarters will be needed for the airport to display a fresh
look. (June 2, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The administration of President Ma Ying-jeou is currently seeking to amend the
Public Debt Act to relax or adjust the debt limits of various levels of
government. If the amendment is passed, the government's combined allowable debt
burden will rise from 48 percent to 51 percent of the country's gross domestic
product.</P>
      <P>We urge the administration to rein in the move before it is too late, because it
would bring disaster upon Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The outstanding amount of debt owed by the government is the accumulated sum of
deficits incurred by the government over the years. The reason why debt has
continued to accumulate is because revenues have fallen short of expenditures.
Raising the debt ceiling will cover up the truth that the government is "failing
to make ends meet, " which will in turn allow the problem to continue to worsen.</P>
      <P>The imbalance between revenues and expenditures should be tackled by reforming
the tax system and cutting down on spending in order to truly resolve the
problem.</P>
      <P>Five or 10 years from now, when the incumbent president and premier are no
longer in office, the problem will have been passed on to their successors.
Future generations will suffer from the disaster. Is this something a
responsible government should be doing?</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Four police officers were at the crime scene when gang leader Weng Chi-nan died
in a shower of bullets in central Taiwan's Taichung City May 28.</P>
      <P>Two higher-ranking officers -- Lin Chi-you, a traffic police squad leader, and
Lin Wen-wu, a detective police squad leader -- have been removed from their
leadership posts and slapped with a demerit as punishment.</P>
      <P>The two lower-ranking officers -- Shih Chang-hsing and Tai Chih-hung -- were
given a warning as they were reportedly just carrying out their duty by driving
their superiors to the gang leader's office. Shih sustained an injury to one of
his toes in the shooting.</P>
      <P>The incident has again raised concerns over the police force's integrity and
work ethic as well as the shady ties between police and criminal rings.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The gunman in last Friday's shooting that claimed two lives remains at large,
while an equally shocking fact came to light Tuesday -- four police officers
witnessed the execution-like killing.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu was kept in the dark for five days about the presence of
police officers at the crime scene. When he found out about the embarrassing
event, he said with frustration that it seemed like he had taken another bullet,
after already being shot once.</P>
      <P>It was truly "heart-wrenching" to know that ranking police officers maintain
ties with gang members, Hu said while attending a city council session.</P>
      <P>Taichung prosecutors summoned the four police officers for questioning and
tentatively concluded that the police officers had nothing to do with the
shooting incident and did not break any law. Their presence at the gang leader's
office was an inappropriate act rather than a legal infraction, the prosecutors
said. (June 2, 2010).</P>
      <P>United Daily Daily News:</P>
      <P>According to a police investigation, the two ranking police officers were
invited to the gang leader's office by their retired colleague Chen Wu-hsiung
for a chat.</P>
      <P>When the gang leader, Weng Chi-nan, arrived at the scene, a gunman who had been
waiting for him for some time fired a volley of bullets at him. Surveillance
cameras showed that the four police officers hid behind couches as the assailant
fired his gun.</P>
      <P>The police officers regretted showing up at the scene at the most inappropriate
time. Lin Chi-you, a traffic police squad head, said he did not know "the place
was so complex." He further said they could not help at the time because they
were not on duty and therefore unarmed.</P>
      <P>Taichung Police Bureau chief Hu Mu-yuan said he had heard that police officers
were present at the crime scene on the day the shooting happened but did not
inform the mayor until obtaining solid evidence.</P>
      <P>Hu promised to step down from his post if the fugitive gunman is not brought to
justice by the end of this year. (June 2, 2010). Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Mayor Hu said the previous day that he was not sure where exactly the city's
public order problems lie. Some people familiar with police circles said the
problems lie in the shady dealings between police officers and underworld ring
members.</P>
      <P>Police officers sometimes have to engage with gang members to obtain tips to
facilitate investigations into criminal dealings. Some police officers fail to
observe the fine line and eventually are co-opted by ring leaders while failing
to get any useful information.</P>
      <P>A retired police detective who once worked in central Taiwan said in some cases,
targeted gangsters were tipped off and fled before police began to probe their
suspected criminal acts. (June 2, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Responding to the pressure for appreciation of the Taiwan dollar in the wake of
the fall of the euro, the central bank intervened in the foreign exchange market
in mid-May to prevent an excessive increase in the value of Taiwan's currency.</P>
      <P>Economists Chen Shiu-sheng and Wu Tsong-min, however, have recently written
articles to discuss Taiwan's currency policy. They found that there was no clear
evidence showing that the policy to prevent currency appreciation contributed to
economic growth, and also concluded that the central bank's intervention is
ineffective in stabilizing currency fluctuations.</P>
      <P>The central bank's effort to stop currency appreciation is bound to lead to an
increase in the money supply. At the same time, certificates of deposit are
being issued to try to prevent a capital glut.</P>
      <P>As the rise in money supply is not supported by an increase in domestic
investment, the yields of the certificates of deposits auctioned out by the
central bank have fallen, standing at just 1.89 percent in the first quarter of
2010.</P>
      <P>In the first four months of this year, the average increase in the consumer
price index was 1.3 percent, higher than the average savings interest rate of
0.64 percent. If the inflation rate further rises, the people will suffer from a
negative real interest rate.</P>
      <P>We need to ponder if it is necessary for Taiwan to adopt a long-term policy
against currency appreciation. If the government does not prepare properly for
the future scenarios of an inflation and capital flow reverse, it will be
unfavorable to Taiwan's long-term development. (June 2, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Evergreen plans to purchase 100 new cargo ships amid recovery</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the Evergreen Group, a Taiwan-based shipping conglomerate, has
confirmed that its maritime shipping unit will order 100 new ships to modernize
its fleet amid the global economic recovery.</P>
      <P>"It will take at least 10 years to have the 100 boats built, but the first will
be delivered in 2013, " said Evergreen Group Chairman Chang Yung-fa in an
interview with the Chinese-language United Daily News published Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang said Evergreen  Marine Corp.,  Asia's second largest container line, hopes
to order 32 container ships this year with a capacity of 8,000 20-foot
equivalent units (TEUs) each.</P>
      <P>The company is thinking of purchasing 10 of the vessels from South Korea and
another 12 from Taiwan's CSBC Corp., Chang said, but their prices have yet to be
finalized. The remaining ships may be ordered from either Korean or Japanese
shipyards.</P>
      <P>The report said that at Chang's insistence, the new ships will be
environmentally friendly and not cost more than US$10,000 per TEU.</P>
      <P>The plan, regarded as the world's largest order for new boats, has drawn the
attention of all major shipbuilders, test centers and equipment suppliers around
the world, the report said.</P>
      <P>Bloomberg News reported last month, when Chang first announced the new order
plan, that Evergreen Marine is the only shipping line among the world's 20
biggest without any new ships on order.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  EVA Air,  one of the Evergreen  Group's eight subsidiaries, also
disclosed that three new Boeing 777-300 passenger aircraft that it purchased
will be delivered in the second half of the year.</P>
      <P>They will be used on flights between Taiwan and Europe, the United States, and
Japan, the report said.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Chang also predicted that Evergreen Marine and EVA Air will

    <HEADLINE>Hon Hai Precision retains top enterprise title in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. kept its title as Taiwan's top enterprise in
terms of sales for 2009, even though its revenue figure fell 3.56 percent from a
year earlier, indicating an impact from the global economic meltdown, according
to the results of a survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According  to the survey results released by China Credit Information Service,
Hon Hai,  the world's largest electronic component contract maker, posted
NT$1.42 trillion (US$43.96 billion) in sales for 2009 to take the top position
for the fifth consecutive year.</P>
      <P>It was the first decline the company had experienced since 1990, according to
the survey results.</P>
      <P>Cathay Financial Holding took the No. 2 title, posting NT$930 billion in sales,
followed by Quanta Computer's NT$750 billion, CPC Taiwan Corp.'s NT$735 billion
and Formosa Petrochemical's NT$643 billion.</P>
      <P>All four firms also suffered year-on-year declines in sales.</P>
      <P>The survey, which covered a total of 5,000 enterprises operating in Taiwan from
old economy companies to the high tech and service sectors, showed that the
total sales of the 5,000 firms fell 6.11 percent from a year earlier to a
combined NT$28.96 trillion, the lowest level in three years.</P>
      <P>Among the top 500 enterprises, 219 enjoyed revenue growth and the number of
firms was the lowest since 1990.</P>
      <P>"Although 2009 was a year of economic recovery at home and abroad, the survey
demonstrates that the recovery was not as strong as had been previously
expected, " CCIS editor in chief Liu Jen told CNA.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest contract
chipmaker, posted the highest net profit of NT$89.22 billion, followed by Hon
Hai's NT$75.69 billion, Chunghwa Telecom's NT$43.76 billion, Formosa
Petrochemical's NT$39.19 and CPC Taiwan's NT$37.65 billion.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that while net profits of the top 500 firms rose to
NT$894.7 billion in 2009 from NT$184.7 billion a year earlier, the total reached
just 57 percent of the NT$1.58 trillion recorded in the boom year of 2007.</P>
      <P>Among the top 500 firms, 71 suffered losses in 2009, down from 115 that recorded
losses in 2008 but still higher than the 47 registered in 2007 and the 62
recorded in 2006.</P>
      <P>"This is also evidence that the economic recovery has not been significant
enough. The higher profits came largely from their efforts in cost control,
falling raw material prices and foreign exchange gains," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, Liu said, the debt problems in Europe could compromise global
consumption, while China's monetary tightening measures are also likely to
impact demand.</P>
      <P>"We remain cautious about the second half of 2010," he concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan free to sign trade pacts with other countries: premier</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is entitled to ink any trade pacts that it wishes to with other countries
under the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Premier Wu Den-yih
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>His remarks echoed a press release issued the previous day by the Mainland
Affairs Council that emphasized Taiwan's right to sign FTAs with other
countries.</P>
      <P>Both Taiwan and China are WTO members, so are entitled to ink free trade
agreements (FTAs) with other WTO members to enhance their economic interests,
the MAC said. "China should not disrupt Taiwan's efforts to ink FTAs with its
trade partners," it added.</P>
      <P>"Under the directive of President Ma Ying-jeou, the government will do its very
best to create welfare and benefits for the Taiwanese people through
globalization, by first making Taiwan a strong economic power and reaching out
to other Asian countries, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>"Trade and commerce is the lifeline of Taiwan, and this country, as a WTO
member, is eligible to clinch trade deals, pacts or agreements of any kind with
other countries to bolster its trade development and boost the welfare and
benefits for its people, regardless of any outside influence," he said.</P>
      <P>"The government will definitely move toward this ultimate goal despite China's
opinion."</P>
      <P>China routinely objects to other countries agreeing to enter FTAs with Taiwan,
making it very difficult for such deals to be signed.</P>
      <P>Ma has reiterated that Taiwan will seek to forge free trade agreements with its
major trade partners when negotiating a proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>The premier's remarks came after China's Foreign Ministry said a day earlier
that while Beijing is not opposed to Taiwan conducting private sector trade
exchanges with China's diplomatic partners, it "firmly objects" to Taiwan's
inking of official agreements with them.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a referendum being promoted by the opposition as a means of
foiling the ECFA, Wu said the government will not oppose any kind of such a
public vote, as long as it is legitimate.</P>
      <P>In response to a question from reporters on whether Taiwan should list its
demand for a role in the international arena in an ECFA formal statement, Wu
said the two sides must put aside their political disputes to arrive at the
trade-concession trade deal for the sake of mutual benefit.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tamtam 8, the only art gallery in Berlin dedicated to contemporary Taiwanese
art, has opened an exhibition of the works of eight Taiwanese female artists
that it hopes will give them greater exposure and advance their careers.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, the biggest since the gallery's founding in April 2009, features
the works of Taiwanese artists based in London, Paris, Beijing and other cities
around the world and covers themes such as lesbian love, the female body,
identity and the nomadic state of mind.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's National Culture and Arts Foundation  has offered financial support for
the ongoing exhibition at the gallery, which was founded by a group of Taiwanese
students studying in Germany to give Taiwanese artists more exposure.</P>
      <P>Fu Ya-wen, one of the founders who is now studying at a visual arts college in
Leipzig, said Taiwanese artists have few chances to showcase their works abroad.</P>
      <P>"We hope the establishment of Tamtam 8 will offer them a platform to display
their creations," Fu explained.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that operating an art gallery in Europe is no easy task, Fu said
she hopes Taiwan's government can offer subsidies to help keep Tamtam alive so
that Taiwanese artists will have more opportunities to exhibit abroad.</P>
      <P>"We are convinced that we can carve out our own niche in Berlin's flourishing
art market," Fu said confidently.</P>
      <P>Since its inauguration in the trendy Friedrichshain district, Tamtam 8 has
sponsored a series of art exhibitions, concerts and cultural seminars, Fu said,
in the hope of inspiring cross-border and cross-culture exchanges of creative
ideas.</P>
      <P>With a liberal artistic atmosphere and incorporation of eastern and western
European cultural characteristics, Berlin has emerged as Europe's new arts
capital and has attracted artists from around the world to work and reside in
the city, Fu said.</P>
      <P>She said she believes that Tamtam 8 will offer Taiwanese artists a good platform
from which to draw creative inspiration and connect with art lovers.</P>
      <P>After the current exhibition closes June 20, Fu said, Tamtam 8 plans to
collaborate artists from around Europe in sponsoring a series of activities,
including movie screenings  as well as theatrical performances and concerts
featuring modern music.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government must clarify death penalty policy: activists</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 2 (CNA)
06/02/10  15:18:01
(By Jenny W. Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Disappointed anti-death penalty activists said Wednesday  that they will stop
pursuing a constitutional interpretation  on capital  punishment  after the
Justices  of Constitutional Court rejected a petition last week on halting the
death penalty.</P>
      <P>However, they urged President Ma Ying-jeou to live up to his pledge to end the
practice in the future.</P>
      <P>Accusing Ma of duplicity, the Taiwan Alliance to End the Death Penalty (TAEDP) ,
along with over 50 supporters from the medical, environmental, religious and
legal sectors, complained that while the president has vowed to abolish the
death penalty, he continues to allow the Ministry of Justice to execute people.</P>
      <P>In April, Taiwan ended a four-year de facto moratorium on capital punishment by
executing four of its 44 death row inmates.</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Tseng Yong-fu, who was appointed after his predecessor resigned
for refusing to sign off on executions, has been vague on the eventual plight of
the remaining 40, saying only that he will respect the decision of the
Constitutional Court.</P>
      <P>According to the court, the government's adherence to its death penalty policy
does not go against the two U.N. covenants -- the International  Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social
and Cultural Rights -- signed by the president in late March.</P>
      <P>Human rights lawyer Wellington Koo lamented the court's decision, saying the
rejection means the group has exhausted all legal means of swaying the
government and that "all we can do now is to plead with the government to hear
us out."</P>
      <P>According to the TAEDP, Taiwan is one of 18 countries, including the United
States and China, that continue to enforce capital punishment.</P>
      <P>"The president and the justice minister have publicly vowed to end the death
penalty but yet they continue to sign off on death warrants. Their actions make
us highly dubious of their true intentions, " said TAEDP Chairwoman Chiu Hei-
yuan, urging Ma to clarify his stance.</P>
      <P>Another of the activists, Catholic Archbishop John Hung, said that "it has been
proven over and over again that the death penalty is not an antidote for
reducing violence in society."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 1.28 percent Wednesday after heavy selling
triggered by the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama and
concern that the political situation in the world's second-largest economy will
impact the global recovery, according to dealers.</P>
      <P>The weighted  index closed  down 93.62 at 7,195.71  after fluctuating between
7,159.75 and 7,304.13 on turnover of NT$79.69 billion (US$2.46 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened down 0.50 percent as investors witnessed a Wall Street fall
overnight and the downside accelerated, in particular in late trading, due to
Hatoyama's decision and a weakening Japanese yen, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,148 stocks closed down and 665 were up, with 259 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector faced the largest decline, down 1.5
percent, followed by plastics and chemicals, which dropped 1.3 percent, the
paper and pulp with a 1.2 percent fall and textiles, down 1.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Cement and construction sectors each closed down 1.0 percent, while the
financial sector fell 0.8 percent and foodstuffs lost 0.6 percent.</P>
      <P>"Hatoyama's resignation has added uncertainty to the global economy. With
fingers crossed, investors were wondering how big the impact will be," said Mega
Securities analyst Alex Huang.</P>
      <P>"Such uncertainty is the last thing investors wanted, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang said the concerns were amplified by the fact that the debt problems in
Europe have not yet been resolved.</P>
      <P>He said he did not rule out the possibility that the local bourse will test the
key 7,000 point support soon.</P>
      <P>Selling pressure focused on large-cap high tech stocks as investors were afraid
of possible weakness in global consumption, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>Personal computer maker Acer shed 4.45 percent to NT$75.20, while smartphone
firm HTC lost 3.97 percent to close at NT$411.50.</P>
      <P>United Microelectronics Corp. fell 2.70 percent to NT$14.40, while Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. closed unchanged at NT$59.80.</P>
      <P>Nan Ya Plastics  fell 1.74 percent to NT$50.70 and China Petrochemical
Development lost 1.33 percent to end the day at NT$14.80.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'FTA-like' deals possible for Taiwan: US expert</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite China's opposition to any form of "official" engagement between Taiwan
and other countries, it remains possible for Taiwan to seal free trade deals
that do not take the form of a "government-to-government" agreement, a U.S.
expert said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"One presumes  that other countries  would realize that a 'government-to-
government' agreement would not pass muster with the PRC (People's Republic of
China) , so they would plan to fashion any agreement to avoid that problem, "
Alan Romberg, distinguished fellow and director of the East Asia Program at the
Henry L. Stimson Center, told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Romberg was commenting on recent remarks by Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Ma Zhaoxu, who said Beijing has no objection to unofficial economic and trade
relations between Taiwan and other countries, but opposes their signing any
official agreements.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has interpreted Ma's statement
as meaning that Beijing will continue to block Taiwan's efforts to establish
free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries, even after it signs an
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government, which plans to seal the deal with China soon, has said the
agreement will help clear the way for Taiwan's bids to negotiate FTAs with its
trade partners.</P>
      <P>Romberg, who formerly served as a spokesman for the U.S. Department of State,
said that Ma's statement does not make clear whether Beijing would oppose an
agreement that "substantively is the equivalent  of an FTA  but does  not  take
the form  of a 'government-to-government' agreement."</P>
      <P>If China were to disappoint Taiwan's expectations by opposing such "FTA-like"
agreements altogether, it would destroy much of the goodwill that has been built
up between the two sides over the past two years, Romberg said.</P>
      <P>As the ECFA has not been signed, he said, it is premature to try to pin down
Beijing's position regarding a future situation.</P>
      <P>"But it is hard to believe that Beijing would not understand the importance of
this issue and would not be cooperative as long as any such agreements take into
account the need to finesse the issue of 'one China, one Taiwan' or 'two
Chinas,'" he said.</P>

      <P>Hon Hai Precision Industry shares closed sharply lower in heavy trading
Wednesday amid concerns over the company's bottom line after Foxconn Technology
Group announced a 30 percent wage increase for the group's workers in China,
dealers said that day.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai is the parent company of Foxconn, which has been accused of mistreating
its Chinese workers in the wake of a string of suicides by workers at its
Shenzhen complex.</P>
      <P>The pay hike, announced the previous evening, was an attempt to overcome public
criticism and assuage its Chinese employees after the 10 deaths, according to
the dealers.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai closed down 4.02 percent at NT$119.50 (US$3.69) , the lowest level since
last Sept. 1, with some 67 million shares changing hands.</P>
      <P>"The 30 percent pay increase was much higher than the 20 percent rise the market
had been expecting, " said Taiwan International Securities analyst Michael
Chiang.</P>
      <P>"The pay hike is likely to add more than NT$10 billion per year to Hon Hai's
operating costs, which will definitely hurt the company's bottom line," Chiang
said.</P>
      <P>The trading volume was high, indicating that selling pressure on the stock was
heavy, he said.</P>
      <P>At present, Foxconn, which assembles mobile phones, laptop computers and other
products for companies such as Apple, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, has more than
800,000 employees in China, about 400,000 of whom work in the Shenzhen complex.</P>
      <P>Chiang said foreign institutional investors have largely been selling  in the
past  10 trading  days  and added  that the higher-than-expected pay hike is
expected to prompt them to continue to dump their stock.</P>
      <P>Amid cautious sentiment toward Hon Hai, Chiang said, the stock might fall
further to around the NT$110 mark before bargain-hunting kicks in to cause a
rebound.</P>
      <P>Daiwa-Cathay Capital Markets analyst Calvin Huang said the pay increase will
erode Hon Hai's already low gross margin, which at present stands at 4 percent.</P>
      <P>Huang added that Hon Hai's pay hike might trigger a chain reaction in which
other Taiwanese investors in Shenzhen could follow suit.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>While buyers and reporters from home and abroad were focusing heavily on tablet
PCs, e-readers, 3D gadgets and gaming products at Computex, the world's second-
largest computer trade show taking place in Taipei, other products, including
interactive whiteboards and a keyboard PC, also captured visitors' attention.</P>
      <P>A number of exhibitors at Computex, now in its 30th year, were showcasing
interactive whiteboards on which teachers or students can write or draw on an
electronic board that shows the image projected from an overhead projector.</P>
      <P>"You can see weathermen  on TV use a similar technology. Businessmen can also
use the interactive whiteboard to highlight their points during their
presentations, " Patrick Hung of Hitachi Sales Corp., Taiwan told CNA Wednesday
at the Nangkang Exhibition Hall, the Computex venue.</P>
      <P>Some of these whiteboards are actually multi-touch screens, allowing users to
quickly and directly switch between different functions or move graphics from
one place to another using their fingers on the screen.</P>
      <P>"These interactive whiteboards have existed for at least 10 years, but they have
only begun getting popular in the last two years," said Jason Liao, a sales
representative of China-based Fuzhou Returnstar Technology Co., which produces
the devices.</P>
      <P>He attributed the popularity of the products to the increasing use of
projectors.</P>
      <P>Liao said his company saw a 40 percent to 50 percent growth in sales of
interactive whiteboards last year from a year earlier, with Europe and the
Middle East regarded as the most lucrative markets.</P>
      <P>"This kind of whiteboard is eco-friendly and does not harm the health, as
teachers no longer have to breathe in chalk powder, " he said.</P>
      <P>While a majority of exhibitors were displaying flat-screen TVs, one Taiwanese
exhibitor was showcasing two traditional TV sets connected to keyboards in the
most eye-catching spot of his booth.</P>
      <P>"These are keyboard PCs. A keyboard PC combines a keyboard and a hard drive. You
can simply connect it to a traditional TV set at home and use the TV set as a
computer screen, " said Jonathan Chang, sales manager of DMP Electronics Inc.</P>
      <P>This kind of product is obviously not aiming to compete with iPad or any other
tablet PCs, but is targeting emerging markets and developing countries,
according to Chang.</P>
      <P>"We are eyeing Africa, as well as Central and South America. They have a big
demand for this kind of product because of the huge digital divides in their
countries," he noted.</P>
      <P>"We also spoke to Taipei-based envoys of Taiwan's diplomatic allies, who say
they find it very interesting and will help us promote it in their own
countries, " he said.</P>
      <P>The  majority  of  the  countries  that  recognize  Taiwan diplomatically are in
Central America.</P>
      <P>Another booth that made visitors stop and take photos featured a small pond in
which computer screen products were being sprayed by water fountains.</P>
      <P>"We want to show that our products are waterproof because our products are
designed for use by restaurants and factories, " said Sandy Huang, a marketing
specialist of Taiwan's Sensor Tech Co.</P>
      <P>"Users don't need to worry that dust or powder will get inside the computer, as
it is completely sealed and if it gets dirty, it can simply be washed," she
added.</P>
      <P>Some of the exhibitors attracted visitors' attention not with their products but
with their booth designs.</P>
      <P>In strong contrast to a booth fronted by a large devil statute standing with a
spear in its hand in an apparent effort to appeal to gamers, In Win Development
Inc. created a relaxing atmosphere in its "yacht" booth.</P>
      <P>"By designing our booth as a yacht, we want to send the message that we are
sailing toward a bright future, as our high tech products are designed to be
more user-friendly and eco-friendly, " said Winner Tsao, the Taiwanese company's
marketing supervisor.</P>
      <P>With this wealth of picture-drawing whiteboards and specially designed booths,
along with dragons, pandas and giant cartoon characters walking around the
exhibition hall to provide photo-ops, you could be forgiven that the show is
largely for kids. Children under 12, however, are not permitted to enter the
trade show, which runs through June 5. By  Alex Jiang CNA staff Reporter</P>

      <P>Hundreds of employees of state-run firms staged a protest Wednesday, calling for
the government to clarify their status and ensure that they are provided with
benefits to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>Demonstrating in front of the Legislative Yuan, the protesters -- union members
from several state-owned enterprises, including Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) ,
Taiwan Sugar Corp., CPC Corp., Taiwan, and Taiwan Water Corp. -- accused the
government of failing to enshrine their rights and clear status under the law.</P>
      <P>They urged the government to clarify whether they are classed as government
civil servants or laborers.</P>
      <P>Pan Hsin-chung, secretary-general of the Taipower union, said that due to the
vagueness of their status, employees of state-owned companies are not entitled
to labor pensions under the Labor Standards Act.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Pan said, they are also not entitled to the monthly pension
civil servants receive after retirement or the preferential 18 percent bank
deposit interest rate that civil servants get.</P>
      <P>Worse still, he went on, employees of state-owned companies are nevertheless
subject to punishments designed for civil servants should they misbehave.</P>
      <P>Pan said that as a state-run company employee, he feels like an orphan,
sacrificed on the one hand to a twisted legal structure, while being
misunderstood by the public on the other.</P>

elections in Xinbei City and Kaohsiung City, jointly launched their campaigns
Wednesday and vowed to win the races through a show of unity.</P>
      <P>Eric Liluan Chu and Huang Chao-shun unveiled their joint campaign theme of
"building both Xinbei in the north and Kaohsiung in the south into trade and
commerce hubs" at a ceremony presided over by Kaohsiung City Council Speaker

      <P>Stanford University emeritus professor Albert Dien, one of the first foreign
students to study Mandarin at National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) , has
returned to Taiwan after more than half a century to accept an outstanding
alumni award from the university on June 4.</P>
      <P>"Before I came to Taiwan in 1956, I had studied classic Chinese for 10 years in
the United States, but I could not speak a word of Mandarin," Dien said at a
welcome reception at NTNU Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The 82-year-old scholar recalled that during his first week in Taipei, he could
not speak enough Mandarin to order food at a restaurant so he ate moon cakes
from street stands for a whole week, as it was around the time of moon festival.</P>
      <P>After Dien's return to the U.S., he became a major figure in Chinese and Asian
academic disciplines, serving as chairman of the East Asia Sectional Committee
and American Oriental Society, and director of the Stanford East Asia National
Resource Center, among other posts.</P>
      <P>"Definitely, the training I received in Taiwan during the two years I spent here
was important to my whole life," he said.</P>
      <P>The first group of foreign students -- Dien and four others -- to study Mandarin
at NTNU helped promote the establishment of the university's Mandarin Training
Center (MTC) in 1956.</P>
      <P>Dien and his wife Ding Shu-fang, a graduate of NTNU's English Department,
expressed appreciation to the school for providing them with what they said was
a good education and the chance to meet each other.</P>
      <P>NTU's Mandarin Training Center, which teaches Chinese as a second language, is
the largest of its kind in Taiwan, with an enrollment of 1,500 students from
more than 60 countries each academic quarter.</P>

      <P>With the approach of the long summer vacation, nearly 40 percent of the parents
of 4th to 6th grade children surveyed recently said they want their kids to sign
up for local summer camps,  according to the survey results released Wednesday
by the Taipei-based King Car Educational Foundation.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey on summer activities also show that more than 40
percent of the parents who answered the poll revealed that they have decided to
enroll their children in various courses during the two-month summer break.</P>
      <P>According to the survey of 10 to 12-year-old children and their parents, travel
camps are the most popular kind of summer camp among children, with 55.7 percent
of the children surveyed saying they want to attend that kind of camp this
summer.</P>
      <P>Sport-oriented  summer  camps are the second-most  popular, attracting 54.88
percent of the respondent kids, followed by art camps (31.53 percent) , science
camps (27.91 percent) and ecology camps (22.92 percent).</P>
      <P>Parents, however, listed their order of preference as ecology camps (56.36
percent), travel camps (34.48 percent), sports camps (33 percent), and science
camps (27.88 percent).</P>
      <P>Art camps for activities such as painting, music and drama were not even on the
list of parent preferences, suggesting that despite government efforts to
promote aesthetic education in recent years, most parents are uninterested, the
King Car Foundation concluded.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,496 valid student samples and 1,495 parent samples were collected
for the survey, which was conducted May 1-12. The margin of error reached plus

    <HEADLINE>Control Yuan corrects Cabinet over poor IPR investment return</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Control Yuan passed a motion Wednesday to correct the Executive Yuan over
low return on the government's investment in intellectual property rights (IPR)
research.</P>
      <P>Citing findings of its study, the Control Yuan -- the top monitor of government
integrity -- said the executive branch budgets nearly NT$100 billion (US$3.1
billion) for science and technology research annually, but combined IPR revenues
of agencies under the Executive Yuan only total slightly more than NT$700
million.</P>
      <P>The disparity indicates the government has failed to work out an overall
strategy and efficient measures to cope with IPR issues, the Control Yuan said
in its statement of censure.</P>
      <P>Chao Jung-yao, one of two Control Yuan members who initiated the motion to study
IPR investment, said that South Korea -- Taiwan's major trade competitor -- has
over the past decades narrowed the gap between its IPR investment and earnings
and almost achieved a balance.</P>
      <P>Chao said Taiwan has made little progress in this regard.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years, Chao said, the government's annual IPR investment
accounted for 2.7 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).</P>
      <P>Chao added that Taiwan spends over NT$100 billion in royalty and trademark fees
annually, but its royalty revenues total only about NT$7 billion or NT$8
billion.</P>
      <P>Huang Huang-hsiung, Chao's colleague, said that although Taiwan produces many
academic papers annually, their value is questionable.</P>
      <P>Huang quoted former National Chiao Tung University President Chang Chun-yen as
having said that 90 percent of those papers were of little to no commercial
value.</P>
      <P>In the process of investigating the case, Huang said he and Chao had visited a
number of private enterprises, many of which mentioned problems involving
"patent trolls, " people or companies that enforce patents in an overly
aggressive or opportunistic manner, usually without any intention of actually
manufacturing or marketing the patented invention.</P>
      <P>As small- and medium-size enterprises form the backbone of Taiwan's economy,
Huang said, the government should follow South Korea's example by setting up a
fund to procure patents owned by its universities or research institutes, or to
support technological research projects to prevent them from flowing out of the
country or being obtained by "patent trolls."</P>
      <P>The government should also encourage or help local industries to establish
integrated platforms for IPR exchanges, Huang said, adding that the Ministry of
Economic Affairs should reinforce the manpower and professional capability of
its Intellectual Property Office to speed up patent screening and quality to
better protect locally developed intellectual property rights.</P>

      <P>Trade ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum are
scheduled to meet this weekend in the Japanese city of Sapporo, and Taiwan and
the Philippines are expected to discuss the possibility of signing a free trade
agreement (FTA) on the sidelines of the meeting.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's representative office in the Philippines told CNA that Taiwanese
officials have promised to push for the agreement and expressed hope that
bilateral trade relations will make significant progress in the short term.</P>
      <P>Philippines Trade and Industry Secretary Jesli Lapus said he is interested in
any deals that would increase foreign investment and that a bilateral trade
agreement could further strengthen trade links between Taiwan and the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>The Philippines and Taiwan signed a memorandum of understanding for the creation
of an economic corridor between the Subic Bay Freeport Zone in the Philippines
and Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan in 2005, and it is now time to upgrade this to
a national level, he said.</P>
      <P>However, the issue requires a certain degree of diplomatic sensitivity that will
need to be handled delicately, Lapus said, adding that the Philippines  follows
a one-China  policy that recognizes the Beijing's government as the sole
legitimate government of China.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the Manila Economic and Cultural Office,
the amount of Taiwanese capital invested in Philippines in 2009 was over US$113
million.</P>
      <P>Another report conducted by the Philippines' National Economic and Development
Authority also suggested that once Taiwan signs a proposed economic cooperation
framework  agreement with China, Taiwanese capital will leave the Philippines
and flow into China, which could cause thousands of Philippines workers to lose

      <P>Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah called for the quick passage of
amendments to the Act Governing the Allocation of Government Revenues and
Expenditures to facilitate the upgrade and merger of several cities and counties
into special municipalities.</P>
      <P>Jiang issued the call Wednesday during a meeting with Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu,
Lai Ching-te, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)  candidate
for the Tainan municipality mayoral election,  and  several  local  government
officials  and DPP representatives.</P>
      <P>Jiang said that after the Cabinet approved a plan to re-map Taiwan's
administrative zones, his ministry created a task force that has met every two
months since last September to handle related affairs. After elections later
this year, Taipei County will be upgraded to "Xinbei City, " Taichung City and
county will be merged, Kaohsiung City and county will merge, and Tainan City and
county will merge to form special municipalities.</P>
      <P>The task force has created a data bank and information systems, Jiang said, but
added that some issues such as financial policies and the municipal governments'
rights and obligations have yet to be settled.</P>
      <P>The minister said issues concerning labor inspections, traffic supervision and
transfers of business operations at public senior high schools and medical
institutions are expected to be addressed before October.</P>
      <P>The budget and staff of cities and counties will also be handed over as part of
the transfers of business operations to the newly formed municipalities, Jiang
said.</P>
      <P>He said that amendments to the act were crucial to whether the transfer of
business operations from the existing local governments to the new
municipalities and municipal budget allocations can be completed by 2011.</P>
      <P>Jiang was responding to complaints of a potential financial shortfall in the
future Kaohsiung and Tainan municipalities.</P>
      <P>Hao Chien-sheng,  secretary-general  of the Kaohsiung  City government, said
that despite an increase to NT$14.3 billion (US$443 million) in revenue
allocation for the new Kaohsiung municipality, it would still see a financial
shortfall. Hao said that based on the current allocation act, expenditures would
be at least NT$26.2 billion.</P>
      <P>Transfer of business operations after the merger will require a lot of money,
and an exact division of powers and functions between the central and local
governments has not been established, he said.</P>
      <P>Hao also suggested the central government retain temporary workers hired by the
local governments' township offices.</P>
      <P>Chen said she hoped the merger could help narrow the gap between urban and rural
areas.</P>
      <P>Lai expressed concern that the future Tainan municipality would have to spend
about NT$20 billion, but would only be allocated NT$8 billion.</P>

      <P>A Swiss bank on Wednesday remitted to Taiwan US$1.52 million from accounts held
in the names of former President Chen Shui-bian's family members, according to
Taiwan's Special Investigation Division (SID).</P>
      <P>The Swiss bank wired two sums of US$529,617 and US$1 million into an SID
designated account from the family's accounts in Switzerland which hold a total
of US$21 million and had been frozen since 2007.</P>
      <P>It was second time in two weeks that funds had been released from the accounts,
as the Swiss bank wired US$2 million two weeks ago into the SID-designated
account. This means that so far, close to US$3.53 million has been returned to
Taiwan from the family's accounts in Switzerland, the SID said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the US$21 billion that was frozen in Merrill Lynch Bank (Suisse)
S.A. and the Royal Bank of Scotland, the former first family in June 2007 had
also transferred to a Swiss bank NT$570 million (US$17.67 million) of the NT$740
million it had in a Cathay United Bank vault, according to the SID.</P>
      <P>The SID had asked the Swiss bank to freeze the NT$570 million because it was
considered a bribe that had been paid to the family by Taiwan's financial
holding companies.</P>
      <P>The ex-president's son Chen Chih-chung said earlier this month that his family
will cooperate with the SID by returning to Taiwan the US$21 million it holds in
Swiss bank accounts, but he did not say whether the NT$570 million will be
returned.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors believe that all of the funds held in Swiss banks in the family's
name were illegally acquired and should be confiscated.</P>
      <P>The former president, who has been in detention since Nov. 12, 2008 on charges
of corruption,  has been sentenced  to life imprisonment.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court judge who presided over Chen's appeal of his life
sentence, had suggested that the former president return the money to Taiwan if
he wishes to be released on bail.</P>

      <P>Taiwan  should  learn  from  the bicycle-friendly Netherlands to improve both
the island's environment and the public's well-being, the president of the
world's largest bicycle manufacturer said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Announcing plans to embark on a cycling trip in the Netherlands later this
month, Giant Global Group President King Liu said at a press conference that 27
percent of all Dutch travel is done by bicycle. In other words, he said, Dutch
ride bicycles not just for fun but also for practical, utilitarian purposes --
unlike Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It would be a dream come true if I could help bring Taiwan up to that level,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Starting on June 14, Liu will spend six days on a 500 kilometer ride through the
nation he described as a "cycling paradise."</P>
      <P>Liu said Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) officials will
also participate on the trip, dubbed "Green World on Wheels, " and study the
cycling infrastructure of the Netherlands to find ways Taiwan can improve its
cycling environment.</P>
      <P>Describing himself as "born on a bicycle, " Menno Goedhart, the representative
of the Netherlands Trade &amp; Investment Office in Taipei, said that even
though he has seen tremendous improvement in Taiwan's cycling culture, there is
still a long way to go.</P>
      <P>MOTC statistics show the total length of bike lanes in Taiwan was 2,170 km by
the end of 2009, while a review published by Rutgers University last year said
the Netherlands already had about 20,000 km of bike paths and lanes by the end
of 1996.</P>
      <P>During a survey conducted by the ministry this March, 40.1 percent of 9,236
participants said they would be more willing to ride a bike if the country was

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that as an independent and sovereign
country, the Republic of China has signed many official pacts and agreements
with other countries in the past, and will endeavor to continue to do so.</P>
      <P>Ma, was responding to a statement by a spokesman for China's foreign ministry
the previous day that Beijing is opposed to Taiwan signing any free trade
agreements (FTAs) with foreign countries.</P>
      <P>"Trade has been the lifeline of Taiwan, and Taiwan cannot survive if there is no
trade, " Ma said at a weekly meeting of the Central Standing Committee of the
ruling Kuomintang, of which he is chairman.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan as a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) "is
entitled to sign any trade deals with other WTO members and this right cannot be
interfered with for any reason."</P>
      <P>In an interview with the BBC Wednesday morning, Ma again urged Beijing "not to
stand in Taiwan's way of clinching FTAs with foreign countries."</P>
      <P>Ma made a similar statement on April 25 during a televised debate with
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen on whether
Taiwan should ink an economic  cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China.</P>
      <P>Ma's administration is hoping the cross-strait trade pact could be signed in
June to help boost Taiwan's competitiveness in the global arena.</P>
      <P>Ma told the BBC that the June schedule remains unchanged, but the details of
some issues related to the pact have yet to be worked out.</P>
      <P>Taiwan government officials have reiterated that the ECFA would help pave the
way for Taiwan to ink FTAs with other major economies.</P>
      <P>In related news, DPP Chairwoman Tsai said that the latest statement by the
Chinese spokesman highlighted the fact that Beijing will continue to hobble
Taiwan's FTA efforts even after the ECFA is signed, and proved that her party
"is right to oppose the ECFA."</P>
      <P>She said that one of the government's touted advantages of the ECFA -- that it
will serve as springboard to other FTAs -- will not come to fruition.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECFA will increase Taiwan's competitiveness: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 2 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China will benefit Taiwan by boosting the country's
competitiveness  and attraction for foreign investors.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the BBC conducted in Chinese at the Presidential Office, Ma
said there has been a boom of free trade agreements (FTA) in the Asia region
over the past decade -- from three to the current 58 -- and that unless Taiwan
takes action quickly, it will face further isolation.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the ECFA, he said, is to normalize the existing robust cross-
strait trade relationship. By doing so, it will maximize profit margins,
encouraging Taiwanese businesses to stay in Taiwan and luring more foreign
investment.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Beijing have tentatively agreed to sign the agreement in June, he
said, but a specific date has yet to be announced.</P>
      <P>The president also stressed that by forging a trade pact with Beijing, it is
hoped that other countries will be encouraged to sign free trade agreements
(FTAs) or similar deals with Taiwan -- an idea that has been long been opposed
by Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Chinese foreign ministry reaffirmed its stance the previous day that Beijing
strongly objects to Taiwan signing FTAs with other countries.</P>
      <P>"We hope and ask China not to impede our efforts in signing FTAs with other
countries because the agreements are vital to Taiwan's livelihood," he told the
BBC.</P>
      <P>As members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), both China and Taiwan have the
right to establish free trade relationships with other WTO members and Beijing
should not stand in Taiwan's way, he said.</P>
      <P>While the administration has repeatedly touted the EFCA, many in Taiwan,
especially the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, have warned that the
pact will make Taiwan further dependent on China's economy and compromise
Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The president acknowledged the fear and said the government is aware of
potential setbacks, which is why the administration has been working very
carefully to ensure Taiwan's rights will not be compromised in the process, he
said.</P>
      <P>"I have said before in open debates that if there is any possibility that
Taiwan's rights will be harmed by the trade pact, then I would rather see the
negotiations collapse than have the deal go through, " he said. "This is why we
are taking each step very carefully."</P>
      <P>In answering a question from a BBC viewer who inquired about Ma's view on
"eventual unification, " the president emphasized his "no unification, no
independence, no war" stance on cross-strait ties. He said that during his
tenure he will not push for unification with China, and that because the
Republic of China has been independent since 1912, he will also not support
Taiwan's de jure independence.</P>
      <P>Last month marked Ma's second anniversary in office. Looking back on the last
two years, the president said the country has faced many trials, including the
worldwide economic contraction and the most devastating and costly flooding the
country has ever seen.</P>
      <P>"Although  we had many difficulties,  we have also gained confidence in
ourselves and we have been making good progress, " he said, adding that Taiwan's
growth, overall competitiveness and government efficiency have all received
excellent international ratings.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A planned wage increase for factory workers in Shenzhen, China could create a
heavy burden on Taiwanese companies and squeeze some of them out of the market,
a Taiwanese business representative said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shenzhen authorities are likely to announce a 20 percent wage hike in the
minimum wage that would take effect from July, said Hung Jia-sheng, vice
chairman of the Shenzhen Taiwan Business Association.</P>
      <P>Hung told the Central News Agency that the measure will deal another heavy blow
to Shenzhen-based Taiwanese enterprises, which only recently begun to recover
from the global financial tsunami.</P>
      <P>"Although many said they had no choice but to accept the wage raise ordered by
the Shenzhen City government, some could be eliminated by a fresh wave of
operating difficulties, " Hung said by telephone.</P>
      <P>At present, there are two levels of minimum wages for workers in Shenzhen. The
minimum at factories near the city center is 1,000 yuan (NT$4,740) a month,
while those on the city's outskirts must pay at least 900 yuan a month. Minimum
wage in Taiwan is NT$17,280.</P>
      <P>Hung said Tuesday's decision by Taiwanese high-tech giant Foxconn to adopt a 30
percent increase in monthly wages starting June 11 will affect other companies
operating in the area. Foxconn's decision came after a spate of suicides at its
factory in Shenzhen's Longhua area.</P>
      <P>However, other Taiwan businesspeople were reserved about such a development.</P>
      <P>Yeh Chung-jung,  chairman of the Dongguan  Taiwan Business Association, said
Foxconn's hike would not have a large effect on other Taiwanese firms, as what
happened to Foxconn was simply an isolated case.</P>

      <P>Police forces will be fully mobilized to crack down on the illegal possession of
firearms and to bring to justice fugitive suspects involved shooting cases in an
all-out effort to improve public order, Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a special session of the Legislative Yuan's Internal Administration
Committee on public order in central Taiwan's Taichung City following a string
of shocking daytime shootouts there, Jiang said his ministry is working on a
blueprint to clamp down on criminal ringleaders.</P>
      <P>On a May 28 shooting incident that claimed two lives, Jiang said that four
Taichung City Police Bureau staff who were present at the crime scene have been
punished.</P>
      <P>Citing the police bureau's initial investigations, Jiang said the four police
officers were invited by a retired colleague to a biotech company for a chat.
None of them knew that the company was run by Weng Chi-nan, an underworld gang
leader who died in a shower of bullets in the shooting incident.</P>
      <P>Two higher-ranking officers -- Lin Chi-you, a traffic police squad leader, and
Lin Wen-wu, a detective police squad leader -- have been removed from their
leadership posts and slapped with demerits, Jiang said.</P>
      <P>The two lower-ranking officers -- Shih Chang-hsing and Tai Chih-hung -- were
given a serious warning as they were reportedly just carrying out their duty by
driving their superiors to the gang leader's office. Shih sustained an injury to
one of his toes in the shooting.</P>
      <P>On Taichung's public order, Jiang said that compared with the same period last
year, the number of criminal cases reported in the city showed a downward trend
and the ratio of cases solved had also declined slightly.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he added, all major criminal cases listed by the Interior
Ministry's  National Police Agency (NPA)  for special monitoring have been
resolved with the exception of the latest shooting.</P>
      <P>Jiang said the ministry has ordered the Taichung City Police Bureau and the
NPA's Criminal Investigation Bureau to set up a special task force to track down
the fugitive gunman and other suspects involved in the case.</P>
      <P>At the city police bureau's request, the NPA has assigned 40 SWAT team members
to serve in Taichung to help maintain public order. The SWAT team members
started conducting spot checks Wednesday at major streets around the city day
and night in a high-intensity campaign to deter organized crime.</P>

      <P>A combination of 3D and gesture-based remote control technologies are poised to
be commercialized for physical rehabilitation applications, a research institute
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>At Computex Taipei, Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)
displayed an interactive glass-free 3D digital signage that uses two household
webcams to immediately recognize hand gestures.</P>
      <P>"You can set the functions by using different gestures, " said Peter Chew,
promotion director of ITRI's 3D System and Application Division. "For example,
you can make a fist to zoom in on an image and wave your hand to turn the page."</P>
      <P>This application can be used in the fields of advertising, gaming, or even
medical treatment, he said.</P>
      <P>"The technology will be applied in physical rehabilitation by using hand
gestures to change the 3D images, " said Chew, adding that patients will have
more fun with such interaction.</P>
      <P>Asked which manufacturer is interested and when the product will hit the market,
Chew said it is too early to say.</P>
      <P>Wii, a Japanese home video game console that was released a few years ago, is
now being used in settings like hospitals, nursing homes and clinics for all
types of rehab devices.</P>
      <P>Chew said that 3D digital signage is just the beginning and he is optimistic
about the future of its applications.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will be able to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries as
long as it does not seek to forge such pacts for political purposes, said a U.S.
expert on cross-strait affairs Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Bonnie Glaser, a senior research fellow with the Washington-based Center for
Strategic and International Studies, told the Central News Agency that she does
not think " Beijing is adamantly opposed to Taiwan signing economic agreements
with other countries, but it does have some concerns, and perhaps even
prcondictions."</P>
      <P>A spokesman for China's foreign ministry said the previous day that "Beijing is
opposed to Taiwan signing any agreements 'of an official nature' with foreign
countries, but it maintains a hands-off policy with regard to Taiwan developing
unofficial trade and economic relations with them."</P>
      <P>Glaser said that, first of all, Beijing might insist that Taiwan use a moniker
in such agreements that is consistent with past practice. Taiwan was admitted
into the World Trade Organization (WTO) under the name "the Separate Customs
Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu."</P>
      <P>Secondly, she said, China could insist that Taiwan give priority to negotiating
a cross-strait economic agreement and that there be no linkage between the ECFA
and other FTAs.</P>
      <P>Finally, Beijing could stipulate that other counties sign FTAs with China first,
before considering Taiwan, she said.</P>
      <P>However, Glaser said, none of those concerns or preconditions would be
"insurmountable barriers" to Taiwan signing trade pacts with other countries.</P>
      <P>Glaser said that she believes that Beijing will not stand in the way of Taiwan's
inclusion in the regional economic process, in light of China President Hu
Jintao's statement last December that China will give due consideration to
Taiwan in this regard.</P>
      <P>Besides, under the framework of the WTO, economic agreements among members are
permitted, Glaser said, adding that China does not have reasonable grounds on
which to oppose such agreements.</P>
      <P>"As long as Taiwan does not seek to use the signing of economic agreements with
other countries for political purposes, as was done in the past when Chen Shui-
bian was president, this (signing of FTAs) is a goal that is achievable  under
President Ma Ying-jeou's leadership," she said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a visiting European Commission official declined to comment on
China's latest remark on the possibility of Taiwan signing FTAs with other
countries.</P>
      <P>Mauro Petriccione, head of the commission's Directorate General of Trade (B) ,
said before a European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) luncheon that he was
not sure exactly how China had voiced its opposition and therefore he could not
comment.</P>
      <P>Addressing the luncheon, Petriccione said that "we will continue to work with
Taiwan and watch what happens with the ECFA and its possible implications."</P>
      <P>Upon arrival in Taiwan on May 28, Petriccione told Taiwanese officials that
there should be further assessment of the possibility of a free trade agreement
between Taiwan and European Union.</P>
      <P>During a meeting the same day on Taiwan-EU trade, Petriccione also asked
Taiwanese officials about the progress of the trade pact talks between Taiwan
and China, according to a Taiwanese official who was at the meeting.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called on China Wednesday to address issues related to
the Tiananmen Incident with a new approach.</P>
      <P>Ma issued the call in an interview with the BBC in Chinese two days ahead of the
21st anniversary of the incident, which occurred on June 4, 1989.</P>
      <P>Ma said that every year since the crackdown he has either participated in
activities commemorating the incident or has issued a statement.</P>
      <P>He told the BBC that he has always been concerned about the incident as it was a
historic event connected to human rights. The Chinese government has to face it
squarely and take steps to heal wounds, sort out the feelings of injustice and
ease the pain of victims and their families, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that similar events have taken place in other countries,
including the 228 Incident and the White Terror Era in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident refers to the anti-government uprising that began in February
1947 and subsequently led to a brutal crackdown by the then Kuomintang-led
government that is widely believed to have resulted in thousands of deaths.</P>
      <P>The White Terror Era refers to a crackdown on advocates of communism, Taiwan
independence and democratic reforms by the KMT in the 1950s and 1960s.</P>
      <P>The crackdown measures adopted during the martial law era from 1949-1987 are now
considered a main source of the problem.</P>
      <P>Taking Taiwan's experience in handling the aftermath of the incidents as an
example, Ma said the government opted to face the facts and take measures to
heal wounds caused by the incidents.</P>
      <P>It is inevitable  that the government has to assume full responsibility when
armed conflict breaks out, the president said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the circumstances in China now are totally different than when the
Tiananmen Incident occurred, Ma said that it is time to do something about it.</P>
      <P>On cross-Taiwan Strait issues, Ma said he did not see an immediate need for
leaders of Taiwan and China to meet, and that it is more important to lay a
solid foundation for future development.</P>
      <P>For example, Ma said that though leaders of South Korea and North Korea have
met, there has been little progress made in other areas.</P>
      <P>The president said he has no plan to invite Chinese leaders to visit Taiwan and
did not expect leaders in the other side to invite him to China.</P>
      <P>He also said he is glad to see improvements in cross-strait relations and will
work to allow the two sides to engage in closer interactions under a peaceful
atmosphere.</P>

      <P>Demonstrating in front of the Legislative Yuan, the protesters -- union members

Taiwan Sugar Corp., CPC Corp., Taiwan, and Taiwan Water Corp. -- accused the

      <P>They urged the government to clarify whether they are classed as government
civil servants or laborers.</P>
      <P>Pan Hsin-chung, secretary-general of the Taipower union, said that due to the
vagueness of their status, employees of state-owned companies are not entitled

      <P>At the same time, Pan said, they are also not entitled to the monthly pension
civil servants receive after retirement or the preferential 18 percent bank
deposit interest rate that civil servants get.</P>
      <P>Worse still, he went on, employees of state-owned companies are nevertheless
subject to punishments designed for civil servants should they misbehave.</P>

      <P>Stanford University emeritus professor Albert Dien, one of the first foreign
students to study Mandarin at National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) , has
returned to Taiwan after more than half a century to accept an outstanding
alumni award from the university on June 4.</P>
      <P>"Before I came to Taiwan in 1956, I had studied classic Chinese for 10 years in
the United States, but I could not speak a word of Mandarin," Dien said at a
welcome reception at NTNU Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The 82-year-old scholar recalled that during his first week in Taipei, he could
not speak enough Mandarin to order food at a restaurant so he ate moon cakes
from street stands for a whole week, as it was around the time of moon festival.</P>
      <P>After Dien's return to the U.S., he became a major figure in Chinese and Asian
academic disciplines, serving as chairman of the East Asia Sectional Committee
and American Oriental Society, and director of the Stanford East Asia National
Resource Center, among other posts.</P>
      <P>"Definitely, the training I received in Taiwan during the two years I spent here
was important to my whole life," he said.</P>
      <P>The first group of foreign students -- Dien and four others -- to study Mandarin
at NTNU helped promote the establishment of the university's Mandarin Training
Center (MTC) in 1956.</P>
      <P>Dien and his wife Ding Shu-fang, a graduate of NTNU's English Department,
expressed appreciation to the school for providing them with what they said was
a good education and the chance to meet each other.</P>
      <P>NTU's Mandarin Training Center, which teaches Chinese as a second language, is
the largest of its kind in Taiwan, with an enrollment of 1,500 students from

      <P>With the approach of the long summer vacation, nearly 40 percent of the parents
of 4th to 6th grade children surveyed recently said they want their kids to sign
up for local summer camps,  according to the survey results released Wednesday
by the Taipei-based King Car Educational Foundation.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey on summer activities also show that more than 40
percent of the parents who answered the poll revealed that they have decided to
enroll their children in various courses during the two-month summer break.</P>
      <P>According to the survey of 10 to 12-year-old children and their parents, travel
camps are the most popular kind of summer camp among children, with 55.7 percent
of the children surveyed saying they want to attend that kind of camp this
summer.</P>
      <P>Sport-oriented  summer  camps are the second-most  popular, attracting 54.88
percent of the respondent kids, followed by art camps (31.53 percent) , science
camps (27.91 percent) and ecology camps (22.92 percent).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Control Yuan corrects Cabinet over poor IPR investment return</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Control Yuan passed a motion Wednesday to correct the Executive Yuan over
low return on the government's investment in intellectual property rights (IPR)
research.</P>
      <P>Citing findings of its study, the Control Yuan -- the top monitor of government
integrity -- said the executive branch budgets nearly NT$100 billion (US$3.1
billion) for science and technology research annually, but combined IPR revenues
of agencies under the Executive Yuan only total slightly more than NT$700
million.</P>
      <P>The disparity indicates the government has failed to work out an overall
strategy and efficient measures to cope with IPR issues, the Control Yuan said
in its statement of censure.</P>
      <P>Chao Jung-yao, one of two Control Yuan members who initiated the motion to study
IPR investment, said that South Korea -- Taiwan's major trade competitor -- has
over the past decades narrowed the gap between its IPR investment and earnings
and almost achieved a balance.</P>
      <P>Chao said Taiwan has made little progress in this regard.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years, Chao said, the government's annual IPR investment
accounted for 2.7 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).</P>
      <P>Chao added that Taiwan spends over NT$100 billion in royalty and trademark fees
annually, but its royalty revenues total only about NT$7 billion or NT$8
billion.</P>
      <P>Huang Huang-hsiung, Chao's colleague, said that although Taiwan produces many
academic papers annually, their value is questionable.</P>
      <P>Huang quoted former National Chiao Tung University President Chang Chun-yen as
having said that 90 percent of those papers were of little to no commercial
value.</P>
      <P>In the process of investigating the case, Huang said he and Chao had visited a
number of private enterprises, many of which mentioned problems involving
"patent trolls, " people or companies that enforce patents in an overly
aggressive or opportunistic manner, usually without any intention of actually
manufacturing or marketing the patented invention.</P>
      <P>As small- and medium-size enterprises form the backbone of Taiwan's economy,
Huang said, the government should follow South Korea's example by setting up a
fund to procure patents owned by its universities or research institutes, or to
support technological research projects to prevent them from flowing out of the
country or being obtained by "patent trolls."</P>
      <P>The government should also encourage or help local industries to establish
integrated platforms for IPR exchanges, Huang said, adding that the Ministry of
Economic Affairs should reinforce the manpower and professional capability of
its Intellectual Property Office to speed up patent screening and quality to
better protect locally developed intellectual property rights.</P>

      <P>Trade ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum are
scheduled to meet this weekend in the Japanese city of Sapporo, and Taiwan and
the Philippines are expected to discuss the possibility of signing a free trade
agreement (FTA) on the sidelines of the meeting.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's representative office in the Philippines told CNA that Taiwanese
officials have promised to push for the agreement and expressed hope that
bilateral trade relations will make significant progress in the short term.</P>
      <P>Philippines Trade and Industry Secretary Jesli Lapus said he is interested in
any deals that would increase foreign investment and that a bilateral trade
agreement could further strengthen trade links between Taiwan and the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>The Philippines and Taiwan signed a memorandum of understanding for the creation
of an economic corridor between the Subic Bay Freeport Zone in the Philippines
and Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan in 2005, and it is now time to upgrade this to
a national level, he said.</P>
      <P>However, the issue requires a certain degree of diplomatic sensitivity that will
need to be handled delicately, Lapus said, adding that the Philippines  follows
a one-China  policy that recognizes the Beijing's government as the sole
legitimate government of China.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the Manila Economic and Cultural Office,
the amount of Taiwanese capital invested in Philippines in 2009 was over US$113
million.</P>
      <P>Another report conducted by the Philippines' National Economic and Development
Authority also suggested that once Taiwan signs a proposed economic cooperation
framework  agreement with China, Taiwanese capital will leave the Philippines
and flow into China, which could cause thousands of Philippines workers to lose
their jobs.</P>

      <P>Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah called for the quick passage of
amendments to the Act Governing the Allocation of Government Revenues and
Expenditures to facilitate the upgrade and merger of several cities and counties
into special municipalities.</P>
      <P>Jiang issued the call Wednesday during a meeting with Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu,
Lai Ching-te, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)  candidate
for the Tainan municipality mayoral election,  and  several  local  government
officials  and DPP representatives.</P>
      <P>Jiang said that after the Cabinet approved a plan to re-map Taiwan's
administrative zones, his ministry created a task force that has met every two
months since last September to handle related affairs. After elections later
this year, Taipei County will be upgraded to "Xinbei City, " Taichung City and
county will be merged, Kaohsiung City and county will merge, and Tainan City and
county will merge to form special municipalities.</P>
      <P>The task force has created a data bank and information systems, Jiang said, but
added that some issues such as financial policies and the municipal governments'
rights and obligations have yet to be settled.</P>
      <P>The minister said issues concerning labor inspections, traffic supervision and
transfers of business operations at public senior high schools and medical
institutions are expected to be addressed before October.</P>
      <P>The budget and staff of cities and counties will also be handed over as part of
the transfers of business operations to the newly formed municipalities, Jiang
said.</P>
      <P>He said that amendments to the act were crucial to whether the transfer of
business operations from the existing local governments to the new
municipalities and municipal budget allocations can be completed by 2011.</P>
      <P>Jiang was responding to complaints of a potential financial shortfall in the
future Kaohsiung and Tainan municipalities.</P>
      <P>Hao Chien-sheng,  secretary-general  of the Kaohsiung  City government, said
that despite an increase to NT$14.3 billion (US$443 million) in revenue
allocation for the new Kaohsiung municipality, it would still see a financial
shortfall. Hao said that based on the current allocation act, expenditures would
be at least NT$26.2 billion.</P>
      <P>Transfer of business operations after the merger will require a lot of money,
and an exact division of powers and functions between the central and local
governments has not been established, he said.</P>
      <P>Hao also suggested the central government retain temporary workers hired by the
local governments' township offices.</P>
      <P>Chen said she hoped the merger could help narrow the gap between urban and rural
areas.</P>
      <P>Lai expressed concern that the future Tainan municipality would have to spend
about NT$20 billion, but would only be allocated NT$8 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Swiss bank releases US$1.52 m. from former first family's account</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Swiss bank on Wednesday remitted to Taiwan US$1.52 million from accounts held
in the names of former President Chen Shui-bian's family members, according to
Taiwan's Special Investigation Division (SID).</P>
      <P>The Swiss bank wired two sums of US$529,617 and US$1 million into an SID
designated account from the family's accounts in Switzerland which hold a total
of US$21 million and had been frozen since 2007.</P>
      <P>It was second time in two weeks that funds had been released from the accounts,
as the Swiss bank wired US$2 million two weeks ago into the SID-designated
account. This means that so far, close to US$3.53 million has been returned to
Taiwan from the family's accounts in Switzerland, the SID said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the US$21 billion that was frozen in Merrill Lynch Bank (Suisse)
S.A. and the Royal Bank of Scotland, the former first family in June 2007 had
also transferred to a Swiss bank NT$570 million (US$17.67 million) of the NT$740
million it had in a Cathay United Bank vault, according to the SID.</P>
      <P>The SID had asked the Swiss bank to freeze the NT$570 million because it was
considered a bribe that had been paid to the family by Taiwan's financial
holding companies.</P>
      <P>The ex-president's son Chen Chih-chung said earlier this month that his family
will cooperate with the SID by returning to Taiwan the US$21 million it holds in
Swiss bank accounts, but he did not say whether the NT$570 million will be
returned.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors believe that all of the funds held in Swiss banks in the family's
name were illegally acquired and should be confiscated.</P>
      <P>The former president, who has been in detention since Nov. 12, 2008 on charges
of corruption,  has been sentenced  to life imprisonment.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court judge who presided over Chen's appeal of his life
sentence, had suggested that the former president return the money to Taiwan if
he wishes to be released on bail.</P>

      <P>Taiwan  should  learn  from  the bicycle-friendly Netherlands to improve both
the island's environment and the public's well-being, the president of the
world's largest bicycle manufacturer said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Announcing plans to embark on a cycling trip in the Netherlands later this
month, Giant Global Group President King Liu said at a press conference that 27
percent of all Dutch travel is done by bicycle. In other words, he said, Dutch
ride bicycles not just for fun but also for practical, utilitarian purposes --
unlike Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It would be a dream come true if I could help bring Taiwan up to that level,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Starting on June 14, Liu will spend six days on a 500 kilometer ride through the
nation he described as a "cycling paradise."</P>
      <P>Liu said Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) officials will
also participate on the trip, dubbed "Green World on Wheels, " and study the
cycling infrastructure of the Netherlands to find ways Taiwan can improve its
cycling environment.</P>
      <P>Describing himself as "born on a bicycle, " Menno Goedhart, the representative
of the Netherlands Trade &amp; Investment Office in Taipei, said that even
though he has seen tremendous improvement in Taiwan's cycling culture, there is
still a long way to go.</P>
      <P>MOTC statistics show the total length of bike lanes in Taiwan was 2,170 km by
the end of 2009, while a review published by Rutgers University last year said
the Netherlands already had about 20,000 km of bike paths and lanes by the end
of 1996.</P>
      <P>During a survey conducted by the ministry this March, 40.1 percent of 9,236
participants said they would be more willing to ride a bike if the country was

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that as an independent and sovereign
country, the Republic of China has signed many official pacts and agreements
with other countries in the past, and will endeavor to continue to do so.</P>
      <P>Ma, was responding to a statement by a spokesman for China's foreign ministry
the previous day that Beijing is opposed to Taiwan signing any free trade
agreements (FTAs) with foreign countries.</P>
      <P>"Trade has been the lifeline of Taiwan, and Taiwan cannot survive if there is no
trade, " Ma said at a weekly meeting of the Central Standing Committee of the
ruling Kuomintang, of which he is chairman.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan as a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) "is
entitled to sign any trade deals with other WTO members and this right cannot be
interfered with for any reason."</P>
      <P>In an interview with the BBC Wednesday morning, Ma again urged Beijing "not to
stand in Taiwan's way of clinching FTAs with foreign countries."</P>
      <P>Ma made a similar statement on April 25 during a televised debate with
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen on whether
Taiwan should ink an economic  cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China.</P>
      <P>Ma's administration is hoping the cross-strait trade pact could be signed in
June to help boost Taiwan's competitiveness in the global arena.</P>
      <P>Ma told the BBC that the June schedule remains unchanged, but the details of
some issues related to the pact have yet to be worked out.</P>
      <P>Taiwan government officials have reiterated that the ECFA would help pave the
way for Taiwan to ink FTAs with other major economies.</P>
      <P>In related news, DPP Chairwoman Tsai said that the latest statement by the
Chinese spokesman highlighted the fact that Beijing will continue to hobble
Taiwan's FTA efforts even after the ECFA is signed, and proved that her party
"is right to oppose the ECFA."</P>
      <P>She said that one of the government's touted advantages of the ECFA -- that it
will serve as springboard to other FTAs -- will not come to fruition.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China will benefit Taiwan by boosting the country's
competitiveness  and attraction for foreign investors.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the BBC conducted in Chinese at the Presidential Office, Ma
said there has been a boom of free trade agreements (FTA) in the Asia region
over the past decade -- from three to the current 58 -- and that unless Taiwan
takes action quickly, it will face further isolation.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the ECFA, he said, is to normalize the existing robust cross-
strait trade relationship. By doing so, it will maximize profit margins,
encouraging Taiwanese businesses to stay in Taiwan and luring more foreign
investment.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Beijing have tentatively agreed to sign the agreement in June, he
said, but a specific date has yet to be announced.</P>
      <P>The president also stressed that by forging a trade pact with Beijing, it is
hoped that other countries will be encouraged to sign free trade agreements
(FTAs) or similar deals with Taiwan -- an idea that has been long been opposed
by Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Chinese foreign ministry reaffirmed its stance the previous day that Beijing
strongly objects to Taiwan signing FTAs with other countries.</P>
      <P>"We hope and ask China not to impede our efforts in signing FTAs with other
countries because the agreements are vital to Taiwan's livelihood," he told the
BBC.</P>
      <P>As members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), both China and Taiwan have the
right to establish free trade relationships with other WTO members and Beijing
should not stand in Taiwan's way, he said.</P>
      <P>While the administration has repeatedly touted the EFCA, many in Taiwan,
especially the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, have warned that the
pact will make Taiwan further dependent on China's economy and compromise
Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The president acknowledged the fear and said the government is aware of
potential setbacks, which is why the administration has been working very
carefully to ensure Taiwan's rights will not be compromised in the process, he
said.</P>
      <P>"I have said before in open debates that if there is any possibility that
Taiwan's rights will be harmed by the trade pact, then I would rather see the
negotiations collapse than have the deal go through, " he said. "This is why we
are taking each step very carefully."</P>
      <P>In answering a question from a BBC viewer who inquired about Ma's view on
"eventual unification, " the president emphasized his "no unification, no
independence, no war" stance on cross-strait ties. He said that during his
tenure he will not push for unification with China, and that because the
Republic of China has been independent since 1912, he will also not support
Taiwan's de jure independence.</P>
      <P>Last month marked Ma's second anniversary in office. Looking back on the last
two years, the president said the country has faced many trials, including the
worldwide economic contraction and the most devastating and costly flooding the
country has ever seen.</P>
      <P>"Although  we had many difficulties,  we have also gained confidence in
ourselves and we have been making good progress, " he said, adding that Taiwan's
growth, overall competitiveness and government efficiency have all received
excellent international ratings.</P>

      <P>A planned wage increase for factory workers in Shenzhen, China could create a
heavy burden on Taiwanese companies and squeeze some of them out of the market,
a Taiwanese business representative said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shenzhen authorities are likely to announce a 20 percent wage hike in the
minimum wage that would take effect from July, said Hung Jia-sheng, vice
chairman of the Shenzhen Taiwan Business Association.</P>
      <P>Hung told the Central News Agency that the measure will deal another heavy blow
to Shenzhen-based Taiwanese enterprises, which only recently begun to recover
from the global financial tsunami.</P>
      <P>"Although many said they had no choice but to accept the wage raise ordered by
the Shenzhen City government, some could be eliminated by a fresh wave of
operating difficulties, " Hung said by telephone.</P>
      <P>At present, there are two levels of minimum wages for workers in Shenzhen. The
minimum at factories near the city center is 1,000 yuan (NT$4,740) a month,
while those on the city's outskirts must pay at least 900 yuan a month. Minimum
wage in Taiwan is NT$17,280.</P>
      <P>Hung said Tuesday's decision by Taiwanese high-tech giant Foxconn to adopt a 30
percent increase in monthly wages starting June 11 will affect other companies
operating in the area. Foxconn's decision came after a spate of suicides at its
factory in Shenzhen's Longhua area.</P>
      <P>However, other Taiwan businesspeople were reserved about such a development.</P>
      <P>Yeh Chung-jung,  chairman of the Dongguan  Taiwan Business Association, said
Foxconn's hike would not have a large effect on other Taiwanese firms, as what
happened to Foxconn was simply an isolated case.</P>

      <P>Police forces will be fully mobilized to crack down on the illegal possession of
firearms and to bring to justice fugitive suspects involved shooting cases in an
all-out effort to improve public order, Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a special session of the Legislative Yuan's Internal Administration
Committee on public order in central Taiwan's Taichung City following a string
of shocking daytime shootouts there, Jiang said his ministry is working on a
blueprint to clamp down on criminal ringleaders.</P>
      <P>On a May 28 shooting incident that claimed two lives, Jiang said that four
Taichung City Police Bureau staff who were present at the crime scene have been
punished.</P>
      <P>Citing the police bureau's initial investigations, Jiang said the four police
officers were invited by a retired colleague to a biotech company for a chat.
None of them knew that the company was run by Weng Chi-nan, an underworld gang
leader who died in a shower of bullets in the shooting incident.</P>
      <P>Two higher-ranking officers -- Lin Chi-you, a traffic police squad leader, and
Lin Wen-wu, a detective police squad leader -- have been removed from their
leadership posts and slapped with demerits, Jiang said.</P>
      <P>The two lower-ranking officers -- Shih Chang-hsing and Tai Chih-hung -- were
given a serious warning as they were reportedly just carrying out their duty by
driving their superiors to the gang leader's office. Shih sustained an injury to
one of his toes in the shooting.</P>
      <P>On Taichung's public order, Jiang said that compared with the same period last
year, the number of criminal cases reported in the city showed a downward trend
and the ratio of cases solved had also declined slightly.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he added, all major criminal cases listed by the Interior
Ministry's  National Police Agency (NPA)  for special monitoring have been

    <HEADLINE>3D gesture-based controller to be new rehab device: institute</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A combination of 3D and gesture-based remote control technologies are poised to
be commercialized for physical rehabilitation applications, a research institute
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>At Computex Taipei, Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)
displayed an interactive glass-free 3D digital signage that uses two household
webcams to immediately recognize hand gestures.</P>
      <P>"You can set the functions by using different gestures, " said Peter Chew,
promotion director of ITRI's 3D System and Application Division. "For example,
you can make a fist to zoom in on an image and wave your hand to turn the page."</P>
      <P>This application can be used in the fields of advertising, gaming, or even
medical treatment, he said.</P>
      <P>"The technology will be applied in physical rehabilitation by using hand
gestures to change the 3D images, " said Chew, adding that patients will have
more fun with such interaction.</P>
      <P>Asked which manufacturer is interested and when the product will hit the market,
Chew said it is too early to say.</P>
      <P>Wii, a Japanese home video game console that was released a few years ago, is
now being used in settings like hospitals, nursing homes and clinics for all
types of rehab devices.</P>
      <P>Chew said that 3D digital signage is just the beginning and he is optimistic
about the future of its applications.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's FTA goals achievable: expert</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 2 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will be able to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries as
long as it does not seek to forge such pacts for political purposes, said a U.S.
expert on cross-strait affairs Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Bonnie Glaser, a senior research fellow with the Washington-based Center for
Strategic and International Studies, told the Central News Agency that she does
not think " Beijing is adamantly opposed to Taiwan signing economic agreements
with other countries, but it does have some concerns, and perhaps even
prcondictions."</P>
      <P>A spokesman for China's foreign ministry said the previous day that "Beijing is
opposed to Taiwan signing any agreements 'of an official nature' with foreign
countries, but it maintains a hands-off policy with regard to Taiwan developing
unofficial trade and economic relations with them."</P>
      <P>Glaser said that, first of all, Beijing might insist that Taiwan use a moniker
in such agreements that is consistent with past practice. Taiwan was admitted
into the World Trade Organization (WTO) under the name "the Separate Customs
Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu."</P>
      <P>Secondly, she said, China could insist that Taiwan give priority to negotiating
a cross-strait economic agreement and that there be no linkage between the ECFA
and other FTAs.</P>
      <P>Finally, Beijing could stipulate that other counties sign FTAs with China first,
before considering Taiwan, she said.</P>
      <P>However, Glaser said, none of those concerns or preconditions would be
"insurmountable barriers" to Taiwan signing trade pacts with other countries.</P>
      <P>Glaser said that she believes that Beijing will not stand in the way of Taiwan's
inclusion in the regional economic process, in light of China President Hu
Jintao's statement last December that China will give due consideration to
Taiwan in this regard.</P>
      <P>Besides, under the framework of the WTO, economic agreements among members are
permitted, Glaser said, adding that China does not have reasonable grounds on
which to oppose such agreements.</P>
      <P>"As long as Taiwan does not seek to use the signing of economic agreements with
other countries for political purposes, as was done in the past when Chen Shui-
bian was president, this (signing of FTAs) is a goal that is achievable  under
President Ma Ying-jeou's leadership," she said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a visiting European Commission official declined to comment on
China's latest remark on the possibility of Taiwan signing FTAs with other
countries.</P>
      <P>Mauro Petriccione, head of the commission's Directorate General of Trade (B) ,
said before a European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) luncheon that he was
not sure exactly how China had voiced its opposition and therefore he could not
comment.</P>
      <P>Addressing the luncheon, Petriccione said that "we will continue to work with
Taiwan and watch what happens with the ECFA and its possible implications."</P>
      <P>Upon arrival in Taiwan on May 28, Petriccione told Taiwanese officials that
there should be further assessment of the possibility of a free trade agreement
between Taiwan and European Union.</P>
      <P>During a meeting the same day on Taiwan-EU trade, Petriccione also asked
Taiwanese officials about the progress of the trade pact talks between Taiwan
and China, according to a Taiwanese official who was at the meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China should adopt new approach on Tiananmen: Ma</HEADLINE>

06/02/10  23:28:45
(By Garfie Li and Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called on China Wednesday to address issues related to
the Tiananmen Incident with a new approach.</P>
      <P>Ma issued the call in an interview with the BBC in Chinese two days ahead of the
21st anniversary of the incident, which occurred on June 4, 1989.</P>
      <P>Ma said that every year since the crackdown he has either participated in
activities commemorating the incident or has issued a statement.</P>
      <P>He told the BBC that he has always been concerned about the incident as it was a
historic event connected to human rights. The Chinese government has to face it
squarely and take steps to heal wounds, sort out the feelings of injustice and
ease the pain of victims and their families, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that similar events have taken place in other countries,
including the 228 Incident and the White Terror Era in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident refers to the anti-government uprising that began in February
1947 and subsequently led to a brutal crackdown by the then Kuomintang-led
government that is widely believed to have resulted in thousands of deaths.</P>
      <P>The White Terror Era refers to a crackdown on advocates of communism, Taiwan
independence and democratic reforms by the KMT in the 1950s and 1960s.</P>
      <P>The crackdown measures adopted during the martial law era from 1949-1987 are now
considered a main source of the problem.</P>
      <P>Taking Taiwan's experience in handling the aftermath of the incidents as an
example, Ma said the government opted to face the facts and take measures to
heal wounds caused by the incidents.</P>
      <P>It is inevitable  that the government has to assume full responsibility when
armed conflict breaks out, the president said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the circumstances in China now are totally different than when the
Tiananmen Incident occurred, Ma said that it is time to do something about it.</P>
      <P>On cross-Taiwan Strait issues, Ma said he did not see an immediate need for
leaders of Taiwan and China to meet, and that it is more important to lay a
solid foundation for future development.</P>
      <P>For example, Ma said that though leaders of South Korea and North Korea have
met, there has been little progress made in other areas.</P>
      <P>The president said he has no plan to invite Chinese leaders to visit Taiwan and
did not expect leaders in the other side to invite him to China.</P>
      <P>He also said he is glad to see improvements in cross-strait relations and will
work to allow the two sides to engage in closer interactions under a peaceful
atmosphere.</P>

sinking four Japanese aircraft carriers and battleships as well as six transport
ships.

2000: Republic of China Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen visits the offshore islands
of Tungyin and Matsu, his first visit to the frontline islands since he assumed
the post on May 20.

2001: Chang Jung-kung, director of the Kuomintang's Mainland Affairs Department,
says that the 1989 crackdown on the unarmed pro-democracy students in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square is a major factor which has driven the Chinese communists
toward a more open society.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "There are three kinds of errors to which men are
liable when in the presence of their superiors. First, to speak out when one is
not called upon to speak: that is called being forward. Second, to keep silent
when called upon to speak: that is called being disingenuous. Third, to speak
out without taking into consideration the expression in the eyes of the person
spoken to: that is called blindness."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman Ma Zhaoxu on Tuesday expressed
Beijing's opposition to the establishment of official agreements between Taiwan
and other countries when asked about Taiwan's plan to negotiate free trade
agreements (FTAs) with its trade partners after concluding an economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>This statement means that signing the ECFA is not equal to gaining an
international pass to FTAs, as the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou
expected. What Beijing was trying to say was that the "Republic of China" was
not a country and that the Ma administration was only a "humble concubine" who
had no right to ask for an equal footing with China.</P>
      <P>The Referendum Screening Committee under the Executive Yuan will issue its
ruling Thursday night on whether a referendum initiative on the ECFA will be
permitted. This will be the best opportunity for the Ma administration to answer
the question of whether it is a "humble concubine."</P>
      <P>The Ma administration must not overlook the seriousness of this matter and
should allow the referendum to become the last democratic mechanism to protect
the Taiwanese people. (June 3, 2010)</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices extended momentum in mid-morning trade Thursday after
investors took cues from a jump on Wall Street overnight, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A rebound on the high-tech-rich NASDAQ also boosted buying in local

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Will China make dramatic concession on ECFA?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/03/10  11:29:37
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On the eve of Taiwan's announcement on whether to approve an initiative to hold
a referendum on a planned economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China, a Beijing official revealed that the number of Taiwanese industries or
services to benefit from the accord's "early harvest" program could reach 500.</P>
      <P>The number was far higher than Taiwan earlier expected. In a recent interview
with Reuters, Premier Wu Den-yih said Taiwan wants at least 300 items included
in the "early harvest" list for tariff concessions or easier market access
terms.</P>
      <P>Also on Wednesday, President Ma Ying-jeou reaffirmed in an interview with BBC
his administration's plan to sign an ECFA with China in June, but he added that
a specific date has yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>Ma acknowledged in the interview that Taiwan hopes its ECFA deal with China will
facilitate its bid to sign similar pacts or free trade agreements (FTAs) with
other countries and asked China not to stand in Taiwan's way to realize its
ultimate goal.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>A Chinese official in charge of Taiwan affairs mentioned for the first time
Wednesday that the number of Taiwanese goods and services to be subject to
tariff waivers or preferential market access terms under the ECFA's "early
harvest" program may reach as high as 500.</P>
      <P>The disclosure of the possibility of China making a dramatic concession to
Taiwan over the "early harvest" list came after a Chinese foreign ministry
official's recent reaffirmation of Beijing's objection to Taiwan signing FTAs
with other countries drew broadsides from Taiwan's opposition camp.</P>
      <P>Noting that concluding negotiations on the "early harvest" list marks the first
step to signing the ECFA, the Chinese official said China will refrain from
asking Taiwan to offer the same preferential treatment to its industries and
services as it offers Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked about his view on the Chinese official's remarks, Deputy Minister of
Economic Affairs Lin Sheng-chung said that as ECFA negotiations are still
ongoing, he cannot make any comments.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-hsiang is scheduled to head for
Japan Thursday to attend a ministerial meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) .</P>
      <P>Industry sources said Shih will meet with Chinese Minister of Commerce Chen
Deming on the sidelines of the APEC meeting, with ECFA issues high on their talk
agenda. The Shih-Chen meeting may lead to a final settlement of the "early
harvest" list, the sources said. (June 3, 2010).</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>President Ma said in the interview with BBC that Taiwan hopes China will refrain
from impeding its efforts to sign FTAs with other countries because such accords
are vital to Taiwan's sustainable growth.</P>
      <P>"As WTO full members, both Taiwan and China have the right to forge free trade
relationships with other WTO members, " Ma said, adding that China should not
interfere with Taiwan's FTA negotiations with other WTO members.</P>
      <P>On the planned ECFA deal with China, Ma said the main purpose is to  normalize
the  existing  flourishing  cross-Taiwan  Strait relationship. He also stressed
that if there is any possibility that Taiwan's rights will be harmed by the
pact, he would rather see ECFA negotiations collapse than have the deal go
through. (June 3, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The Referendum Screening Committee under the Executive Yuan will meet Thursday
evening to decide whether an opposition party-proposed referendum initiative on
the ECFA will be permitted.</P>
      <P>The meeting is expected to begin at 6 p.m. and last less than three hours. It
remains uncertain whether all of the committee's 21 members will be present at
the session. As of Wednesday evening, several members had yet to confirm whether
they would attend.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union Chairman Huang Kun-huei urged
the committee members to respect people's right to have a say on the critical
trade pact with China by approving the referendum initiative.</P>
      <P>The main opposition Democratic Progressive Party also said it will consider
whether to mount a large-scale street protest if the referendum initiative is
rejected. (June 3, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: DPP's position toward Songshan Airport</HEADLINE>

06/03/10  11:40:10
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>used to have a proposal to relocate Taipei's Songshan Airport to make way for a
park there. Su Tseng-chang, the DPP's candidate for the year-end Taipei mayoral
election, is reportedly struggling whether to follow his party's "anti-Songshan
Airport" policy.</P>
      <P>With Songshan Airport set to launch direct flights to Shanghai's Hongqiao
Airport, Tokyo's Haneda Airport and Seoul's Gimpo Airport, Su's hesitance
demonstrates that he is aware that the trend cannot be blocked by himself or the
DPP.</P>
      <P>The revival of Songshan Airport is partly thanks to a change in airport managing
concepts that has been taking place internationally in recent years. Hongqiao
Airport, for example, redefined its status from a domestic airport to a
"regional airport" after completing a runway and terminal expansion project in
March.</P>
      <P>Another example is Haneda Airport,  which was reopened to international flights
after Japan felt the threat from South Korea. Maintaining direct links with 28
Japanese cities, Korea's Incheon International Airport was replacing Japan's
Narita International Airport as the favorite transit venue for Japanese citizens
traveling abroad. In other words, Incheon Airport's openness and close-knit
international network have greatly enhanced its competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The direct link between Songshan and Hongqiao symbolizes not only closer ties
between Taipei and Shanghai, but also rosier prospects for Taipei in the East
Asian aviation network. We want to remind Su to find a proper position for
Songshan Airport in his policy platform. (June 3, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A music ensemble from Taiwan called Sheng Dong, or as it translates in English,
A Moving Sound, touched the heart of England Tuesday with a poetic musical
performance.</P>
      <P>Lead singer Mia Hsieh, her husband -- ensemble director Scott Prairie -- and
four other musicians put on their Taiwan Show at RichMix art center in eastern
London, attracting a capacity crowd, including leading music critics.</P>
      <P>The group's unique musical expression fuses Taiwanese, Chinese and neighboring
Asian musical influences in modern song compositions, fusing traditional and
modern art.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's vocals and dance were performed with music from Chinese instruments such
as the vertically held and bowed erhu and the Chinese zhongruan, or "moon
guitar, " as well as Western guitar and hand drums.</P>
      <P>They performed 11 pieces created or adopted between 2004-2010, including
"Wedding, ""Dombra, " "Fire, " "Ganesh, " and the energetic "Marketplace."</P>
      <P>Mo Hua-wei, Taiwan's deputy representative in London, was among the audience.
"The show was indeed impressive," he said.</P>
      <P>"Despite its small size, the ensemble makes itself a great citizen diplomacy
front," Mo told the Central News Agency.</P>

      <P>Major Taiwanese notebook computer producers that run production facilities in
China said Thursday they will not raise wages at their Chinese plants after
Foxconn Technology Group announced a 30 percent pay hike for its Chinese
workers.</P>
      <P>Foxconn, which has been accused of mistreating its Chinese workers, announced
the pay raise in an attempt to overcome public criticism and assuage its
employees after a string of suicides at its Shenzhen complex left 10 dead and
two injured.</P>
      <P>Shares of Foxconn's parent company Hon Hai Precision Industry suffered heavy
selling on Taiwan's stock exchange Wednesday -- a day after the pay hike
announcement -- on fears the pay increase would hurt the company's bottom line.</P>
      <P>Daiwa-Cathay Capital Markets analyst Calvin Huang said Wednesday that Foxconn's
move is expected to trigger a chain effect, prompting other Taiwanese investors
on the mainland to follow suit.</P>
      <P>Compal Electronics President Chen Jui-tsung, however, said that his company
issued a pay raise last year and that its pay scale meets the demand set by
authorities.</P>
      <P>Chen said Compal, which operates plants in Kunshan of eastern Jiangsu Province,
has no plans for another raise but will give extra rewards to employees who
achieve the company's production target.</P>
      <P>Quanta Computer Vice Chairman Liang Tzu-chen said his company also follows the
requirements of the Chinese government in employee compensation, adding that
Quanta's wages are above the minimum.</P>
      <P>Liang said Quanta, which runs production facilities in Jiangsu Province, has
tried hard to improve the working environment and hopes its employees can take
advantage of the company's efforts and get along well with each other.</P>
      <P>Wistron Corp.  officials said their company has been very competitive in
employee compensation, so it sees no need to consider a pay hike for the moment.</P>

      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung talked about Taiwan's
assistance to Haiti and other plans to help the recovery of the quake-ravaged
Caribbean country, at a Haiti aid summit Wednesday in the Dominican Republic.</P>
      <P>At the summit that was opened by Dominican President Leonel Fernandez, Chen said
the Taiwan government will deliver on its promise to help with the post-quake
reconstruction  in Haiti, according to a press release by the Embassy of the
Republic of China in the Dominican Republic.</P>
      <P>Chen also told Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive that he and the Taiwan
delegation will visit Haiti after the summit to get a first-hand look at the
reconstruction work there and to see what is needed.</P>
      <P>Since Haiti was struck by a 7.0-magnitude earthquake Jan. 12, the Taiwan
government has been working with private charities and non-governmental
organizations to send medical and reconstruction teams and emergency supplies to
the Caribbean ally.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also offered some debt relief to Haiti in the form of about US$12 to
US$13 million in loan interest payments and a five-year suspension of principal
payments.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan has promised to provide Haiti with about US$10 million in
aid annually over the next decade through bilateral cooperation projects.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's total aid package to Haiti over the next decade is estimated at around
US$121.37 million.</P>

      <P>The R. William Jones Cup International Invitational Tournament, Taiwan's top
international hoop event, will be held from July 13-21, a Taiwan basketball
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Seven men's teams and five women's teams will participate in the annual
tournament in Taipei County's Sinjhuang Stadium, said Lee Yi-chung, deputy
secretary-general of the Chinese Taipei Basketball Association (CTBA), Taiwan's
top basketball governing body.</P>
      <P>Host Taiwan will field its national teams and university all-star teams in both
the men's and women's competitions, Lee said. Several of Taiwan's national
players have injuries, however, and have said they will sit out in order to be
in better shape to prepare for the Asian Games, which will be held in Guangzhou,
China in November.</P>
      <P>Among the men's participating teams are Japan's national team, Lebanon's
national team, Iran's national second team, a club team from western Australia
and the Philippines' national team.</P>
      <P>Lee said he expected the Philippine team to be the top box office draw as usual
because there are many overseas Filipino workers in Taiwan and because Filipinos
are known for their passion for basketball.</P>
      <P>"Moreover, this Philippine team was selected to compete for a berth in the Asian
zone for the 2012 London Olympics. I think the team will be highly competitive,
" Lee said.</P>
      <P>In the women's competition, Japan, Kazakhstan and Lebanon will send their
national teams to compete with the two home teams.</P>
      <P>The Jones Cup started in 1977 as an invitational tourney with national teams,
club teams and university teams mainly from the Asian region. It was named after
Renato William Jones, one of the founders and former  secretary-general  of the

      <P>Ahead of a China-Japan-South Korea leadership summit in late May, South Korean
President Lee Myung-bak proposed launching negotiations with China in the second
half of 2010 or the first half of 2011 on the establishment of a Korea-China
free trade area.</P>
      <P>Seoul is eager to open free trade talks with Beijing partly because Taiwan will
soon sign an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China. With 70
percent of Taiwan's exports to China overlapping with those of South Korea,
Seoul is afraid that it might lose its edge in the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>This tells us that when working hard toward the goal of forging the ECFA with
China, Taiwan should also realize that it is racing against time.  Any foul-up
by Taiwan could throw it into an unfavorable situation.</P>
      <P>The proposed China-Japan-South Korea free trade area was on the agenda of the
summit. Regrettably, Taiwan is again being excluded from the golden economic and
trade triangle in Northeast Asia, after having been shut out from the Southeast
Asian free trade area.</P>
      <P>How to break through  the impasse  is an issue that the administration of

      <P>The number of foreign students at Taiwan universities and colleges reached a
record high in 2009, according to the Ministry of Education (MOE) Thursday.</P>
      <P>The total number of students from abroad studying for degrees, learning
Mandarin, or engaged in exchange programs was 22,300 last year, the latest MOE
figures showed.</P>
      <P>"The majority of the foreign students in Taiwan in 2009 were from Southeast Asia
and India, " said CJ Liu, Director General of the MOE's Bureau of International
Cultural and Educational Relations.</P>
      <P>A breakdown of the 2009 figures shows that Asian students accounted for 72.7
percent of the total; students from North, South and Central America 17 percent;
European students 5.4 percent, African students 3.2 percent, and South Pacific
Islanders 1.64 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>"One of the goals we are focusing on is increasing the number of degree students
studying in Taiwan, " said Lu, noting that the number foreign degree students in
Taiwan last October was 7,764, an increase of more than 30 percent from the
previous year.</P>
      <P>In order to attract more degree students from abroad, the MOE plans to promote a
better quality of teaching and an improved learning environment, rather than
increase the number of scholarships offered, he said.</P>
      <P>The government will push for internationalization of the language of instruction
and the learning environment at Taiwan universities, will try to forge links
with schools in other countries, and make the application process more
convenient for foreign students, he added.</P>
      <P>"We already have a high quality of teaching, an open learning environment and
lower fees, which make schools in Taiwan more competitive than those in other
countries," according to Liu.</P>
      <P>Most of the degree students in Taiwan in 2009 were from Vietnam, Malaysia,
Indonesia, South Korea and the United States, in that order, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Those studying Mandarin were mostly from the U.S., Japan, South Korea, Vietnam
and Indonesia, while the majority of exchange students were from Japan, the
U.S., South Korea, France and Germany, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should take a tougher stance against the deteriorating human rights
situation in China before Taiwanese nationals become victims of China's obscure
legal system, a group of lawyers said Thursday on the eve of the 21st
anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.</P>
      <P>Human rights lawyers from Hong Kong and Taiwan warned that if Taiwan continues
to turn a blind eye to China's human rights violations, "sooner or later, China-
based Taiwanese nationals will suffer," said Lin Feng-jen, executive director of
the Judicial Reform Foundation.</P>
      <P>The activists say China continues to detain, kidnap and torture human rights
lawyers who speak up against the government. Several lawyers have gone missing
while others had their license revoked for bucking the system, they said.</P>
      <P>Activists said that by being under the constant threats of the government,
lawyers have lost their vital role as protectors of citizens' rights.</P>
      <P>The group called on President Ma Ying-jeou, a Harvard-trained legal scholar, to
be mindful of China's human rights situation as he tries to forge closer trade
relations with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are expected to sign an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) next month. Since Ma took office in 2008, his administration
has been heavily accused by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party of being
too China-leaning.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the BBC on Wednesday, the president affirmed his plan to
issue a statement on the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre Friday as
he has done since the bloody crackdown in 1989.</P>
      <P>Over the last 21 years, the president said during the interview, China has made
dramatic changes and improvement.</P>
      <P>"I believe the Beijing government will undertake new measures on the issue and
by doing so, it will narrow the gap between people on both side of the [Taiwan
Strait] because the Taiwanese people are watching," he said. "We have always
been highly concerned about the issue, especially me." (By Jenny W. Hsu)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday that Beijing should not disrupt Taiwan's
efforts to forge free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries, stressing
that Taiwan must take this path because its economy is its lifeline.</P>
      <P>Ma made the statement, the third of its kind in two days, in a meeting at the
Presidential Office with a group of representatives of Taiwan business
associations in China.</P>
      <P>China's Foreign Ministry said Monday that Beijing is not opposed to Taiwan
conducting private trade and commerce exchanges with other countries,  but that
it objects to Taiwan clinching  official agreements with any country.</P>
      <P>"As a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) , Taiwan is eligible to sign
FTAs with other countries, " Ma noted. "This is clearly stipulated in the WTO
regulations."</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has inked four FTAs with its central American allies, which has
helped boost Taiwan's exports to those countries, Taiwan still needs to
establish FTAs with its major trading partner in order to achieve a similar
goal, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"Our main trading partner is China and that is why we have been seeking to
clinch a cross-strait trade agreement, " the president said, adding that Taiwan
cannot afford to ignore the vast China market.</P>
      <P>"We will first conclude the pact with China before approaching other countries,
" Ma said. "Taiwan must take that path for its own development and survival and
China should not foil Taiwan's efforts."</P>
      <P>According to Ma, Taiwan is aiming to clinch a cross-strait ECFA to lower tariffs
on exports to China, protect intellectual property rights and guarantee the
interests of Taiwan businesses there.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan companies are also welcome to return and invest at home," he said,
adding that the government  has been assessing the feasibility of building an
exclusive zone for foreign-based Taiwan businessmen.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 2.28 percent Thursday as buying focused on the
high-tech sector after investors witnessed a strong showing on Wall Street
overnight, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index closed up 164.57 points at 7,360.28, off a low of 7,309.46
and a high of 7,361.70, with turnover of NT$79.02 billion (US$2.45 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened 1.76 percent higher across the board on a 2.3 jump on the Dow
Jones average index overnight, and the momentum accelerated with growing
interest in electronics after a significant rebound on the tech-heavy NASDAQ
index, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,319 stocks closed up and 622 down, with 245 unchanged.</P>
      <P>The textile sector posted the largest gains, up 4.1 percent, while the machinery
and electronics sector closed up 2.5 percent, the financial sector rose 2.4
percent, the plastics and chemical sector was up 2.0 percent and the foodstuff
sector ended 1.6 percent higher.</P>
      <P>The paper and pulp, and construction sectors added 1.3 percent each, followed by
the cement sector's 1.2 percent rise.</P>
      <P>"Today's gains gave the market a breather as investors left behind concerns over
the pace of the global economic recovery, which had caused sell-off in the past
few sessions, " Concord Securities analyst Allan Lin said.</P>
      <P>"Judging from the buying, I think many investors have regained confidence to
some extent. After the gains, the local bourse has turned technically healthy,"
Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said he suspected foreign institutional investors served as the major
buyers, rushing to pick up high-tech stocks and taking advantage of their low
valuations after recent heavy selling.</P>
      <P>He said the electronics sector accounted for about 70 percent of the total
turnover as a driver of the gains on the broader market.</P>
      <P>Integrated circuit designer MediaTek closed at the day's high of NT$535.00, up
3.68 percent, with 5.60 million shares changing hands after Merrill Lynch
upgraded the company's earnings forecast, dealers said.</P>
      <P>Personal computer vendor Acer gained 5.19 percent to NT$79.10, and Hon Hai
Precision Industry added 4.60 percent to NT$125.00.</P>
      <P>Lin said, however, that investors should watch out for technical resistance if
the market rises to about 7,450 points.</P>
      <P>"Turnover remained moderate today despite the gains. Unless it grows to NT$90
billion or above, it is not easy for the market to jump over the technical
hurdles," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Andre Agassi and Marat Safin, two of the biggest names -- and personalities --
in men's tennis in the past 15 years, will play a series of exhibition matches
in Taiwan early next year, the promoter of the event confirmed Thursday.</P>
      <P>Agassi and Safin will play in best-of-three matches (with the third set a first-
to-10-points super-tiebreaker) at the Taipei Arena on Jan. 6, 2011 and at the
Kaohsiung Arena on Jan. 8, 2011.</P>
      <P>Jeff Hsu, the CEO of the event promoter Integration Sports Inc., said the two
stars have plenty to offer to Taiwan's tennis scene.</P>
      <P>"We know that Agassi and Safin are really well-known in Taiwan, so we did our
best to invite them to play. They'll bring character, experience, and a passion
for tennis.</P>
      <P>Both matches will be preceded by a single set match between Taiwan's top pros Lu
Yen-hsun and Jimmy Wang and followed by a set of doubles.</P>
      <P>Hsu would not reveal the appearance fees being paid to the two stars, but he
said staging the event will cost a total of NT$75 million.</P>
      <P>A first round of advanced ticket sales will take place in mid-June, and tickets
will also be available online beginning in early August. Hsu said ticket prices
will range between NT$800 and NT$10,000, with the average about NT$3,700 for the
roughly 12,000 seats available in Taipei and 14,000 in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Dedicated Web site and Facebook pages for the event should be ready by mid-June
to keep fans informed of the latest developments, he said.</P>
      <P>Though both players have retired from the men's ATP Tour, they continue to play
exhibitions around the world and should raise the game's profile in Taiwan,
which has long been starved of top-flight sports events.</P>
      <P>Tennis, especially, has suffered because of a lack of a tennis center that would
meet the ATP's tough requirements.</P>
      <P>"Most countries around Asia have held major tennis events that market their
cities. Only Taiwan's fans haven't been able to enjoy such an event," because of
the facility problem, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"So to get world-class players to come to Taiwan without having to comply with
the ATP's many strict regulations, we felt holding an 'invitational' event was
more feasible."</P>
      <P>Negotiations began with CAA, the agency for both Agassi and Safin, in early
March, and the contract was finalized Thursday. Hsu felt both players can still
perform at a very high level.</P>
      <P>"They are still very, very good if they just play two out of three in one day.
They may not be able to win a real grand slam, but their experience and skill
are still there," he said.</P>
      <P>Safin and Agassi split six ATP and Davis Cup matches during their lengthy
careers, with Safin winning both of their grand slam encounters in five sets.</P>
      <P>Getting Agassi and Safin for the event is a fairly low-risk proposition because
of their high name recognition and limited schedule, which means they are less
likely to pull out with injuries or save themselves for the year's first grand
slam, the Australian Open, to be played roughly two weeks later.</P>
      <P>Even Safin's reputation for being unpredictable should not be an issue, Hsu
indicated.</P>
      <P>"Since we've signed the contract, CAA will do their best to secure this. I did
talk to them about this, and they said I don't need to worry," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>If nothing else, Agassi and Safin should put on quite a show. Agassi, who
retired after the US Open in 2006, won eight grand slam titles and 60 singles
titles during a topsy-turvy 21 years on the men's tour, ranking No. 1 in the
world in 1995, 1999, 2000 and 2003 but also dropping to No. 140 in 1997.</P>
      <P>When he won the French Open in 1999, he became only the fifth player in men's
tennis history to have won a career grand slam (winning the Australian Open,
French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open), and he also won a men's singles Olympic
gold medal in Atlanta in 1996.</P>
      <P>Safin, who retired last year, won two grand slams, the 2000 US Open and 2005
Australian Open, but was often derailed by injuries and a mercurial temperament.</P>
      <P>"I am not perfect and neither was my career. In the end tennis is like life,
messy, " is how Safin summed up his body of work. But he told retired player

    <HEADLINE>MECO welcomes report of Taiwan-Philippines free trade talks</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 3 (CNA)
06/03/10  16:44:12
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Philippines' representative office in Taiwan said it welcomed  the reported
plans for Taiwan  and the Philippines to hold talks on a free trade agreement
(FTA).</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan officials have been cautious in their responses to the report on
the sensitive issue.</P>
      <P>A Philippines newspaper, the Business Mirror, on Monday quoted Philippines Trade
Secretary Jesli A. Lapus as saying that officials from Manila and Taipei will
start talks on a "mini-FTA" on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Sapporo, Japan this week.</P>
      <P>"This is of course a welcome development from MECO's perspective, if it is
correct, but as the (trade) secretary said, it is still at an exploratory
stage," said Antonio Basilio, resident representative and managing director of
the Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO) in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shih Yen-hsiang, who is leading the Taiwan delegation to the June 5-6
APEC Meeting of Ministers Responsible for Trade, declined to comment directly on
the report prior to his departure, saying only that the APEC meeting focuses on
multilateral trade discussions rather than bilateral talks.</P>
      <P>According to the newspaper report, Lapus said he will seek a meeting with his
Chinese counterpart to ask about the contents of a prospective economic
agreement between China and Taiwan and to seek Beijing's opinion on whether a
full-blown trade deal would conflict with its "one-China policy."</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan and the Philippines are working on a mini-FTA under  the
so-called  Subic-Clark-Kaoshiung  Economic  Corridor Agreement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is hoping that the conclusion of the cross-strait economic cooperation
framework  agreement  (ECFA)  will help boost its competitiveness in the global
market and help pave the way for FTAs with other countries, without China's
interference.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is reportedly hoping to sign FTAs with Singapore and the Philippines
after the ECFA is completed.</P>
      <P>However, China's foreign ministry said Wednesday that Beijing is opposed to
Taiwan signing free trade agreements (FTAs) with any country. In response,
President Ma Ying-jeou said that Taiwan "is entitled to sign any trade deals
with other WTO (World Trade Organization) members and this right cannot be
interfered with for any reason."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) deputy spokesman James Chang said
Thursday that the ministry "had not received information about Taiwan
negotiating (trade deals) with any specific country or countries, but we believe
that the easing of cross-strait tensions will help create an atmosphere in which
Taiwan can secure FTAs with other countries."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs said in a Cabinet meeting Thursday that it
plans to spend NT$1.1 billion (US$34.2 million) between 2010 and 2013 to promote
Taiwanese food overseas.</P>
      <P>The program will be aimed at helping to establish 3,500 new stores in Taiwan and
abroad, generate 10,000 jobs in Taiwan, add 50 new international food brands,
train 1,000 workers "with global vision " and create 500 business cooperation
opportunities, as well as spur NT$2 billion- worth of private investment, the
ministry said.</P>
      <P>To push for the globalization of Taiwanese food in local terms, the ministry
will set up a think tank to promote Taiwanese delicacies through experience-
sharing  among food stores and food service establishments and will designate a
street in Taipei dedicated to local fine food that will hold international food
fairs to attract tourists from Taiwan and overseas.</P>
      <P>It also plans to organize training courses for chefs and send them to compete in
international culinary competitions.</P>
      <P>To allow renowned Taiwanese chefs to demonstrate their skills, the ministry will
arrange events and seek to hold international culinary contests for them to show
their skills.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, to give Taiwanese delicacies a presence in other countries, the
ministry will devise an incentive mechanism to encourage Taiwanese restaurants
to set up overseas stores and will try to persuade overseas shopping centers to
stock a variety of Taiwanese fine food brands.</P>
      <P>In addition, it will make efforts to establish a unified translation system for
menu terms and dishes and produce promotional brochures that will be distributed
overseas.</P>
      <P>After being briefed on the issue, Premier Wu Den-yih said that more needs to be
done to integrate the resources of various central and local government agencies
and private enterprises and groups.</P>
      <P>He said the program should also include Hakka food and added that an overseas
credit guarantee fund managed by the Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission
should relax its rules for loans to overseas Taiwanese food store operators to
help promote Taiwanese fine food abroad.</P>

      <P>The time is not right for Taiwan and Iran to develop closer relations, despite a
strong desire by both sides to do so, a Taiwan foreign ministry official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Iran both intend to boost their already strong trade relationship but
"the time is not right" to take the bilateral relations to the next level, said
Lin Jinn-jong, director-general of the Department of West Asian Affairs under
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), at a press briefing.</P>
      <P>As the international community has been contemplating sanctions against Iran
because of its nuclear energy policies, "it's not appropriate at this moment to
step up exchanges (with Iran) , " Lin said.</P>
      <P>On May 21, the Associated Press reported that Taiwan had turned down a request
by Iran to open a "diplomatic mission" in Taiwan. Taiwan's Foreign Minister
Timothy C.T. Yang rebutted the report May 25, saying that his ministry has not
received any request from Iran to open a trade office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Iran is Taiwan's third largest oil supplier after Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait and the annual two-way trade volume is valued at a peak of US$5.6
billion.</P>
      <P>"However, the real trade volume could exceed that figure because some deals were
done via the Dubai Free Zone," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan External Trade Development Council established an office in Tehran in
1992.</P>
      <P>According to Bureau of Foreign Trade statistics, the total trade volume between
Taiwan and Iran,  Taiwan's 25th-largest trading partner, was US$2.5 billion in
2009. Most of Taiwan's imports, valued at US$1.98 billion, were petroleum
products.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called Thursday for China's cooperation in clamping down
on the cross-Taiwan Strait trafficking  of illegal narcotics,  under the
framework  of a Taiwan-China judicial assistance accord.</P>
      <P>"International and Chinese cooperation should help the government more
effectively fight the trafficking of drugs from China to Taiwan by cutting the
supply chain, " the president told a national anti-drug meeting, held every year
since 1993, when Ma served as minister of justice.</P>
      <P>During  Ma's tenure as justice  minister,  law enforcement authorities seized
the country's largest-ever haul of illegal drugs -- 336 kg -- in Chiayi County.</P>
      <P>Although the rate of inmates convicted of drug trafficking or abuse has dropped
from 60 percent to 42 percent -- about 24,000 prisoners -- Ma said their
recidivism rate remains as high as 90 percent and that the government's top task
now is to lower this rate by reducing consumption and breaking the supply chain.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday that he foresees enhanced relations between
Taiwan and Hong Kong after the establishment of a cooperative platform between
the two sides.</P>
      <P>Wu was referring to the Taipei-based Taiwan-Hong Kong Economic and Cultural Co-

governments of the two sides recently to handle mutual exchanges.</P>
      <P>Wu, after hearing a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) report on the Taiwan-Hong
Kong platform at a Cabinet meeting, said that Hong Kong was Taiwan's fourth-
largest trading partner last year, with bilateral trade totaling US$30.6 billion
and 2.86 million travelers between the two.</P>
      <P>He asked government agencies to make good use of the platform to further
exchanges  with Hong Kong in the fields of finance, transportation, investment,
education and culture.</P>
      <P>In a ceremony marking the opening of the Taiwan council May 26, MAC Chairwoman
Lai Shin-yuan said that the council and its Hong Kong counterpart will deal not
only with issues related to civilian exchanges, but also with issues involving
"official matters" on the two sides.</P>
      <P>Former Finance Minister Lin Chen-kuo serves as the chairman of the council,

      <P>Hong Kong's role as a major transit hub for trade and tourism between Taiwan and

    <HEADLINE>2009 mortality rate down: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 3 (CNA)
06/03/10  17:41:47
(By Karen Chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's mortality rate was down in 2009, at 616.3 deaths per every 100,000
people, marking the first year-on-year decline in the past 12 years, according
to Department of Health (DOH) tallies released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The DOH suggested that the decline could be related to a decline in the number
of deaths caused by chronic disease.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the average lifespan of Taiwanese women was 6.6 years longer than
that of their male counterparts in 2009, according to the tallies.</P>
      <P>Life expectancy among Taiwanese women was an average of 82.5 years in 2009,
compared to 75.9 years for men, said Chao Kun-yu, deputy director-general of the
DOH's Bureau of Health Promotion.</P>
      <P>During the 1940s, Taiwanese women's lifespans were about three years longer than
men, gradually increasing to 4.5 years in the 1950s and 6.5 years by 2008.</P>
      <P>In 2009, 142,240 people died in Taiwan, representing a slight decrease from the
2008 level and the first decline of its kind in 12 years, according to the
tallies.</P>
      <P>Cancer remained the top killer for the 28th consecutive year, claiming 39,917
lives or 28.1 percent of the total figure of the 2009 mortalities, according to
the DOH.</P>
      <P>Cancer caused a death every 13 minutes and 10 seconds in 2009, 20 seconds faster
than the previous year, according to the figures.</P>
      <P>A total of 217.4 per 100,000 male cancer patients died in 2009, compared to
127.8 females, meaning that the male cancer mortality rate was 1.7 times higher
than that of the female rate, according to the tallies.</P>
      <P>Rounding out the top 10 killers list were heart disease, cerebrovascular
disease,  pneumonia, diabetes, accidents,  lower respiratory tract disease,
chronic liver disease, suicide, and nephritis, in that order, according to the
DOH figures.</P>
      <P>Of the 10 categories, only the number of deaths from accidents increased in
2009, up by 2.6 percent year on year. Chao attributed the increase mainly to
Typhoon Morakot, which claimed 614 lives and left 75 others unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH figures, the overall death rate of suicides in Taiwan
dropped by 1.9 percent in 2009. However, the suicide mortality rates of people
in the 15-24 and 45-64 age groups increased.</P>
      <P>The suicide mortality rate among males was 2.2 times higher than that among
females, according to the figures.</P>
      <P>Chang Chia-ming, a psychiatrist with the Department of Psychiatry of the Chang
Gung Medical Center, attributed the higher suicide mortality rate among males to
the facts that they tend to choose more effective ways to end their lives and
that most men decline to seek consultation before committing suicide.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Chu Kai-yu,  chief  secretary  of the Lifeline Association, Taipei,
said more suicidal people had called a helpline since the hotline's inception in
2008.</P>
      <P>The suicide counselling service hotline, jointly run by the DOH and the
association, served some 40,000 people in 2008, a number that increased to over
60,000 in 2009, according to Chu, who added that the hotline intervention
stopped 143 people from committing suicide in two years.</P>

      <P>For organizers who sidestep the requirement, the institutions in which they work
will be subject to fines of between NT$100,000 (US$3,103) and NT$1 million.</P>
      <P>Research institutions should monitor and check all research they approve and
must suspend or drop it if irregularities are found.</P>
      <P>The research should be limited to subjects with compos mentis and should obtain
their prior consent, while in the case of infants and cadavers, consent of next
of kin is required.</P>
      <P>However, the compos mentis requirement may be waived in research that will
benefit "special" groups of people or people with "special" diseases.</P>
      <P>No jail inmates should be research subjects unless there are no alternatives to
their use.</P>
      <P>Researchers should inform their study subjects, or their next of kin, legal
agents, guardians or assistants, in layman's terms, of the purpose and methods
of the research, the name of the research institute involved, the providers of
the funds and the rights of the research subjects.</P>
      <P>Neither the organizers nor the members of the research team should divulge

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged the government Thursday
not to use administrative intervention to hinder a referendum on a planned
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>The DPP criticized President Ma Ying-jeou for only verbally calling on China not
to obstruct Taiwan from signing free trade agreements (FTAs) with other
countries after Chinese officials publicly said Taiwan is not a sovereign
independent country and warned other countries against signing FTAs with Taiwan
to avoid interfering in "China's internal affairs."</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Lin Yu-chang accused Ma of being weak and irresponsible in dealing
with the matter.</P>
      <P>The DPP's criticism came after China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Ma
Zhaoxu on Tuesday expressed Beijing's opposition to the establishment of
official agreements between Taiwan and other countries after being asked about
Taiwan's plan to negotiate FTAs with its trade partners after concluding the
ECFA.</P>
      <P>Lin asked what the president will do if China blocks Taiwan's FTA talks with
other countries after Taiwan signs the trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>The DPP suggested that Ma should ask China to promise not to do so in the trade
pact.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's Referendum Review Committee was slated to meet Thursday to
decide whether a referendum proposal initiated by the DPP and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) conforms to legal requirements.</P>
      <P>The government should ensure people's right to hold a popular referendum as it
is an essential safeguard for democracy, Lin said, while urging the
administration not to use political maneuvering or bureaucracy to hinder it.</P>
      <P>"This evening  is the best time to show whether  the Ma administration allows
referendums and protects Taiwan's democracy, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>To promote the referendum, the DPP will hold a rally in Kaohsiung on June 5.</P>
      <P>Ahead of the rally, the party will hold a "made in Taiwan" market fair featuring
locally made products and craftwork at Glory Pier that is expected to include
120 booths to help the party raise funds for the year-end special municipality
mayor elections.</P>
      <P>As a warm up to the rally, the DPP held a promotional event in Taipei Thursday
during which Lin Yu-kuo, a fruit farmer from Dashu Township in Kaohsiung County,
called on the government to come up with measures to protect Taiwan's
disadvantaged industries before signing the trade deal with China.</P>

      <P>The government will spend about NT$75 million (US$2.33 million) to help
traditional manufacturing companies integrate information and communication,
with the aim of increasing their combined production value by at least NT$1.8
billion by the end of this year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) under the MOEA, the
information and communications technology (ICT) project -- launched for
traditional manufacturing industries for the first time -- is also expected to
increase the country's private investment by more than NT$100 million by year-
end.</P>
      <P>A total of 30 projects applying ICT applications were selected from nearly 100
applications in April, with subsidies of between NT$2 million and NT$5 million
granted, an IDB official said.</P>
      <P>"Most traditional manufacturers  have slow response to new technologies, so the
government's move has made them aware of the importance of ICT applications," he
said.</P>
      <P>One of the chosen companies, Tex-Ray International, plans to integrate its smart
clothes products -- which can monitor heartbeat and provide electrocardiograms
(ECGs) -- with security system and medical service providers to develop an
individual health care service module that is expected to be sold to hospitals
and health centers and achieve around NT$80 million in production value in two
to three years, the official said.</P>
      <P>Sanitary wares supplier Hocheng Corp. (HCG) was selected for its planned project
to transform its business operation model from a pure sanitary wares supplier to
a solution  provider for all home facilities.</P>
      <P>Hocheng's project is expected to increase the company's sales by 5 percent and
sharply lower its after-sales costs by 30 percent by the end of this year, the
official said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a service team was also set up to provide consultation and evaluation
services to traditional manufacturers to enhance their understanding about ICT

      <P>Several Taiwanese merchants associations in China have decided to buy 600 metric
tons of bananas to help local banana farmers cope with a fall in the price of
the fruit, a leader of one of the associations said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The decision came after an announcement by the Council of Agriculture (COA) May
29 that 800 tons of bananas will be shipped to Beijing and Shanghai by the end
of June -- the first time the fruit will have been sold in China since 2006.</P>
      <P>Lin Rong-de,  honorary  chairman  of the Taiwan  Merchants Association in
China's Kunshan, said at a press conference that if banana prices keep falling,
they will bring even more bananas into China.</P>
      <P>A COA official said the bananas will be shipped to Xiamen City in southeastern
China.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang  Legislator  Huang Chao-shun,  who helped coordinate the sales
to Taiwanese businessmen in China, said she hopes the sales will help reduce
pressure on local banana farmers.</P>
      <P>Tainan Magistrate Su Huan-chih also announced a day earlier that he is scheduled
to visit Beijing and Shanghai June 15 to promote mango sales.</P>
      <P>Su said that top quality  mangoes  from his county  have successfully opened up

      <P>Microsoft Corp. opened a Software and Services Excellence Center (SSEC)  in
Taipei Thursday for the development of cloud computing-based technology in
collaboration with its Taiwan partners.</P>
      <P>Steven Guggenheimer, corporate vice president of Microsoft's original equipment
manufacturing division, announced the opening of the center on the sidelines of
Computex Taipei, the world's second largest computer fair that will run through
June 5.</P>
      <P>"The opening of the SSEC is a significant milestone for Microsoft and its
hardware partners in our collaboration for the development of additional
business opportunities in the area of cloud computing," he said.</P>
      <P>Microsoft said it will combine its research and development (R&amp;D) expertise
and technology leadership in software, services and cloud computing data center
technology with Taiwan's strength in hardware innovation.</P>
      <P>"Over the past two decades, hardware manufacturers in Taiwan have established
their global leadership in PCs, netbooks, cell phones, LCDs, and other IT
technologies, which is important for the global ICT (information communication
technology) industry," Guggenheimer said.</P>
      <P>The center is expected to create new business opportunities for Microsoft and
its Taiwanese partners, the company said.</P>
      <P>Cloud computing is a Web-enabled software solution based on the use of computer
technology to allow users who have no knowledge of or expertise in technology
infrastructure to carry out common business applications online.</P>
      <P>Through the center, Microsoft said, it also plans to license patents and share
its software development expertise with academic and R&amp;D institutes in
Taiwan to help the country develop its ICT industry.</P>
      <P>Representatives of Microsoft's partners in Taiwan, including Quanta Computer
Chairman Barry Lam and Inventec Corp Chairman Lee Shih-chin, attended the
opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>The center was established on the basis of a memorandum of understanding signed
between Microsoft and the Ministry of Economic Affairs in November 2009.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan contributes to global effort on wild tiger conservation</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 3 (CNA)
06/03/10  19:13:37
(By Jenny W. Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's wild tiger conservation efforts in recent years have proven successful,
but more can be done to protect the endangered animals, a Council of
Agricultural (COA) official said Thursday at a screening of a National
Geographic documentary about the seedy underworld of tiger trade and poaching in
Asia.</P>
      <P>According to Kuan Li-hao, director of the Forestry Bureau's Conservation
Division, during the 1970's, Taiwan had a problem with live tigers or tiger-
related products being imported into the island because there was no law
sanctioning such practices.</P>
      <P>However, with growing awareness and increased global efforts to save endangered
species, Taiwan enacted the Wildlife Conservation Act in June 1989, which
outlawed all imports and exports of wildlife, including live tigers and tiger-
related products, except for the purpose of scientific research or exhibition,
such as in zoos.</P>
      <P>Violators face a maximum fine of NT$1.5 million and five years imprisonment,
according to Taiwan's law.</P>
      <P>"The Taiwan authority takes the matter of smuggling of tiger and tiger parts
very seriously. It has been years since our last case, Kuan said, attributing
public vigilance as a major policing force in the effort.</P>
      <P>But he added that more can be done.</P>
      <P>Some Taiwanese people would bring back medicine made with tiger parts from
China, which is also illegal, Kuan said. Further increasing public awareness is
the best way to deal with this problem, he said.</P>
      <P>Tiger body parts have been long considered as potent natural elixirs in
traditional Chinese medicine as well as symbols of luck and prominence in
various Asian cultures.</P>
      <P>It is believed that alcoholic tonic made from tiger penis is a powerful
aphrodisiac and can improve virility in men and that tiger bones, when grounded
into power, can treat rheumatism and headaches.</P>
      <P>The government does not have a figure of the black market on tiger parts in
Taiwan, but officials said almost all of the so-called tiger penises sold in
traditional medicine shops are fakes, such as cow or dog penis.</P>
      <P>Each year, the COA provides funding to Taiwanese conservation groups, such as
the Society of Wildlife and Nature and other international organizations,
totalling around NT$10 million to NT$20 million to help with the worldwide
conservation work.</P>
      <P>According to National Geographic, there are approximately 3,500 tigers left in
the world X a significant drop from the 100,000 at the beginning of the 20th
century.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, there are 54 tigers spread out in three zoos as well as in the
government-sponsored tiger haven run by the National Pingtung University of
Science and Technology, Kuan said.</P>
      <P>The documentary will premier on Sunday June 6 at 9 a.m. on the National
Geographic Channel in Taiwan. The film will show agents from the Environmental
Investigation Agency (EIA) going under cover across China to investigate the
tiger smuggling operations and the illegal traders involved.</P>

      <P>New graduates in Taiwan tend to have difficulty making the transition from
school to the workplace and the wider world, the results of a survey by the 1111
Job Bank and Discovery Channel indicated Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to some 42 percent of the respondents, what they dread most is trying
new unfamiliar tasks, with 34.2 percent saying they would rather quit than
attempt to tackle the unknown.</P>
      <P>The poll suggests that fresh graduates in Taiwan are not ready to strike out on
their own, which could narrow their chances of building a career, said Charlene
Chang, spokeswoman for the 1111 Job Bank.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that new university graduates in Taiwan are unadventurous
in other areas, as 82 percent said they are afraid to travel alone.</P>
      <P>However, when asked if they would visit a cannibal village if they were given a
free trip there, 16 percent said yes.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the trend in Taiwan, Olly Steeds, host of Discovery Channel's new
adventure series "Solving History with Olly Steeds, " said he is looking forward
to sharing with Taiwan's college students his experience in facing challenges on
the job.</P>
      <P>Hailed by the international media as a "real-life Indiana Jones," Steeds said
his motto is "Adventures are a mark of incompetence."</P>
      <P>"I encourage young people around the world to go out there and make mistakes and
don't be afraid," he said.</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out among 1,177 respondents and had a margin of error of
2.9 percentage points.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan ground to a halt Thursday when the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) took issue with all the bills on the agenda in an
attempt to disrupt the last sitting of the session.</P>
      <P>Displeased  with  the  Internal  Administration  Committee's confirmation the
previous day of a May 10 decision to approve a revision of the Act Governing the
Relations Between the Peoples of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area to allow
Chinese students to enroll in local colleges, the opposition decided to go all
out to stonewall the sitting.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Chun-yi, secretary of the DPP Legislative Caucus, said the party
would not tolerate what it described as the ruling Kuomintang's (KMT's) contempt
for both legislative procedures and the opposition.</P>
      <P>"Unless  the  KMT  declares  null  and void  the Internal Administration
Committee's confirmation the previous day, the DPP will suspend negotiations
with the KMT, and the ruling party should be held responsible for the disruption
of the legislature," said Lee.</P>
      <P>However, Lin Hung-chih, secretary of the KMT's Legislative Caucus, and
Legislator Wu Yu-sheng, who presided over the Thursday meeting  of the Internal
Administration  Committee,  said the confirmation of the May 10 decision made
jointly by the Internal Administration Committee and the Education and Culture
Committee followed procedure to the letter.</P>
      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng agreed to look into the dispute by examining
a video  tape of the meeting  of the Internal Administration Committee to see
whether procedure was in fact followed properly.</P>
      <P>Noting that the present legislative session will last for two more days before
the session adjourns next Monday, the speaker said this is enough time to sort
out the differences.</P>
      <P>The DPP, which opposes closer ties with China, has pulled out all the stops to
sink the ruling party's policy of opening local colleges to Chinese students.</P>

      <P>Parents who let children under the age of 12 play with fireworks unsupervised
are now punishable under a recently revised law, the National Fire Agency said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The revised Firework  and Firecracker  Management  Act was implemented a day
earlier, the agency said, and includes changing the categories of fireworks and
increasing punishments for violations.</P>
      <P>The agency said parents or guardians will face fines of between NT$3,000 and
NT$15,000 if their children are caught playing with fireworks with no
supervision. Previously, the law only required them to accompany their children
while playing,  and there was no punishment if they failed to do so.</P>
      <P>Selling fireworks to children remains illegal and violators can still be fined
between NT$30,000 and NT$150,000 under the revised act.</P>
      <P>A new addition to the act is a prohibition on sales methods in which the age of
purchasers cannot be checked, such as vending machines and mail order.</P>
      <P>The agency said fireworks and firecrackers are now categorized by their usage in
the act, which includes those for general use and those for professional use.
Previous categories were high altitude fireworks and general fireworks.</P>
      <P>Professional fireworks include those used in films, on television and in public
pyrotechnic displays, and can only be set off by certified technicians.</P>

      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu drew the battle lines Thursday to fight crime in his
city, saying that he is determined to deal with the so-called "eight categories
of special business," which are regarded as covers for criminal activities.</P>
      <P>"As mayor of this city, I will not back down from a war against gangsters even
if my life is threatened, " he told reporters. "I do not expect to gain the
votes of those who work in those eight lines of business."</P>
      <P>Hu said some elements from those circles have threatened to have him removed as
mayor, as the Nov.27 mayoral elections approach.</P>
      <P>The eight categories of "special business" in Taiwan refer to entertainment-
related enterprises such as KTV clubs, saunas, night clubs, barber and massage
shops, dance halls, discotheques, and tea houses, many of which are said to be
run by organized gangs.</P>
      <P>Hu has come under strong pressure amid criticism of public order in Taichung
City after an alleged gang leader was shot dead by an unknown assailant at his
own company on May 28.</P>
      <P>In response to the incident that was the latest in a spate of high-profile
killings in the central Taiwan city, Hu pledged to crack down on gangs in the
city.</P>
      <P>It was later revealed that four police officers on the crime scene were chatting
and drinking tea when the shooting took place, which gave rise to rumors of
links between the local police and gangs.</P>
      <P>Two ranking police officers have been given a demerit by the National Police
Agency for what was deemed to be misconduct, while the other two were given a
strong warning.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah vowed Thursday to get to the bottom of
the killing regardless of who was involved.</P>
      <P>"We will not cover up any corruption among officials if firm evidence in this
regard is discovered," Jiang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Nantou police said Thursday that the gunman remained at large and his
whereabouts were unknown.</P>
      <P>The day after the shooting, the police found a vehicle near Sun Moon Lake, which
they later confirmed was the car used by the assailant to flee the crime scene.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is devising a fund-raising
mechanism for the year-end special municipality elections that will involve only
small amounts, a DPP official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The party plans to set up an association of DPP friends in July with the aim of
recruiting 10,000 members, each of whom will be required to make a monthly
donation ranging from NT$500-NT$1,000 via credit card, according to Hung Yao-fu,
DPP acting secretary-general.</P>
      <P>The mechanism is designed to become a fixed revenue stream for the party, Hung
said after a party meeting to discuss the DPP's campaign strategy for the year-
end elections.</P>
      <P>Wu Nai-jen, the DPP's election campaign manager, said that with the high
popularity of the five DPP candidates in the year-end elections, the party's
campaign spending for the elections might be less than the NT$70 million spent
on the 2009 three-in-one elections that included the elections for city mayors,
county magistrates, city and county councilmen and township chiefs.</P>
      <P>Wu said the DPP will do its utmost to win all five seats up for grab in the five
municipalities -- Taipei City, Xinbei City, Taichung City (a merger of Taichung
City and Taichung County), Tainan City (a merger of Tainan City and Tainan
County) and Kaohsiung City (a merger of Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County).</P>
      <P>When DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen took office in May 2008, the party was NT$200
million in debt, which has been reduced to NT$30 million, according to Hung.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's real estate agents have launched various marketing campaigns, including
a promising new house-hunting service on a mobile platform, in a bid to gain the
edge in fiercely competitive business, a broker said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Yung-ching Real Estate, since its mobile application was launched
in March, it has recorded a 20 percent increase in the number of prospective
buyers.</P>
      <P>The service allows registered online clients to view, rent or even buy
properties listed in the company's database of 150,000 entries, via their cell
phones.</P>
      <P>HB Housing and Sinyi Realty have also introduced various games on Facebook and
Plurk to attract buyers, with Sinyi Realty drawing 160,000 Facebook users in
five weeks, according to a media report.</P>
      <P>Another real estate agent TWHouse, which registered on Facebook in March, said
that it hopes to increase the number of its Facebook fans to 100,000 by the end
of September from the current 53,000, the report said.</P>
      <P>The competition in the real estate business has become quite fierce in the last
two to three years, as the number of realtors has been growing at a faster rate
than the number of deals, an executive of HB Housing said.</P>
      <P>In 2009, the number of real estate agents increased 84 percent to 4,165 from
2,262 in 2004, the company said.</P>

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) candidates for the year-end mayoral elections in two
northern Taiwan municipalities pledged Thursday to make concerted efforts to
promote co-prosperity for their respective cities.</P>
      <P>Hau Lung-bin and Eric Liluan Chu, who will run for the KMT in the mayoral
elections in Taipei City and Xinbei City -- an upgrade of Taipei County -- made
"Golden Decade and Co-prosperous Twin Cities" their joint campaign slogan at a
press conference that day.</P>
      <P>Hau, the incumbent Taipei mayor, said that with a combined population of 6.5
million -- over 25 percent of Taiwan's total -- the two cities should play a
leading role in sharpening Taiwan's competitive edge.</P>
      <P>"Close and well-concerted cooperation between the two cities will produce a 'one
plus one is greater than two' effect, " Hau said.</P>
      <P>"The locomotive with twin engines (Taipei and Xinbei cities) will surely lead
Taiwan to a 'golden decade' economically, " Hau added.</P>
      <P>Hau noted that seven of Taipei City's 10 additional mass rapid transit lines
that are either under construction or on the drawing board will run deep into
surrounding Xinbei City, making them a " two-in one" community.</P>
      <P>Chu, who resigned last month as vice premier to prepare for his election
campaign, advocated the creation of a " golden Taipei technology corridor" by
connecting existing and planned science parks in the two municipalities --
including the Neihu Technology Park, the Nankang Software Park, the Keelung
Valley Science Park and the Liudu Industrial Park.</P>
      <P>He also called for the establishment of an " innovative industry and green
energy industrial zone" by including the Keelung Valley Science Park in a free
trade zone of the Taipei Port, setting up an intellectual science park in Linkou
Township and linking it with the planned Taoyuan Aerotropolis.</P>
      <P>With this empowered technology corridor, Hau said, the two cities will in the
next decade turn into a "global research and development hub and an Asia-Pacific
operational center, in addition to becoming the headquarters for Taiwanese
enterprises worldwide."</P>
      <P>The elections -- scheduled for Nov. 27 in five municipalities -- are widely
regarded as a crucial indicator for the 2012 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The three other municipalities are Taichung City (a merger of Taichung city and
county) , Tainan City (a merger of Tainan city and county) and Kaohsiung City (a

      <P>A dragon boat team made up of women with breast cancer is set to race in
Taipei's Dragon Boat Festival on June 12 to raise awareness of the sports'
benefits to post-surgery rehabilitation, a spokesman from the Taipei City
Hospital said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The team composed of 22 members aged between 34 to 64 is the first team formed
by cancer patients in Taiwan, Chen Huo-mu, a director of General Surgery in
Taipei City Hospital said.</P>
      <P>Team members have undergone three-month  intensive training coached by students
from the Department of Physical Education of National Taiwan Normal University,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Dragon Boat Race is a part of patients' rehabilitation exercises that could
improve their health conditions, Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to a research study conducted by a Canadian sports medicine physician
Dr. Don McKenzie in the 1990s, dragon boat racing can help patients gain
physical strength, and reduce the formation of post-operation adhesions and
Lymphedema - localized fluid retention and tissue swelling caused by a
compromised lymphatic system.</P>
      <P>In terms of the impact on recovering cancer patients' mindset, the sport helps
patients rediscover the rhythm of life and gives them a chance to share their
emotions with their teammates.</P>
      <P>With the support from family members and friends, the patients are able to walk
out of their home and receive training with others, which produces the effect of
group therapy, Chen added.</P>
      <P>The number of breast cancer patients in Taiwan is increasing by more than 7,000
a year. The Taiwan Breast Cancer Alliance will host an international breast
cancer conference in November 2011, Chen said.</P>

      <P>American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Raymond F. Burghardt shrugged off
questions about Taiwan's ongoing trade pact talks with China during a visit
Thursday, saying that "it is up to Taiwan to decide."</P>
      <P>Burghardt, who arrived in Taiwan a day earlier for a one-week visit, is
reportedly on a mission to learn about the details of Taipei's talks with
Beijing on a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) that are
entering their final phase.</P>
      <P>He gave his brief reply in response to journalists' questions before a meeting
with Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng.</P>
      <P>Wang later confirmed that during their talks, Burghardt asked him about the
legislative procedures for handling the proposed pact after it is concluded.</P>
      <P>Wang said he told Burghardt that the pact and other cross-strait agreements are
not international treaties according to a ruling by the Constitutional Court.</P>
      <P>However, according to the ruling, Wang said, the legislature can recommend to
the executive branch that the pact should be "revised."</P>
      <P>"I am not certain what kind of binding force our recommendation would carry or
how far we can go in requesting revisions, " the speaker said.</P>
      <P>There is simply no mechanism the legislature can use to deal with an agreement
other than an international treaty, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang also said Burghardt told him that he hoped talks between Taiwan and the
United States on a trade investment framework agreement can be resumed later
this year.</P>
      <P>Those talks, which began in 1994, are the most important trade negotiations
between Washington and Taipei and are considered a step toward a free trade
agreement. However, they have been suspended since July 2007 because of a
dispute over imports of U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>Wang said that when he broached the possibility of Taiwan and the United States
having a free trade pact, Burghardt said the prospects are dim, as there is
little support in Washington for such an agreement.</P>
      <P>Turning to Taiwan's request to buy F-16 C/D jet fighters from the United States,
Wang said he got the feeling from his talks with Burghardt that Washington is
very likely to give a green light to such a sale, although Burghardt said only
that Washington is "considering it carefully."</P>
      <P>Taiwan requested in 2006 to buy 66 F-16 C/Ds to replace its aging IDF jet
fighters and French-made Mirage 2000s, but there has been no official response
from Washington to date.</P>

      <P>An official in charge of China affairs urged all government agencies Thursday to
observe the decision to be made by the Referendum Review Committee over a
referendum proposal on a planned trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Deputy Minister Liu Te-shun issued the call hours
before the committee under the Executive Yuan makes a final decision on whether
the referendum initiative is in conformity with the law.</P>
      <P>Liu said at a routine press conference that the fact that the review committee
approved a Consumers Foundation request for a referendum on U.S. beef imports in
January proves that the screening committee is impartial. He added, therefore,
that all government agencies should abide by its decisions.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in response to a statement issued Tuesday by China's Ministry  of
Foreign Affairs on Beijing's  opposition  to the establishment  of official
agreements between Taiwan and other countries, Liu said that trade is Taiwan's
lifeline and that seeking to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with other major
trade partners is the government's consistent policy.</P>
      <P>As a member of the World Trade Organization, Taiwan is eligible to clinch trade
agreements with other countries, Liu went on, adding that the government will
work toward this goal and that China should not hinder it from doing so.</P>
      <P>Although it is well-known that Taiwan is under great pressure, mainly from
China, when seeking to sign FTAs with other countries, the government
nevertheless has the responsibility to overcome all difficulties to reach the
goal, he said.</P>
      <P>While noting that the MAC does not agree with the Chinese government's rhetoric,
Liu expressed hope that China will understand Taiwan's stance and that both
sides will allow each other to seek more international  space and the best
platforms for economic development.</P>
      <P>The government's determination to ink FTAs with other countries will not be
affected by negative factors, according to Liu.</P>

      <P>The resignation of Taichung police chief Hu Mu-yuan was approved late Thursday
following public outrage over the presence of four police officers at a crime
scene in which a gang leader was shot in the central city.</P>
      <P>His post was filled by Chiu Feng-kuang, deputy head of the National Police
Agency's Criminal Investigation Bureau.</P>
      <P>Hu, chief of the Taichung City Police Department, resigned after attempting to
cover up the presence of the four officers when alleged gang boss Weng Chi-nan
was shot dead in his office May 28. It was not until June 1 that the matter came
to light.</P>
      <P>The four police officers were reportedly playing mahjong there and hid under a
table when Weng was shot.</P>
      <P>The case came to light after investigators looked at surveillance tape and
discovered that when the killer entered the office, there were four police
officers on the scene. At first, the police force did not release details about
the tape and officers were later disciplined.</P>
      <P>Hu was blamed for keeping Taichung Mayor Jason Hu in the dark over the incident.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's permanent representative to the World Trade Organization (WTO) said
Thursday that many WTO members are concerned about the progress of a proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) being negotiated between Taiwan
and China.</P>
      <P>In a telephone interview with CNA, Lin Yi-fu said from Geneva, Switzerland that
"everyone is concerned about the ECFA, " adding that "we talk about it whenever
we meet."</P>
      <P>Those WTO members that have expressed concern include the United States, the
European Union, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, he said.</P>
      <P>He said he has explained the trade deal to them, including each side's early
harvest list -- a list of items to be given early tariff exemptions -- as well
as the pact's coverage of protection for Taiwanese business interests and
intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that during a just-concluded WTO review meeting on China's trade
policies, Taiwan expressed hope that China will take into consideration the
views of Taiwanese businessmen operating in China when formulating its trade
policy, to which China reacted "positively."</P>
      <P>Lin said that the Chinese WTO representative, in a written statement,  expressed
a  positive  attitude  toward  Taiwanese businessmen's contributions to China's
economic development and said that China "will respect Taiwanese businessmen's
views."</P>
      <P>WTO members, including Taiwan, were also concerned about China's government
procurement list, which they said is not open enough, he added.</P>
      <P>The WTO will hold a Taiwan trade policy review meeting, which is held every four
years, July 5 and July 7.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese ex-national security chief said here Thursday that the time for
talks between Taiwan and China on the building of military mutual trust is not
ripe at this time.</P>
      <P>Former National Security Council Secretary-General Su Chi told CNA that Taiwan
needs time to prepare for such talks, although the international community is
eager to see them start.</P>
      <P>Citing the Taiwanese opposition parties' all-out fight against ongoing trade
talks between Taiwan and China, Su said negotiations on building military mutual
trust will be much more controversial than the trade talks, despite Washington's
support for such talks and Beijing's willingness to engage in them.</P>
      <P>"In the near future, there is no possibility for such talks," he said.</P>
      <P>However, the situation across the Taiwan Strait is much more stable than before,
he said, as Taiwan will not provoke China and China is unlikely to attack
Taiwan, in view of the fact that there are many sea and air links across the
Taiwan Strait every day.</P>
      <P>Su Chi was in Britain on a speaking tour at the invitation of Oxford University

      <P>A woman in southern Taiwan's Tainan City infected with Japanese encephalitis
died a day earlier, a senior health official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director-general of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said
the woman might have caught the disease at the pig farm where she worked in
neighboring Tainan County. The disease's carrier, Culex tritaeniorhynchus
mosquitoes, were found at the farm after she was diagnosed.</P>
      <P>The woman began showing flu-like symptoms May 18 and went to several clinics in
the following days, but was not diagnosed with Japanese encephalitis until she
was taken to National Cheng Kung University Hospital as her condition worsened.</P>
      <P>Lin said the local government cleaned and sprayed pesticide in the area and
urged the public to take action against mosquitoes to prevent disease
transmission.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that inoculation is the most effective prevention against
Japanese encephalitis. Children should receive four vaccinations between the age
of 15 months and when they enter elementary schools, while adults can go to
public hospitals to be vaccinated.</P>
      <P>Lin said it was the second case this year. The first was reported in
southernmost Pingtung County and that patient survived. The situation of the
disease this year is in line with previous years, he said.</P>
      <P>According to CDC statistics, there were 37 cases of Japanese encephalitis in
2007, with two fatalities, 17 cases in 2008 and 18 cases in 2009, with one death

Tiger according to the lunar calendar. Following is a list of important events
that have occurred on this date in the past:

colonies fed American discontent, leading to the American Revolution in 1776.

1928: Chang Tso-lin, leader of the Fengtien army in China's northeast
(Manchuria), is killed by a bomb on a train at Wangkutun near Mukden (Shenyang).
His son, Chang Hsueh-liang, succeeds him as the ruler of Manchuria.

1940: A flotilla of naval and civilian craft complete the safe evacuation of

Massacre.

1990: President Roh Tae Woo of South Korea meets with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev in Washington.

1999: The Basic Education Law passes three readings at the Legislative Yuan,
paving the way for the Ministry of Education to implement a 12-year system of
compulsory education for ROC nationals.

2000: An ROC Navy goodwill flotilla reaches the Marshall Islands after sailing
2,220 nautical miles.

2001: The 21st Taipei International Computer Show -- Computex Taipei 2001 --
kicks off at the Taipei World Trade Center, attracting a record high of 1,071
firms from home and abroad to take part in the five-day event.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "There are three things which a man should beware
of in the three stages of his life. In youth, when the constitution of his body
is not yet formed, he should beware of lust. In manhood, when his physical
powers are in full vigor, he should beware of strife. In old age, when the
physical powers are in decay, he should beware of greed."</TEXT>

      <P>The Referendum Screening Committee under the Executive Yuan again rejected an
initiative for a referendum on a proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China Thursday, after turning down a similar plan last
year.</P>
      <P>It was the darkest day in the history of Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>Opposing a referendum on the ECFA is not only the ruling Kuomintang's (KMT)
position but also that of the Communist Party of China.  Beijing is concerned
about the democratic momentum of referendums, which could bar its attempts to
annex Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a democratic Taiwan, the KMT dares not challenge public opinion and therefore
has been playing the trick of saying one thing and doing the other. The KMT's
plot was finally exposed Thursday night.</P>
      <P>The decision by the Referendum Screening Committee raises an alarm for Taiwan's
people. It signals that the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou has no
regard for public opinion and is conspiring with Beijing to pave the way for
Taiwan's ultimate annexation by China. (June 4, 2010)</P>

      <P>China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said recently that Beijing opposes
the signing of government-to-government agreements between Taiwan and other
countries  when asked about Taiwan's expectations that the conclusion of a
proposed cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation agreement framework (ECFA)
will facilitate Taiwan's bids to seal free trade agreements (FTAs) with other
trade partners.</P>
      <P>This statement has been interpreted by some as meaning that China is against
Taiwan signing FTAs with other countries.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News later verified the remarks with Chinese officials and was
told that Beijing will not block any "purely economic agreements" between Taiwan
and other countries that do not involve sovereignty issues. This explanation is
reasonable and predictable.</P>
      <P>Beijing is unlikely to oppose FTAs signed by Taiwan. The ECFA is not only a
cross-strait economic agreement but also an important framework that will create
a climate for peaceful development. Whether Taiwan can sign FTAs with other
countries has become a main indicator of whether the proposed ECFA is based on
sincerity and goodwill.</P>
      <P>Self-esteem and trust are the two major pillars of Taiwan's mainstream
sentiment. If Taiwan is only allowed to sign an ECFA with China but cannot sign
FTAs with other countries, how can the Taiwanese people build their self-esteem
and trust? How are the significance and achievements of the ECFA going to stand?</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>After nearly five hours of heated debate,  the Referendum Screening Committee
(RSC) under the Executive Yuan rejected a referendum initiative presented by the
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) on the signing of an economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>Frustrated by the invalidation of its referendum initiative, the TSU said it
will mount an initiative to hold a national referendum on whether the RSC should
be abolished.</P>
      <P>The invalidation of the referendum initiative is expected to accelerate ECFA
talks with China and a long-delayed third round of such talks is expected to
take place soon.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>After the RSC rejected the ECFA referendum initiative by a vote of 12-4 with one
abstention late Thursday, a third round of ECFA talks is likely to be held in
the coming few days.</P>
      <P>Responding to the committee's decision, the Executive Yuan issued a four-point
statement, saying that it respects the committee's conclusion and will continue
to keep the Legislative Yuan informed on the progress of the ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>Once the agreement is signed, the statement said, it will be sent to the
legislature for approval.</P>
      <P>In the process of the ECFA negotiations, the statement said, the government
will ensure that the nation's sovereignty  is not compromised and that the
people's well-being is enhanced through the deal.</P>
      <P>Upon learning of Taiwan's rejection of the referendum initiative, a Chinese
official in charge of Taiwan affairs said he is optimistic about the signing of
the ECFA by the end of June as originally scheduled. (June 4, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The RSC rejected the TSU's referendum on the grounds that it is not in
conformity with the law.</P>
      <P>The referendum initiative would have asked the public: "Do you agree that the
government should sign an economic cooperation framework with China?"</P>
      <P>Most committee members said the question contradicts the main discourse of the
TSU-drafted referendum initiative and that even if the referendum initiative
were to be passed, it would not change the status quo.</P>
      <P>According to the Referendum Act, TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei, who proposed the
ECFA referendum initiative, can appeal the case with the Executive Yuan within
30 days. (June 4, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Huang accused President Ma Ying-jeou of kowtowing to China's will by having the
RSC reject his party's ECFA referendum initiative.</P>
      <P>He said the TSU will propose a new initiative to hold a referendum on the Ma

economic reliance on China and lead to China's annexation of the country.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Huang said, the TSU will initiate another referendum proposal to have

      <P>As Taiwan imposes only a securities transaction tax and does not tax capital
gains, investors who generated sizable profits from the stock market last year
were not required to pay any tax on that income when they filed their tax
returns in May.</P>
      <P>Levying a capital gains tax has always been a taboo issue in Taiwan, and this is
just one example of the government's reluctance to raise taxes despite its huge
fiscal shortfall. The government has instead been cutting taxes in recent years,
with the wealthy benefiting the most from decreases in the gift, estate and
value added taxes.</P>
      <P>This demonstrates  that a core concept is lacking in the government's tax
policy, which leaves room for bargaining and lobbying by the rich. This is
dragging our policy farther and farther away from fairness and justice,
pampering the rich and leading them into unrighteousness.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, not all wealthy people are unwilling to pay more taxes. The
legendary investor Warren Buffett, William H. Gates, father of Microsoft co-
founder Bill Gates, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Chairman Morris
Chang have all advocated raising taxes for the rich.</P>
      <P>Has the government heard the voices of these rich opinion leaders? Rich people
pay more attention to gaining social esteem than paying less taxes,  but the
existing  tax system is creating confrontation between the poor and the rich.
The authorities should work out some serious plans to reform the tax system
without delay.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called on the Beijing leadership Friday to heal the scars
of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Incident with innovative thinking.</P>
      <P>A government's existence of power hinges on the trust of its people, he said. In
an incident in which a government turns its guns on the people, the innocent
public is not the only party to be harmed, but also the trust between the rulers
and the people, he added.</P>
      <P>Once the people's trust in their government is smashed, it will take a long time
for the trust to be rebuilt, he said.</P>
      <P>He urged Beijing to face reality courageously and address the major human rights
incident that has left scars on its nation's history and to rebuild the mutual
trust by demonstrating the patience and tolerance.</P>
      <P>The president made the call in the latest issue of his online newsletter that
day, the 21st anniversary of the bloodshed when Beijing used tanks and troops to
crush a student-led pro-democracy demonstration.</P>
      <P>"We people in Taiwan commemorate the June 4 incident in the same manner we
observe the anniversary of the 1947 Feb. 28 Incident in Taiwan and the White
Terror Era of the 1950s," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He said he hopes Beijing will borrow from Taiwan's experience in dealing with
historical tragedies to help prevent similar incidents from occurring again.</P>
      <P>He also urged Beijing to take action to allay the hurt and the burning sense of
injustice among the families of the victims.</P>
      <P>By doing so, the Beijing leadership could increase the Chinese people's trust in
it and also narrow the human rights gap between Taiwan and China, the president
said.</P>
      <P>The Tiananmen Incident was a series of demonstrations in and around Beijing's
Tiananmen Square that began April 14, 1989. Led mainly by students and
intellectuals, the protests occurred in a year that saw the collapse of a number
of communist governments around the world.</P>
      <P>The protests, which lasted seven weeks, were sparked by the death of a pro-
democracy and anti-corruption official, Hu Yaobang, whom the protesters wanted
to mourn.</P>
      <P>Following the bloody crushing of the protesters by the Chinese military, the
Chinese government conducted widespread arrests of protesters and their
supporters, cracked down on other protests around China, banned the foreign
press from the country and strictly controlled coverage of the events in its
press.</P>

      <P>Also, the number of flights between Kaohsiung and China will be almost tripled

related businesses in the Kaohsiung and Pingtung areas.</P>
      <P>Lin said the increase in the number of flights was agreed upon during cross-
Taiwan Strait aviation talks last month in Taipei and is the result of lobbying
efforts by the alliance.</P>
      <P>At present, Kaohsiung International Airport maintains direct air link with eight
Chinese cities, namely Fuzhou, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Guangzhou,
Chengdu and Xiamen. A total of 14 flights per week are provided.</P>
      <P>Lin said an increase in the number of flights between Kaohsiung and China will

    <TEXT>
      <P>Integrated circuit (IC) designer MediaTek Inc. said Friday it has settled a
patent dispute with British Telecom.</P>
      <P>The settlement was reached after British Telecom filed a lawsuit at a district
court in the U.S. state of Massachusetts in November 2009, accusing the
Taiwanese firm's wholly owned unit MediaTek Wireless of infringing on its
patents applied to microchips used in cell phones.</P>
      <P>MediaTek said both sides have signed a settlement agreement in which British
Telecom will withdraw  the litigation  from the Massachusetts court and will not
pursue legal proceedings related to the same patents anywhere else.</P>
      <P>MediaTek declined to elaborate on the settlement or to disclose any possible
compensation it will have to pay British Telecom over the patent dispute.</P>
      <P>However, the company said in a statement that "the settlement does not pose any
impact on the company's financial condition or its operations."</P>
      <P>According to the local media, MediaTek had originally insisted on its innocence
when British Telecom first filed the lawsuit, saying the company had never used
the patents involved in the dispute.</P>
      <P>In recent years, MediaTek has obtained IC patents for cell phone use through a
spate of acquisitions, as the company has diversifying its business to the
mobile communications IC sector.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States remains firm on its policy for selling defensive weapons to
Taiwan under the framework of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) , American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Raymond F. Burghardt said Friday.</P>
      <P>U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are vitally important in terms of maintaining peace
and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and the U.S. will not deviate from this
stance on the basis of the 30-year- old TRA, Burghardt said while briefing
President Ma Ying-jeou at the Presidential Office on the recent U.S.-China
Strategic and Economic Dialogue.</P>
      <P>This has been a never-rescinded promise and obligation of the U.S. to Taiwan
over the past 30 years, he said, explaining that he communication channels
remain smooth between the two countries and that they will immediately contact
each other should the need arise.</P>
      <P>Ma for his part urged the U.S. to consider selling F-16C/D jet fighters to
Taiwan to help the country phase out its aging fleet of fighters and beef up its
defenses.</P>
      <P>Taiwan requested in 2006 to buy 66 F-16 C/Ds to supplement its aging IDF jet
fighters and French-made Mirage 2000s, but Washington has not given a clear
reply to date.</P>
      <P>Touching on his recent controversial remarks that he will not ask the U.S. to
fight for Taiwan, Ma reiterated that he made them simply to underscore to the
entire world Taiwan's resolve to defend itself in line with the TRA.</P>
      <P>On the prospects for cross-Taiwan Strait relations, the president said the goal
of clinching a Taiwan-China economic cooperation framework agreement in June
remains unchanged, and he also called on the U.S. to quickly sign an extradition
agreement with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"A similar Taiwan-China judicial assistance accord has helped bring several
Taiwanese fugitives back to Taiwan," he noted.</P>
      <P>Burghardt, the top U.S. liaison official responsible for two-way dealings with
Taiwan, arrived in Taiwan June 2 for a six-day visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Computex must get bigger: organizers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Organizers of the world's second biggest computer show, Computex Taipei, said
this week during the 30th show that if the trade exhibition does not expand its
venue space, the show may not be able to retain its high position.</P>
      <P>"If (participating companies) cannot be accommodated in Taiwan, there are plenty
of big exhibition halls in other Asian countries for them," Moses Yen, the head
of the Exhibition Department of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) , told the Central News Agency during a recent interview.</P>
      <P>Although Computex posts small growth almost every year -- with 8 percent more
booths this year than last year -- it still has a long way to go, Yen said.</P>
      <P>CeBIT, the world's largest show of its kind, draws 4,000-5,000 exhibitors to
Hannover, Germany annually, while Computex has never topped 2,000, according to
Chang Li, deputy secretary-general of the Taipei Computer Association (TCA),
which co-hosts Computex.</P>
      <P>But the problem isn't as simple as just finding more exhibitors.</P>
      <P>"Our problem is that we do not have enough space at the available halls, " said
Jeremy Horng, deputy executive director of TAITRA'S Exhibition Department.</P>
      <P>More than 100 companies could not exhibit at the event this year because of lack
of space, Horng said.</P>
      <P>The government is already working to ease the problem by building an extension
to the Nangang Exhibition Hall, which currently can accommodate 2,467 booths.</P>
      <P>The extension, which will be capable of accommodating a further 2,350 booths, is
due to open in 2013, which will make the Nangang Exhibition Hall Taiwan's first
international-level large exhibition hall. It will provide space for at least
5,000 booths.</P>
      <P>This year, Computex uses a combined 4,861 booths at the Nangang Exhibition Hall,
Taipei International Convention Center (TICC) , Taipei World Trade Center (TWTC)
Exhibition Hall 1 and TWTC Exhibition Hall 3.</P>
      <P>The government is also considering building another extension to the hall, but
is concerned that the second extension might not be fully used all year round,
Yen noted.</P>
      <P>Chang recently echoed Yen by saying that the government should consider the
needs of Taiwan's largest exhibitions, rather than paying too much attention to
smaller exhibitions.</P>
      <P>"If you don't look at it this way, Taiwan will never be able to organize large
activities," he told reporters.</P>
      <P>Computex became the world's third largest computer trade show in 1989, three
years after organizers moved the event to a bigger venue at the TWTC Exhibition
Hall 1.</P>
      <P>It became the world's second largest of its kind after the U.S.'s COMDEX was
canceled in 2004.</P>
      <P>This year's five-day Computex opened to industry professionals beginning
Tuesday, and will be open to the public on its final day Saturday.</P>
      <P>More than 1,700 companies are exhibiting at the show this year and around
120,000 visitors are expected.</P>
      <P>In terms of its influence on the hardware industry, Computex is already the
world's No. 1,  as Taiwan has a well-established industrial supply chain, Chang
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan manufactures nearly 90 percent of the world's notebook computers.</P>
      <P>Chang, however, said another issue is the nature of the show.</P>
      <P>Computex  has been focused mainly on business to business products, but in
recent years, it has begun to be geared towards consumers.</P>
      <P>This will help it become more appealing, the organizers said.</P>
      <P>Many major exhibitors are showcasing some of the latest tablet PCs, 3D gaming
notebook computers or e-readers at Computex this year, marking another step in
Computex's expansion to cover consumer electronics products in recent years,
Chang said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 0.21 percent Friday as profit taking emerged to
erode early gains after the bourse staged a strong rebound in the previous
session, dealers said later that day.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 15.69 points to 7,344.59 after moving between 7,337.35
and 7,377.56 on turnover of NT$67.58 billion (US$2.10 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened 0.23 percent higher on follow-through buying from the previous
day's 2.28 percent jump, but profit taking emerged in mid-morning trade to
compromise the earlier gains, with the index moving closer to the nearest
resistance of around 7,400 points, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,163 stocks closed up and 1,431 were down, with 420 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The financial sector suffered the heaviest losses, down 0.9 percent, followed by
a 0.6 percent fall in the construction sector, while cement, along with paper
and pulp, lost 0.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The foodstuff sector fell 0.4 percent, followed by machinery and electronics
with a 0.1 percent decline, while the textile sector closed up 0.4 percent and
the plastics and chemicals sector was unchanged.</P>
      <P>"Turnover remained thin. The market, therefore,  failed to overcome the
technical barriers ahead of 7,400 points, " TLG Asset Management analyst Arch
Shih said.</P>
      <P>After an NT$11 billion net buy recorded a day earlier, foreign institutional
investors mostly took to the sidelines throughout the trading session, waiting
for new leads to act, Shih said.</P>
      <P>"Without buying from foreign funds, large-cap high tech stocks appeared
stagnant, in sharp contrast to yesterday's strong showing. The local bourse has
fallen back to consolidation mode," he said.</P>
      <P>However,  he added  that  market  sentiment  has  improved significantly after
Thursday's gains, with more and more investors willing to keep their holdings.</P>
      <P>"I expect the market will see technical  support  at the 7,000-7,100 point range
next week," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Cathay Financial fell 1.92 percent to NT$45.95 and Fubon Financial lost 0.54
percent to end at NT$36.85.</P>
      <P>United Microelectronics Corp. dropped 1.68 percent to NT$14.65, while Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. closed up 0.33 percent at NT$61.00.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Friday that the government will keep promoting low-
carbon communities and he urged big companies to put more efforts into adopting
new technologies to reduce carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>At a ceremony in which he presented "carbon footprint" labels to five local
companies considered eligible to label their products as having small carbon
footprints, Wu said that companies with high carbon emissions -- such as Taiwan
Power Company, CPC Taiwan Corp., China Steel, China Shipbuilding and Formosa
Plastics Group, should consider revamping their infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Action taken by China Steel to use new equipment, and Formosa Petrochemical's
efforts to reduce carbon emissions should also be encouraged, the premier said.</P>
      <P>Wu also noted that the Presidential Office has begun to turn off some of its
lights in the daytime, has installed water-efficient faucets, and is turning up
the temperature on its air-conditioners, in an effort to reduce carbon emissions
and save energy and water.</P>
      <P>"In the past year, the energy-saving measures taken by the government and people
helped save more than 7 billion units of electricity  --  almost  equivalent  to
one year's electricity consumption for the whole of Tainan County and city,
which have a combined population of 1.86 million people," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu also said that over the past six months, the country's water use reduced by a
volume equivalent to almost 29 days-worth of water consumption in Taipei City,

      <P>Seven products made by five local companies have been granted carbon footprint
labels, making Taiwan the 11th country in the world to introduce  the labeling
system,  the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The first products in the country to be approved for the carbon footprint label
are Taisun Enterprise's bottled drinking water, Hey Song's sarsaparilla and
camellia green tea drinks, Hair O'right's green tea shampoos, BenQ's 20-inch LCD
monitor and AU Optronic's 32-inch TFT-LCD television, the EPA said.</P>
      <P>EPA Minister Stephen Shu-hung Shen said those companies with products granted
the labels not only showed a smaller carbon footprint, but also promised to
reduce carbon emissions in the future.</P>
      <P>The EPA said that about 50 percent of the carbon footprint for regular shampoos
is caused by consumers rinsing with hot water, and the shampoo granted the new
label is made with local plant extracts that make it easier to rinse.</P>
      <P>The bottled drinking water "Twist Water" was granted the label because it
reduces plastic usage by 43 percent, carbon emissions by 50 grams and recycling
space by 70 percent, Taisun Enterprise Deputy General Manager Lin Wen-tsung

      <P>Taipei City government's "1999 Citizen Hotline" was recently honored as the best
public service in the Asia Pacific region in 2009 by the Hong Kong-based Asia
Pacific Customer Service Consortium, according to Mayor Hau Lung-bin.</P>
      <P>The hotline won "Public Service of the Year" at the 2009 Asia Pacific Customer
Relationship Excellence Awards on June 2, making the city government the second
governmental institute in the region to receive the honor after the Hong Kong
Observatory won when the category debuted in 2008.</P>
      <P>"The award recognizes the efforts of all Taipei City government staff members,"
Mayor Hau Lung-bin said.</P>
      <P>The 24-hour hotline was launched at Hau's initiative on July 3, 2008 to improve
public servants' service attitude and efficiency. It was set up to answer
various requests for city government help or consultation and to handle citizen
complaints.</P>
      <P>Hau said that world-renowned Japanese architect Toyo Ito once told him that he
was impressed by an operator who spoke fluent Japanese when he called 1999 for
information about an exhibition at the Chang Dai-chien Residence in Taipei
City's Shilin District.</P>
      <P>Some taxi drivers use the call center for help translating foreign customers'
needs, Hau added.</P>
      <P>According to city government statistics, the service has received over 3.4
million calls since opening. More than 2.68 million calls, or 79 percent of the
total, were made to ask for dispatching services while 710,000 calls, or 21
percent, for transfer to other public services.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan Institute of Economic Research survey showed 86 percent of those who
had called the hotline said they were satisfied with the service, and 88 percent
of the satisfied respondents said they would use the service again.</P>
      <P>Chen Yeong-ren, Taipei's deputy secretary-general, received the award on behalf
of the city government in Hong Kong on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The annual awards were established in 2002 to promote service quality and
customer relationship excellence in international cities across the Asia Pacific
region, and to recognize companies, business units, teams and individuals that
have contributed to the success of both their customers and the organizations
that they serve.</P>

      <P>The Control Yuan -- the country's top government watchdog -- censured the
Department of Health (DOH) Friday for mismanaging a controversy over U.S. beef
tongue imports in April.</P>
      <P>Pointing to what he described as four "major lapses" committed by the DOH,
Control Yuan member Cheng Jen-hung said the DOH did not learn from its mistakes,
lacked a sense of crisis, failed to proactively supervise beef imports, and did
not clear up public doubts in time.</P>
      <P>It was the second time the DOH had been censured over its handling of beef
imports from the United States. The last time was in March, when it was
reprimanded for mistakes in the government's policy of opening Taiwan's market
to U.S. bone-in-beef and other beef parts.</P>
      <P>The latest dispute arose after the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) approved April
15 an application by a Taiwanese beef importer to import 453 kg of beef tongues
and diaphragm from the United States -- the first application to import such
products since Taiwan opened its market wider to U.S. beef products in November
2009.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, the BOFT issued an import permit to the importer because it
did not consider tongues to be classed as internal organs, which are not allowed
to enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although the BOFT notified the DOH immediately after it issued the permit, DOH
Minister Yaung Chih-liang said he remained unaware of the matter until he was
asked about it by reporters, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Under pressure from public concern about the safety of the products, the DOH
advised the importer to drop the import plan April 20,  and the BOFT later said
the importer had withdrawn the application.</P>
      <P>However, Cheng said, the beef tongues were already being shipped to Taiwan by
that time. After the shipment arrived in Taiwan May 7, the importer voluntarily
gave it up and it was destroyed by customs authorities, he added.</P>
      <P>Referring to the example of South Korea, Cheng said that since South Korea
reopened its market to U.S. beef in June 2008, there is no record of beef
tongues having been imported there because there is an understanding between the
two sides.</P>
      <P>In addition, South Korea has listed beef tongue as a controlled item subject to
batch-by-batch inspections and tests should it ever be imported there, he went
on.</P>
      <P>Instead of learning from South Korea, however, the DOH classed beef tongues as
regular beef products and handled them according to relevant procedures, Cheng
said.</P>

      <P>The acquisition of the Taiwan-based Nan Shan Life Insurance company by a Hong
Kong consortium has hit a snag as the Taiwan government requires more
information from the group, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
Friday.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong group failed to submit some of the documents that are required by
the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) and other relevant government
agencies and which should have accompanied its application in January for the
Taiwan government's approval of the acquisition deal, the MOEA said.</P>
      <P>The agencies have asked the Hong Kong consortium, which is led by Primus
Financial Holdings and China Strategic, to provide, in particular, information
related to any Chinese shareholding in China Strategic, the MOEA said.</P>
      <P>"The government needs all the required documents to complete its review of the
application, as the shareholding structure of the consortium is very
complicated," MOEA told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>"Without careful review, we cannot allow the deal to proceed, " the ministry
said.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan regulations, Chinese enterprises are not permitted to own Taiwanese
insurance companies, and any overseas company in which Chinese investors have
more than a 30 percent stake is considered a Chinese company.</P>
      <P>The MOEA said it is also looking into whether Raymond Or, chief executive of
China Strategic, is currently a member of the Chinese People's Consultative
Conference.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, which supervises cross-strait relations, will
examine whether Or's status will have any impact on the deal, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the FSC will look at the consortium's financial situation and its
ability to deliver on its promise to run Nan Shan Life as a long term
investment, according to the MOEA.</P>
      <P>The consortium had hoped that the government review of its application would
have been completed by mid-July, but according to the MOEA, this all depends on
the information that the consortium provides.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong group won the bid last October, beating out Taiwan's Chinatrust
Financial Holding, to acquire Nan Shan Life from the debt-ridden American
International Group (AIG) for US$2.15 billion (NT$69.16 billion).</P>
      <P>However, government approval is required before the deal can go though, as it
will involve the interests of 4 million local insurance policy holders.</P>

      <P>Pundits and experts said Friday in a seminar that a lot of news in today's world
is obtained via the Internet and that a management system should be devised to
control it, considering the huge impact of the Internet.</P>
      <P>In the seminar sponsored by the Ministry of the Interior, the scholars discussed
how to deal with the issues of emerging new media and how to maintain discipline
among them.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-min, executive director of the Child Welfare League Foundation, said the
media's performance has improved.</P>
      <P>She cited as an example that when the media reports suicides, they add a "value
your life" ticker, " as well as the suicide prevention hotline number, and do
not run photos of dead children.</P>
      <P>However, she also expressed regret that a media outlet recently covered the rape
of a student on a train in lurid detail.</P>
      <P>She said the ratio of pornographic content on the Internet tends to be too high
but there is no law to govern it, and she urged the media not to vie for
sensationalism to boost their ratings.</P>
      <P>Public Television Service News Department Manager He Kuo-hua said the Internet
has made a massive impact, but the government's regulations governing the new
media are insufficient compared with its management of the print and electronic
media, and he urged the government to come up with a strategy to regulate the

      <P>The Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) and the Taipei-based India-Taipei
Association will hold an exhibition featuring three Indian mountain railways to
mark the TRA's 123rd founding anniversary, an association spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>This will be the first time that the three Indian railways and Mumbai Railway
Station, which have been listed on UNESCO's World Heritage List, will be
featured in Taiwan,  according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, a collection of photos, posters and other materials related to
the railways, will be held at Taipei Main Station June 9-13 and be accompanied
by Bollywood dances and food-tasting and prize-drawing events.</P>
      <P>The TRA has some history with India, having purchased 113 trains from the
southern Asian country more than 30 years ago. Only about 10 of them remain in
service today, as commuter trains in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>One was recently used to support the resumption of operations of a mountain
railway line in Miaoli, northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The three Indian railways to be featured include the Darjeeling Himalayan
Railway in northeast India, the Kalka Shimla Railway in northwest India and the
Nilgiri Mountain Railway in southern India.</P>
      <P>The 88-kilometer Darjeeling Himalayan line, opened in 1881, and the 96-km Kalka
Shimla line, opened in 1903, reach altitudes of over 2,000 meters and offer
panoramic views of the Himalayas.</P>
      <P>UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization)
described the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway as the most outstanding example of a
hill passenger railway.</P>
      <P>It said its design applies bold and ingenious engineering solutions to the
problem of establishing an effective rail link across a mountainous terrain of
great beauty.</P>
      <P>The Ghum station along the line is the highest railway station in India at an
elevation of 2,258 meters.</P>
      <P>The Kalka Shimla line passes through more 100 tunnels and over 800 bridges and
provides the chance to get a glimpse of spectacular snow-capped mountains.</P>
      <P>The 46-km Nilgiri line, opened in 1899, is the steepest railway line in Asia.
Along with a steep gradient, there are curves as sharp as 18 degrees.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators from across the political spectrum urged the central government
Friday to delegate the power to name city and county police chiefs to local
government heads.</P>
      <P>At present, police forces are administered by the National Police Agency (NPA)
under the Ministry of the Interior, while mayors and magistrates can only offer
advice on police personnel administration, including appointment and discipline.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Legislator Chiu Yi said the current system is unfair to local
government chiefs, who are held accountable for public order in their
administrative districts.</P>
      <P>"The central government should consider taking steps to correct this disparity
by delegating the power to choose police personnel to local government chiefs so
that they can better deploy manpower, improve efficiency and streamline police
discipline," Chiu said.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the power delegation issue has become more urgent after the changing
of the guard at the Taichung City Police Bureau the previous day.</P>
      <P>The reshuffle, in which Chiu Feng-kuang, originally deputy head of the Criminal
Investigation Bureau, replaced Hu Mu-yuan as the Taichung police chief, came at
the insistence of Taichung Mayor Jason Hu amid public outrage over the presence
of four police officers at a crime scene in which a suspected gang leader died
in a shower of bullets.</P>
      <P>NPA Director-General Wang Cho-chun said at a news conference late Thursday that
out of respect for Mayor Hu's opinion, he decided to reassign Hu Mu-yuan to head
a riot police corps, a proposal that was also backed by Wang's superior,
Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah.</P>
      <P>Mayor Hu demanded the personnel replacement after Hu Mu-yuan kept him in the
dark for five days after investigators discovered the presence of four police
officers at the scene of the May 28 shooting, which claimed two lives.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations showed that the four police officers were invited by a
retired colleague to the office of suspected gang leader Weng Chi-nan, who was
killed in the shooting.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Lee Chun-yee said Friday that
the event highlighted poor police ethics and a lack of integrity.</P>
      <P>Hu Mu-yuan should not have allowed his subordinates to maintain interactions
with members of criminal rings, Lee said, adding that judging from the event,
the police chief should have been removed from his post earlier.</P>
      <P>Lee also echoed Chiu's appeal,  saying that giving  local government heads the
power to name city or county police bureau chiefs and discipline  police
officers in their administrative districts would improve operational efficiency
and police integrity.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Institutional investors are increasingly optimistic about the outlook of
Taiwan's notebook computer industry, with shipments from the largest contract
notebook manufacturers expected to rise by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Goldman Sachs analyst Henry King raised the brokerage's growth forecast for
notebook shipments in the second quarter to 7 percent from 6 percent, and also
expected increases of 13 percent in Q3 and 5 percent in Q4.</P>
      <P>King noted in a report on Thursday that notebook maker Compal Electronics raised
its shipment target from 48 million units to 50 million for 2010, while Quanta
Computer expected a quarter-on-quarter growth of 15 percent to 20 percent in Q2
shipments.</P>
      <P>Although share prices of those notebook manufacturers were not cheap, King still
suggested bargain hunting their shares because more good news from the industry
is expected in the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>King also said Wistron Corporation is his top pick among notebook stocks.</P>
      <P>In another report released by Credit Suisse analyst Randy Abrams on Thursday,
the brokerage noted that Quanta and Acer were more confident they could achieve
their targets for shipment this year, while Wistron and Compal also expected a
recovery following a drop in late April and early May.</P>
      <P>Quanta was one of the five top picks in the brokerage report, which was
completed after the brokerage's local equity research team visited 21 Taiwanese
manufacturers at the Computex Taipei trade show, a media report said.</P>

      <P>A businessman from Taiwan became the first Asian winner of the prestigious Comms
Business Awards in Britain Thursday.</P>
      <P>The award presentation was held in London and Jason Tsai, who is the winner of
the Channel Entrepreneur of the Year, was honored along with 18 winners of
awards in other categories.</P>
      <P>Miles Bossom, managing director of the awards, said Tsai was chosen from among
14 candidates and he added that the fierce competition among the candidates
underscores the excellence of Tsai's company's service and the high quality of
its products.</P>
      <P>Tsai founded Enta Technologies Ltd. -- the name of which is a combination of
England and Taiwan -- in 1990, distributing computer components from his garage
at his home in England.</P>
      <P>The company rapidly grew into one of Britain's leading IT distributors.</P>
      <P>By 1995, when Enta moved into purpose-built premises, Tsai spotted an
opportunity in the market to provide Internet access services, so he set up a
second business, Entanet International Ltd., which has grown into a leading
voice and data communications provider.</P>
      <P>In 1999, he set up his third company, Entacall Telecommunications Ltd., to
provide traditional telecom services to his existing Entanet reseller partners.</P>
      <P>Then, in 2003, he established his fourth business, Entamedia Ltd., as a separate
company providing marketing and design services to its sister companies and
external clients.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Tsai said the award is significant to him as it
confirms his many years working in Britain, especially as he was the only Asian
winner at this year's awards.</P>
      <P>Addressing Taiwanese youths who would like to start their own businesses in
Britain, Tsai advised them to swim with the tide, choose the right trade, learn
the local culture and assimilate into local society.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will launch a "10-year war of
resistance" and continue pushing for a referendum on a potential Taiwan-China
trade deal after an initiative on the issue was rejected Thursday night, a DPP
spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>By a vote of 12-4 with one abstention, the Executive Yuan's Referendum Screening
Committee rejected a referendum petition on Taiwan's signing of an economic
cooperation framework agreement with China presented by the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU).</P>
      <P>Responding to the rejection, DPP spokesman Julian Kuo said the DPP will ally
with the TSU and other social activist groups to launch a 10-year offensive and
will help the TSU initiate another ECFA referendum.</P>
      <P>Kuo said President Ma Ying-jeou's Kuomintang (KMT) administration has labeled
the ECFA as a free trade agreement (FTA) , and under the spirit of FTAs, Taiwan
will be forced to open its markets to 90 percent of China's merchandise over a
period of 10 years, he added.</P>
      <P>He said all DPP officials and grassroots members will pitch in to the offensive
in opposing the referendum initiative's rejection -- which he described as
tantamount to denying the people their civil rights.</P>
      <P>If China moves to disrupt Taiwan's bid to sign FTAs with other nations and locks
Taiwan into a "one China" market, it will certainly whip up a second wave of
indignation in Taiwan's society, he contended.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP spokesman Lin Yu-chang reiterated that the DPP will render its
support to the TSU in submitting the referendum initiative proposal again.</P>
      <P>According to the Referendum Act, TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei, who proposed the
ECFA referendum initiative, can appeal the case to the Executive Yuan within 30
days.</P>
      <P>The DPP will also organize a series of social activities to press forward the
opposition's causes, Lin said, with the first in the series to be held in
Kaohsiung City Saturday evening.</P>
      <P>Both DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen and TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei will be there,

      <P>The Pingtung County government has begun to buy bananas from local farmers at
eight locations in the southern area to help prop up the fruit's slumping price,
in line with an initiative launched by Taiwan's top agricultural authority.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) announced in late May it would
guide food processors to buy bananas for a relatively cheap NT$5 per kilogram to
boost flagging demand, and officials in Taiwan's southernmost county said Friday
it had begun to comply.</P>
      <P>According to the county's Agricultural Department, demand for bananas has been
crowded out by the harvests of many other summer fruits like mangos, pineapples
and watermelons, causing prices to fall.</P>
      <P>"Bananas have been unable to compete with the juicy fruits, " the department
said.</P>
      <P>The COA has set a goal of purchasing 3,000 tons of healthy green bananas,
weighing under 6 kilograms per bundle.</P>
      <P>The measure, however, drew the protests of several banana growers in neighboring
Kaohsiung County, who complained that the purchasing program only benefits
farmers who have contracts with local farmers cooperatives, the Chinese-language
United Daily News reported Friday.</P>
      <P>"Farmers who don't have ties to the cooperatives can only leave their bananas to
rot, " said Chu Hsin-chiang, the former head of the Meinong Township Farmers

      <P>A Taiwan baker has made a 170 cm tall chocolate model of the Taipei 101 tower to
promote the World Chocolate Wonderland exhibition that will open in Taipei next
month.</P>
      <P>The baker, Lee Kuo-yi, said at a promotional event Friday that he and his team
took a month to create the piece, which is made from almost 20 kg of chocolate.</P>
      <P>"The biggest challenge is how to keep the chocolate in perfect condition, " said
Lee, who won a silver medal at HOFEX 2009, Asia's leading food and hospitality

      <P>Chocolate is a fragile medium in food art because it melts at temperatures of

    <TEXT>
      <P>An environmental group announced Friday the launch of a permanent forum to bring
together the government and the business and academic sectors to tackle the task
of reducing carbon emissions in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Chu Feng-chi, one of the legislators who attended the
bipartisan press conference to show support for the initiative, said she expects
the forum to help forge consensus on carbon reduction issues.</P>
      <P>Representatives from all sectors of society will meet once every two months to
discuss issues related to global warming and low carbon development strategies
and make suggestions to the government for its drafting of relevant policies,
she said.</P>
      <P>The group decided earlier this year to set up the forum to fill the need for
cooperation among the various sectors in Taiwan to work toward the government's
carbon reduction goals, said opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator
Tien Chiu-chin.</P>
      <P>The government's goals are to cut Taiwan's carbon dioxide emissions to the 2005
level by 2020, and reduce them to the 2000 level by 2025.</P>
      <P>Tien said that as more and more people have fallen victim to climate-related
disasters in recent years, there is an immediate need for action to fight
climate change.</P>
      <P>For example, rising sea levels caused by abrupt climate changes could submerge
many coastal industrial zones in Taiwan, she said. In such a senario, economic
development would mean nothing, Tien added.</P>
      <P>However, ruling Kuomintang Legislator Cheng Li-wen said there is not necessarily
a conflict between economic  development  and environmental protection.</P>
      <P>She added that once high-polluting industries undergo full transformation, the
mode of economic growth will also change significantly.</P>
      <P>Changes in the approaches toward economic development  and environmental
protection will have to take place in tandem, Cheng stressed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should join the global efforts to reduce carbon emissions, she said.</P>
      <P>"If we do not do so today, we would regret tomorrow, " Cheng added.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Pan Meng-an said that in the past, Taiwan sought economic
development at the cost of the environment.</P>
      <P>He suggested that in the future, the decisions reached in the forum should be
submitted to the Legislative Yuan for reference.</P>

      <P>Some 1,000 volunteers gathered in Taichung City Friday for the launch of a
citizens flood alert team that the government hopes will provide more timely
information that helps it prevent flood damage.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Hwang Jung-chiou said at a ceremony in the central
Taiwan city that the volunteers in local communities will complement the
government's early warning system and help authorities respond to floods more
quickly and effectively.</P>
      <P>The key to preventing and mitigating flood damage, Hwang said, is getting early
warnings and accurate information about situations, a lesson learned in past
typhoon seasons.</P>
      <P>Last August, Typhoon Morakot battered southern Taiwan with torrential rains,
triggering lethal mudslides and flooding a quarter of the country's land area.</P>
      <P>The Water Resources Agency said each of its 10 River Management Offices around
Taiwan has recruited 100 local citizens and assigned them into groups according
to the conditions of each region.</P>
      <P>The agency said the volunteers will check places such as pumping stations, river
embankments, and drainage systems to see if they are functioning normally.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 94 percent of the Chinese tourists who have visited Taiwan so far this year
were satisfied with their tours, Yang Rui-tsung, chief of the Beijing bracnch of
the Taiwan Strait Tourism Association, said here Friday.</P>
      <P>That figure represents a rise of 10 percentage points over last year, according
to surveys conducted by the Taiwan-based association.</P>
      <P>A breakdown of the figures shows that tour bus drivers earned the highest
approval rating of 98.9 percent, compared with 94.2 percent</P>
      <P>last year, while the level of satisfaction with meals in Taiwan was 82.5
percent, down from 84.6 percent of last year, Yang said.</P>
      <P>At a seminar with 18 Beijing travel agencies that handle package tours to
Taiwan, Yang said his association pays great attention to the quality of the
tours and will spare no effort to ensure the comfort of the visitors.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by Taiwan authorities, Yang said Chinese tourist
arrivals to Taiwan in 2009 were 600,000, while there were 370,000 business
arrivals.</P>
      <P>The figures are expected to grow this year to 1 million and 500,000,
respectively, he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan limits the number of Chinese tourists arrivals to 3,000 per
day, Yang said the restriction takes into consideration the capacity of Taiwan's
hospitality industry.</P>
      <P>He urged the Chinese travel agencies to keep the cost of Taiwan tours at a
minimum of US$60 per capita per day, and refrain from waging price wars that
will undermine the quality of tours.</P>
      <P>Yang said Taiwan is preparing to allow visits by Chinese backpackers, but this
would require careful planning and China's cooperation.</P>
      <P>"It will only be approved when both sides of the strait think it is OK," he
said.</P>
      <P>The seminar was held to mark the one month anniversary of the association's
office opening in Beijing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The controversy surrounding Taiwan's partial ban on beef imports from the U.S.
is not resolved but won't affect the countries' strong trade relationship,
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Raymond F. Burghardt said Friday.</P>
      <P>Burghardt told a media roundtable that the beef row was a "lingering issue"
because U.S. senators and the U.S. government see Taiwan's market as still not
totally open to U.S. beef due to "non-scientific" reasoning.</P>
      <P>In January, Taiwan's legislature passed an amendment to the Act Governing Food
Safety that banned imports of specific beef products from countries with
documented cases of mad cow disease in the past decade. The amendment
effectively barred U.S. ground beef, beef offal and other beef parts such as the
skull, eyes and intestines from Taiwan's market, in contravention of a bilateral
beef trade protocol signed by the two countries last October.</P>
      <P>Burghardt said, however, that U.S. beef "is coming in and doing well (on
Taiwan's market) and people are buying bone-in and boneless beef... It would be
nice to see the market totally open."</P>
      <P>Moreover,  he said,  the fact that Taiwan  is the U.S.'s ninth-largest  trading
partner  and sixth-largest  market  for agricultural products says a lot about
the countries' bilateral trade relations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Friday
that she would welcome a visit by the head of China's Taiwan Affairs Office
while also expressing a wish to visit the mainland sometime in the future.</P>
      <P>"I would welcome Director Wang Yi to come to Taiwan," Lai said in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>She also felt she would have the opportunity to travel to China because of more
institutionalized contacts between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>"Under the systematic negotiating framework" between the two intermediary bodies
from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, an "MAC chairperson's visit to the
mainland, or that of the Taiwan Affairs Office director to Taiwan can be
expected," she said.</P>
      <P>Lai arrived in the special administration region of China Thursday for a three-
day visit accompanied by Chu Hsi, the director of the MAC's Department of Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs.</P>
      <P>Addressing her visit, which was described by a senior MAC official as an ice-
breaking "landing on Hong Kong, " Lai said she came here to review the
operations of the MAC's Hong Kong office, referring to the Chung Hwa Travel
Service.</P>
      <P>She also plans to visit Taiwanese associations and other related groups set up
in the former British colony, Lai added.</P>
      <P>Speaking to MAC staff members stationed in Hong Kong, Lai said that positive
cross-strait  exchanges  have helped promote the improvement in Taiwan-Hong Kong
ties, and that her visit is evidence of that.</P>
      <P>She expressed hope for the newly-formed Taipei-based Taiwan-Hong Kong Economic
and Cultural Co-operation Council and its Hong Kong counterpart  --  the Hong
Kong-Taiwan  Economic  and Cultural Co-operation and Promotion Council -- to
spur visits by Taiwanese officials to Hong Kong and vice versa in the future.</P>
      <P>Taiwan formally launched the semi-official organization May 26 to help forge
closer cooperation with Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Speaking of Taiwan's Hong Kong policy, Lai said there remain many problems in
terms of Taiwan-Hong Kong cooperation and exchanges that need to be resolved.</P>
      <P>Matters concerning the welfare of people in Taiwan and Hong Kong, for example,
can still only be handled by "official authorities," she said, but hoped there
could be breakthroughs in the future.</P>
      <P>"We should anticipate the future development of Taiwan-Hong Kong relations in an
active and positive manner. Like visa waivers, if people expect that to happen,
both governments should work in that direction, " Lai said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, senior MAC officials confirmed that Lai made the visit in her
official  capacity  as MAC chief.  Lai is the  first minister-level Taiwanese
official to visit Hong Kong, they said.</P>

action plan to improve the city's public order and create a better and more
secure living environment.</P>
      <P>Chiu Feng-kuang,  formally deputy director of the Criminal Investigation Bureau,
also promised to streamline police ethics and discipline as he took over the
helm at a ceremony attended by his predecessor Hu Mu-yuan and Taichung Mayor
Jason Hu.</P>
      <P>Mayor Hu lauded Hu Mu-yuan, who has been reassigned to head a riot police corps,
for his arduous efforts to combat crime and maintain public order during his
nine-month term of office.</P>
      <P>The personnel reshuffle came after a string of daylight gunfights in the central
Taiwanese city in recent months, including a May 28 shooting that claimed two
lives. More embarrassing was the discovery that four police officers were
present at the scene of the latest killings.</P>
      <P>Amid public outrage over ties between city police staff and gangs, Mayor Hu
urged Chiu to draw a clear line of battle in the fight against crime rings.</P>
      <P>After public demand that the police bureau release security camera footage of
the May 28 shootout at the office of Weng Chi-nan, an alleged gang boss who was
killed in the shootings, Chiu said he will deal with the issue in a speedy and
transparent manner.</P>
      <P>As to relations between police and criminals, Chiu said he will require all

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) said Friday it will sue the
Executive Yuan's Referendum Review Committee for dereliction of duty, a day
after the committee rejected the TSU's referendum initiative on a proposed trade
pact with China.</P>
      <P>The committee turned down the referendum proposal, which asked "Do you agree
with the government signing an economic cooperation framework agreement with
China?" by a 12-4 margin.</P>
      <P>The committee consists of 21 members, but only 19 attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei blasted the committee's decision at a press
conference, saying that it is invalid and does not conform to the law. He said
the party would file a complaint with prosecutors that the committee should be
prosecuted for dereliction of duty.</P>
      <P>The opposition party also plans to appeal the committee's ruling, and if the
appeal fails, it intends to file an administrative appeal, Huang said.</P>
      <P>If the administrative litigation does not succeed, the TSU will then resort to a
constitutional interpretation, the TSU leader said.</P>
      <P>Huang accused the committee of degrading its status as a government unit that
safeguards the people's right of referendum to one that suppresses Taiwan's
democracy.</P>
      <P>He also urged the public to endorse another referendum proposal the TSU plans to
launch Saturday, which is aimed at abolishing the Referendum Review Committee.</P>
      <P>The committee rejected the referendum proposal on the grounds that it did not
conform with the law because of a "conflict between the reasoning and the
question itself, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>But a letter previously sent to the TSU by the Central Election Commission said
the proposal did not violate the law, according to the TSU leader, and he bashed
the committee for denying a fact it first recognized and violating the law in
the process.</P>
      <P>He said he will take legal action against the 12 members of the committee who
rejected the proposal.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday in an interview with the Central News
Agency that a proposed  economic cooperation framework agreement with China is a
major national policy, and the government should allow the people to express
their opinion on the matter through a referendum.</P>
      <P>He said it was ridiculous to allow a dozen people write off a referendum
proposal supported by more than 100,000 people.</P>
      <P>In response, relevant government officials said the committee has the right to
screen the content of the proposal, if the proposal initiators are not satisfied
with the decision, they can file an appeal and pursue administrative remedies.</P>

      <P>Minister of Justice Tseng Yung-fu on Friday refused to commit to a request by
victims' families that the country's 40 death row inmates be executed
simultaneously.</P>
      <P>During a meeting in his office with a group of crime victims' families,  the
minister  offered his sympathy  and voiced his determination to handle the
convicts according to law.</P>
      <P>"Law is meant to bring justice to the world, and criminals should be punished
according to law," he was quoted as saying. "Although the Ministry of Justice
has set abolishment of the death penalty as its eventual goal, those who have
already been sentenced to death should be executed as required by the law."</P>
      <P>The meeting was held behind closed doors, but Hsu Wen-bin, a national policy
adviser to the president and a human rights lawyer, said afterward that many
families of the victims tearfully pleaded with Tseng to have all death row
inmates executed simultaneously.</P>
      <P>Tseng took office on March 22 to fill a post left by Wang Ching-feng, who
resigned amid a public outcry after refusing to sign execution orders for death
row inmates.</P>
      <P>Tseng has told the Legislative Yuan that he personally favors the abolishment of
death penalty, but that he will follow the law in dealing with death row inmates
unless it is altered to end capital punishment.</P>
      <P>The minister made headlines when he approved the execution of four death row
inmates on April 30. A European Union foreign policy chief condemned the move
the next day and asked Taiwan to declare a moratorium on the death penalty and
to work to amend laws abolishing the practice.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A United States diplomat on Friday supported Taiwan's right to sign trade
agreements with other WTO members, but said that an existing trade and
investment framework agreement would be a better vehicle through which to
improve U.S.-Taiwan ties.</P>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Raymond F. Burghardt said in Taipei
Friday that the U.S. believes Taiwan's rights as a WTO member should be
protected and should not be vulnerable to influence from China.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. position has been as clear as anybody that all WTO members have the
right and power to sign trade agreements with other WTO members. Period. No need
for prior ECFA agreements, no need for permission from China, " said Burghardt
at a media roundtable.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is trying to sign an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China, in part to pave the way for signing free trade agreements (FTAs) with
other countries, including the U.S.</P>
      <P>But a Chinese Foreign Ministry official recently seemed to undercut the
government's argument when he said China would not agree to the idea, sparking
controversy over the issue in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Though Burghardt said the U.S. supported the right of every WTO member to sign a
trade agreement, he indicated that the U.S. intends to improve bilateral trade
ties with Taiwan under the framework of an existing Trade and Investment
Framework Agreement (TIFA) rather than a full-fledged FTA.</P>
      <P>There is not much enthusiasm in Washington for another FTA after the three
previous FTAs with South Korea, Panama and Columbia have failed to pass the U.S.
Congress, he said.</P>
      <P>Both Taiwan and the U.S. have agreed that the last round of talks under the TIFA
-- a deputy ministerial meeting which was held in July 2007 -- was too long ago,
and "it would be nice to see that happen sometime before the end of the year,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he emphasized that the U.S. trade agreements are always "very
complete" and different from the ones signed between Asian countries, which are
usually "weak and partial."</P>
      <P>The diplomat reiterated that Taiwan is not ready to fully open its market (to
foreign economies) subject to a full free trade agreement, nor did he think that
agreement would clear Taiwan's Legislature.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan is seeking to sign FTAs with other countries, Asian countries will be
better choices because it will be asked for less of a market opening from those
countries than the U.S., Burghardt suggested.</P>
      <P>Burghardt also confirmed that three U.S. senators -- Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.), Kay Hagan (D-NC) and Mark Udall (D-Co.) -- will visit Taiwan on
Saturday, the first visit by U.S. senators since President Ma Ying-jeou took
office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>Burghardt said the visit will be "short and unofficial."</P>

      <P>Tea growers in central Taiwan's Nantou County plan to create a clearer image for
their tea by launching a brand named after the county's famous Sun Moon Lake,
local officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-wang, head of Nantou County's agriculture department, said that the
county's eight townships produce 62 percent of the country's tea, but that
tourists are often unable to tell which tea is from Nantou because the townships
use their own branding.</P>
      <P>Chen said that local farmers' associations have agreed to create an umbrella
brand called "Sun Moon Lake Tea, " and that the county will hold a packaging
design contest in which the winner will receive NT$30,000 and a medal.</P>
      <P>Tea growers in Nantou can choose whether or not to market their products under
the brand, and those who agree can still have their individual growing areas
identified on the packaging that will also show the Sun Moon Lake brand, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Lan Fang-ren, a Mingjian Township farmers' association official, used the
success of Alishan tea as an example to explain the importance of branding.</P>
      <P>Lan said that Chinese tourists are more familiar with Alishan tea and that it is
not easy to promote tea from Nantou. He said he hoped that with the fame of Sun
Moon Lake, the county's tea will be able to carve out a niche in the market.</P>

unemployment, being a result of insufficient consumer spending, could be
relieved by government-sponsored programs.

1926: Chiang Kai-shek becomes commander-in-chief of the National Revolutionary
Forces in China.

1945: The supreme commanders from the United States, Great Britain, France, and

Development, says that in addition to financial aid, the Republic of China is to
offer economic advice to its allies in the same way the United States helped the
island some 50 years ago.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "There are three things which a wise and good man
holds in awe. He holds in awe the Laws of God, persons in authority, and the
words of wisdom of holy men. A fool, on the other hand, does not know that there
are Laws of God; he, therefore, has no reverence for them; he is disrespectful
to persons in authority, and condemns the words of wisdom of holy men."</TEXT>

covered up by local political forces? The Taichung shooting incident was just an
epitome of the corrupt links between politicians and gangsters.</P>
      <P>It is a mission impossible trying to eradicate gang organizations in any
society, but the government must draw a clear line between the right and wrong
to guide grassroots policemen and maintain the rule of law. This is by no means
an easy task.</P>
      <P>The gunman who still remains at large must be seized and punished by law, but a
bigger challenge that will test the government's wisdom is how it will resolve
corruption among government officials as had been exposed by the four policemen.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) is assessing the
possibility of opening branches in China to better serve Taiwanese companies
dedicated to the cultural innovation industry amid more frequent cross-Taiwan
Strait exchanges, an official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Johnson Chiu, deputy CEO of Taipei Culture Foundation, told CNA that although
the plan is still on the drawing board, the CCA might follow in the footsteps of
the quasi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council by opening
footholds in major Chinese cities and stationing officials there to serve more
Taiwanese businessmen.</P>
      <P>Chiu's remarks echoed a response by CCA Chairman Emile Sheng in a legislative
hearing in late April that his council might be able to establish semi-official
offices in China this year.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, many Taiwan cultural innovation firms have called for
government assistance, particularly on the tax problems and legal consultations,
to help them tap the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Chiu is now in Shanghai for the 2010 Taipei-Shanghai twin-cities exhibition on
cultural innovation, which will be held June 17-20 in the Chinese city.</P>
      <P>"The major purpose of the exhibition is to provide a more effective platform to
help the many small cultural innovation businesses from Taiwan build an image
and distribute their products," he explained.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwanese companies of this kind in Shanghai are promoting their brands
through department stores, five-star hotels or shopping malls.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- MAC head on low-profile visit to Hong Kong</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
06/05/10  13:08:24
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan arrived in Hong Kong June 3 for a three-day visit in
her official capacity.  Though  staying  low-profile,  she  was  the  first
minister-level Taiwanese official to visit the special administrative region of
China.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage on June 5 of the visit
described by MAC ranking officials as "significant" :</P>
      <P>Economics Daily News:</P>
      <P>Although Lai stressed that she visited Hong Kong only to inspect the MAC's
operations there, her appearance on the special Chinese territory, where public
visits by Taiwanese officials -- no matter of what rank -- had always been
rejected, could definitely be seen as a major breakthrough on Taiwan-Hong Kong
ties against the backdrop of the warming relations between mainland China and
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Despite Lai not meeting with any Hong Kong officials or Chinese officials
stationed in Hong Kong during her stay, her visit in the capacity of MAC chief,
Taiwan's highest authority in charge of China affairs, reflects Beijing's new
thoughts on Taiwan-Hong Kong and cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Lai's stepping on China-controlled  land also suggests the possibility of higher
ranking Taiwanese officials visiting the mainland; they are currently still
barred from conducting such visits.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>A Beijing-based scholar anticipated that Lai's visit to Hong Kong in the runup
of the signing of a proposed cross-strait economic cooperation framework
cooperation (ECFA) was also aimed at studying Hong Kong's free trade agreements
with other countries.</P>
      <P>He also expressed that he believes Lai would meet Chinese liaison officials in
Hong Kong or other officials from Beijing during her stay in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Although cross-strait links are being expanding in the full scale, the exchanges
of governmental personnel between Hong Kong and Taiwan remain low profile.</P>
      <P>Concerned sources disclosed that Lai had planned to meet with Hong Kong Chief
Executive Donald Tsang during her visit to Hong Kong. The plan, however, was not
able to be carried out in the end because Lai had a tight schedule  and Tsang
was occupied with other activities.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, according to reliable sources, Lai's visit was kept low key
because she came to Hong Kong at a sensitive time: her visit coincides with the
21st anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre on June 4th.</P>
      <P>Although Lai,  a former member of Taiwan's pro-independent opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union, did not deliberately choose the time to make the visit,
Beijing and her host Hong Kong chose instead to keep it low key, the sources
said.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Securities Association (TSA) said Saturday that a proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement ( ECFA) with China should be signed as soon as
possible as the trade pact would be very positive for financial industries on
both sides.</P>
      <P>Gordon Yeh, vice chairman of the TSA, said at a seminar that with China's great
market size, and Taiwan's experience, talent and service efficiency, the
cooperation between both sides will be able to create a new competitive edge in
Taiwan's and China's financial industries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Futures Exchange Vice President Huang Nai-kuan said that Taiwanese
futures traders have been focusing on financial futures for a long time, so they
will be able to offer experience to China in developing financial futures.</P>
      <P>In addition, as major futures companies on both sides have a similar amount of
registered capital, they will be more likely to invest shares in each other or
set up a joint venture, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang also noted that China's futures markets at present only offer commodity
products, so there is still much room for growth in other business areas, such

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's former vice premier said Saturday that the opposition party's
"politically maneuvered" campaign against a soon-to-be signed Taiwan-China trade
pact would not appeal to most voters in year-end local elections, in which he is
taking part.</P>
      <P>As campaigning for the mayoral positions in Taiwan's five biggest municipalities
and cities is expected to intensify ahead of the November elections, Eric Chu
was asked by CNA how he would assess the impacts of the opposition's recently-
failed referendum drive on the government's efforts to sign the trade agreement.</P>
      <P>Chu said the opposition should adopt a "rational and objective" attitude on the
issue.</P>
      <P>"I think it is necessary to look at the issue (on the trade pact) from an
objective and rational perspective, " he said Saturday on the sidelines of a
seminar related to the trade pact known as the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>"If it (the campaign) is handled in a politically maneuvered manner, it will not
be able to appeal to the majority of voters, " said Chu, who is also the vice
chairman of the ruling party Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Chu is running for mayor in Xinbei City in northern Taiwan, which has a bigger
population than any other city or county in Taiwan. His rival is Tsai Ing- wen,
chairwoman of the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>After a government committee on Thursday rejected another opposition party's
proposal to hold a referendum on the issue of whether Taiwan should sign a trade
agreement with China, the DPP said that it will launch a "10-year war of
resistance" and continue pushing for a referendum on the Taiwan-China pact
slated to be signed later this month.</P>
      <P>The government committee rejected the Taiwan Solidarity Union's (TSU) initiative
on the grounds that it did not conform with the law because of a "conflict
between the reasoning and the question itself."</P>
      <P>The DPP will organize an event later Saturday in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung, where the party's mayoral candidates will help step up the campaign
against the trade pact.</P>
      <P>Opposition parties and a significant number of people in Taiwan believe that the
trade pact will result in an influx of Chinese workers and cheap goods from
China, while also making Taiwan too dependent on China, and potentially
undermining Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>But the government considers the pact as an important way to normalize the trade
relations between Taiwan and its largest trading partner, China, and to overcome
China's blockage of Taiwan signing free trade agreements with other countries.</P>
      <P>The mayoral elections will take place Nov. 27 in five special municipalities --
Taipei City, Xinbei City, Taichung City, Tainan City and Kaohsiung City -- whose
populations together account for 70 percent of the country's total.</P>
      <P>The races are viewed as a bellwether for the 2012 presidential election and a
gauge of the popularity of President Ma Ying-jeou, who is expected to seek
reelection, but whose approval ratings have remained low for most of the two
years that he has been in office.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Under the directive of President Ma Ying-jeou, a delegation of Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) officials will head for Singapore next
week to inspect how its government succeeded in reducing its jobless rate to 2.2
percent.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the government has been keener in publishing brilliant
statistics than caring for the people's lives. Despite all-out government
efforts such as creating temporary jobs to bring down unemployment, it would be
pointless if Taiwan is a society without confidence and hopes, due to a lack of
stable jobs.</P>
      <P>A lower jobless rate does not mean an improvement in employment, and this is the
real problem because creating temporary jobs is just an interim measure. With
the economy gradually recovering from the financial tsunami, the government
should work out a long-term policy to boost employment.</P>
      <P>In terms of the impact of industrial development in the job market, Taiwan
should send delegations to study what is happening in Japan and South Korea,
where the situations are more similar to Taiwan's.</P>
      <P>If the government only cares about jobless statistics rather than the core of
the unemployment problem, the problem in Taiwan will not be genuinely resolved.

      <P>Global smartphone maker HTC has announced a record revenue of NT$18.66 billion
(US$575 million) in May, up 49.5 percent year-on-year, which the company
attributed to strong market demand for its high-end mobile phones.</P>
      <P>It was the second consecutive month for the company to register a record monthly
revenue, according to the company Friday. In the first five months of the year,
the company registered a revenue of NT$74.37 billion, up 34 percent from the

      <P>More Chinese companies may want to take part in Computex Taipei, the world's
second biggest computer trade show, next year as this year saw a surge of them
using the show to explore overseas business opportunities, an organizer said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>"For the Chinese at the moment, except for the domestic market, it remains
difficult for them to branch out to foreign markets. Therefore, they use
Computex as an excellent platform to establish connections with the rest of the
world," Jeremy Horng, deputy executive director of the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA)'s Exhibition Department, told the Central News
Agency in an interview.</P>
      <P>The five-day trade show, Asia's biggest computer show, ended Saturday. This
year, more than 1,700 companies from around the world showcased their products
at Computex, using 4,861 booths.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Computer Association, another organizer of the event, said in a
statement released Saturday that the number of Chinese buyers visiting the show
rose significantly this year from last year.</P>
      <P>A total of 106 companies from China used 171 booths at the trade show this year,
which was more than double the numbers from last year, when there were 41
Chinese exhibitors using 78 booths, Horng noted.</P>
      <P>Computex was open to Chinese exhibitors last year for the first time after the
political tensions between Taiwan and China had eased since the inauguration of
Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou in May 2008.</P>
      <P>Computex successfully appealed to Chinese exhibitors as the show increased their
business opportunities from foreign buyers, Horng said.</P>
      <P>However, due to insufficient space at Computex's venues, more than 100 companies
from various countries could not exhibit at the annual event, now in its 30th
year, according to Horng.</P>
      <P>Unless Computex expands its venues, it might be difficult for the show to
accommodate the even greater interest expected from Chinese firms next year,
organizers said.</P>
      <P>"Although we could expect yet another increase in the number of Chinese
companies that want to exhibit at the show next year, we will have to see first
if we could provide more booths for them to use, " he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Almost every Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) member is concerned about
the progress of negotiations and talks on a proposed trade pact between Taiwan
and mainland China, Taiwan's minister of economic affairs said Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's active move to promote the signing of an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China draws APEC members' attention, Shih Yen-hsiang noted
in an interview with CNA in Sapporo, Japan.</P>
      <P>Shih, leading the Taiwan delegation, arrived here Thursday for the two-day
annual meeting of APEC trade ministers that began Saturday.</P>
      <P>He attended a formal welcoming dinner the previous evening, in which he was seen
chatting with World Trade Organization Secretary General Pascal Lamy, as well as
ministers and trade representatives of other nations, including China's Minister
of Commerce Chen Deming.</P>
      <P>In the coming APEC meeting, Shih will conduct talks with Lamy.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he will hold talks with Chen or have a chance to talk about the
ECFA issue during the meeting, Shih only said the APEC forum is a public
occasion, on which he will meet all trade ministers of all member states to
exchange opinions.</P>
      <P>Responding to questions on the widely-anticipated early harvest list of items
that will have tariffs reduced immediately after the proposed ECFA deal is
signed, Shih reiterated that items which are expected to affect Taiwan's
employment, farmers and conventional medium and small enterprises, will not be
put in the program for tax deduction or exemption.</P>
      <P>As to how many items of products will be included in the early-harvest list,
Shih only said talks on the issue have not been finalized, but he confirmed that
the number of Chinese products on the list will be less than the more than 300
Taiwanese products on the list.</P>
      <P>Shih, again, underlined the importance and urgency of the signing of the cross-
strait trade pact, saying China, Japan and South Korea recently agreed among
each other to be active in promoting the formation of a free trade agreement
among themselves.</P>
      <P>Once the proposed Northeast Asian free trade zone is formed, Taiwanese companies
will not be able to compete with rival businesses that enjoy preferential tax
treatment in the region, Shih warned.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NTCH director plots to get Taiwan's performers on world stages</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/05/10  16:59:56</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Huang Pi-twan has been the artistic director of Taiwan's National Theater and
Concert Hall (NTCH) for only two months, but her mission is already clear: to
expand efforts to stage productions with international directors and give local
performers more experience.</P>
      <P>Huang, a former head of the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) ,
feels the NTCH has a duty to boost the standard of performances in Taiwan, and
one way to achieve that, she says, is by focusing on collaborations with artists
from other countries.</P>
      <P>"This not only lets us learn advanced technology and performance skills from
other artists, it also helps us promote our shows to the world," she stressed in
an interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Huang's mission is not new for the performance venue.</P>
      <P>The NTCH has often worked with international directors in the past, including on
the production "1433-The Grand Voyage, " a collaboration between avant-garde
American stage director Robert Wilson and Taiwanese percussion group "U Theatre"
that was staged in the first half of the year.</P>
      <P>But Huang hopes such co-productions  will be staged  more frequently in the
future, and she said there are at least two programs set for the second half of
the year.</P>
      <P>"One of those is an opera called 'La Peintre, Yu-Lin, ' in which a Taiwanese
writer, composer and orchestra and Taiwanese singers will work with a French
director, " she indicated.</P>
      <P>The production, which will debut at the National Theater Hall at the beginning
of July, is based on the story of a legendary Chinese women named Pan Yu-Liang,
who first was a prostitute and then a concubine before becoming a famous
painter, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The opera's composer is National Award for Arts winner Chien Nan-chang, who will
team up with playwright Wang An-chi and French director Juliette Deschamps.</P>
      <P>"The opera will present a fascinating  world of song and performance," Huang
said.</P>
      <P>The other production, slated for August, will invite Wang Hsin-sing, the founder
of Hsin Sing Nanguan (also written Xin Xin Nanguan), to collaborate with French
director Lukas Hemleb on a modern Nanguan opera called "Feather."</P>
      <P>Nanguan is a style of Chinese classical music originating in the southern
Chinese province of Fujian.</P>
      <P>Huang revealed that the story of the Nanguan musical is based on a Chinese
legend known as "The Double Seventh Festival, " which involves a love story
between a goddess and a human being.</P>
      <P>"We spent over NT$20 million on each production, but I believe our artists can
learn a lot from these opportunities, and we will definitely promote these works
in other countries," she said.</P>
      <P>Despite the challenge of having to compete with many bigger and more modern
venues built in Asia in recent years, Huang maintains confidence in the
management ability and technology of the NTCH.</P>
      <P>"While we are preparing for the celebration  of the 25th anniversary of the NTCH
in 2012, I think the first thing we should do is to make a list of our standard
operating procedures (SOP) , which include program organization, stage
technology, and marketing, among others," she said.</P>
      <P>The purpose is to help those who will manage new performance halls that will be
opening in the future in northern, central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We can provide information and experience to help them manage these new venues
smoothly," she said.</P>
      <P>Another new project Huang feels proud of is successfully raising funds to enable
the children of poor families in remote areas to see shows at the NTCH.</P>
      <P>"We raised over NT$1.7 million in May, which meant that we reached our goal much
earlier than expected, " Huang said, pleased that the fund will help more
children enter the beautiful world of the performing arts. By Sunnie Chen, CNA

      <P>As Taiwan is likely to soon sign an economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China, Taiwan should devise an effective strategy to take advantage
of a Western Taiwan Straits Economic Zone in Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>Beijing is promoting the zone to balance regional development and boost economic
integration with Taiwan, paving the way for peaceful cross-strait unification.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's private sector has responded enthusiastically to the special economic
zone on China's west coast, but the government has adopted a "cool-headed"
approach because of political concerns.</P>
      <P>Although we don't need to dance to Beijing's tune, Taiwan still needs to think
positively and try to benefit from China's west coast economic zone. That would
enable us to bolster economic development in our own special economic zones and
build a new model of two-way industrial cooperation in the post-ECFA era.</P>
      <P>We must stress that Taiwan as a whole should avoid engaging with the Fujian
zone. Rather, Taiwan should use its special economic zones to deal with the zone
on the opposite side so as to not hurt parity and Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The special economic zones envisioned by Taiwan's government, where companies
will be given preferential tax, labor, financing and customs treatment, will be
the best choice Taiwan has to embrace the post-ECFA era and cross-strait
dealings. (June 5, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Visitors to the international Computex Taipei trade show have found out quickly
that the future is in cloud computing, with industry veterans confident that the
concept's technology is launching integrated computing into a new era.</P>
      <P>"It may have been around for a long time, but now cloud computing is about to
take off, " Tudor Brown, president of British chip maker ARM, said at a forum on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The five-day Computex, which concluded Saturday, included a series of speeches
and discussions devoted to cloud computing technology, a sign of its growing
importance in the IT field.</P>
      <P>Cloud computing provides "highly available" services and data stored on an
Internet network (the cloud) that users can access with devices such as desktop
personal computers, TVs and smart phones connected to the Web.</P>
      <P>The advantage is that users do not have to install or maintain these services on
their devices, said Gary Szilagyi, vice president and general manager of
American semiconductor developer Atheros Communications, Inc.'s Computing and
Consumer Business Unit, at a conference Monday.</P>
      <P>"Everyone sees great value in the cloud, and in fact, there have been many
businesses founded upon entire requirements of delivering the cloud content," he
said.</P>
      <P>Cloud computing is expected to be the preferred solution in an era of rapid
industrial development, experts believe, and Brown said he saw a lot of
opportunity for Taiwan because the market is driven by low-power equipment,
innovation, cost and mobility.</P>
      <P>"That's what you do here very well," he said.</P>
      <P>According to Digitimes Research, there will be 10 billion connected devices in
the future, which would have been impossible to believe just a few years ago.</P>
      <P>"In 2004, it's very hard to think of a single desktop application which is used
by millions of users outside of games, " but now we have popular cloud web
applications, such as Gmail, Google Map, Twitter, and Facebook," said Sundar
Pichai, vice president of Google.</P>
      <P>Cloud computing  is also among the Taiwanese  government's strategic industries.
The government and the private sector jointly formed the Taiwan Cloud Computing
Consortium in April, pouring in NT$24 billion (US$740 million) to promote
development in the field over the next five years.</P>
      <P>"We expect the private sector to invest NT$12.7 billion in research and
development and another NT$100 billion for manufacturing and services, "
Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said at the Taiwan Business
Alliance Conference the day before Computex opened.</P>
      <P>"This could create 50,000 new jobs with a turnover of NT$1 trillion," he added.</P>

      <P>World-renowned Japanese architect Tadao Ando hosted a groundbreaking ceremony in
Taipei County Saturday to kick off construction on the first columbarium complex
he has designed in his illustrious career.</P>
      <P>Ando said he expects the new facility,  consisting  of a columbarium -- the
memorial building where the cremated remains of the deceased can be stored --
and a landscaped garden with 4,000 cherry trees, to become an international
architectural landmark that represents Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also hopes that the site will turn out to be one of the world's best
cemeteries and a global attraction for people to appreciate the beauty of cherry
blossoms outside of Washington, D.C., said the University of Tokyo professor.</P>
      <P>Ando has also incorporated water into his design, putting a reflecting pool on
the roof of the columbarium.</P>
      <P>Situated on a 26-hectare site in Sanjhih, a coastal township in northern Taiwan,
the planned columbarium complex and garden will cost an estimated NT$10 billion
(US$308.24 million) to build, according to Taipei-based Lung Yen Life Service
Co., which contracted Ando to build the facility.</P>
      <P>It is expected to take 10 years to complete.</P>

      <P>Taipei City will make a concerted effort to increase the availability of public
rental housing over the next 10 years, hoping that 5 percent of all available
housing in the city will be public rentals by 2020.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Long-bin said Friday that 0.65 percent of the city's housing
stock is currently public rental housing, the highest ratio in the country but
still low compared with western countries, and he expressed hope that the rate
will be able to rise to 5 percent, the same level as in the U.S.</P>
      <P>Hau said that the city government is planning to build 200 public rental units
of 50 square meters each in six locations by the end of 2014. Each unit will
have a monthly rent of NT$10,000 (US$308).</P>
      <P>The city will also release  houses obtained  from private construction companies
taking part in urban renewal projects or other joint development projects for
public rental.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,230 such houses, including some located above MRT complex
buildings, will be available for public rental rather than sold via public
auction, Hau said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the city government also plans to renovate some idle school
buildings, or use old market places to build public rental homes, he said.</P>
      <P>A city government official said the government will draft regulations to prevent
high-income households from benefiting from public rental housing policies.</P>

      <P>The government will resolutely push for energy conservation and carbon emission
cuts in both the public and private sectors this year, Premier Wu Den-yih said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>He said major carbon emitters, such as Taiwan Power Company (Taipower), CPC
Corp., Taiwan, Formosa Plastics and China Steel, will have to cut carbon
emissions by replacing aging equipment to enhance energy efficiency.</P>
      <P>"If major carbon emission businesses such as Taipower and CPC strive for
progress, they will be able to cut millions or tens of millions of tons of
carbon emissions every year, " he said on the sidelines of an energy
conservation show coinciding with World Environment Day.</P>
      <P>The premier pledged that the government would also focus more emphasis  on
energy  saving  and carbon  reduction  in public infrastructure.</P>
      <P>One example, he said, was that the government has begun to replace the light
bulbs normally used in traffic lights with LEDs in the past two years and that
there are only three or four cities that have yet to replace their traffic
lights.</P>
      <P>"By 2011, all traffic lights will use LEDs, " the premier said.</P>
      <P>The government will also encourage the development of renewable energy, solar
power, LEDs, biomass energy and wind power, and electric cars and motorcycles,
he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Executive Yuan has also planned to make Green Island as a model
low-carbon emission island, the premier said.</P>
      <P>"We'll promote the idea to other parts of Taiwan after reviewing the results on
Green Island," he added.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Huang Jung-chiou said that in addition to Green Island,
the low-carbon island project will also cover three other  outlying  islands  --
Liuchiu  Islet  (also  known as Siaoliouchiou), Penghu and Kinmen.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou spoke of the importance of signing a trade pact with
China when he received three visiting U.S. senators Saturday.</P>
      <P>The trio -- Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) , Kay Hagan (D-NC) and Mark Udall
(D-Co.) -- arrived in Taiwan earlier in the day, marking the first visit by U.S.
senators to Taiwan since President Ma took office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>The president noted that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have signed 12
agreements over the past two years, and that cross-strait ties have been more
peaceful and stable than at any time in the past six decades.</P>
      <P>The two sides are now negotiating  a economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) , and Ma said he hoped it could be signed soon to institutionalize cross-
strait trade ties.</P>
      <P>Citing a comment by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg at the
Brookings Institution, a U.S. think tank, on May 10, Ma said the signing of the
trade pact is significant in that it will promote peace, resolve differences and
avoid confrontation.</P>
      <P>Noting that the group flew into Taiwan after visiting Beijing and Shanghai, Ma
said this "was unimaginable in the past, and was made possible through improved
cross-strait relations."</P>
      <P>The president also said that he talked to Feinstein, a former San Francisco
mayor, over the phone during his visits to the U.S. in 2006, 2008, and 2009 but
did not meet her, and said he was glad to "finally have the meeting in Taiwan."</P>

      <P>The old CK124 steam engine sounded its horn at Sanyi Railway Station in Miaoli
County Saturday, signaling to the train's 300 passengers and other train
aficionados around the country that service on a historic railway line in Taiwan
had resumed.</P>
      <P>"This is the train I took when I was little, " said a 55-year-old grandmother
when describing the old locomotive to her eight-year-old grandson at the
station.</P>
      <P>The passenger, identified only by the surname Huang, said she had eagerly
awaited the reopening of the 15.9-kilometer-long Old Mountain Line between Sanyi
and Houli in Taichung County for 12 years, since the rail line's operations were
suspended in 1998.</P>
      <P>Her 94-year-old mother has still not forgotten the sound of trains on the
railway line running through the hills of central Taiwan, Huang said.</P>
      <P>To attract tourists, the Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) spent nearly
NT$200 million (US$6.16 million) to restore the tracks and facilities along the
line, which passes many historic sites, including the Broken Longteng Bridge and
the nearby Shengsing station built during the Japanese colonial era.</P>
      <P>The project has managed to restore service on 13.6 kilometers of the line thus
far, from Sanyi to Taian Station in Taichung County, according to the TRA.</P>
      <P>On Saturday the old steam train made two round trips. It will be back in service
on June 9, each Wednesday in July and August, and August 29, with two round-trip
runs per day.</P>
      <P>In addition, the TRA will also offer services by a diesel-powered train every
Monday and Friday between July 5 and Aug. 27, with two round-trip runs per day.</P>

      <P>Nearly six tons of cherries recently imported from the United States have been
found to contain the pesticide malathion, the Department of Health (DOH) said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Pan Chih-kuan,  a director  of the DOH's  Food  and Drug Administration, said
the two batches of cherries contained 0.02 parts per million and 0.03 ppm of
malathion, respectively. Taiwan's regulations do not allow any trace amounts of
the substance in cherries.</P>
      <P>The two importers are now applying to have the two batches re-examined.</P>
      <P>If they are still found to contain the pesticide, the first batch, which had not
been cleared by customs, will be returned to the shipper, and the second batch,
which had been released to the importer to keep refrigerated pending the results
of the examination, will be confiscated and destroyed.</P>
      <P>Pan said that if a third batch of U.S. imported cherries were to fail the
examination within six months, the DOH will ask the U.S. to come up with a plan
to improve the situation.</P>
      <P>"We will also step up the examination of all cherries imported from the United

      <P>A multi-purpose unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) developed by a local company will
take part in a major air show next week, an official of the company said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Cooper Chang, the marketing manager of Carbon-Based Technology Inc., said its
UAV, called the UAVER, will take part in the Berlin Air Show June 8-13. It will
be the first time an unmanned aerial system (UAS) with a Taiwanese brand has
entered a major air show.</P>
      <P>The company demonstrated the 3.45-kilogram system on Friday on top of a building
at National Chung Hsin University in central Taiwan's Taichung, during which
images taken by the airborne UAV were transmitted simultaneously.</P>
      <P>Chang said the United States, though a leader in the development of unmanned
aerial systems, has generally used much larger systems for military purposes.</P>
      <P>But the smaller UAV developed by Carbon-Based Technology can be an effective
tool in monitoring disasters, environmental pollution and other problems.</P>
      <P>Chen Shu-chun,  director of the university's Water &amp; Soil Conservation
Department, said traditional unmanned helicopters can monitor the environment,
but they have the limitations of being loud, noisy and hard to maneuver.</P>
      <P>They also only have a short remote control distance (about 2 kilometers) and
cannot stay airborne for long (under 10 minutes).</P>
      <P>This is why they are confined to short-distance environmental monitoring and
disaster prevention missions, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"The Avian UAS developed  by Taiwan has solved the above problems," he added.</P>
      <P>He said the UAS also does not require a long runway due to its use of a bungee
rope launch for take-off and its parachute landing system.</P>
      <P>The other advantage is that the whole system can be maneuvered from a disaster
prevention center indoors.</P>
      <P>The system can stay airborne for 90 minutes and penetrate remote areas to
provide often difficult-to-obtain information in real time.</P>

      <P>Computex Taipei, Asia's largest computer show, attracted more international
visitors this year than ever before and generated a record US$230 million in
business on site, the organizers said in a statement on the show's final day
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Jeremy Horng, deputy executive director of Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) 's Exhibition Department, said the 35,017 international
visitors from 216 different countries and regions attending the show's first
four days outpaced the 34,892 visitors from 184 countries and regions last year.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA, more than 2,000 one-on-one meetings between buyers and
suppliers were held on June 1 and 2, generating on-site business worth US$230
million, more than double the US$100 million generated during similar meetings
last year.</P>
      <P>The top five countries  and regions  most represented  by international buyers
were the United States, Japan, China, Hong Kong, and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Aiming to make Computex the world's biggest computer show, Horng said the fair's
international  significance in the information technology sector was reflected
by the 400 foreign exhibitors occupying 830 booths at the show.</P>
      <P>The number of booths was 5 percent higher than last year.</P>
      <P>But venue size continues to haunt Computex's ambitions to expand. According to
the organizers, there were 100 to 200 foreign and local exhibitors on the
waiting list this year, and other vendors even plan to apply for more booths
next year.</P>
      <P>Because another Nangang Exhibition Hall will not be ready until the end of 2012,
the organizers said they will consider using Taiwan World Trade Center Hall 2
next year, which can provide another 350 booths.</P>

      <P>The operator of an electronic freeway toll collection system admitted Saturday
that it will fall short of the targeted usage rate for the system by the end of
June, but it remains at odds with the government over how the problem should be
solved.</P>
      <P>Far Eastern Electronic Toll Collection Co. (FETC) , which was commissioned to
set up the ETC service, said that with the ETC usage rate at 38 percent at
present, it is not likely that the target rate for the end of June of 45 percent
will be met.</P>
      <P>According to an agreement between the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) and FETC, the ETC usage rate is required to reach 45
percent by the end of June, and 65 percent by the end of 2012.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau under the MOTC said it will send a
notice to FETC next month asking the company to improve the situation within a
specified time, but it acknowledged that the two sides have failed to reach any
consensus on how to resolve the issue.</P>
      <P>The usage rate of the system, which collects tolls from freeway motorists
automatically,  has been hampered by resistance  to installing the system's
transmitter, the "on board unit, " which costs NT$1,199 (US$37).</P>
      <P>Since the ETC system was introduced four years ago, about 950,000 vehicles have
installed the OBUs.</P>
      <P>The bureau has hoped that FETC would offer the OBU at a lower price or for free,
but the company has rejected the idea, saying that free installations would cost
the company over NT$6 billion, well above the company's NT$3.8 billion in
capital.</P>
      <P>The FETC, on the other hand, has suggested many times since last year that the
government should offer a 20 percent discount on tolls for ETC users, but the
proposal has not yet been approved by the MOTC.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an MOTC official also said on Saturday that the low usage rate of the
ETC system could delay the implementation of an automatic distance-based  toll
collection scheme,  but did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>The ministry plans to replace both the frequency-based ETC and manned toll
booths with a fully automatic distance-based toll collection model by the end of
2012.</P>

      <P>An alleged gangster leader was recently shot dead by an unknown gunman at his
own company in Taichung City. Four police officers were found to be at the crime
scene when the shooting took place, provoking strong public criticism of their
misconduct.</P>
      <P>The four policemen claimed they were only chatting and drinking there, but why
did they have to meet at a secret guest house at the "biotech" company run by
the killed gangster. The suspicious company had no official registration and
nobody knows what the company's functions are.</P>
      <P>The government has declared war against the underworld, but how can it launch
the battle against the gang operations disguised as enterprises, which are then
covered up by local political forces? The Taichung shooting incident was just an
epitome of the corrupt links between politicians and gangsters.</P>
      <P>It is a mission impossible trying to eradicate gang organizations in any
society, but the government must draw a clear line between the right and wrong
to guide grassroots policemen and maintain the rule of law. This is by no means
an easy task.</P>
      <P>The gunman who still remains at large must be seized and punished by law, but a
bigger challenge that will test the government's wisdom is how it will resolve
corruption among government officials as had been exposed by the four policemen.

      <P>Taiwan's Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) is assessing the
possibility of opening branches in China to better serve Taiwanese companies
dedicated to the cultural innovation industry amid more frequent cross-Taiwan
Strait exchanges, an official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Johnson Chiu, deputy CEO of Taipei Culture Foundation, told CNA that although
the plan is still on the drawing board, the CCA might follow in the footsteps of
the quasi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council by opening
footholds in major Chinese cities and stationing officials there to serve more
Taiwanese businessmen.</P>
      <P>Chiu's remarks echoed a response by CCA Chairman Emile Sheng in a legislative
hearing in late April that his council might be able to establish semi-official
offices in China this year.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, many Taiwan cultural innovation firms have called for
government assistance, particularly on the tax problems and legal consultations,
to help them tap the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Chiu is now in Shanghai for the 2010 Taipei-Shanghai twin-cities exhibition on
cultural innovation, which will be held June 17-20 in the Chinese city.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan arrived in Hong Kong June 3 for a three-day visit in
her official capacity.  Though  staying  low-profile,  she  was  the  first
minister-level Taiwanese official to visit the special administrative region of
China.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage on June 5 of the visit
described by MAC ranking officials as "significant" :</P>
      <P>Economics Daily News:</P>
      <P>Although Lai stressed that she visited Hong Kong only to inspect the MAC's
operations there, her appearance on the special Chinese territory, where public
visits by Taiwanese officials -- no matter of what rank -- had always been
rejected, could definitely be seen as a major breakthrough on Taiwan-Hong Kong
ties against the backdrop of the warming relations between mainland China and
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Despite Lai not meeting with any Hong Kong officials or Chinese officials
stationed in Hong Kong during her stay, her visit in the capacity of MAC chief,
Taiwan's highest authority in charge of China affairs, reflects Beijing's new
thoughts on Taiwan-Hong Kong and cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Lai's stepping on China-controlled  land also suggests the possibility of higher
ranking Taiwanese officials visiting the mainland; they are currently still
barred from conducting such visits.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>A Beijing-based scholar anticipated that Lai's visit to Hong Kong in the runup
of the signing of a proposed cross-strait economic cooperation framework
cooperation (ECFA) was also aimed at studying Hong Kong's free trade agreements
with other countries.</P>
      <P>He also expressed that he believes Lai would meet Chinese liaison officials in
Hong Kong or other officials from Beijing during her stay in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Although cross-strait links are being expanding in the full scale, the exchanges
of governmental personnel between Hong Kong and Taiwan remain low profile.</P>
      <P>Concerned sources disclosed that Lai had planned to meet with Hong Kong Chief
Executive Donald Tsang during her visit to Hong Kong. The plan, however, was not
able to be carried out in the end because Lai had a tight schedule  and Tsang
was occupied with other activities.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, according to reliable sources, Lai's visit was kept low key
because she came to Hong Kong at a sensitive time: her visit coincides with the
21st anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre on June 4th.</P>
      <P>Although Lai,  a former member of Taiwan's pro-independent opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union, did not deliberately choose the time to make the visit,
Beijing and her host Hong Kong chose instead to keep it low key, the sources
said.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Securities Association (TSA) said Saturday that a proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement ( ECFA) with China should be signed as soon as
possible as the trade pact would be very positive for financial industries on
both sides.</P>
      <P>Gordon Yeh, vice chairman of the TSA, said at a seminar that with China's great

cooperation between both sides will be able to create a new competitive edge in
Taiwan's and China's financial industries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Futures Exchange Vice President Huang Nai-kuan said that Taiwanese
futures traders have been focusing on financial futures for a long time, so they
will be able to offer experience to China in developing financial futures.</P>
      <P>In addition, as major futures companies on both sides have a similar amount of

      <P>Huang also noted that China's futures markets at present only offer commodity
products, so there is still much room for growth in other business areas, such

    <HEADLINE>Referendum drive won't appeal to voters: former vice premier</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's former vice premier said Saturday that the opposition party's
"politically maneuvered" campaign against a soon-to-be signed Taiwan-China trade
pact would not appeal to most voters in year-end local elections, in which he is
taking part.</P>
      <P>As campaigning for the mayoral positions in Taiwan's five biggest municipalities
and cities is expected to intensify ahead of the November elections, Eric Chu
was asked by CNA how he would assess the impacts of the opposition's recently-
failed referendum drive on the government's efforts to sign the trade agreement.</P>
      <P>Chu said the opposition should adopt a "rational and objective" attitude on the
issue.</P>
      <P>"I think it is necessary to look at the issue (on the trade pact) from an
objective and rational perspective, " he said Saturday on the sidelines of a
seminar related to the trade pact known as the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>"If it (the campaign) is handled in a politically maneuvered manner, it will not
be able to appeal to the majority of voters, " said Chu, who is also the vice
chairman of the ruling party Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Chu is running for mayor in Xinbei City in northern Taiwan, which has a bigger
population than any other city or county in Taiwan. His rival is Tsai Ing- wen,
chairwoman of the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>After a government committee on Thursday rejected another opposition party's
proposal to hold a referendum on the issue of whether Taiwan should sign a trade
agreement with China, the DPP said that it will launch a "10-year war of
resistance" and continue pushing for a referendum on the Taiwan-China pact
slated to be signed later this month.</P>
      <P>The government committee rejected the Taiwan Solidarity Union's (TSU) initiative
on the grounds that it did not conform with the law because of a "conflict
between the reasoning and the question itself."</P>
      <P>The DPP will organize an event later Saturday in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung, where the party's mayoral candidates will help step up the campaign
against the trade pact.</P>
      <P>Opposition parties and a significant number of people in Taiwan believe that the
trade pact will result in an influx of Chinese workers and cheap goods from
China, while also making Taiwan too dependent on China, and potentially
undermining Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>But the government considers the pact as an important way to normalize the trade
relations between Taiwan and its largest trading partner, China, and to overcome
China's blockage of Taiwan signing free trade agreements with other countries.</P>
      <P>The mayoral elections will take place Nov. 27 in five special municipalities --
Taipei City, Xinbei City, Taichung City, Tainan City and Kaohsiung City -- whose
populations together account for 70 percent of the country's total.</P>
      <P>The races are viewed as a bellwether for the 2012 presidential election and a
gauge of the popularity of President Ma Ying-jeou, who is expected to seek
reelection, but whose approval ratings have remained low for most of the two
years that he has been in office.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Under the directive of President Ma Ying-jeou, a delegation of Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) officials will head for Singapore next
week to inspect how its government succeeded in reducing its jobless rate to 2.2
percent.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the government has been keener in publishing brilliant
statistics than caring for the people's lives. Despite all-out government
efforts such as creating temporary jobs to bring down unemployment, it would be
pointless if Taiwan is a society without confidence and hopes, due to a lack of
stable jobs.</P>
      <P>A lower jobless rate does not mean an improvement in employment, and this is the
real problem because creating temporary jobs is just an interim measure. With
the economy gradually recovering from the financial tsunami, the government
should work out a long-term policy to boost employment.</P>
      <P>In terms of the impact of industrial development in the job market, Taiwan
should send delegations to study what is happening in Japan and South Korea,
where the situations are more similar to Taiwan's.</P>
      <P>If the government only cares about jobless statistics rather than the core of
the unemployment problem, the problem in Taiwan will not be genuinely resolved.

      <P>Global smartphone maker HTC has announced a record revenue of NT$18.66 billion
(US$575 million) in May, up 49.5 percent year-on-year, which the company
attributed to strong market demand for its high-end mobile phones.</P>
      <P>It was the second consecutive month for the company to register a record monthly
revenue, according to the company Friday. In the first five months of the year,
the company registered a revenue of NT$74.37 billion, up 34 percent from the

      <P>More Chinese companies may want to take part in Computex Taipei, the world's
second biggest computer trade show, next year as this year saw a surge of them
using the show to explore overseas business opportunities, an organizer said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>"For the Chinese at the moment, except for the domestic market, it remains
difficult for them to branch out to foreign markets. Therefore, they use
Computex as an excellent platform to establish connections with the rest of the
world," Jeremy Horng, deputy executive director of the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA)'s Exhibition Department, told the Central News
Agency in an interview.</P>
      <P>The five-day trade show, Asia's biggest computer show, ended Saturday. This
year, more than 1,700 companies from around the world showcased their products
at Computex, using 4,861 booths.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Computer Association, another organizer of the event, said in a
statement released Saturday that the number of Chinese buyers visiting the show
rose significantly this year from last year.</P>
      <P>A total of 106 companies from China used 171 booths at the trade show this year,
which was more than double the numbers from last year, when there were 41
Chinese exhibitors using 78 booths, Horng noted.</P>
      <P>Computex was open to Chinese exhibitors last year for the first time after the
political tensions between Taiwan and China had eased since the inauguration of
Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou in May 2008.</P>
      <P>Computex successfully appealed to Chinese exhibitors as the show increased their
business opportunities from foreign buyers, Horng said.</P>
      <P>However, due to insufficient space at Computex's venues, more than 100 companies
from various countries could not exhibit at the annual event, now in its 30th
year, according to Horng.</P>
      <P>Unless Computex expands its venues, it might be difficult for the show to
accommodate the even greater interest expected from Chinese firms next year,
organizers said.</P>
      <P>"Although we could expect yet another increase in the number of Chinese
companies that want to exhibit at the show next year, we will have to see first
if we could provide more booths for them to use, " he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Almost every Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) member is concerned about
the progress of negotiations and talks on a proposed trade pact between Taiwan
and mainland China, Taiwan's minister of economic affairs said Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's active move to promote the signing of an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China draws APEC members' attention, Shih Yen-hsiang noted
in an interview with CNA in Sapporo, Japan.</P>
      <P>Shih, leading the Taiwan delegation, arrived here Thursday for the two-day
annual meeting of APEC trade ministers that began Saturday.</P>
      <P>He attended a formal welcoming dinner the previous evening, in which he was seen
chatting with World Trade Organization Secretary General Pascal Lamy, as well as
ministers and trade representatives of other nations, including China's Minister
of Commerce Chen Deming.</P>
      <P>In the coming APEC meeting, Shih will conduct talks with Lamy.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he will hold talks with Chen or have a chance to talk about the
ECFA issue during the meeting, Shih only said the APEC forum is a public
occasion, on which he will meet all trade ministers of all member states to
exchange opinions.</P>
      <P>Responding to questions on the widely-anticipated early harvest list of items
that will have tariffs reduced immediately after the proposed ECFA deal is
signed, Shih reiterated that items which are expected to affect Taiwan's
employment, farmers and conventional medium and small enterprises, will not be
put in the program for tax deduction or exemption.</P>
      <P>As to how many items of products will be included in the early-harvest list,
Shih only said talks on the issue have not been finalized, but he confirmed that
the number of Chinese products on the list will be less than the more than 300
Taiwanese products on the list.</P>
      <P>Shih, again, underlined the importance and urgency of the signing of the cross-
strait trade pact, saying China, Japan and South Korea recently agreed among
each other to be active in promoting the formation of a free trade agreement
among themselves.</P>
      <P>Once the proposed Northeast Asian free trade zone is formed, Taiwanese companies
will not be able to compete with rival businesses that enjoy preferential tax
treatment in the region, Shih warned.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NTCH director plots to get Taiwan's performers on world stages</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/05/10  16:59:56</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Huang Pi-twan has been the artistic director of Taiwan's National Theater and
Concert Hall (NTCH) for only two months, but her mission is already clear: to
expand efforts to stage productions with international directors and give local
performers more experience.</P>
      <P>Huang, a former head of the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) ,
feels the NTCH has a duty to boost the standard of performances in Taiwan, and
one way to achieve that, she says, is by focusing on collaborations with artists
from other countries.</P>
      <P>"This not only lets us learn advanced technology and performance skills from
other artists, it also helps us promote our shows to the world," she stressed in
an interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Huang's mission is not new for the performance venue.</P>
      <P>The NTCH has often worked with international directors in the past, including on
the production "1433-The Grand Voyage, " a collaboration between avant-garde
American stage director Robert Wilson and Taiwanese percussion group "U Theatre"
that was staged in the first half of the year.</P>
      <P>But Huang hopes such co-productions  will be staged  more frequently in the
future, and she said there are at least two programs set for the second half of
the year.</P>
      <P>"One of those is an opera called 'La Peintre, Yu-Lin, ' in which a Taiwanese
writer, composer and orchestra and Taiwanese singers will work with a French
director, " she indicated.</P>
      <P>The production, which will debut at the National Theater Hall at the beginning
of July, is based on the story of a legendary Chinese women named Pan Yu-Liang,
who first was a prostitute and then a concubine before becoming a famous
painter, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The opera's composer is National Award for Arts winner Chien Nan-chang, who will
team up with playwright Wang An-chi and French director Juliette Deschamps.</P>
      <P>"The opera will present a fascinating  world of song and performance," Huang
said.</P>
      <P>The other production, slated for August, will invite Wang Hsin-sing, the founder
of Hsin Sing Nanguan (also written Xin Xin Nanguan), to collaborate with French
director Lukas Hemleb on a modern Nanguan opera called "Feather."</P>
      <P>Nanguan is a style of Chinese classical music originating in the southern
Chinese province of Fujian.</P>
      <P>Huang revealed that the story of the Nanguan musical is based on a Chinese
legend known as "The Double Seventh Festival, " which involves a love story
between a goddess and a human being.</P>
      <P>"We spent over NT$20 million on each production, but I believe our artists can
learn a lot from these opportunities, and we will definitely promote these works
in other countries," she said.</P>
      <P>Despite the challenge of having to compete with many bigger and more modern
venues built in Asia in recent years, Huang maintains confidence in the
management ability and technology of the NTCH.</P>
      <P>"While we are preparing for the celebration  of the 25th anniversary of the NTCH
in 2012, I think the first thing we should do is to make a list of our standard
operating procedures (SOP) , which include program organization, stage
technology, and marketing, among others," she said.</P>
      <P>The purpose is to help those who will manage new performance halls that will be
opening in the future in northern, central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We can provide information and experience to help them manage these new venues
smoothly," she said.</P>
      <P>Another new project Huang feels proud of is successfully raising funds to enable
the children of poor families in remote areas to see shows at the NTCH.</P>
      <P>"We raised over NT$1.7 million in May, which meant that we reached our goal much
earlier than expected, " Huang said, pleased that the fund will help more
children enter the beautiful world of the performing arts. By Sunnie Chen, CNA

    <TEXT>
      <P>As Taiwan is likely to soon sign an economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China, Taiwan should devise an effective strategy to take advantage
of a Western Taiwan Straits Economic Zone in Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>Beijing is promoting the zone to balance regional development and boost economic
integration with Taiwan, paving the way for peaceful cross-strait unification.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's private sector has responded enthusiastically to the special economic
zone on China's west coast, but the government has adopted a "cool-headed"
approach because of political concerns.</P>
      <P>Although we don't need to dance to Beijing's tune, Taiwan still needs to think
positively and try to benefit from China's west coast economic zone. That would
enable us to bolster economic development in our own special economic zones and
build a new model of two-way industrial cooperation in the post-ECFA era.</P>
      <P>We must stress that Taiwan as a whole should avoid engaging with the Fujian
zone. Rather, Taiwan should use its special economic zones to deal with the zone
on the opposite side so as to not hurt parity and Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The special economic zones envisioned by Taiwan's government, where companies
will be given preferential tax, labor, financing and customs treatment, will be
the best choice Taiwan has to embrace the post-ECFA era and cross-strait
dealings. (June 5, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Visitors to the international Computex Taipei trade show have found out quickly
that the future is in cloud computing, with industry veterans confident that the
concept's technology is launching integrated computing into a new era.</P>
      <P>"It may have been around for a long time, but now cloud computing is about to
take off, " Tudor Brown, president of British chip maker ARM, said at a forum on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The five-day Computex, which concluded Saturday, included a series of speeches
and discussions devoted to cloud computing technology, a sign of its growing
importance in the IT field.</P>
      <P>Cloud computing provides "highly available" services and data stored on an
Internet network (the cloud) that users can access with devices such as desktop
personal computers, TVs and smart phones connected to the Web.</P>
      <P>The advantage is that users do not have to install or maintain these services on
their devices, said Gary Szilagyi, vice president and general manager of
American semiconductor developer Atheros Communications, Inc.'s Computing and
Consumer Business Unit, at a conference Monday.</P>
      <P>"Everyone sees great value in the cloud, and in fact, there have been many
businesses founded upon entire requirements of delivering the cloud content," he
said.</P>
      <P>Cloud computing is expected to be the preferred solution in an era of rapid
industrial development, experts believe, and Brown said he saw a lot of
opportunity for Taiwan because the market is driven by low-power equipment,
innovation, cost and mobility.</P>
      <P>"That's what you do here very well," he said.</P>
      <P>According to Digitimes Research, there will be 10 billion connected devices in
the future, which would have been impossible to believe just a few years ago.</P>
      <P>"In 2004, it's very hard to think of a single desktop application which is used
by millions of users outside of games, " but now we have popular cloud web
applications, such as Gmail, Google Map, Twitter, and Facebook," said Sundar
Pichai, vice president of Google.</P>
      <P>Cloud computing  is also among the Taiwanese  government's strategic industries.
The government and the private sector jointly formed the Taiwan Cloud Computing
Consortium in April, pouring in NT$24 billion (US$740 million) to promote
development in the field over the next five years.</P>
      <P>"We expect the private sector to invest NT$12.7 billion in research and
development and another NT$100 billion for manufacturing and services, "
Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said at the Taiwan Business
Alliance Conference the day before Computex opened.</P>
      <P>"This could create 50,000 new jobs with a turnover of NT$1 trillion," he added.</P>

      <P>World-renowned Japanese architect Tadao Ando hosted a groundbreaking ceremony in
Taipei County Saturday to kick off construction on the first columbarium complex
he has designed in his illustrious career.</P>
      <P>Ando said he expects the new facility,  consisting  of a columbarium -- the
memorial building where the cremated remains of the deceased can be stored --
and a landscaped garden with 4,000 cherry trees, to become an international
architectural landmark that represents Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also hopes that the site will turn out to be one of the world's best
cemeteries and a global attraction for people to appreciate the beauty of cherry
blossoms outside of Washington, D.C., said the University of Tokyo professor.</P>
      <P>Ando has also incorporated water into his design, putting a reflecting pool on
the roof of the columbarium.</P>
      <P>Situated on a 26-hectare site in Sanjhih, a coastal township in northern Taiwan,
the planned columbarium complex and garden will cost an estimated NT$10 billion

have a monthly rent of NT$10,000 (US$308).</P>
      <P>The city will also release  houses obtained  from private construction companies

      <P>The government will resolutely push for energy conservation and carbon emission
cuts in both the public and private sectors this year, Premier Wu Den-yih said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>He said major carbon emitters, such as Taiwan Power Company (Taipower), CPC
Corp., Taiwan, Formosa Plastics and China Steel, will have to cut carbon
emissions by replacing aging equipment to enhance energy efficiency.</P>
      <P>"If major carbon emission businesses such as Taipower and CPC strive for
progress, they will be able to cut millions or tens of millions of tons of
carbon emissions every year, " he said on the sidelines of an energy
conservation show coinciding with World Environment Day.</P>
      <P>The premier pledged that the government would also focus more emphasis  on
energy  saving  and carbon  reduction  in public infrastructure.</P>
      <P>One example, he said, was that the government has begun to replace the light
bulbs normally used in traffic lights with LEDs in the past two years and that
there are only three or four cities that have yet to replace their traffic
lights.</P>
      <P>"By 2011, all traffic lights will use LEDs, " the premier said.</P>
      <P>The government will also encourage the development of renewable energy, solar
power, LEDs, biomass energy and wind power, and electric cars and motorcycles,
he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Executive Yuan has also planned to make Green Island as a model
low-carbon emission island, the premier said.</P>
      <P>"We'll promote the idea to other parts of Taiwan after reviewing the results on
Green Island," he added.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Huang Jung-chiou said that in addition to Green Island,
the low-carbon island project will also cover three other  outlying  islands  --

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou spoke of the importance of signing a trade pact with
China when he received three visiting U.S. senators Saturday.</P>
      <P>The trio -- Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) , Kay Hagan (D-NC) and Mark Udall
(D-Co.) -- arrived in Taiwan earlier in the day, marking the first visit by U.S.
senators to Taiwan since President Ma took office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>The president noted that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have signed 12
agreements over the past two years, and that cross-strait ties have been more
peaceful and stable than at any time in the past six decades.</P>
      <P>The two sides are now negotiating  a economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) , and Ma said he hoped it could be signed soon to institutionalize cross-
strait trade ties.</P>
      <P>Citing a comment by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg at the

      <P>The old CK124 steam engine sounded its horn at Sanyi Railway Station in Miaoli
County Saturday, signaling to the train's 300 passengers and other train
aficionados around the country that service on a historic railway line in Taiwan
had resumed.</P>
      <P>"This is the train I took when I was little, " said a 55-year-old grandmother
when describing the old locomotive to her eight-year-old grandson at the
station.</P>
      <P>The passenger, identified only by the surname Huang, said she had eagerly
awaited the reopening of the 15.9-kilometer-long Old Mountain Line between Sanyi
and Houli in Taichung County for 12 years, since the rail line's operations were
suspended in 1998.</P>
      <P>Her 94-year-old mother has still not forgotten the sound of trains on the
railway line running through the hills of central Taiwan, Huang said.</P>
      <P>To attract tourists, the Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) spent nearly
NT$200 million (US$6.16 million) to restore the tracks and facilities along the
line, which passes many historic sites, including the Broken Longteng Bridge and
the nearby Shengsing station built during the Japanese colonial era.</P>
      <P>The project has managed to restore service on 13.6 kilometers of the line thus
far, from Sanyi to Taian Station in Taichung County, according to the TRA.</P>
      <P>On Saturday the old steam train made two round trips. It will be back in service
on June 9, each Wednesday in July and August, and August 29, with two round-trip
runs per day.</P>
      <P>In addition, the TRA will also offer services by a diesel-powered train every
Monday and Friday between July 5 and Aug. 27, with two round-trip runs per day.</P>
      <P>The timetable for the line can be found on the TRA's website.</P>

      <P>Nearly six tons of cherries recently imported from the United States have been
found to contain the pesticide malathion, the Department of Health (DOH) said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Pan Chih-kuan,  a director  of the DOH's  Food  and Drug Administration, said
the two batches of cherries contained 0.02 parts per million and 0.03 ppm of
malathion, respectively. Taiwan's regulations do not allow any trace amounts of
the substance in cherries.</P>
      <P>The two importers are now applying to have the two batches re-examined.</P>
      <P>If they are still found to contain the pesticide, the first batch, which had not
been cleared by customs, will be returned to the shipper, and the second batch,
which had been released to the importer to keep refrigerated pending the results
of the examination, will be confiscated and destroyed.</P>
      <P>Pan said that if a third batch of U.S. imported cherries were to fail the
examination within six months, the DOH will ask the U.S. to come up with a plan
to improve the situation.</P>
      <P>"We will also step up the examination of all cherries imported from the United
States," he added.</P>

      <P>A multi-purpose unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) developed by a local company will
take part in a major air show next week, an official of the company said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Cooper Chang, the marketing manager of Carbon-Based Technology Inc., said its
UAV, called the UAVER, will take part in the Berlin Air Show June 8-13. It will
be the first time an unmanned aerial system (UAS) with a Taiwanese brand has
entered a major air show.</P>
      <P>The company demonstrated the 3.45-kilogram system on Friday on top of a building
at National Chung Hsin University in central Taiwan's Taichung, during which
images taken by the airborne UAV were transmitted simultaneously.</P>
      <P>Chang said the United States, though a leader in the development of unmanned
aerial systems, has generally used much larger systems for military purposes.</P>
      <P>But the smaller UAV developed by Carbon-Based Technology can be an effective
tool in monitoring disasters, environmental pollution and other problems.</P>
      <P>Chen Shu-chun,  director of the university's Water &amp; Soil Conservation
Department, said traditional unmanned helicopters can monitor the environment,
but they have the limitations of being loud, noisy and hard to maneuver.</P>
      <P>They also only have a short remote control distance (about 2 kilometers) and
cannot stay airborne for long (under 10 minutes).</P>
      <P>This is why they are confined to short-distance environmental monitoring and
disaster prevention missions, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"The Avian UAS developed  by Taiwan has solved the above problems," he added.</P>
      <P>He said the UAS also does not require a long runway due to its use of a bungee
rope launch for take-off and its parachute landing system.</P>
      <P>The other advantage is that the whole system can be maneuvered from a disaster
prevention center indoors.</P>
      <P>The system can stay airborne for 90 minutes and penetrate remote areas to
provide often difficult-to-obtain information in real time.</P>

      <P>Computex Taipei, Asia's largest computer show, attracted more international
visitors this year than ever before and generated a record US$230 million in
business on site, the organizers said in a statement on the show's final day
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Jeremy Horng, deputy executive director of Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) 's Exhibition Department, said the 35,017 international
visitors from 216 different countries and regions attending the show's first
four days outpaced the 34,892 visitors from 184 countries and regions last year.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA, more than 2,000 one-on-one meetings between buyers and
suppliers were held on June 1 and 2, generating on-site business worth US$230
million, more than double the US$100 million generated during similar meetings
last year.</P>
      <P>The top five countries  and regions  most represented  by international buyers
were the United States, Japan, China, Hong Kong, and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Aiming to make Computex the world's biggest computer show, Horng said the fair's
international  significance in the information technology sector was reflected
by the 400 foreign exhibitors occupying 830 booths at the show.</P>
      <P>The number of booths was 5 percent higher than last year.</P>
      <P>But venue size continues to haunt Computex's ambitions to expand. According to
the organizers, there were 100 to 200 foreign and local exhibitors on the
waiting list this year, and other vendors even plan to apply for more booths
next year.</P>
      <P>Because another Nangang Exhibition Hall will not be ready until the end of 2012,
the organizers said they will consider using Taiwan World Trade Center Hall 2
next year, which can provide another 350 booths.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ETC operator, government still at odds over toll collection system</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The operator of an electronic freeway toll collection system admitted Saturday
that it will fall short of the targeted usage rate for the system by the end of
June, but it remains at odds with the government over how the problem should be
solved.</P>
      <P>Far Eastern Electronic Toll Collection Co. (FETC) , which was commissioned to
set up the ETC service, said that with the ETC usage rate at 38 percent at
present, it is not likely that the target rate for the end of June of 45 percent
will be met.</P>
      <P>According to an agreement between the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) and FETC, the ETC usage rate is required to reach 45
percent by the end of June, and 65 percent by the end of 2012.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau under the MOTC said it will send a
notice to FETC next month asking the company to improve the situation within a
specified time, but it acknowledged that the two sides have failed to reach any
consensus on how to resolve the issue.</P>
      <P>The usage rate of the system, which collects tolls from freeway motorists
automatically,  has been hampered by resistance  to installing the system's
transmitter, the "on board unit, " which costs NT$1,199 (US$37).</P>
      <P>Since the ETC system was introduced four years ago, about 950,000 vehicles have
installed the OBUs.</P>
      <P>The bureau has hoped that FETC would offer the OBU at a lower price or for free,
but the company has rejected the idea, saying that free installations would cost
the company over NT$6 billion, well above the company's NT$3.8 billion in
capital.</P>
      <P>The FETC, on the other hand, has suggested many times since last year that the
government should offer a 20 percent discount on tolls for ETC users, but the
proposal has not yet been approved by the MOTC.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an MOTC official also said on Saturday that the low usage rate of the
ETC system could delay the implementation of an automatic distance-based  toll
collection scheme,  but did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>The ministry plans to replace both the frequency-based ETC and manned toll
booths with a fully automatic distance-based toll collection model by the end of
2012.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Perfectionist chef relentless in quest to present good food</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/06/10  10:22:28</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Veteran chef Huang Shih-chan, a perfectionist who is his own most fastidious
critic where food is concerned, has turned his back on the Western-style
steakhouses and Chinese restaurants in which he learned his craft, and is now
putting his considerable skill and talent into a new venture -- in fact a whole
new genre -- a fusion cuisine restaurant that also serves breakfast.</P>
      <P>Huang's diners could find themselves being served, for example, with Taiwanese
egg rolls with basil and bacon, or Japanese sushi wrapped in thin-pressed bread,
coupled with a cup of freshly brewed coffee Huang has developed after trying
around 20 types of beans and preparation methods.</P>
      <P>"Eating should be far more than just putting food into your mouth," Huang said
during a recent interview.</P>
      <P>"Eating just to feel full is not enough. My patrons are not allowed to leave my
restaurant until they feel totally satisfied, " said an ebullient Huang, his
face wreathed in its customary smiles.</P>
      <P>Huang honed his skills and techniques in various Taiwanese and traditional
Chinese restaurants for 23 years before turning his hand to Western cuisine.
Prodigiously talented, he became a chef within just two years of his
apprenticeship.</P>
      <P>It was during the busiest time of his career, when he was running three
steakhouses-cum-piano bars at the same time, that he picked up the idea of
fusion cuisine from the West.</P>
      <P>Huang would begin his day by trying a new dish or type of food, perhaps at a
decent restaurant, other times at a simple roadside diner, during daily scouting
missions.</P>
      <P>Through these scouting missions, he has developed his own scheme for running
restaurants -- either turning expensive dishes normally served only at upscale
restaurants into food for the average person, or absorbing the ingredients and
the secret knacks of roadside eatery cooking to transform lowly, everyday food
items into dishes one would expect to see only in luxury restaurants.</P>
      <P>On one occasion, he had afternoon tea at a five-star hotel in Taipei, where he
was bowled over by the assorted sandwiches and brought some of them home to
study more closely.</P>
      <P>Another foray took him to a renowned steak restaurant franchise in Taipei. Upon
discovering that his NT$450 "steak" was actually a piece of re-formed meat, he
called for the manager and demanded a replacement, only to be presented with
another fake steak in its place. And another. And another. Not until he had sent
back four of the impostors did he finally get his steak.</P>
      <P>Amazingly, this did not turn him into persona non grata at the franchise but
instead, he became a VIP patron and is now regularly invited to test new menu
items.</P>
      <P>In his search  for good coffee,  meanwhile,  Huang tested ceaselessly, so much
so that during one tasting session, his mouth and tongue became numbed by the
caffeine, whereupon he simply chewed on a little bread and soldiered on.</P>
      <P>Huang is extremely critical when choosing food and ingredients. "Just like
choosing a spouse, I'm critical of the foods' appearance, as well as its
content," he said.</P>
      <P>"You can't present a good dish unless you have developed an absolute insight
into the tastes, textures, smells and colors of the foods, " he noted.</P>
      <P>For example, tuna is one of the major ingredients in his latest venture, but
Huang said he has had a long and difficult time trying to get rid of tuna's
fishy odor. After months of research, however, he finally worked out a knack in
which the oil from the cooked tuna is squeezed out before the fish is seasoned,
after which, the oil is allowed to soak back in -- a method that Huang says
makes the tuna smell less fishy without altering the smooth taste.</P>
      <P>Ever the stickler to detail, Huang goes as far as examining his customers'
leftover food and drinks -- sometimes even tasting the leftovers in his quest to
find out why something has not been eaten.</P>
      <P>"Being critical is probably one of the prerequisites  for preparing good food,"
he said. By CNA staff writers Deborah Kuo, Inky Kao</P>

Confucius' lesson of the day: "The highest class of men are those who are born
with a natural understanding. The next class are those who acquire understanding
by study and application. There are others again who are born by nature dull,
but who by strenuous efforts, try to acquire understanding: such men may be
considered the next class. Those who are born by nature dull and yet will not

    <TEXT>
      <P>It is a matter of opinion whether it is right or wrong for a graduate of the
country's most prestigious university, National Taiwan University, to take a job
as a show girl. But "adults" should adopt a new way of thinking toward the
younger generation's career choices.</P>
      <P>NTU President Lee Si-chen described the NTU graduate's choice to be a show girl
at 3C exhibitions as "a pity" in his speech at the university's commencement
ceremony on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lee harbors a mentality similar to that of Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Gou, who
once was dismissive of the aspirations of a member of the X-generation to open a
coffee shop.</P>
      <P>Both Lee and Gou probably lack imagination when it comes to the new generation's
career choices. Why must today's young people make job decisions based on
thinking that belongs to the more traditional industrial development era? Why
not allow them access or the right to career options that are more creative or
innovative?</P>
      <P>Many careers or work models that people have not even conceived of in the past
are still in the works.</P>
      <P>As commencement season approaches, over 20 percent of the yearly 250,000 college
graduates will need to spend at least one year to land a job, and those who are
lucky enough to find one will not necessarily be happy because their starting
pay will be below average.</P>
      <P>The "high degree, low pay" or "high academic credential, high unemployment"
phenomena in the country have not yet been addressed, despite government figures
showing 13.27 percent economic growth in the first quarter of the year, the
biggest single quarter rise in 30 years.</P>
      <P>With the unemployment rate remaining historically high, the Q1 surge was
actually an "unfelt" or "jobless" recovery.</P>
      <P>Statistics are one thing, but the people's actual experiences are another. The
change in graduates' starting salaries is a direct benchmark in discerning the
reality. (June 6, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Responding to a press inquiry Saturday about his views on dozens of National
Taiwan University (NTU) students who became big hits on the Internet and
television recently for working as "show girls," the president  of the
prestigious  school  said he feels kind of disappointed.</P>
      <P>"While nobody should be discriminated against over his or her occupation, I have
higher expecations of NTU graduates, " said NTU President Lee Si-chen. "Since
our school uses a large amount of national resources, I hope our students will
have better career development and make greater contributions in professional
fields."</P>
      <P>Lee's remarks have drawn mixed reaction from the school's students and alumni.
While some agreed with his views, others said students' free will in career
development should be respected.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Thirteen NTU students have emerged as Internet sensations because of their
charming good looks. Some of them have even attracted considerable media
attention after serving as "show girls" at major trade fairs or appearing in TV
video game commercials.</P>
      <P>After presiding over the school's 2010 graduation ceremony on Saturday, NTU
President Lee was approached by a group of reporters seeking his opinions on the
phenomenon.</P>
      <P>In response, Lee said NTU students are generally very talented and creative.</P>
      <P>"I hope they will develop their talent and ability to their fullest in order to
contribute to society and civilization, " Lee said, adding that it would be a
pity for NTU graduates to land jobs based on their appearance instead of their
professional competence.</P>
      <P>In his speech at the graduation ceremony, Lee encouraged NTU graduates to set a
goal of becoming an outstanding world-class figure who works diligently to help

      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Yang Yi-mei, an NTU graduate who has served as a show girl or host at more than
100 trade fairs during her time at NTU because of her proficiency in Chinese and
English, said she has just signed with an entertainment management company and
will pursue her dream of becoming a TV host.</P>
      <P>"I know what I am doing and have good judgment. I plan to write a book on my
career experiences and visions, and I am studying Cantonese in order to get into
Hong Kong's entertainment world, " she said.</P>
      <P>She said she believes that when Lee reads her book, he will have a different
view on NTU students' career pursuits.</P>
      <P>Huang Shu-chun, a popular singer and songwriter who holds a master's  degree
from NTU's  Graduate  Institute  of Business Administration, said he agrees with
Lee's views.</P>
      <P>"If I had known I would end up entering the entertainment world, I would have
begun developing the skills needed for this profession starting in my teenage
years, and would not have had to enroll in NTU," Huang said.</P>
      <P>He further said he believes Lee's remarks were not aimed at denigrating "show
girls" but rather at encouraging NTU graduates to make greater contributions to
society. (June 6, 2010).</P>

      <P>With the economy regaining momentum, new college and university graduates have
become more optimistic about their job prospects, according to the results of an
online survey.</P>
      <P>The survey conducted by the 1111 Job Bank showed that more than 80 percent of
new graduates are choosing to enter the job market right after graduation.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the poll found that 44.7 percent of the respondents said they expect
they can land a job within one month of their graduation, and 23.84 percent said
they believe they can get a job within 31 to 60 days after their graduation.</P>
      <P>On average, the new graduates believe they can land a job within 41 days of
graduation, shorter than the 78 days estimated in a similar poll conducted last
summer.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that technology and science graduates feel they will have
an easier time landing jobs than their humanities peers. (June 6, 2010).</P>

      <P>Sister Madeleine Severens, who devoted 35 years to assisting people in need in
Taiwan as a missionary, died Friday at the Congregation of the Immaculate Heart
of Mary (CICM) in Leuven, Belgium, at the age of 92.</P>
      <P>After learning of Severens' death, Taiwan's representative to Belgium Lin Yung-
lo headed to Leuven and paid tribute to her at a memorial Mass held at CICM
Saturday.</P>
      <P>During the Mass, a CICM sister read in Chinese and Dutch an article written by
Severens to pray for residents of Taiwan's outlying island of Matsu, where she
worked for 25 years.</P>
      <P>Severens spent much of her life in China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In 1945, she decided to devote her life to missionary service after joining the
CICM religious order and was sent to China in 1948 while the civil war there was
still raging.</P>
      <P>While in China, she worked in Kunming, Inner Mongolia, and Beijing, but after
the Communists won the civil war and founded the People's Republic of China
(PRC) in 1949, the Belgian missionary was jailed for two and a half years
because of PRC leader Mao Zedong's opposition to deism.</P>
      <P>Severens was then repatriated to her country, but eventually returned to the Far
East in 1966 when her religious order sent her to Taiwan. She was eventually
transferred to Matsu in 1976 and stayed there until retiring in 2001.</P>
      <P>During her time in Matsu, Severens helped deliver more than 1,000 babies on an
island with only about 3,000 residents. Her devotion earned her the nickname of
"Mou Mou," meaning mother.</P>

      <P>Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas and candidate for the Republican
presidential nomination in 2008, will visit Taiwan in a private trip next week,
organizers announced Sunday.</P>
      <P>The former governor is scheduled to arrive in Taipei Monday for the promotion of
his book "Do the Right Thing" and will make an invitation-only appearance at the
Taipei International Convention Center on June 8, according to Jack Hu, managing
director of the visit's organizer London International Group.</P>
      <P>Hu did not elaborate on details of Huckabee's visit, which will not be announced
until Monday, but he said Huckabee may meet with local political heavyweights
during his stay.</P>
      <P>The June 8 event,  called "An Evening with Governor Mike Huckabee," will begin
with remarks from Huckabee and then be followed with a moderated question and
answer session, Hu said.</P>
      <P>Huckabee last visited Taiwan in June 2006 when he was still governor  of
Arkansas and chairman  of the National Governors Association and met with former
president Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The association passed a resolution in 2003 supporting Taiwan's bid to become an
observer in the World Health Assembly, and in 2005, Huckabee's state of Arkansas
passed a resolution recommending the signing of a Taiwan-U.S. free trade
agreement.</P>
      <P>In his bid for the Republican nomination for President, Huckabee won eight
states and more than 4 million votes in the primaries before pulling out of the

      <P>The 2010 Taipei International Flora exposition will transform Taiwan's capital
into a city of gardens and help showcase its achievements to the world, Mayor
Hau Lung-bin said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The event, the most important internationally recognized expo ever to take place
in the country, will allow Taiwan to share with the world its exploits in
biotechnology, horticulture and tourism, Hau said during a ceremony marking the
signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the city and Rotary
International Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew, who was also present at the ceremony, echoed Hau's
vision, describing the expo as an event that will show the world the country's
soft power and commitment to green technology.</P>
      <P>The MOU with Rotary International was patterned after cooperation between the
Rotary Club and the city when Taipei hosted the 2009 Summer Deaflympics.</P>
      <P>Hau said the city was better able to promote itself during the Deaflympics, held
in September 2009, because of the help of more than 5,500 Rotary Club members,
who offered translating, catering and tour guide services.</P>
      <P>Eva Hsiao, a three-year member of Rotary International District 3520,  said she
is looking forward to helping bring about a qualitative change in Taipei after
visiting the Shanghai World Expo last month.</P>
      <P>"Shanghai has become such a giant magnet, " she said. "I believe we can achieve
that as well if we work together."</P>
      <P>Forty-five countries have already registered for the Flora Expo, which is to be
held from November 6, 2010 to April 25, 2011. The organizers said they expect
the six-month event to draw as many as 6 million visitors.</P>

    <DATELINE>06/06/10  17:04:03
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After two-years of twists and turns, Christina Liu, head of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development, announced that the country's six free trade
ports will be converted into special economic and trade zones.</P>
      <P>We are disappointed in how the government has set up these special zones by
doing away with some restrictions on the free trade ports.</P>
      <P>Reforms that involve creative destruction are never easy. Only if their benefits
are fully realized and their shortcomings eliminated during experimentation in
special zones on a small scale should they be carried out on large scale.</P>
      <P>Taiwan needs the special economic and trade zones because it has lagged far
behind Singapore and Hong Kong in its liberalization of foreign trade,
especially after the previous government's "no haste, be patient" policy on
trade with China painted the country into a tight corner.</P>
      <P>The political taboo for exchanges with China has now been erased, but the island
is still closely bound by outdated regulations and suffers from backward
infrastructure relative to Singapore and Hong Kong, dashing its hopes to become
a regional operations hub.</P>
      <P>In order to make up the two decades it lost, the country has to set up some
special zones as an experiment in developing itself into a free trade island.</P>
      <P>But these special zones should not be a more-open version of free trade ports,
which are too small in scale to handle the production, transportation and
logistics related to supplying upstream and midstream materials to processing
zones in the Asia Pacific region, which employ more than 3 billion workers.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the "special" zones have belied their names by failing to follow
Singapore's approach of employing foreign workers according to market forces,
rather than imposing minimum wage and quota restrictions.</P>
      <P>The special zones should have something special to justify their names. (June 6,

    <HEADLINE>DPP to continue negotiating on eastern Taiwan development bill</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Sunday that it will
continue negotiating with the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) over including
transportation subsidies to residents of eastern Taiwan in a bill on developing
that part of the country.</P>
      <P>A report in Sunday's Chinese-language China Times said the Legislative Yuan is
expected to pass the bill on eastern Taiwan development to pave the way for an
eastern Taiwan sustainable development fund, but will block the transportation
subsidy proposal.</P>
      <P>The subsidy proposal was originally  floated by the DPP's candidate, Hsiao Bi-
khim, during a legislative by-election in Hualien County earlier this year.</P>
      <P>She proposed that people with household registrations in eastern Hualien and
Taitung counties receive subsidies on air, train and highway bus fares of up to
50 percent.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lai Kun-cheng from Taitung County said Sunday that the DPP will
stick to its guns on the subsidy program, but indicated there was room for
discussion on the size of the subsidies and how they would be delivered.</P>
      <P>Pointing to rail service, Lai argued it was unreasonable that passengers in
eastern Taiwan are charged ticket prices on a par with those charged in other
parts of Taiwan, given the region's old rail equipment and relatively slow train
service.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-shih, the head of the KMT Policy Committee, said his legislative caucus
has no intention of blocking the plan, but insisted that the DPP must come up
with concrete steps for the implementation, such as how to prove passengers are
local residents.</P>
      <P>However, Ker Chien-ming, executive director of the DPP Policy Committee, said
the DPP will insist on its version of the bill, which includes the subsidy
program.</P>

      <P>Trade officials from Taiwan and the United States compared notes on bilateral
trade issues here Sunday on the sidelines of a conference sponsored by the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, the director-general of Taiwan's Bureau of Foreign Trade, said
that Economics Minister Shih Yen-shiang met with the U.S. delegation to the APEC
conference of trade ministers Saturday.</P>
      <P>Without naming names, Huang said U.S. officials conveyed their hopes that Taiwan
would speed up its examination procedures and customs clearance for U.S. beef
imports.</P>
      <P>For his part, Shih explained that Taiwan's Legislative Yuan had revised the law
to forbid imports of the skulls, brains, eyes and internal organs of U.S.
cattle.</P>
      <P>Imports of beef tails and tongues, which are not internal organs and are thereby
not banned, will be subject to careful examinations because of public concerns
about their safety, Huang quoted Shih as saying.</P>
      <P>Shih also called for the earlier resumption of talks between Taipei and
Washington  under an existing Trade and Investment Framework Agreement.</P>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan Chairman Raymond F. Burghardt said in Taipei on
June 3 that talks, which began in 1994 but were suspended in July 2007 because
of a dispute over imports of U.S. beef, would be resumed later this year.</P>
      <P>Washington may broach any questions about beef imports at those talks, which are
usually attended by senior trade officials or vice trade ministers of both
sides, Huang said.</P>
      <P>During Shih's stay in Sapporo, Taiwan's delegation was also to hold bilateral
talks with many APEC member economies and express its wishes to negotiate free
trade agreements or economic cooperation pacts with its leading trade partners,
including the U.S., Japan, the European Union and the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations.</P>
      <P>Huang was part of Taiwan's delegation during the June 5-6 APEC conference, which
has gathered trade delegations from 21 APEC member economies  to discuss
regional  trade liberalization,  economic cooperation and growth strategies.</P>

      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching will lead Taiwan's world renowned Cloud Gate Dance
Theatre on a tour of Russia later this week, the Presidential Office confirmed
Sunday.</P>
      <P>This will be the second time that Chow has served as Cloud Gate's honorary
director on an overseas performance  engagement.  She previously assumed the
role early this year when the troupe performed in the United States and Canada
in late January and early February.</P>
      <P>Most Cloud Gate dancers headed for Moscow Sunday afternoon ahead of their
performances of "Whisper of Flowers" at the 2010 Chekhov International Theatre
Festival from June 10-13.</P>
      <P>Chow, who is scheduled to depart for Moscow Tuesday and meet up with the Cloud
Gate dancers there, will be the first Republic of China first lady ever to visit
Russia.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office refused to play up the trip, describing it simply as a
"journey of arts and culture."</P>
      <P>According to a front-page report in the Sunday edition of the local United Daily
News (UDN), however, Chow's Moscow trip could be of significance and might usher
in a period of closer official exchanges between Taiwan and Russia.</P>
      <P>Chow will be given special courtesies  in passing through immigration in Moscow,
and Taiwan's representative office there will arrange dinner parties for the
first lady to reach out to Russian politicians and other celebrities, the report
said.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, the paper said, Taiwan will have a better chance to expand its
official ties with Russian authorities.</P>
      <P>Chow was invited by Cloud Gate founder Lin Hwai-min to join the troupe in Russia
because of the fond memories of her participation when the troupe performed in
Washington, D.C. Jan. 29-30 and at the Vancouver Cultural Olympiad in early
February.</P>
      <P>One Cloud Gate executive said Chow touched the hearts of the troupe's dancers
and stage staff with her warmth and kindness.</P>
      <P>"Chow stayed at the same hotel where all troupe members stayed and attended each
of the troupe's performances, " the executive said, adding that Chow could
easily identify each dancer and stage technician, and would often chat with them
and offer them a loving hug to boost their morale.</P>
      <P>Though Chow suffered a lower back injury a few weeks ago, the Presidential
Office said the first lady had fully recovered and was healthy enough to make
the trip.</P>
      <P>This is the fourth time that the troupe has been invited to perform in the
internationally important Moscow arts festival.</P>
      <P>Chow is scheduled to wrap up her Moscow trip and return to Taipei June 13, while
the Cloud Gate dancers will fly on to Italy in preparation for performances in
the June 22-23 arts festival in Rome.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that the travel time of the planned rapid
transit system connecting Taipei to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport must be
shortened to stay competitive with the existing freeway network.</P>
      <P>The drive between Taipei and the airport currently  takes approximately 40
minutes,  and the airport rail system should therefore take half of that for
travelers to find it competitive, the president said.</P>
      <P>"Frankly speaking, since it is a 40-minute car ride to get to the airport, no
one would want to ride the MRT if it takes 35 minutes. Therefore, you must
shorten the time down to 20 or 25 minutes, " Ma said to the director general of
the Bureau of Taiwan High Speed Rail during a visit to the airport.</P>
      <P>The 22-station, 51.5-kilometer Taoyuan International Airport Access MRT system
began construction in 2003 and is scheduled to begin operations in three years.
Travel time between Taipei and the airport was originally estimated at 35
minutes.</P>
      <P>The airport, formerly known as Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, is the
biggest airport in the country and serves as the main hub for international
flights.</P>
      <P>The train to the airport is part of the government's NT$10.7 billion "Taoyuan
Aerotropolis" plan, which also aims to lengthen runways and taxiways to
accommodate aircraft as large as the Airbus A380, add a new third terminal, and
establish an aerospace industrial park and special zones for cargo, passenger
and logistics services.</P>
      <P>The airport's aging Terminal One is currently undergoing a NT$3.2 billion
facelift, the Civil Aeronautics Administration said. The renovation is slated to
be completed in August 2011.</P>
      <P>According to the Airports Council International's (AIC) 2009 Airport Service
Quality Survey, Taoyuan International Airport fell to 27th place in the 2009, a
sharp drop from the previous 18th.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's tilapia aquaculture farmers were urged Sunday to shift to production of
higher added value fish fillets to skirt fierce competition from their Chinese
rivals.</P>
      <P>Chen Tien-shou, deputy director-general of the Fisheries Agency under the
Council of Agriculture, called for Taiwan tilapia farms to increase exports of
fish fillets, which are higher priced, instead of producing whole fish, which
face cutthroat competition from China.</P>
      <P>China's mass production and low price strategy have caused the price of whole
tilapia to plummet since early this year. It fell to NT$33 (US$1.03) per
kilogram at its lowest point from NT$45 two years ago, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The pricing problem prompted the Fisheries Agency to put forth a subsidy plan in
May to encourage local tilapia farms to cooperate with seafood processing
factories to increase their export of skinless, boneless tilapia fillets, which
can be sold for US$6.5 per kilogram on an FOB basis.</P>
      <P>Under the incentive program, fish farmers are given NT$5 per kilogram in
subsidies for their production and export inspection fees , according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Because of its large size, rapid growth and palatability, Taiwan's tilapia has
become the most important fish in the country's aquaculture sector, with annual
exports of whole fish and fish fillets reaching between 30,000 and 40,000 metric
tons and some 4,000 metric tons, respectively, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The annual global output of tilapia is roughly 2.7 million metric tons, with
about 1.1 million metric tons of that coming from China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A big increase in Chinese demand for Taiwan's cultured grouper has pushed prices
for the fish in southern Taiwan higher by 10-15 percent recently, a grouper
farmer in Gangshan, Kaohsiung County, said Sunday.</P>
      <P>As live grouper is seen as a valuable gift or upscale dish in restaurants by
ordinary Chinese, demand for the fish has increased, sending prices soaring,
according to Chen Wen-ge, head of the Kaohsiung County Aquaculture Development
Association.</P>
      <P>The prices of giant grouper are particularly high because of their limited
availability, Chen said, noting that a 1.2-kilogram giant grouper can sell for
NT$4,000 (US$123.65) in China.</P>
      <P>The average price of grouper in the 525 gram-825 gram range -- the most popular
size in China -- has risen to NT$230 from NT$200 per 600g, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>China's coastal cities are the main export destinations for the fish, mainly
raised in Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The fish are usually transported by 13 fishing boats to various harbors in China
while they are still alive immediately after wholesalers agree on quantities and
prices, increasing survival rates and improving competitiveness, according to
Chen.</P>

      <P>An 86-year-old Tao elder from Orchid Island was presented with a top award for
quitting smoking and prize money of NT$300,000 from the anti-smoking campaign's
organizer, the John Tung Foundation, at a ceremony in Taipei Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chou Lung-fa, who had smoked one to two packs of cigarettes daily over the past
60 years, had originally planned not to give up smoking until he turned 90, said
Chou Chang-jung, his son.</P>
      <P>But the elder Chou, a resident of the island off eastern Taiwan's Taitung
County, said the prize money offered by the association prompted him to move up
his schedule and "win the sum to help build houses for younger generations and
for health reasons."</P>
      <P>Yu Tseng-li, a 64-year-old woman, was awarded the "Best Witness Prize" for
helping his only son, nicknamed "big head," quit smoking.</P>
      <P>"Big head" once successfully gave up smoking when he was hospitalized after
suffering serious burns on almost half of his body, but after recovering, he
started to smoke again while attending a job training program.</P>
      <P>Yu organized a group of monitors --  including neighbors, relatives and her
son's friends -- to remind "big head" of swearing off cigarettes whenever he was
found to have smoked.</P>
      <P>The mother, in addition to inviting neighbors to leave messages on the "quit
notebook' to encourage her son to carry on, read the notebook carefully every
day to examine any problems her son encountered.</P>
      <P>Touched by his mother's insistence and seriousness, Big Head finally succeeded,
even though he suffered discomfort, such as vomiting, during the process and
lost 16 kilograms.</P>
      <P>The John Tung Foundation first launched the "Quit and Win" campaign, endorsed by
the World Health Organization, in 2002 to provide a platform for Taiwan's 4
million smokers to overcome their habit and quit.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the award presentation ceremony, Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang
said the biggest award for those who quit smoking would be "winning back their
health."</P>
      <P>He cited the example of his mother, who gave up smoking 26 years ago when she
was 60, and she is now in good shape and able to "go around everywhere on her
own."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECFA will change Taiwan's status on world trade map: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
06/06/10  19:49:04

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that signing an economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China will ultimately change Taiwan's place on
the global trade map.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a visit to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, Ma said that
over the past decade, Taiwan has lacked a strategic vision to guide its national
development because of a closed-door mindset.</P>
      <P>On the presidential campaign trail two years ago, Ma said, he proposed three
national development goals -- making Taiwan a global innovation center,  an
Asia-Pacific trade center and a global operations hub for Taiwanese
conglomerates and a regional operations hub for foreign business groups.</P>
      <P>"The discourse was based on the fact that Taiwan is located at the center of
East Asia, " Ma said, adding that Taiwan's major airports and sea ports are the
closest to those in other East Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, Ma said, Taiwan had failed to cash in on this advantage over the
past 10 years due to a closed-door mindset and a lack of strategic vision.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan unable to forge a cooperative relationship with China, Taiwan's air
carriers and logistic service operators had been reluctant to make new
investment as they were not sure how relations across the Taiwan Strait would
develop, the president said.</P>
      <P>Now that China has emerged as the world's second largest economy, Ma argued,
Taiwan can no longer dodge the need to foster and maintain an appropriate
relationship with it.</P>
      <P>"It's not an issue of 'want or not want' or 'like or dislike.' It's a 'must.' If
we do nothing in this regard, we are sure to lag behind, to be forced out of the
global economic sphere and to be marginalized. Taiwan must grasp any possible
opportunity to catch up with mainstream world trends at this time of global
economic recovery," Ma stressed.</P>
      <P>Once Taiwan strikes an ECFA deal with China, Ma said confidently, its status on
the world trade map will no longer be the same.</P>
      <P>The world will "feel that Taiwan's public and private sectors are determined and
have far-sighted visions to move forward and upward in the pursuit of
excellence," he contended.</P>

      <P>Taipei, June 6 (CNA Taiwan will for the first time send officials to conduct on-
site inspections of slaughterhouses that have their beef exported to Taiwan,
Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Yaung said the move, slated for August or September, is to he taken to ensure
that all U.S. beef exports are adequately labeled, as required by the country's
regulations.</P>
      <P>"Five to 10 slaughterhouses or packing facilities in the U.S. will be inspected
by Taiwanese officials this time, " Yaung said in response to a Central News
Agency question on the latest U.S. calls for Taiwan to accelerate its imports of
U.S. beef products.</P>
      <P>In a meeting on the sidelines of the conference of Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) trade ministers held June 5-6 in Sapporo, Japan,  U.S.
officials told their Taiwanese counterparts that Washington would be happy to
see Taipei speed up its examination procedures and customs clearance for U.S.
beef imports.</P>
      <P>"The examination procedures and customs clearance will be able to become faster
after the labeling problems are addressed," Yang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's legislature revised laws late last year to ban imports of certain U.S.
beef products, including skulls, brains, eyes and internal organs of U.S.
cattle.</P>

      <P>The chief of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) urged the Central
Election Commission to speak out against the rejection of a TSU referendum
initiative or face a possible investigation by the Control Yuan into
"dereliction of duty."</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's Referendum Review Commission rejected on June 3 a TSU
referendum initiative that would have asked voters, "Do you agree that the
government should sign an economic cooperative framework agreement (ECFA) with
China?"</P>
      <P>It nixed the initiative, its chairman Chao Yung-mao said, because the stated
purpose of the referendum was to determine if the government had the right to
sign an ECFA, but the question was focused on the ECFA's content.</P>
      <P>"The  referendum  question's  content  and  purpose  were contradictory," Chao
said.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei contended Sunday that the review commission had
infringed on the power of the Central Election Commission (CEC) in making such a
judgment.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the review commission is only authorized by law to check
whether the subject of the referendum proposal is suitable for a national
referendum and whether it was a subject that had already been put to a
referendum within the previous three years.</P>
      <P>But the grounds for rejecting the proposal -- that the actual question was
inconsistent with the stated purpose of the referendum -- was for the CEC and
not the review commission to decide, according to the Referendum Act, Huang
said.</P>
      <P>The CEC actually reviewed the referendum question before handing it over to the
review commission, and in doing so had given its green light to the proposal,
Huang contended.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, unless the CEC defends its authority by tossing out the
review commission's decision, "we will bring the issue to the Control Yuan for

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The recently reelected head of the Taiwan Electrical  and Electronic
Manufacturers Association (TEEMA) said over the weekend that Foxconn Group's
recent pay raise signals an upward trend of production costs in China.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, TEEMA President Arthur Chiao said the association will
begin to promote a "southward strategy" to encourage China-based Taiwanese
technology companies to relocate to India, Indonesia and Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Foxconn Group announced Sunday that workers at its Shenzhen plants
will get another pay raise from Oct.1, which would bring their standard monthly
salary to 2,000 yuan, (about NT$9,600). The group's move now puts strong
pressure on its peers.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Chiao said the Foxconn Group's decision to raise the wages its Chinese workers
is an indication that the good old days of cheap Chinese labor are gone.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwan-owned  companies that manufacture umbrellas and footwear, which were
the first to set up in China, have already relocated elsewhere. Now it is the
turn of export-oriented electronic and information-technology companies, Chiao
said.</P>
      <P>In response to the labor shortage and rising wages in coastal Chinese provinces,
a number of Taiwanese enterprises have relocated to China's hinterland in recent
years with an eye on the growing Chinese consumer market.</P>
      <P>However, companies whose main markets are in the United States and Europe should
consider relocating as soon as possible to places with better potential for
development and profit making, Chiao said. The TEEMA will step up information
gathering and market surveys to help its members secure better investment
opportunities, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition to arranging visits to South Asian and Southeast Asian countries by
market survey groups, Chiao said, the association will also organize for a
delegation to visit Japan next year to scout business opportunities and joint
venture deals there. (June 7, 2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Foxconn Group, a subsidiary of the Taiwan-based Hon Hai Group, announced Sunday
that assembly workers and division chiefs at all of its factories in Shenzhen,
China will get a second round of pay raises from Oct. 1, once they pass the
basic performance assessment.</P>
      <P>This will push up their basic monthly salary from the current 1,200 yuan to
2,000 yuan, the highest at any enterprise in China.</P>
      <P>Foxconn's Shenzhen plants had just offered its workers a 30 percent pay raise at
the beginning of this month amid a string of reported suicide attempts at its
sprawling factory complex in the southern Chinese city, in which 11 people died
and two were injured.</P>
      <P>Foreign institutional investors estimated that the pay increases will eat up at
least a third of Hon Hai Groups's earnings. It will be a challenge for the group
to earn a profit of NT$8 per share for 2011, they forecast.</P>
      <P>The group's pay raise decision has also put strong pressure on other Taiwanese
companies in China. Heads of major Taiwanese business associations in China said
they will encourage their member companies to transform and upgrade their
technology in order to survive in an environment of rising costs and stiffer
competition. (June 7, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices extended losses across the board in mid-morning trade
Monday, following a dive on Wall Street at the end of last week, as debt
problems in Hungary added to the worry over the European debt crisis, dealers
said.</P>
      <P>At 10: 27 a.m., the weighted index fell 243.63 points or 3.32 percent to
7,100.96, after opening 2.79 percent lower, on turnover of NT$40.92 billion
(US$1.27 billion).</P>
      <P>"It was no surprise to see investors scrambling to dump stocks this morning, "
said Taiwan International Securities analyst Michael Chiang. "The problems in
Hungary have greatly affected market confidence at home and abroad."</P>
      <P>In addition, Chiang said, the euro's dive against the U.S. dollar has renewed
concerns about consumption in the eurozone.</P>
      <P>"That's why we're seeing heavy losses in local high tech stocks on fears that
weakening demand in Europe will affect their global sales and their bottom
line," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai Precision fell 6.43 percent to NT$116.50 and Acer 2.52 percent to
NT$77.50.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor  Manufacturing Co.  lost 3.61 percent, dropping to
NT$58.80, and United Microelectronics Corp. fell 3.75 percent to NT$14.10.</P>
      <P>Chiang said investors should watch closely to see how foreign institutional
investors cut their holdings after the Wall Street losses.</P>
      <P>"If foreign selling accelerates, it is possible that the local bourse will test
the psychological 7,000 mark soon," Chiang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: More sense less party scheming on ECFA referendum</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/07/10  11:12:24
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>We think the Cabinet's Referendum Review Committee made the right decision to
reject a proposal by the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) for a
referendum on whether Taiwan should sign an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>The TSU, which has been outspoken in its opposition to the ECFA, accused the
committee of attempting to block the referendum. However, we noticed that the
party worded the referendum question in the affirmative, a linguistic trick that
we think was meant to confuse voters.</P>
      <P>If the TSU wants the electorate to reject the ECFA, it should pose the
referendum question in way that would require a straight yes or no answer.</P>
      <P>However, we think that any referendum on the ECFA would be premature as the
contents of the pact have not yet been fully worked out. There are still many
details related to the ECFA that still have to be resolved, including whether or
not it should be subject to legislative approval.</P>
      <P>If the electorate wants a referendum on the ECFA, the proposal should be made
though proper and rational procedures. We don't want Taiwan's referendum system
to be haunted by the ghosts of crafty political schemes. (June 7, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) announced Monday that official approval  will
now be required  for the development of hillside land in Taiwan, whether for
agricultural or other purposes.</P>
      <P>With the approach of the rainy season in Taiwan, Lee Chen-yang, deputy director-
general of the COA's Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, called on farmers and
developers to submit their plans for soil and water conservation in the use of
such lands.</P>
      <P>The screening  plan is designed to ensure soil and water conservation on
Taiwan's fragile land areas, lower the possibility of landslides and promote
proper land use, Lee said in an announcement on the bureau's Web site.</P>
      <P>Lee called for all those concerned to follow the rules on the use and
development of hill-slope land. Violators could face fines of between NT$60,000
and NT300,000, he said.</P>
      <P>Those whose development projects are found to have resulted in water and soil
erosion or damage to water conservation facilities could face fines of up to
NT$600,000 or a maximum prison term of five years, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Can suicide prevention system withstand test?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/07/10  11:47:31
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 9-year-old-girl helped save her mother's life last week by making repeated
emergency calls to the police to tell them that her mother was about to commit
suicide. Her precocious sense and courage are admirable, but the case has once
again exposed the flaws and deficiencies in our suicide prevention system.</P>
      <P>The "saving mother" case showed that there is ample room for improvement in
suicide reporting, assessment and care. Police, firefighting and medical staff
should also be trained to be more sensitive to possible suicides.</P>
      <P>The case last week, coupled with the deaths of a fifth grader and her mother in
a familicide tragedy, also reflects the government's incompetence in dealing
with high-risk family problems.</P>
      <P>Inter-agency coordination and enforcement are badly needed to help disadvantaged
families and to prevent suicides. The government should also make an overall
review of the allocation of its suicide prevention budget. Usually, a large
amount of money is spent on data analysis and hosting seminars and overseas
survey trips, which defeats the purpose of the funds.</P>
      <P>The budget should be used to train those on the frontline of suicide prevention,
including teachers, borough chiefs and police officers.</P>
      <P>More importantly, a special bill on suicide prevention and control should be
enacted to provide a solid and comprehensive legal basis for various suicide
prevention operations.</P>
      <P>With suicide being one of the top 10 causes of death in Taiwan for 13
consecutive years, we should not continue to drag our feet on such legislation.

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: Resolving excessive savings</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/07/10  12:56:40
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The shortage of domestic investment and surging excessive savings are always
problems that give the government a headache. According to Executive Yuan
statistics, Taiwan's net national savings totalled NT$3.64 trillion (US$112.22
billion) in 2009.</P>
      <P>While the net domestic investments only reached NT$2.18 trillion that year, the
country saw NT$1.46 trillion in excessive savings, accounting for 11.28 percent
of the gross national product (GNP).</P>
      <P>In 2010, private investment rebounded, but national savings also expanded to
break the level of NT$4 trillion. As a result, excessive savings this year will
fall only slightly to NT$1.28 trillion.</P>
      <P>The percentage of excessive savings to GNP in 2010 is expected to reach a high
level of 9.42 percent. These high savings are the cause of a flood of idle funds
in the country.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  people  are  not short  of money,  but investment opportunities must be
created by the government in order that idle funds can flow into national
construction projects.</P>
      <P>To tackle the problem, Christina Liu, the new chairwoman of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development, has proposed bringing in the "public-private
partnership (PPP) " investment model from overseas.</P>
      <P>However, it is doubtful that the model will be successfully implemented in the
country, given the disputes that have arisen in the wake of the major national
construction projects based on the "build, operate, transfer (BOT) " model,
including the High-Speed Railway.</P>
      <P>To successfully copy the PPP model in Taiwan, mutual trust needs to be promoted
between the government and people, while strict regulations must be set forth
and a political environment that will help the investment model must be adopted.

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that Taiwan will continue to strengthen
diplomatic relations with Kiribati but will not oppose the west-central Pacific
ally's seeking to develop unofficial ties with China.</P>
      <P>"We (Taiwan and China) have developed tacit agreement that we will not steal
each other's diplomatic allies, " Ma told visiting Kiribati President Anote Tong
at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Ma said cross-Taiwan Strait relations have become much warmer since he took
office in 2008, a development he said has not only benefited the people of both
sides and helped ease regional tensions but has also allowed Taiwan to adopt its
modus vivendi approach toward pragmatic diplomacy.</P>
      <P>He told Tong, whose ancestors came from today's Guangdong Province, that Taiwan
has not interfered with Chinese fishing companies' bid to enter into fishery
cooperation with their Kiribati counterparts.</P>
      <P>As a diplomatic ally, Taiwan is now building an international airport for
Kiribati, to give the island nation quicker access to the rest of the world, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he added, a plan has been launched to allow Kiribati students to
learn English and Chinese in Taiwanese colleges.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Ma attended a red carpet ceremony at the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall Plaza, where Tong was welcomed with a military salute.</P>
      <P>For his part, Tong reiterated that Taiwan is an important member of the global
community and said Kiribati will spare no efforts to help Taiwan join major
international organizations.</P>
      <P>Tong assumed office in early 2003 and a few months later, the nation established
formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Lower demand in China for cellphone microchips as a result of tighter government
monetary policy affected the May sales figures of integrated circuit designer
MediaTek Inc., analysts said Monday.</P>
      <P>MediaTek posted NT$9.87 billion (US$306 million) in sales for May, down 18.14
percent from April's NT$12.06 billion, although the May figure was 5.44 percent
higher year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Demand for cell phone microchips in China reached a peak in April before the
long Labor Day holiday in early May, TLG Asset Management analyst Arch Shih
said.</P>
      <P>"This shows that China's recent tightening of its monetary policies to cap
inflation is working, " Shih said. "We have to watch closely to see how the
monetary policy will affect consumption in China."</P>
      <P>In the first five months of the year, MediaTek posted NT$54.6 billion in sales,
up 27.33 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Shih said there are concerns about MediaTek's gross profit margin, as
competition on the mainland is getting stiffer.</P>
      <P>The forecast for the company's gross profit margin for 2010 is 57 percent,
compared to the 58 percent it recorded in 2009, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>"I do not think it will be easy for the company to achieve the 57 percent
margin, given the stiffer competition in China," he said.</P>

06/07/10  15:43:42
(By Frances Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 2.54 percent Monday following a Wall Street
plunge at the end of last week that dealers attributed to fears that debt
problems in Europe will worsen after a financial crisis surfaced in Hungary.</P>
      <P>The weighted index closed down 186.76 points at 7,157,83, after moving between
7,085.55 and 7,172.30 on turnover of NT$82.48 billion (US$2.56 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened 2.79 percent lower on a knee-jerk reaction to Wall Street's
dive to below the key 10,000 point level, and the losses extended, led by the
high tech sector, during the trading session before rebounding on bargain
hunting toward the close, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,552 stocks closed down and 447 ended the day up, with 124 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector suffered the steepest decline, down 2.9
percent, while construction and financial shares fell 2.6 percent each, followed
by paper and pulp, with a 2.4-percent decline.</P>
      <P>Plastics and chemicals, and textile shares each lost 2.1 percent, while the
foodstuff sector closed down 1.8 percent and the cement sector was 1.7 percent
lower.</P>
      <P>Edward Chen,  vice president of First Capital Management's research department,
said that as Hungary is a small economy and not a member of the eurozone, its
debt problems are unlikely to pose a serious threat to the economy in the
European Union.</P>
      <P>"However,  amid the already weak investor  sentiment,  the development has dealt
a blow to market confidence at home and abroad," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"The impact so far has been very psychological, in particular as investors
witnessed the panic selling on Wall Street," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen said many local investors are afraid that accelerating debt problems in
Europe will hurt demand and cut consumption in the European market.</P>
      <P>"The worries are running deep, as Taiwan is an export-oriented economy with so
many high tech firms heavily dependent on foreign markets, " he said, adding
that bellwether electronic heavyweights faced heavy selling as a result of the
concern.</P>
      <P>For example, flat panel maker Chimei-Innolux lost 5.23 percent to close at
NT$33.55, while AU Optronics fell 3.42 percent to NT$29.65.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai Precision, meanwhile, faced other problems and shed 5.62 percent to
NT$117.5 over concerns about its bottom line after Foxconn Technology Group
announced another pay hike for its Chinese workers Sunday. Hon Hai is the parent
company of Foxconn.</P>
      <P>Against the downward trend on the broader market, there was some slightly more
optimistic news in the tourism sector, with some tourism stocks appearing
resilient thanks to an increase in the number of Chinese tourists to Taiwan.
Formosa International Hotels were up 2.53 percent at NT$385.00 and Ambassador
Hotel ended the day 0.27 percent higher at NT$36.75.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Plan launched to build third terminal at Taoyuan Airport</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 7 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A plan to build a third terminal at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport (TTIA)
-- the country's main gateway -- has been submitted for government approval, the
Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>"The expansion and development is imperative, " said President Ma Ying-jeou
during an inspection tour of the airport a day earlier.</P>
      <P>CAA officials said the new terminal will have a maximum capacity of 43 million
passengers per year -- about 2.5 times greater than that of Terminal Two, which
has a capacity of 17 million people, or 3.5 times larger than that of Terminal
One, with its capacity of 12 million people.</P>
      <P>TTIA's aging Terminal One is currently undergoing a NT$3.2 billion facelift, the
CAA said, work that is slated to be completed in August 2011.</P>
      <P>The development of a third terminal will be under the authority of a state-run
company that is expected to be established in November, according to the CAA.</P>
      <P>After the development plan is approved by the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications and the Executive Yuan, and the details of the development are
made available, the CAA will open international bidding to solicit world-
renowned architect firms to take part in the development, CAA officials said.</P>
      <P>On the issue of whether the new terminal will be built by the government  or  by
a  private  consortium  based  on  a build-operate-transfer program, the
officials said this will be decided depending on how the to-be-formed state-run
airport company's financial condition unfolds.</P>
      <P>The plan for a third terminal has been devised in view of improved economic
prospects at home and abroad in the future, as well as closer bilateral
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, the officials said.</P>
      <P>A record high of over 23 million people arrived in Taiwan and departed via TTIA
in 2007, a figure that slowed slightly to 22 million in 2009, according to CAA
tallies.</P>
      <P>According to the Airports Council International's (AIC) 2009 Airport Service
Quality Survey, TTIA fell to 27th place in 2009 rankings, a sharp drop from the
18th position it held the previous year.</P>

      <P>Shares of Hon Hai Precision Industry, the world's biggest contract electronics
maker, plunged to a nine-month low in heavy trading Monday after it announced
another pay hike in China, raising concerns over the company's bottom line.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai closed down 5.62 percent to NT$117.50 (US$3.64) , the lowest level since
August 31, 2009, with 87.63 million shares changing hands, after publicizing the
pay hike, which will take effect in October.</P>
      <P>Foxconn Technology Group, as Hon Hai is known in China, felt compelled to raise
wages to assuage its workers and overcome public criticism of its management
practices following a rash of suicides at its Shenzhen complex this year.</P>
      <P>The pay raise announced on Sunday was the second in a week, and will boost the
pay of the company's Chinese employees to 2,000 Chinese yuan (US$293) a month
from 1,200 yuan.</P>
      <P>The first pay hike, which took effect June 1, pushed their original wages from
900 Chinese yuan a month 30 percent higher.</P>
      <P>"I expect the two pay hikes will take away about NT$20 billion from Hon Hai's
bottom line, " said Wang Wan-li, head of research at HSBC Securities Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The company's net income in 2009 was NT$75.7 billion, 37 percent higher than the
previous year.</P>
      <P>Wang said, however, that the trend toward higher wages in China has become
irreversible.</P>
      <P>"Not only foreign investors but also Chinese entrepreneurs have to face reality.
Hon Hai has merely adapted itself to the changing environment earlier than
others," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Asking not to be identified, a dealer with a regional brokerage said the market
is watching closely how Hon Hai will overcome the financial hurdle as its net
profit will be cut by 20 percent after the pay hikes.</P>
      <P>"I expect foreign institutional investors will continue to dump Hon Hai shares,"
he said.</P>
      <P>The stock may keep weakeni g until it falls to the nearest support level of
around NT$110," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) has been fined NT$7.7 million (US$215,400) between
2006 and April 2010 for pollution and other violations at its sixth naphtha-
cracking plant in Mailiao, in central Taiwan's Yunlin County, the Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The EPA initiated a plan earlier this year to conduct eight-month checks on the
operations of the company's sixth naphtha cracker at the request of the Control
Yuan in the wake of an increasing number of complaints from Yunlin residents
over the possible health dangers caused by the petrochemical complex.</P>
      <P>Twenty-five percent of the checks have been completed so far, according to Yen
Hsu-ming, an EPA official.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Institute of Environment and Resources has been commissioned
with a budget of NT$9 million to conduct evaluations on the plant's operations
over the past 10 years, Yen said.</P>
      <P>The institute is scheduled to make assessments between April 28 and Dec. 31 on
the aspects of environment, society, culture and health and will give monthly
reports every month to the EPA, along with three overall reports, Yen noted.</P>
      <P>The first overall report,  issued Monday, shows that most complaints were
related to air pollution, foul smells, and adverse effects on the fishery
industry.</P>
      <P>Of nine complaints filed in 2009, six related to noxious odors, according to the
report.</P>
      <P>Yen also said the environmental authorities carried out 133 inspections of the
plant between 2006 and 2010 and dealt out fines totaling NT$7.7 million to the
company for violations found during 14 of the inspections.</P>
      <P>Addressing residents' concerns that the plant is closely linked to a high cancer
rate in the township, Yen said the EPA will ask FPG itself to submit a three-
year health risk evaluation plan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Monday that Taiwan will adopt
a "building blocks" approach to promote free trade agreements (FTAs) with other
countries, beginning with investment guarantee pacts.</P>
      <P>The idea of signing an investment guarantee agreement between Taiwan and Japan
as a pragmatic option preceding an eventual FTA has been favorably received in
Japan, Shih told a group of local business and industrial leaders.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan and the United States have exchanged technical views seven times
on the feasibility of signing an investment guarantee pact.</P>
      <P>The U.S. has some legal issues to tackle before it could possibly sign an
investment guarantee pact with Taiwan, Shih said during the joint supervisory
board meeting of the Taipei-based Chinese National Association of Industry and
Commerce.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has signed FTAs with five Latin American allies, but the government wants
FTAs with more key economic players, including the U.S., Japan, the European
Union, Australia, New Zealand and the ASEAN members, Shih said.</P>
      <P>"Making Taiwan part of global business integration is one of the government's
top missions," he said.</P>
      <P>"We follow a 'building blocks' concept in this effort. Since an FTA is unlikely
to be signed with a major economy in one stroke, we seek to achieve the goal
piece by piece," he explained.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas and candidate for the Republican
presidential nomination in 2008, reiterated his support for Taiwan upon arrival
Monday for a three-day visit during which he will meet government officials and
local political leaders.</P>
      <P>He wasted no time to emphasize his long-term support for Taiwan, saying: "I love
Taiwan. I feel that it is one of the most important partners the United States
has and one of our greatest allies."</P>
      <P>Huckabee met then-President Chen Shui-bian during his last visit in June 2006,
when he was governor of Arkansas and chairman of the National Governors
Association. The association passed a resolution in 2003 supporting Taiwan's bid
to become an observer in the World Health Assembly, and in 2005, Huckabee's
state of Arkansas passed a resolution recommending the signing of a Taiwan-U.S.
free trade agreement.</P>
      <P>Responding to a reporter's question, he acknowledged there had been political
changes both in the U.S. and Taiwan since his last visit, but said change is
"one of the wonderful things about democracy."</P>
      <P>"Sometimes I don't like the change. Obviously I would like to see a different
president in my country. I thought it should have been me, but apparently the
rest of the country doesn't think that way just yet, " he said.</P>
      <P>"We accept change as what makes our system the amazing system that it is, and in
the same way this is one of the reasons that I feel the U.S. has a very strong
organic relationship with Taiwan because, like we elect our government, so do
you. And you have the opportunity to get angry with them and express it. I like
that and I think that's healthy and good, " he said.</P>
      <P>Visiting Taiwan to promote his book "Do the Right Thing, " Huckabee will make an
invitation-only appearance at the Taipei International Convention Center
Tuesday, according to Jack Hu, managing director of London International Group,
organizer of the visit.</P>
      <P>The Tuesday event,  called "An Evening with Governor Mike Huckabee, " will begin
with remarks from Huckabee and later include a moderated question and answer
session, Hu said.</P>
      <P>In his bid for the Republican nomination for president, Huckabee won eight
states and more than 4 million votes in the primaries before pulling out of the
race in March 2008.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he plans to run again in the 2012 presidential election, Huckabee
said: "I don't know. If I were, I probably wouldn't announce it in Taipei."</P>
      <P>Huckabee was elected as lieutenant governor of Arkansas in 1993 by special
election and re-elected in 1994. He became governor in July 1996 when his
predecessor resigned, making him one of the youngest governors in the country at
the time. He served as governor from 1996 to 2007 and was recognized by Time
Magazine as one of the five best governors in America.</P>
      <P>Huckabee  currently  hosts a weekend political  talk show, "Huckabee," on Fox
News Channel.</P>

      <P>A new snack made from ponkan mandarin oranges grown in central Taiwan's Taichung
County has obtained Halal certification, which will pave the way for it to enter
Islamic markets abroad, a farmers association said Monday.</P>
      <P>Halal certification is recognition that products are permissible under Islamic
law for use by Muslims.</P>
      <P>The ponkan mandarin orange cake was developed by Taichung County's Shihkang
Farmers Association in collaboration with a food company, an association
spokesman said, adding that the association was forced to try to add value to
its ponkan mandarin oranges -- a major crop in the Shihkang area -- following
poor sales in 2009.</P>
      <P>After much trial and error, it came up with the orange cake, the spokesman said.
As the cake uses purely natural ingredients and is moderately sweet and full of
orange aroma and flavor, he said, it was an instant success when it hit the
market in April.</P>
      <P>"All of the cakes have sold out and we are now preparing to produce another
batch, part of which will be exhibited at a food fair in Malaysia in July," the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Besides Malaysia, the association will also explore markets in other Southeast
Asian countries with large Muslim populations, the spokesman said, adding that
the association will try to create as much commercial value as possible for
second-grade locally grown oranges.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City's Department of Health has found that one-sixth of the 102 samples
of zongzi and zongzi ingredients it collected and tested recently failed to meet
hygienic standards, city health officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>Zongzi are a traditional Chinese food made of glutinous rice stuffed with
different fillings and wrapped in bamboo or reed leaves. They are often consumed
during the Dragon Boat Festival, which falls on June 16 this year.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health conducted the test to ensure the safety of the seasonal
favorite, but found that 16 of the 102 samples contained excessive amounts of
chemical ingredients that could be harmful to people's health.</P>
      <P>The tests were thorough, covering meat, vegetarian and sweet zongzi as well as
ingredients sold to make their fillings, such as shrimps, salted duck egg yolks,
dried radish and pickled mustard tubers, and the bamboo leaves used to wrap the
mix.</P>
      <P>The tests found that 10 of the dried radish samples had excessive levels of the
preservative benzoic acid, and two pickled mustard tuber samples had excessive
amounts of preservatives  and the bleaching agent sulfur dioxide, respectively.</P>
      <P>One of the bamboo leaves also had too much bleaching agent, according to the
health officials.</P>
      <P>Benzoic acid is harmful to the liver and kidneys, while sulfur dioxide can
induce asthma.</P>
      <P>The health officials said preservatives can be dissolved in water, and those
found in dried radishes can be removed by immersing the radishes in hot water
for a while, health officials said.</P>
      <P>Though none of the shrimps tested add excessive levels of bleaching agent, the
officials urged consumers to buy shrimps with a natural color and soak them in
warm water for at least 20 minutes before cooking.</P>
      <P>Bamboo leaves that are too green or emit a sulfuric smell might also have been
treated with bleaching agent and should be avoided when used to wrap foods, the
officials said.</P>

      <P>The Council of Indigenous Peoples (CIP) welcomed the public Monday to
participate in efforts to preserve Aboriginal cultures by taking one of several
free language classes offered around Taiwan starting later this month.</P>
      <P>In collaboration with National Taiwan Normal University, the CIP will hold
classes in five regions of the country in which all 14 of the aboriginal
languages spoken in the Taiwanese indigenous community are covered.</P>
      <P>The classes will focus on speaking, reading and writing, said CIP officials.</P>
      <P>"Language is the most direct way for people to communicate with each other. It
is also through language that we can understand the true essence of a culture,"
said CIP Chief Secretary Chen Cheng-jia.</P>
      <P>Paelrese, a native Rukai language instructor in Taipei City, explained that
traditionally, aboriginal languages and history are passed down orally or
through other unwritten forms such as folklore, dance, songs or art.</P>
      <P>These methods, she said, can be dangerous because pertinent history and personal
data can get lost or distorted along the way.</P>
      <P>In an effort to preserve the languages of the indigenous community, the CIP in
2005 established a Romanized writing system for all Taiwan's aboriginal
languages.</P>
      <P>The council has also held classes and language certification programs for
members of the indigenous community, as well as for Han Chinese, to help with
the conservation movement.</P>
      <P>"For aboriginal children,  learning their mother tongue is extremely important
for their personal well-being because it helps them to know who they are and to
be proud of their heritage, " said Parlese.</P>
      <P>Fifteen year-old Pulalujan, who also belongs to the Rukai tribe, said he enjoys
learning the language of his ancestors because "it gives me a sense of
connection to my culture and my people, even though I live in the city."</P>
      <P>In addition to the basic language classes, the CIP also offers advanced courses
for certified Aboriginal language speakers on subjects such as language
pedagogy, interpreting and translation, as well as news broadcasting.</P>
      <P>The free classes will be offered in the cities of Taipei, Taichung, Kaohsiung,
Hualien and Taitung.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A decision by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to exclude high-income families
from a plan to level the difference in tuition fees at private and public high
schools was criticized Monday as unfair and too late.</P>
      <P>Since March, when the MOE first announced its new tuition policy, many private
high schools have been using the promise of lower fees in their advertisements,
according to Chairman of the National Alliance of Parents Organization Hsieh
Kuo-ching.</P>
      <P>However, on June 4 the Cabinet approved an amendment to the policy that would
exclude families with an annual household income of more than NT$600,000, which
obliges the MOE to address the resulting problems, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The new clause will affect nearly 10,000 junior high school graduates who have
been accepted to private high schools and vocational schools for the 2010-2011
academic year that starts in September, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, a couple with three children in southern Taiwan is now
forced to split because their two younger sons are enrolled at private high
schools and they would not qualify for the lower tuition rates if their parents'
incomes are combined.</P>
      <P>A family of four people cannot be classified as high income if its annual
household income is only slightly higher than NT$600,000, some people were
quoted in the local media as saying.</P>
      <P>The National Teachers' Association (NTA) held a press conference earlier in the
day in which NTA Chairman Liu Hsin-hsu denounced the MOE for not keeping its
promise. He demanded an apology and remedial measures.</P>
      <P>The MOE's new policy states that, with effect from September, tuition fees for
first, second and third year students at private high schools, who come from
families with an annual household income of less than NT$600,000, will be
lowered from NT$22,800 to NT$6,240, same as at public schools.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, tuition fees for private vocational school students from low-income
families will drop from NT$22,530 to NT$6,240 per semester, on the same level as
at public vocational schools.</P>
      <P>Starting September 2011, the MOE said, the policy will be expanded to include
students from households with an annual income of up to NT$900,000.</P>
      <P>The fee reduction in the 2010-2011 academic year will cost NT$813 million, the
ministry said.</P>

      <P>"We also will include the flight mileages of those experts and artists we have

      <P>Kaohsiung City has procured a second amphibious vehicle that is expected to be
put into commercial use in September for sightseeing tours in the southern port
city, a transportation official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The first "duck boat" was delivered to Taiwan early this year, but did not begin
tour services until May 8 due to a time-consuming application process for
vehicle and boat permits, said Wang Kwo-tsai, director-general of the city's
Transportation Bureau.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the passenger load factor of the vehicle averaged 90 percent over
the first month of operations.</P>
      <P>In view of the popularity that the first amphibious vehicle enjoys, the city
government plans to start a second service and earmark NT$100 million (US$3.07
million) next year to buy another four vehicles.</P>
      <P>The second duck boat has arrived in Kaohsiung Harbor and will be formally
introduced June 14. After undergoing checks and obtaining permits, it will begin
commercial operations in September.</P>
      <P>The new duck boat will be used for tours between Kaohsiung Harbor's Glory Pier
and Pier-2 Art Center. The route is designed to attract tourists to performances
and other cultural activities organized by the city's Cultural Affairs Bureau at
the art center, Wang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Large wage hikes in China unfavorable to Taiwan businesses there</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,   June  7  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of a Taiwanese investor association in China said Monday that most of
his association members will be adversely impacted by wage hikes in China that
are on too high a scale or at too fast a pace.</P>
      <P>Kuo Shan-hui, chairman of the Beijing-based Association of Taiwan Investment
Enterprises on the Mainalnd, said that as a result of China's rapid economic
growth over the past decade, it is inevitable that average wages in China will
go up.</P>
      <P>However, wages should not increase too high or too fast, so that enterprises can
find room to adapt to the changing economic and social situation, Kuo said after
presiding over a ceremony to open an express service center established by his
association.</P>
      <P>"For most of Taiwanese investors in China, a wage hike of 10 percent at present
would be acceptable, " said Kuo, whose association is a federation of over 100
Taiwanese groupings across China.</P>
      <P>Kuo was responding to the latest in a spate of pay hikes in China, after Foxconn
Technology announced a day earlier a new round of wage hikes for its workers,
taking their monthly salaries to 2,000 Chinese yuan (US$293), effective Oct. 1.</P>
      <P>It was the second pay hike in a week announced by Foxconn and was part of a
series of moves to assuage its workers and overcome public criticism of its
management practices following a rash of suicides at its Shenzhen complex this
year. Foxconn had already adjusted upward the monthly wages of its workers from
900 yuan to 1,200 yuan from June 1.</P>
      <P>The statutory minimum wage in many of China's eastern coastal provinces has
risen by up by 20 percent since the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>Kuo said his association will relay the concerns of its members to the relevant
Chinese agencies.</P>
      <P>"Many Taiwanese enterprises  will be forced to move their operations elsewhere
with relatively lower wages if the problem (higher wages in China) is left
unaddressed," he said.</P>
      <P>The express service center was set up to protect Taiwanese businessmen operating
in China by providing them with needed and timely services.</P>
      <P>Kuo also revealed that his association will set up a think tank to focus on
research into investment strategies for Taiwanese businesses in China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gates reaffirms no changes in U.S. policy on arms sales to Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  June 6 (CNA)
06/07/10  22:04:40
(By Tang Pei-chun and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has reaffirmed that the United States policy
on selling defensive weapons to Taiwan remains unchanged despite China's
opposition.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered at a seminar on Asian security at the International
Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore Saturday, Gates said arms sales to
Taiwan "are nothing new."</P>
      <P>He also stressed that the U.S. had demonstrated in a very public way that it
does not support independence for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We strongly encourage the cross-Strait improvement in relations and perhaps a
time will come when this issue will go away because of those improved relations,
but we will maintain our obligations" under the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), he
said.</P>
      <P>The TRA is the U.S. law that regulates relations with Taiwan in the absence of
diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Noting that China has done nothing to stop its military buildup "largely focused
on Taiwan, " Gates said the U.S. was selling arms to Taiwan in response to that
threat.</P>
      <P>China has more than 1,000 short-range ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan and is
also developing  advanced weaponry ranging from anti-satellite  weaponry and
cyber-attack  capabilities to more conventional fighter jets and long-range
missiles, according to defense sources.</P>
      <P>Addressing the seminar, also known as the Shangri-La Dialogue, Gates   described
China's   repeated   postponements   of military-to-military exchanges because
of the arms sales to Taiwan as counterproductive.</P>
      <P>China canceled such exchanges after the U.S. announced a US$6.4 billion arms
package to Taiwan in January.</P>
      <P>"We need sustained and reliable military-to-military contacts at all levels that
reduce miscommunication,  misunderstanding  and miscalculation, " Gates said.
"There is a real cost to any absence of military-to-military relations."</P>
      <P>Gates originally planned to visit China after attending the Singapore seminar,
but China rejected his travel plans without giving a reason. It was widely
believed that China's refusal was related to its anger at the latest U.S.
commitment to sell weapons to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Ma Xiaotian, deputy chief of general staff of the
Chinese People's Liberation Army, said U.S. arms sales to Taiwan have been a
major hurdle to the development China-U.S. military relations.</P>
      <P>"For China, it has been a serious problem that has hindered our relations with
the U.S. over the past three decades," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Ma said, China does not think that its military ties with the U.S.
are broken.</P>
      <P>The two sides have just suspended high-level dialogue, while lower-level
exchanges  of  visits,  ministerial-level  defense consultations and the
bilateral maritime security meeting mechanism remain functional, he added.</P>

(Global Views Monthly 287)
(translated by Kay Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Southeast Asian investment in Taiwan may have declined in 2009, probably because
of the global economic downturn, but the numbers belie the growing interest
among companies from the region in Taiwan's service sector and using it as a
springboard to China.</P>
      <P>Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines were the top three sources of approved
investment from Southeast Asia between 2005 and 2009, at US$1.61 billion,
US$1.39 billion and US$39.4 million, respectively, according to the Ministry of
Economic Affairs' Investment Commission.</P>
      <P>But those numbers are expected to increase in the coming years, in part because
of the growth in China's market.</P>
      <P>Winston Yu, CEO of the accounting firm KPMG Taiwan, travels frequently to
Singapore and Malaysia, and he has found that companies in those two countries
view Taiwan as an entry point to tap into China's market because they lack the
knowledge to operate there.</P>
      <P>"We (Taiwanese) know China best among Chinese speaking regions, " he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has other advantages that are attractive to Southeast Asian companies
interested in raising funds and investing overseas, Yu said, including the low
cost of capital and a relatively high capital turnover rate.</P>
      <P>Singapore's Oceanus Group Limited, the world's largest land-based abalone
producer, was one of the companies taking advantage of the opportunity, issuing
Taiwan depositary receipts on Taiwan's stock exchange in late 2009.</P>
      <P>The complementary nature of companies from Taiwan and Southeast Asia also has
encouraged  growing investment from places like Singapore and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>While Taiwanese companies are strong in technology because of the country's
focus on developing high-tech industries, Southeast Asian companies invest in
what they see as their strengths -- the service, retail, and property sectors.
They also keep a low profile.</P>
      <P>Indonesia based APP, Asia's largest pulp and paper producer, announced to the
media earlier this year that it was entering Taiwan's consumer products market
with a NT$200 million advertising campaign.</P>
      <P>But it has declined all interviews since then as it prefers to "share with
everyone after results are available, " according to Wu He-rong, the company's
direct marketing manager.</P>
      <P>Malaysia's richest man Robert Kuok has also joined the trend, investing in
Taiwan's freight forwarding and transportation company T-Join Transportation
Co.  through his Hong Kong based Kerry Logistics.</P>
      <P>The investment has helped the Taiwanese company expand services abroad and pick
up international customers from Kerry Logistics, and also brought in a new
management style emphasizing customer service to this family-run business.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has worried that the free trade zone set up between the the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus China will leave it marginalized, in the
region, but as the rising investment in Taiwan from ASEAN countries shows, it
still has an attractive enough investment environment to remain an important
player.</P>

      <P>The Tourism Bureau said Monday there was no timetable for allowing individual
visits by Chinese tourists, countering remarks by a Taiwanese official in
Beijing that such visits were likely to begin next year.</P>
      <P>China's Southern Metropolis Daily reported on Sunday that Taiwan Strait Tourism
Association head Yang Ruey-tzhong said that although there are still measures to
be discussed with China's Cross-Strait Tourism Association (CSTA) , authorities
in Taiwan will cooperate immediately if Beijing decides to allow residents from
certain cities to visit the island alone.</P>
      <P>In a phone interview with the Central News Agency, Wu Chao-yen, deputy director-
general of The Tourism Bureau, said discussions are "still in the pipeline."</P>
      <P>The exact timetable, Wu said, has yet to be brought to the negotiating table by
the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SE F) and Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>After the CSTA's announcement last month that China will allow all Chinese
residents to visit Taiwan for vacation purposes beginning July 18, questions
emerged as to whether the SEF and ARATS will accelerate talks about lifting the
current ban on individual visits and raise the daily maximum of 3,000 Chinese
tourists.</P>
      <P>According to a news release from the Tourism Bureau last week, the 3,000 maximum
will remain the same.</P>
      <P>Roget Hsu, secretary-general of the Travel Agent Association of R.O.C., Taiwan,
said that even though the local tourism industry welcomes discussion about
individual visits, "from our perspective, there is no hurry."</P>

      <P>Taiwan's inflation in May rose by less than 1 percent compared to the same month
a year earlier, a modest rise indicating that there is no immediate risk of
inflation, an official with the country's statistics office said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) stood at 104.95 in May, 0.74 percent higher than
in May 2009, said Wu Chao-ming, a section chief of the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The rise was attributed to an annual increase of 18.31 percent in natural  gas
prices and 15.72 percent in fuel prices,  which contributed 0.18 percent and
0.48 percent, respectively, to May's CPI increase.</P>
      <P>Inflation in May fell 0.17 percent from April, mainly because of special
discounts on cosmetics and skin care products around Mother's Day and declines
in fruit and egg prices, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Though a gradual recovery in the economy could prompt commodity prices to rise,
Wu said he sees no significant upside inflation pressure at the moment because
private consumption momentum remains low, and the soft job market is likely to
keep salary increases in check.</P>
      <P>Though consumer prices remained steady, the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) in May
hit a 22-month high of 108.88, 9.41 percent higher than a year earlier due to
surges in basic metal and chemical materials.</P>
      <P>The May WPI was also 0.32 percent higher than the month-earlier figure, mainly
due to rises in quotations for metal products, machinery and electronic
components and parts.</P>

      <P>He and his family members, who accompanied him on the trip, then visiting the

      <P>Tan, who is a member of the clan's 22nd generation, said his grandfather
emigrated from Bishan to Malaysia in the early 20th century to seek a better
life.</P>
      <P>Noting that his grandfather was just one of many Kinmen people who emigrated to
Southeast Asia during the era, Tang said Kinmen immigrants weaned on infertile
land and hardship in their homeland often worked harder than others in their new
countries and thereby created distinguished new careers.</P>
      <P>Tan was born to a family with 11 members in 1956 in Johor, Malaysia. His father

      <P>Labor unions in Taiwan and Hong Kong on Monday said that in an effort to
pressure Foxconn to raise wages and improve management, they will on June 8
commemorate Foxconn workers who committed suicide recently.</P>
      <P>Tuesday was chosen because it coincides with the debut of the much-anticipated
iPhone 4G at the Apple Worldwide  Developers Conference in the U.S. and the day
Hon Hai Group, the parent company of Foxconn and Apple's strategic parnters for
iPhone 4G, will hold a shareholders' meeting in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The event was initiated by Hong Kong's SACOM, a group that monitors corporations
and campaigns to protect worker's rights, health, safety and welfare.</P>
      <P>The call was supported by Taiwan's National Federation of Independent Trade
Unions (NFITU) and the Taiwan Association for Victims of Occupational Injuries.</P>
      <P>The groups also plan to mobilize more than 100 workers outside the venue for the
Hon Hai shareholders' meeting.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai had recently announced a pay raise at its Chinese factories, including
those at the Shenzhen factory where 10 workers jumped to their deaths. Wages at
the Shenzhen Longhua plant rose to 1,200 yuan (US$176). Foxconn announced Sunday
a conditional pay raise with the aim of reaching 2,000 yuan eventually.</P>
      <P>"The hike still isn't enough, " said Chu Wei-li, executive director of the
NFITU, noting that SACOM has estimated the minimum wage should be at least 2,294
yuan per month in Shenzhen.</P>
      <P>Foxconn should also change its management methods, Chu added, saying that the
company should have independent trade unions that are not controlled by the

      <P>The Taiwan branch of an international medical geology research group will help
strengthen research into arsenic contamination of the country's groundwater, the
university professor heading the group said Monday.</P>
      <P>Jean Jiin-shuh, a professor in National Cheng Kung University's (NCKU's)
Department of Earth Sciences in southern Taiwan, said medical geology is a new
fast developing research field that studies the effect of geological factors on
the health of humans and animals.</P>
      <P>The professor hopes his group can focus on research on arsenic contamination and
form a dedicated team to study the issue, he said Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan suffered from a spate of cases of gangrene that appeared in patients'
feet, called "blackfoot" disease, in the late 1950s, which many suspect was
caused by drinking groundwater contaminated with arsenic.</P>
      <P>They believe arsenic was released into the groundwater by shifts in the earth's
layers.</P>
      <P>But though the disease was eventually brought under control and faded away, its
cause was never confirmed, and research on the phenomenon has continued to this
day.</P>
      <P>The International Medical Geology Association agreed to formally set up a Taiwan
chapter in cooperation with NCKU during a five-day seminar on arsenic in the
environment in mid-May.</P>
      <P>The International Medical Geology Association was set up in the Italian city of
Florence in 2004. Its has members in 70 countries around the world, and chapters

Confucius' lesson of the day: "Men who, when they see what is good and honest,
try to act up to it, and when they see what is bad and dishonest try to avoid it
as if avoiding scalding water: Such men I have known and the expressions of such
principle I have heard." "But men who live in retirement in order to study their
aims and who practice righteousness in order to carry out their principles: The
expression of such principles I have heard, but I have not seen such men."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and ally Saint Lucia opened a two-day conference on information and
communication technology (ICT) in the Caribbean country Monday, drawing the
participation of officials from 10 Caribbean countries and territories.</P>
      <P>Tao Wen-lung,  secretary-general  of Taiwan's  International Cooperation
Development Fund (ICDF), told participants that the event was organized to
promote ICT development in the Caribbean and narrow the digital gap between
developing countries in the region and developed nations, according to a
statement by Taiwan's Embassy to Saint Lucia.</P>
      <P>The ICDF has already helped some of Taiwan's allies in the region, including
Belize, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Lucia,
develop e-government and establish national ICT centers to improve
administrative efficiency, Tao said.</P>
      <P>In his address on the opening day of the seminar, Taiwan's ambassador to Saint
Lucia Tom Chou noted that Taiwan wants to share its successful experience in
developing ICT with its allies and help Caribbean countries improve their
people's welfare.</P>
      <P>Lenard Montoute, Saint Lucia's social transformation minister, said that with
Taiwan's assistance, his country opened the ICT center last year and also
established an information technology office to promote IT education and
training.</P>
      <P>The new facilities have helped boost employment in his country, Montoute said.</P>
      <P>The conference was attended by officials from Taiwan as well as allies Belize,
Dominican Republic, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Police integrity and oversight in question</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/08/10  10:50:47
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eleven days after the gangland killing of an underworld ring leader, the
Taichung City Police Bureau finally unveiled surveillance footage of the
shooting scene in an attempt to quell rampant speculation about police
discipline and integrity.</P>
      <P>The footage undermined the testimony of five active and retired police officers,
who had said they were chatting and drinking tea at the tightly guarded office
of gang leader Weng Chi-nan when he was shot dead May 28. The footage showed
that, in fact, they were playing mahjong.</P>
      <P>The footage also showed five other incumbent police officers had visited Weng's
secretive office between May 24 and May 28. The police corruption scandal may
snowball as investigators and prosecutors continue probing the case.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts of the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Before police authorities made public the shocking footage, prosecutors had
pored over Weng's phone records over the past half year  and identified  over 10
police  officers,  one of them high-ranking, who were believed to have
maintained close ties with the underworld ringleader.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said they will look into those police officers' family assets to
determine whether any of them colluded with Weng's ring in shady or criminal
dealings for illicit financial gain.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the footage has only fueled more speculation about police ties to
Weng's ring. It was said Weng's secretive room was actually a private police
club equipped with mahjong tables, billiard tables and tea drinking sets.</P>
      <P>Speculation was rife that the police officers present at the crime scene on the
day of the shooting were negotiating a shady dealing or probably collecting
bribe money through mahjong matches.</P>
      <P>During a question-and-answer session at the Taichung City Council on Monday, new
Taichung City Police Bureau Director Chiu Feng-kuang was grilled about police
ethics.</P>
      <P>Chiu, a veteran police detective, said engagements between police officers and
criminal ring members tend to signal that something is wrong in the police
force's internal monitoring and control system.</P>
      <P>He also said proudly that during his terms as a criminal investigator in the
1980-90s, he did not rely on clues or tips from gang members in bringing to
justice six of the 10 most notorious fugitive gunmen at the time. (June 8,
2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>To enhance police integrity, the Taichung City Police Bureau decided Monday to
punish the nine active police officers spotted in the footage more harshly than
had been planned.</P>
      <P>Three of the officers present at the crime scene on May 28 -- Lin Chi-you, Lin
Wen-wu and Tai Chih-hung -- were each slapped with a major demerit after having
been originally given a minor demerit. Two of them have also been removed from
leadership posts to take up research jobs. The penalty for the fourth policeman
at the scene when the shooting occurred -- Shih Chang-hsing -- was changed to
two minor demerits from the original "warning" issued.</P>
      <P>The five other police officers seen chatting or drinking tea in Weng's office
between May 24 and May 28 were each given a demerit. (June 8, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The head of a small detective police squad in Taichung, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said he feels despondent about the recent incident, which he said
has gravely tarnished the image of police detectives.</P>
      <P>With nearly 20 years of experience in criminal investigations, he said he hopes
police authorities will not prohibit detectives from interacting  with gang
members because of the recent shooting incident.</P>
      <P>According to the detective, current regulations allow detectives to visit
special places or contact underworld members for their job as long as they
report such contacts to their direct superiors in advance.</P>
      <P>After five police officers shown in the footage were all disciplined, he said he
is worried that fewer detectives will dare to report such contacts in the
future.</P>
      <P>Contending that the disciplinary measures will discourage police detectives from
probing criminal cases actively, he said he is afraid that they will make
criminal investigators become more passive or lazy. (June 8, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The upcoming establishment of a trade pact between the two sides of the Taiwan

ruling and opposition parties should adopt a more positive attitude to face the
new situation following the signing of the Taiwan-China economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>What the opposition camp should be planning are not protests, but measures that
can enhance Taiwan's industrial development and better take care of local
workers.</P>
      <P>Also,  we want to remind  the government  to work out a comprehensive plan to
cope with the future economic situation. First, it is urgent to develop new
markets for Taiwan's manufacturing and service sectors. Second, Taiwan needs
economic cooperation that can boost investment and employment. Third, taking
care of disadvantaged workers and families and resolving their difficulties
finding jobs are responsibilities that the government cannot sidestep.</P>
      <P>We expect the ECFA will boost Taiwan's private consumption and investment and
help revive the country's long-dormant economic prosperity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Signing FTAs with other countries</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/08/10  11:44:25
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Answering questions on Taiwan's desire to sign free trade agreements (FTAs)
with other countries,  a Chinese government spokesman said on June 1 that
Beijing is strongly opposed to Taiwan developing official links with other
countries in any form.</P>
      <P>Some critics took it as a declaration of opposition to Taiwan's signing FTAs
with other countries, calling it a slap in the face for President Ma Ying-jeou,
who has been seeking an improvement in cross-Taiwan Strait relations since he
assumed office in 2008.</P>
      <P>However, after carefully analyzing Beijing's statement, which also said China is
not against its diplomatic allies developing economic and trade links in civil
sectors with Taiwan, we believe "official agreement" is not the same as "FTA."</P>
      <P>With its special status in the international community, Taiwan has been forced
to develop ties with most countries on a level that is not official but close to
it.</P>
      <P>Taiwan joined the Asian Development Bank under the name of Taipei, China, the
World Trade Organization and Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum under the
name of Chinese Taipei.</P>
      <P>These examples suggest Taiwan must still find an alternate path in promoting the
signing of FTAs with other economies with which it maintains no diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-green" camp raised questions over the issue after confusing
China's opposition to Taiwan's signing official agreements with other countries
as opposition to Taiwan's signing FTAs. But its vigorous arguments reflect the
concern of Taiwan's people over the issue and attempt to remind Beijing to take
Taiwan's needs for international space and national dignity seriously. (June 8,

    <HEADLINE>AU Optronics' May sales boosted by TV screen demand: analyst</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
06/08/10  12:00:27
(By Pan Chi-i and Frances Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Strong global TV screen demand helped AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) , the world's
third largest flat panel maker, post record sales of large-sized liquid crystal
displays (LCD) in May, an analyst said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>AUO said Monday that shipments of large-sized flat panels -- defined as 10
inches or above -- hit a high of 10.23 million units in May, up 6 percent from a
month earlier.</P>
      <P>The company also reported NT$43.8 billion (US$1.35 billion) in sales in May, up
6.4 percent from April and up 57.9 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>"The increase in sales indicates demand for flat TV screens remained strong, "
Taiwan International Securities analyst Eric Yu said.</P>
      <P>"As flat TV panels account for about half of the company's revenue, AUO was
taking advantage of such market conditions, " Yu said.</P>
      <P>Yu said the May sales  figures  were well within  market expectations as demand
continues to rebound amid the global economic recovery.</P>
      <P>In the first quarter of this year, TV panels accounted for 48 percent of AUO's
sales, while 21 percent came from desktop monitors and 17 percent came from
screens used in notebook computers.</P>
      <P>Unlike for larger panels, May shipments of small and medium-sized flat panels
fell 12.2 percent from April to 18.54 million units, the company said.</P>
      <P>Yu contended, however, that the decline was not a cause for concern because
medium- and small-sized panels account for less than 15 percent of the company's
total sales.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as the second quarter is traditionally a slow season for the high
tech sector, the market will pay more attention to how AUO will perform from
July, when the peak season begins, the analyst said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>After a marathon session that lasted into Tuesday morning, the Legislative Yuan
passed a state enterprise budget bill less than three hours before adjourning
the body's spring session.</P>
      <P>Unless extraordinary legislative sessions are called in the coming months, the
legislators will not meet again until September after a summer recess.</P>
      <P>Legislators across party lines passed the 2010 budget plan for state-run
enterprises, calling for combined revenues of NT$2.846 trillion and expenditures
of NT$2.711 trillion.</P>
      <P>Three opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers joined 59 ruling
Kuomintang legislators during the overnight session, during which they debated
and voted on more than 300 budget adjustments submitted by legislators on an
item-by-item basis.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-shih, a KMT legislative caucus whip,  said it was regrettable that many
other measures, including the confirmation of nominees to the National
Communications Commission (NCC) and a bill allowing Taiwan to recognize Chinese
academic credentials, were not completed during the session.</P>
      <P>"Despite the delay, the KMT will continue to consult and negotiate with our DPP
colleagues to facilitate passage of many other difficult bills," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The Legislature's spring session had been scheduled to conclude in May but was
extended to June to deal with pending legislation.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whip Chai Trong-rong said the session's extension was
simply because of KMT legislators' insistence on pushing for amendments that
would have paved the way for allowing Chinese students to study in Taiwan and be
allowed to participate in exams for professional credentials.</P>
      <P>The measures were not passed despite the extended session because of DPP
opposition, leading Chai to say of the KMT, "now they've learned a lesson."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Competition to be held to select Taiwan's top five night markets</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau will sponsor an unprecedented nationwide night market
competition to select the top five markets suitable for tourism promotion, an
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Mei-hsiu, a Tourism Bureau section chief in charge of promotional affairs,
said the night markets will compete in five categories.</P>
      <P>"The competition aims to select (the night markets) that are the cleanest,  the
most friendly  to foreign  visitors,  the most interesting, the easiest to
stroll through and the richest in culinary diversity, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>Night markets have emerged as Taiwan's top tourist attraction, with 73 of every
100 foreign visitors saying they intend to see night markets during their stay
in Taiwan, according to the results of a survey conducted by the bureau last
year.</P>
      <P>In the 2009 survey, night markets beat out many of Taiwan's major landmark
attractions, such as Taipei 101, the National Palace Museum and Alishan, to
capture the No. 1 place on the top 10 list.</P>
      <P>The competition to choose the top five night markets in the country will be
divided into three stages, Chen said. In the first phase, each city and county
will be asked to recommend one to five night markets for initial screening by
representatives of major local travel agency and tour guide associations.</P>
      <P>The field will be narrowed to 10 night markets in the second stage, decided by
on-site visits of tourism experts and scholars and an online poll. The final
competition will take place in mid-August, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen acknowledged that tourists from different countries tend to have different
tastes and demands, citing the importance Japanese travelers place on clean food
and a hygienic environment.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, cleanliness is one of the five themes of the competition. We want to
pick the cleanest night market to help attract more health-conscious foreigners
to vacation in Taiwan," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In selecting the most foreigner-friendly night market, Chen said, globalization
will be a major measurement. One of the indicators will be signs, labels and
menus in foreign languages to help overseas visitors understand what they are
eating.</P>
      <P>The night market that is easiest to walk through will be the one where walking
directions are simple and clear and where overseas visitors are least likely to
get lost.</P>
      <P>To win the most interesting place title, the night market must feature a wide
diversity of merchandise and foods, while the market with the most culinary
diversity will be the one with the greatest variety of appealing foods and
beverages.</P>
      <P>Chen said members of the public who vote in the online selection will have
opportunities to win big prizes, including automobiles and night market
consumption vouchers.</P>
      <P>In addition to the competition, Chen said the Tourism Bureau will issue 100,000
night market vouchers this year to individual travelers to Taiwan as part of the
campaign. Each traveler will be given a NT$100 denominated coupon to enjoy
dishes at any of the five top special night markets.</P>
      <P>According to the Tourism Bureau's estimate, the consumption vouchers will help
bring at least NT$10 million in revenues to local night markets.</P>

they will be invited to take part in the 2010 Taiwan International Food
Exhibition to be held in the second half of August.</P>
      <P>With Chinese tourists gradually outnumbering Japanese peers, the rankings of
Taiwan's popular tourist attractions changed a bit last year as compared to
previous lists, according to the newly released Tourism Bureau survey results.</P>
      <P>The top three places -- night markets, Taipei 101, the National Palace Museum --
remained unchanged, while the three "must-see" spots for Chinese tourists -- Sun
Moon Lake, the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall and Alishan emerged as the fourth,
fifth and sixth most popular tourist attractions.</P>
      <P>Two other "must-see" places for Chinese visitors -- the Sun Yat-sen Memorial
Hall and Taroko Gorge -- made the top 10 list for the first time, ranking eighth

      <P>Danshuei and Jiufen ranked seventh and ninth.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A regressive trend has recently emerged in Taiwan politics. Two indicators are
the slogan by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to launch "a
second rural siege against cities" and a remark by the party's chairwoman Tsai
Ing-wen that the Republic of China government is "a government in exile."</P>
      <P>It was 21 years ago when the DPP first came up with the battle cry of "local
governments  laying  siege against  the central government."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai's "government in exile" comment, is a thousand times more
backward than former President Lee Teng-hui's statement in 1994 that the
Kuomintang was an "alien regime."</P>
      <P>There are several reasons why Taiwan's democracy  has not progressed.</P>
      <P>First, the greens are reluctant to abandon the politically expedient strategy of
playing on ethnic differences, which has continued to engender hate and conflict
in local politics.</P>
      <P>Second, the blues have failed to clear up the doubts expressed by the green camp
and have been dancing to the greens' tune, which repeatedly takes our society
back to its starting point.</P>
      <P>Third, democratic politics in Taiwan has been reduced to nothing more than
"elections."</P>
      <P>After two peaceful transition of power from one political party to another, it
is depressing to hear politicians still chanting hackneyed slogans. (June 8,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Text books compiled in Taiwan for Chinese and Taiwanese children living abroad
are now being printed in both simplified and traditional Chinese characters,
President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The simplified-traditional Chinese character arrangement is not only inspiring,
but also marks a significant change, " Ma said to a group of visiting Chinese
expatriate leaders from around Asia.</P>
      <P>Overseas Chinese and Taiwanese children around the world have been taught either
traditional or simplified Chinese characters over the past five decades and it
is the first time that Taiwan is issuing text books for overseas expatriates
that carry both types of characters, Ma said.</P>
      <P>In China, where simplified characters are used, the younger generation  is
becoming increasingly  familiar with traditional characters as a result of
closer cross-strait exchanges, he said.</P>
      <P>"Chinese youths have learned a lot about traditional Chinese characters by
listening to the lyrics of Taiwanese pop icon Jay Chou's hits," Ma said with a
smile.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese TV programs also play an important role in promoting a better
understanding of Taiwan among Chinese and Taiwanese living abroad, he said.</P>
      <P>Chinese  children  in Singapore  and Malaysia  often watch Taiwan-produced TV
programs and talent shows, which has helped to improve their Mandarin speaking
skills. the president said.</P>
      <P>In addition, many Chinese and Taiwanese in North America who are fans of Taiwan
TV talk shows follow the shows so closely that they are more familiar with the
contents than most Taiwanese at home, according to Ma.</P>
      <P>The president told his visitors that since he took office in 2008, he has
adopted a modus vivendi approach toward diplomacy, which has resulted in an
easing of cross-Taiwan Strait tensions and allowed Taiwan more room to maneuver
in its global relations.</P>
      <P>He called for overseas Chinese around the world, whether from mainland China or
Taiwan, to also adopt a modus vivendi approach toward people-to-people relations
so they can get along with each other in their countries of residence.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) hopes to provide information on Taiwan's top 50
universities and colleges and the 100 best international student programs in the
near future as a reference for foreign students, an MOE official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The lists are part of the MOE's initiative to attract degree candidates from
abroad by selling Taiwan's teaching quality and learning environment rather than
offering more scholarships, stressed C.J. Liu, the director general of the MOE's
Bureau of International Cultural and Educational Relations.</P>
      <P>The list of 100 programs is expected to be posted on the MOE's website this
September, said Jennie Y. Wu, a researcher with the MOE's Program Office of
Bureau of International  Cultural and Educational Relations.</P>
      <P>Wu told the Central  News Agency  that the ministry  has commissioned the
Foundation for International Cooperation in Higher Education in Taiwan (FICHET)
, a nonprofit organization founded in 2005, to conduct the survey that will form
the basis of the list.</P>
      <P>In its first stage, the survey will target foreign students currently studying
in 44 schools in Taiwan and ask them about language ability, teaching quality,
language environment, and other issues, said Peng Yi-chao, a foundation
official.</P>
      <P>Based on the results, the foundation will produce a list of the 44 universities
and 100 programs with descriptions of each one, but Peng said the universities
and programs will not be given scores or be ranked.</P>
      <P>"We will also classify the 100 programs into four categories -- more than 90
percent taught in English, 75 percent-95 percent taught in English, under 75
percent taught in English and those taught entirely in Chinese -- so that
students can choose programs according to their language abilities, " she said.</P>
      <P>The foundation launched the new website "Study in Taiwan" at the beginning of
May to promote higher education in Taiwan and expand the recruitment of
international students, and the results of the survey will posted there and on
the MOE's website when they become available.</P>
      <P>The MOE hopes that the number of universities on the reference list will
increase to 50 over time.</P>
      <P>Foreign students thinking about coming to Taiwan can go to the website,
www.studyintaiwan.org., to find updated information about scholarships and
international programs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hon Hai Group will raise wages at all its factories in China and also offer
business start-up loans to its Chinese workers with over five years of service,
its chairman Terry Gou announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>At a shareholders meeting, Gou said the group will raise wages not only at its
factories in Shenzhen in southern China, but also at those in other regions such
as Jiangsu and Shandong.</P>
      <P>However, Gou said, the pay hikes at the different factories will vary because of
differences in the cost of living in some areas.</P>
      <P>In addition to pay raises, Gou said, the group will offer start-up loans of
200,000 yuan (US$29,275) each to employees who have been with the company for
more than five years.</P>
      <P>Workers who apply for and obtain the loans will be able to return to their
hometowns, start their own businesses and even place orders with Hon Hai, he
said.</P>
      <P>Foxconn Technology Group, as Hon Hai is known in China, announced a second pay
raise Sunday, amid public criticism of its management practices following a rash
of suicides at its Shenzhen complex this year.</P>
      <P>The first pay increase of 30 percent, which took effect June 1, pushed the
monthly wages of Foxconn's workers from 900 yuan to 1,200 yuan. With the second
raise, the employees will now earn 2,000 yuan a month.</P>
      <P>Gou said that his group plans to build dozens of technological and electronics
markets -- like Taipei City's Guang Hua Digital Plaza -- in China because
Foxconn's focus in China is shifting from exports to domestic demand.</P>
      <P>In late April, Hon Hai's distribution subsidiary, Cybermart Worldwide Co., was
named as the preferred bidder for a build-operate- transfer (BOT) project for an
information park next to the Guang Hua Digital Plaza.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, several labor rights groups held a protest in front of Hon Hai's
headquarters in Taipei County Tuesday, calling for the workers' right to form an
independent union.</P>
      <P>The protesters also asked that investments of Taiwan's labor pension fund be
withdrawn from Hon Hai. If the fund is to continue to hold large chunks of Hon
Hai shares, Taiwan workers should have the right to supervise the company's
management, they argued.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taoyuan County Magistrate John Chih-yang Wu announced Tuesday that he will soon
begin the process to try and upgrade the county into a special municipality  now
that its population has topped 2 million.</P>
      <P>Wu said that as of 5 p.m. Monday, the county's population has reached 2,003,078,
making it eligible to be upgraded into a municipality directly under the control
of the central government according to the Local Government Act.</P>
      <P>"I want to share the good news with the residents of Taoyuan County," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu said he will soon begin preparations for filing an application to upgrade the
county and will consult with related  central government agencies on the
upgraded county's personnel, organization and budget.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County's population had remained at between 1.97 million and 1.98
million until a few months ago, when the county government offered a spate of
generous incentives, including more than NT$2,000 in cash per person, coupons
and prize drawings to encourage people from outside the county to register their
households in Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>Those who move their registration to the county before 5 p.m. Wednesday will
still be eligible for the incentives, a county official said.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan City Mayor Su Chia-ming said that he had originally set a target of
having 2,000 more people register the households in the city and never expected
that more than 6,000 would actually do so.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan  County  pursued  the  move  aggressively  because administrative
districts  classified  as special municipalities received a much bigger share of
funds and resources from the central government than regular counties or cities.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed slightly lower Tuesday after a tug of war between
bargain hunters and market pessimists amid concerns over the pace of the global
economic recovery, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index closed down 5.84 points, or 0.08 percent, at 7,151.99, after
fluctuating between 7,128.92 and 7,179.14, on turnover of NT$85.10 billion
(US$2.62 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened 0.22 percent lower on Wall Street's continued weakness
overnight, but bargain hunting during the trading session offset earlier losses
as investors saw regional markets such as Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea
stabilize after Monday's sell-off, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,596 stocks closed higher, while 1,168 lost ground and 372 remained
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The foodstuff sector scored the biggest gains, rising 3.2 percent. The textile
sector closed up 1.5 percent, the plastics and chemical sector rose 0.8 percent
and the cement sector added 0.7 percent.</P>
      <P>The construction sector closed up 0.6 percent and the financial sector 0.3
percent higher, while the machinery and electronics sector fell 0.6 percent and
the paper and pulp sector lost 0.5 percent.</P>
      <P>"After yesterday's slump, some investors took advantage of reduced valuations,
serving as a force to stabilize the local bourse today," said MasterLink
Securities analyst Tom Tang. said.</P>
      <P>Bargain hunters scrambled to pick up "China-concept stocks" which have close
business ties with the mainland, Tang said.</P>
      <P>"While investors have been worried that rising wages in China would hurt
Taiwanese investors there, the higher pay could translate into higher purchasing
power on the mainland," Tang said.</P>
      <P>Based on this possibility, "food makers and retailers that operate on the
mainland appeared attractive and became today's favorites, "Tang said.</P>
      <P>Wei-Chuan Foods rose 6.87 percent to NT$35.80, while computer product retailer
Tsann Kuen Enterprise gained 4.79 percent to reach NT$61.20.</P>
      <P>However, Tang said turnover remained thin, indicating that many investors
preferred to stay on the sidelines as no quick solutions to the debt problems in
Europe are expected to emerge.</P>
      <P>"It will be a good policy to be cautious and keep as much cash as possible now,"
he said.</P>
      <P>The flat panel company AU Optronics fell 0.84 percent to NT$29.40, although it
recorded record high shipments of its large sized panels in May.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. dropped 1.18 percent to NT$58.50 and

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei-based First Bank placed a "charity" order with the Pingtung county
government in southern Taiwan Tuesday for 35 metric tons of locally grown
bananas, the price of which has slumped again this season due to a production
glut.</P>
      <P>First Bank Vice President Chou Poh-chiao placed the order with the Pingtung
Banana Farmers Association via the county government at a press conference to
mark the charity purchase.</P>
      <P>Chou said at the press conference that First Bank has been around for 110 years
and has witnessed Taiwan's economic take-off, as well as its transition from an
agrarian to an industrial economy.</P>
      <P>He said that as a member of Taiwanese society, First Bank decided to purchase
the bananas to help tide Pingtung banana farmers over their financial
difficulties.</P>
      <P>The fruit will be distributed to First Bank employees, clients, and two
Pingtung-based charity organizations, he added.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-sheng, a Pingtung county councilor, said he was told by a banana
farmer two weeks ago that the wholesale price of Pingtung bananas had plummeted
to NT$6 per kilo, a price so low that the farmers cannot even harvest them for
sale to the public, but instead, just cut them down for pig feed.</P>
      <P>Tai Hsin-hsieh,  a banana farmer  who spoke at the press conference, said his
production cost is NT$10 per kilo and he expressed gratitude to First Bank for
offering NT$7.3 per kilo for the purchase of the 35 tons of fruit.</P>
      <P>"Although the offering is still lower than cost, it is better than the NT$6
wholesale price," Tai noted.</P>
      <P>According to Wu Szu-ping, a deputy chief of the Agriculture and Food Agency's
southern Taiwan office, the agency began a week earlier to purchase bananas of
lower-than-average quality at NT$5 per kilo. So far, 235 tons have been bought
islandwide, with 112 tons harvested in Pingtung, he noted.</P>
      <P>The southern Pingtung and Kaohsiung counties are major spring banana production
areas in Taiwan, while the central Taichung and Nantou counties are production
bases for autumn bananas, according to the agency.</P>
      <P>Pingtung County, the largest banana-producing county in Taiwan, produces about
50,000 metric tons of spring bananas each year from a combined area of over
3,000 hectares, according to the county government.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese student Lin Po-yi, part of a bridge team that won an international
bridge tournament in New Zealand in late May, said fighting stress was the key
to victory when talking about the event publicly for the first time Monday.</P>
      <P>The six-student Taiwanese team led by Lin, a sophomore at National Chiao Tung
University, swept Australia, Japan and New Zealand in the final round robin to
win the under-21 category of the 47th Pacific Asia Bridge Federation
Championships on May 30.</P>
      <P>Lin said that although winning the competition had earned him recognition and
honor, his real benefit came from having the chance to compete against other
players from around the world.</P>
      <P>Although most competitors in the tournament had high skill levels, Lin said he
quickly realized the event was essentially a mental challenge where each player
was his own biggest enemy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An unprecedented "Taiwan World Cup" initiated by a Taiwan-based British
investment banker will take place on June 16 in Taipei to cash in on the
spotlight of the real World Cup that opens in South Africa Friday.</P>
      <P>The one-day tournament -- the brainchild of Russell Curtis -- will bring
together 16 teams composed of citizens from 20 countries residing in Taipei's
Ying Feng Riverside Park.</P>
      <P>Actually, it already tried last Saturday, but rain forced the event to be
postponed to June 16.</P>
      <P>For Curtis, organizing the event was a natural extension of his passion for the
game. "I love football. It's my life, " he told the Central News Agency in an
interview.</P>
      <P>Putting the event together, however, has not been easy because there are fewer
football fans and standard fields in Taiwan than in western countries.</P>
      <P>"It was most difficult to get the pitch. We wanted it for two days but could
only get it for one day, " Curtis said, which forced him to cut the original
field from 25 teams down to 16 teams so that the event could be completed in a
single day.</P>
      <P>The 16 teams in the 7-a-side tournament, including a European Union team that
consists of players from Germany, Denmark and the Czech  Republic,  are composed
of people  of many  different nationalities from all walks of life -- students,
English teachers, bankers, business executives and even millionaires.</P>
      <P>"In England or the U.S., you'll never be with these people because you have a
different status. It's like Terry Gou playing football with you," Curtis said of
the unusual phenomenon.</P>
      <P>To give the tournament a genuine feel, Curtis has invested more than NT$100,000
in prize money and to hire professional referees, tents and a PA system.</P>
      <P>A set of rules were also established, including requiring each team to present
their national anthem before each match, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Curtis, everyone is motivated, with some teams even preparing the
same uniforms that their national teams will wear at the FIFA World Cup in South
Africa.</P>
      <P>But he also wondered if the passion could be taken to excess, worrying that if
everyone gets too serious, they might not be able to enjoy the game and have
fun.</P>
      <P>If the investment banker has any regrets, aside from losing some of his
investment to the rainout on Saturday, it is that more Taiwanese teams did not
sign up.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Citibank raises forecast for Taiwan's economic growth to 7 percent</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 8 (CNA)

(By Cheng Yun-hsuan and Frances Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Citibank on Tuesday upgraded its forecast of Taiwan's economic growth for 2010
from 5 percent to 7 percent, largely on the country's strong export performance.</P>
      <P>Cheng Cheng Mount, chief economist at Citibank Taiwan, said the higher gross
domestic product (GDP) growth prediction also reflected a recovery in domestic
investments and an increase in government spending.</P>
      <P>In addition, the world economy is on the road to recovery, with global demand
picking up, he said.</P>
      <P>The forecast put Taiwan in second place among the four Asian tigers in terms of
projected growth rate, behind Singapore's 9 percent, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Citibank said it expects South Korea to achieve a GDP growth of 5.2 percent for
2010, and Hong Kong 4.7 percent.</P>
      <P>In May, Taiwan posted a record high export figure of US$25.54 billion, which was
an increase of 57.9 percent year-on-year, as shipments of high tech products
soared on strong global demand.</P>
      <P>In the first five months of this year, Taiwan's exports totaled US$109.26
billion, up 52.7 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>With global demand on the rise, many local firms have been expanding their
production capacity,  boosting overall domestic investments, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's fixed investments for 2010 are expected to rise 13.6 percent
from a year earlier, while local consumption is projected to increase 2.2
percent from 2009 as consumers are likely to spend more, encouraged by an
economic recovery.</P>
      <P>Cheng forecast a 2010 unemployment rate of 5.4 percent, compared to 5.85 percent
in 2009, saying that the rate will drop as manufacturing companies continue to
hire.</P>
      <P>However, because the new job openings are concentrated in the high tech sector,
not all job seekers will benefit from the improvement in the job market, he
said.</P>
      <P>In May, the government raised its 2010 GDP growth forecast from 4.72 percent to
6.14 percent after Taiwan posted a 13.27 percent economic growth for the first
quarter of this year, which was the highest since the third quarter of 1978.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan will request that legislators hold a special session during
their summer recess to consider some urgent legislation, Premier Wu Den-yih said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The request could be raised as soon as late June if a proposed economic

a proposed amendment to the Disaster Prevention and Protection Act, which will
help boost the government's preparedness for the coming typhoon season,
according to the premier.</P>
      <P>He explained  that the amendment  will mainly involve the reorganization of the
National Fire Agency into a disaster prevention and rescue agency, the division
of labor between local and central governments, and listing disaster prevention
and rescue as part of the military's core missions.</P>

      <P>Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation (TRTC) has launched a one-year pilot program to
make the poles in subway cars easier to grip and more visible to prevent slips
and falls, the company said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The pilot program is being run in one train on the Danshui MRT line. Poles in
the train's cars have been wrapped in a fluorescent orange rubber material that
TRTC said provides a better grip for standing passengers.</P>
      <P>The color contrast with the rest of the car also makes the poles easier to see
and will keep passengers from banging into them, TRTC said.</P>
      <P>The company is launching the test as part of an overall campaign to improve MRT
safety, comfort and reliability started in 2006. Since then, train floors, seats
and handrails on large-capacity MRT lines have been upgraded and public
announcement systems improved.</P>
      <P>The most recent attempt to improve safety was based on methods in place in Hong
Kong and Atlanta's subway systems, which have bright colored-rubber  material
on poles that produce  strong visual contrasts.</P>
      <P>TRTC said that if the pilot program goes well, it will consider adhering  the
fluorescent  rubber  material  to all poles  on high-capacity lines.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will help Taiwanese businesses move
research and development  (R&amp;D) operations from China back to Taiwan as part
of efforts to sharpen competitiveness, a ministry official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Helping sharpen China-based Taiwanese businesses' competitiveness is one of the
ministry's most urgent tasks in the face of rising minimum wages, said Ling
Chia-yuh, director of the MOEA's Department of Investment Services.</P>
      <P>The rising minimum wages have been attributed to a spate of suicides at
Foxconn's factory in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, one of the largest
electronics manufacturing plants in the world.</P>
      <P>Ling's remarks echoed those made a day earlier by Minister of Economic Affairs
Shih Yen-shiang, who said that in light of China's changing minimum wage
standards, the MOEA would like to see Taiwanese producers of high-end products
in China relocate to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ling said the ministry is organizing a 2010 summit on Taiwan investment by
Taiwanese funds or companies that operate outside Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The meeting, slated for June 15 in Taipei, is aimed at informing Taiwanese
businesspeople  operating  in China of new business opportunities after Taiwan
and China sign an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), Ling said.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's domestic industrial sector will be forced to upgrade after the
signing of the ECFA, a development he said will improve Taiwan's investment
climate and decrease the unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that after the summit, China-based Taiwanese companies will know
how to effectively grasp business opportunities in the post-ECFA era, accelerate
their industrial upgrading and move their R&amp;D operations back to Taiwan,"
Ling said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) , the world's second largest contract
chipmaker, said Tuesday its May sales hit a 30-month high on the back of strong
demand for consumer electronics products.</P>
      <P>UMC said it posted NT$10.09 billion (US$311.2 million) in sales for May, up 8.27
percent from April. The May figure was the highest level since November 2007 and
was up 34.28 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>Sales growth also reflected a recovery in average selling prices of products,
the company said in a statement.</P>
      <P>The chipmaker said production capacity of its eight-inch and 12-inch wafer
plants has been fully utilized to meet the rising demand from a global economic
recovery.</P>
      <P>"It was no surprise to see UMC record sales growth under the current market
conditions, " TLG Asset Management analyst Arch Shih said.</P>
      <P>"The full capacity utilization is expected to continue to the third quarter of
this year as inventories of UMC's customers remain at an acceptable level," Shih
said.</P>
      <P>However, Shih said as uncertainty over the European debt crisis still haunts the
world's economy, "it remains to be seen whether chipmakers, like UMC, will see
full capacity in the fourth quarter once the weakening euro compromises
consumption."</P>
      <P>Shih said that is why UMC and rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
(TSMC) have encountered higher selling pressure on the local stock market
recently amid such cautious sentiment.</P>
      <P>UMC shares fell 1.41 percent to NT$14.00 and TSMC lost 1.18 percent to NT$58.50
Tuesday, while the weighted index closed down 0.08 percent, at 7,151.99 points.</P>

      <P>Chairperson of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Tsai Ing-wen called on the
public Tuesday to vote in the June 12 local elections so as to help the
opposition party maintain a strong presence in the country's grass-roots
politics.</P>
      <P>"This is a critical battle and a historical mission in terms of the DPP's
efforts to deepen democracy in Taiwan," Tsai said at a news conference at which
the party's candidates for Saturday's local elections were presented.</P>
      <P>The polls will be held June 12 in 17 cities and counties across Taiwan to elect
village chiefs and township representatives.</P>
      <P>"At some point in Taiwan's democratic  development,  local government and public
service will become much more important because they are directly related to the
people's interests," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>She said this trend is more likely to develop after the creation of five special
municipalities at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, the June 12 elections will have a great impact on the country's
democratic progress, and DPP supporters must vote for the party to help it
expand its influence in grass-roots politics, " she urged.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the DPP is aiming to win a total of 1,000 seats in Saturday's
polls and in the Nov. 27 elections for borough chiefs in the five special
municipalities, in order to safeguard Taiwan's democracy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Control Yuan resolved Tuesday to ask the Constitutional Court to rule on the
constitutionality of the way the country's prosecutor-general is appointed.</P>
      <P>In its resolution, the Control Yuan said the method of appointing the
prosecutor-general -- named by the president and approved by the Legislative
Yuan for a single  four-year  term --  might be unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>The resolution said the method infringes on the authority of the premier, who is
the head of the executive branch, and of the minister of justice, who heads the
country's prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Under the existing appointment method, the resolution says, it is unclear who is
the superior of the prosecutor-general in the administration, which breaches the
rules regarding the division of power.</P>
      <P>Also, the resolution says, under the Code of Criminal Procedure, anyone who
files a criminal complaint with the prosecutors can request the prosecutors'
superior to reconsider a ruling to not indict an accused.</P>
      <P>However, if the original ruling is made by prosecutors of the Supreme
Prosecutors Office -- a move that was not possible prior to the establishment of
a special investigation division under the prosecutor-general as the Supreme
Prosecutors Office was tasked only with reviewing lower prosecutors office
ruling and did not issue its own indictments -- there is no further recourse for
the complainant, as there is no superior office to review it, according to the
resolution.</P>
      <P>The Constitutional Court should determine to whom the complainant can apply for
reconsideration of such cases, the resolution says.</P>
      <P>The anomalies were exposed during a Control Yuan investigation into former
Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming's association with people listed as witnesses
or suspects in prominent criminal cases.</P>
      <P>Chen quit Jan. 19 after being impeached by the Control Yuan as a result of that

    <TEXT>
      <P>Over 50 Taiwanese activists Tuesday added their voice to worldwide condemnation
of Israel's alleged violence on the Gaza Strip, demanding Israel stop impeding
the international effort to supply humanitarian aid to the region.</P>
      <P>Led by the Labor Rights Association, demonstrators gathered in front of the
Taipei World Trade Center building, which houses several foreign representative
offices, including the Israel Economic and Cultural Office (ISECO).</P>
      <P>"What Israel is doing to the Palestinians is systematic murder. Over 70 percent
of the people in the Gaza Strip have no food or water and this is all because
Israel has refused to allow them to live, " said Wang Chun-ping, the
association's executive director.</P>
      <P>Holding up placards and banners, the protesters shouted "Free Free Palestine"
and called Israeli officials "liars" and "killers."</P>
      <P>The group also accused the Taiwanese government and the public of standing idly
by while conflicts continue to flare in the war-torn region.</P>
      <P>A New Zealand man named Sean Kaiteri said it is ironic that the Jewish people
are now oppressing another race when not too long ago they were the victims of
persecution.</P>
      <P>A minor scuffle with the police erupted when the ISECO refused to accept a
petition letter from the protesters. The group was ordered to disperse because
the demonstration was in violation of the Assembly and Parade Act, the police
said.</P>
      <P>"I instructed my people not to go down to meet the protesters because we refuse
to be part of a staged demonstration. If the protesters were truly interested in
a dialogue, they could make an appointment, " Israeli Representative Rafael
Gamzou told the Central News Agency by telephone.</P>
      <P>The Israeli representative categorically denied any disaster, hunger, or human
atrocity in the Gaza Strip and asked the world to turn its attention to the
Hamas government, which he said is abusing its own people by depriving them of
supplies provided by the international community, including Israel.</P>
      <P>On May 31, nine Turkish citizens died and several were injured during a raid by
Israeli commandos on a Gaza-bound aid ship. The incident  sparked  international
outrage  against  the Israeli government.</P>
      <P>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his soldiers acted out of self-
defense and that all donated goods will reach the Gaza region after a thorough
security inspection by Israeli forces.</P>
      <P>UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for a multinational probe into the
clash, but was rebuffed by Israel.</P>
      <P>Calling the protesters  in Taiwan "victims  of propaganda" perpetuated by Hamas,
Gamzou said the allegations against his country were groundless.</P>
      <P>"Where were these self-declared peace lovers and human rights champions when
Israeli citizens were being shelled every day by the Hamas? I never once heard
them open their mouths in defense of the innocent Israeli people," Gamzou said.</P>
      <P>The representative, however, stressed that many Taiwanese friends have expressed
their support for Israel and said the protesters were "in the minority." (By

      <P>At a promotional event for the Taiwan Culinary Exhibition (TEC) that will open
Aug. 27, Tourism Bureau Director Janice Lai said that local cuisine has become
the highlight of the travel experience for many visitors to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, the bureau said, it is organizing the 2010 TEC, which will

    <DATELINE>06/08/10  20:05:04</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thanks to Taiwanese pastry chef Wu Pao-chun, dried lychees have become so
popular that Taiwan's farmers have not been able to meet increasing demand from
domestic and foreign bakeries.</P>
      <P>Dried lychees were one of the ingredients Wu used in making a "Taiwan-style"
bread at the 2010 Bakery World Cup in France, where he won the title of Master
Baker in the bread category.</P>
      <P>Since Wu's victory in March and his disclosure of his recipe, orders of dried
lychees from local bakery shops have totaled over 10,000 kilograms, according to
Wu.</P>
      <P>With supply falling short of demand, Wu said local farmers limited Japanese
importers to an order for 1,000 kilograms.</P>
      <P>"That will definitely not be enough to meet Japanese needs," said Wu, who was
invited by a flour company to visit Tokyo on June 20 and share his know-how with
hundreds of representatives from bakeries in Japan.</P>
      <P>The pastry chef pointed out that many people in Japan, South Korea, Singapore
and Malaysia love the flavor of lychees.</P>
      <P>"The government should do more to combine bakery expertise with local farmers to
promote Taiwanese fruit exports," Wu said.</P>
      <P>For example, Wu said, the government could take actions to ensure a stable
quality and supply of the fruit.</P>
      <P>Some local lychees have excess pesticide residue, which could prevent them from
meeting Japanese standards. If the government can work around this issue,  it
would greatly  benefit  both the agricultural and baking industries, Wu said.</P>
      <P>"What I can do is develop good recipes that combine local ingredients with
international baking techniques, and I think that is meaningful," said Wu, who
was also a winner of the Louis Lesaffre Cup in 2007 and a silver medalist in the
2008 Bakery World Cup's team competition.</P>
      <P>In addition to lychees, Wu said he is developing new bakery products using
Taiwanese pineapples, bananas and oranges.</P>
      <P>"I have special feelings toward pineapples, because my late mother used to plant
pineapples in Pingtung, " Wu said, adding that he wants to develop breads, jams
and cakes featuring the juicy fruit.</P>
      <P>While the government is taking various measures to boost banana sales to help
local farmers cope with a price drop, Wu noted that bananas, with chocolates,
are ideal ingredients for making tasty Viennese pastries.</P>
      <P>"It may take me some time to develop a successful recipe. But once I've done it,
I will teach others the following day," he said.</P>
      <P>Wu said that he is not afraid of sharing his knowledge with other pastry chefs,
which he described as a kind of self-cleaning process. "I can start learning new
things after I return myself to zero."</P>
      <P>Wu, who first made his name in Kaohsiung and now works in a bakery in Taipei,
said he plans to open his own shop in Kaohsiung by the end of July -- after the
arrival of an advanced German oven that will cost him about NT$1.7 million
(US$52,000) , almost triple the price of a high-end local oven -- to ensure the
bread's moisture and flavor.</P>
      <P>For the time being, Wu said that he is not in a hurry to open more shops in
Taiwan. "I need to be 100 percent sure that the product quality will be the same
before I open my second bakery."</P>
      <P>Wu also said he has turned down many investment offers from China because he
believes only a wholly-owned bakery can grant him the freedom he needs to
develop his baking arts.</P>
      <P>"I want to open a bakery with products that taste so good people from Taipei or
Taichung will take a high-speed rail, or people in China or Japan will take a
flight, just to visit, " Wu said with confidence. By Fanny Liu, CNA staff writer</P>

      <P>India has officially recognized the degrees issued by Taiwan's 167 universities
and colleges, said Taiwan's representative to India, Ong Wenchyi, Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ong said that the Association of India Universities (AIU) during a visit to
Taipei in early March signed a memorandum of understanding with the Federation
of Cooperation in Higher Education of Taiwan to pave the way for mutual
recognition of each other's university degrees.</P>
      <P>The AIU at its board of trustees meeting on May 27 completed a case-by-case
screening process and decided to accept all the 167 Taiwanese universities'
academic degrees.</P>
      <P>That means Taiwanese people applying to study for advanced degrees in India, and
Indian nationals applying to study in Taiwan will have their university degrees
recognized.</P>
      <P>India's 497 universities and colleges enrolled about 3 million students
annually, and about 500,000 of their graduates pursued higher education in the
United States, Canada, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and other countries.</P>
      <P>Ong said the move will help boost the number of Indian students enrolling in
Taiwan's university campuses. Currently, only 500 Indian students are enrolled
in Taiwan's universities.</P>
      <P>Ong said that his office  is prepared  to help Taiwanese universities  hold
enrollment  promotion  seminars in India in September, to attract more Indian
students to study in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ong said his office will organize a large scale joint promotion
campaign in New Delhi next year, and called on the Taiwanese universities which
are interested in attracting Indian students to better prepare themselves by
opening more courses with English as the language of instruction.</P>

      <P>A British man who concealed his record of conviction for sex crimes to enter
Taiwan was arrested by police and turned over to the National Immigration Agency
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Detectives from the Criminal Investigation Bureau, acting on a May 17 tip-off
from Interpol, tracked down the man, whose name was not divulged to protect his
privacy, in Taipei earlier that day.</P>
      <P>According to a press release issued by the bureau, the 66-year old from Wales
was formerly a primary school teacher in the United Kingdom. He was sentenced in
Britain to two years in jail in 1988 for having sex with a 16-year-old boy and
sentenced to community service in 2002 for imposing corporal punishment on two 8
-year-old children.</P>
      <P>The man arrived in Taiwan in October 2002 and has lived here ever since, working
as an English teacher at cram schools with students aged between 5 and 11,
according to the press release.</P>
      <P>There were no reports of any students at these cram schools, or children living
in the man's neighborhood, of having fallen victim to him, according to the
police.</P>
      <P>The man breached the Immigration Act by entering Taiwan without disclosing his
criminal record and will be expelled if he is not found to have been otherwise
involved in any crimes here, according to the police.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese would rather be farmers than own mansions: poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More Taiwanese want to be farmers than own mansions, according to a survey by a
local business weekly.</P>
      <P>"That tells me people value a spiritual life, and want to sustain a life on
their own, " said Liou Wei-gong, an associate professor of sociology at Soochow
University in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The survey, published in Business Today's May 24 issue, found that of 1,183
respondents over 21 years old, 5.1 percent said they dreamt of being farmers,
while only 2.5 percent dreamt of owning a mansion.</P>
      <P>The first choice was being a billionaire (21.6 percent), followed by traveling
around the world (19.2 percent) and retiring early (15.6 percent).</P>
      <P>Other top 10 dreams included starting a business (9.6 percent) , owning a shop
such as a cafe or a restaurant (6.9 percent), studying abroad (2.9 percent) ,
living overseas (2.1 percent) and taking advanced or personal-interest courses
(2 percent).</P>
      <P>Liou said the poll suggested there might be a potential market as people want to
learn more after they graduate.</P>
      <P>Men and women, however, have different ideas about their dreams. While wealth
lead men's lists at 24.9 percent, traveling around the world was top on women's
lists at 24.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Clark Lin, the project manager handling the survey, said another major
difference between genders is that women are more interested in pursuing further
studies. Both studying abroad and taking courses were among women's top 10
dreams, and neither of the two made it in men's list.</P>
      <P>"The result showed women are more into self-development, while men seek a good
material life," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said being married or not is also an important factor. He said more
unmarried people would like to study more, while married people wanted to retire
early or become a farmer.</P>
      <P>The magazine said the survey was conducted between April 30 and May 3, with a
margin of error of plus or minus 2.85 percentage points and a confidence level
of 95 percent.</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Tuesday that the avoidance of double
taxation will not be discussed at the fifth round of cross-strait talks, which
will only address the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) and an
intellectual property rights agreement.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said that the exact dates of the meeting between
Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation, and
his Chinese counterpart, Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
President Chen Yunlin, has not been decided.</P>
      <P>She added, however, that "we still hope the fifth Chiang-Chen meeting will be
held in June."</P>
      <P>Lai also said that both sides will definitely hold a third round of ECFA talks,
but that they would not take place before June 10.</P>
      <P>While a draft trade pact may be expected during the third round of talks, the
pact's "early harvest" list, which includes items that will receive immediate
tariff reductions or exemptions or improved market access, may need a little
more time, she said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou observed World Oceans Day Tuesday in an activity
sponsored by the government that called for greater public awareness of the
significance of environmental protection and sustainable growth.</P>
      <P>Citing the concept of environmental protection broached by Mencius, a famous
philosopher born more than 2,000 years ago in China, Ma said it is vitally
important to conserve Taiwan's marine ecology to sustain Taiwan's development.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's people should know how to take advantage of the oceans and maritime
sources. Otherwise, the country's economy will not be able to survive, " he said
during an address at the opening of the World Oceans Day activity sponsored by
the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) and the Environmental Protection
Administration.</P>
      <P>"This is why I am urging the public to learn to swim and get closer to the sea,"
he explained.</P>
      <P>World Oceans Day was officially declared by the United Nations in 2009 and falls
on June 8. The concept was first proposed June 8, 1992 by Canada at the Earth
Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and has been unofficially celebrated every year
since then as World Ocean Day.</P>
      <P>The president also mentioned the idea of holding ocean-related international
meetings on Taiwan-held islands in the South China Sea as a means of asserting
Republic of China sovereignty over the islands.</P>
      <P>The CGA responded positively to Ma's demand, saying that last year, it already
held a `marine research committee' meeting with government officials and
academics on Dongsha Island to inspect Taiwan's offshore territory and promote
the government's marine policy.</P>
      <P>"In addition to Dongsha Island, the islands of Kinmen, Matsu and Taiping are
also being considered as meeting venues," the CGA said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Hai Group Chairman Terry Gou said Tuesday that investigations by Chinese
authorities have found none of the 10 suicides at his group's Shenzhen complex
in Guangdong province had anything to do with the working conditions there.</P>
      <P>Guo said at the group's shareholders meeting that Chinese authorities sent a
team of 200-odd officials to conduct a 10-day on-site investigation into the
reasons behind the incidents at the Shenzhen complex, where over 400,000 people
are employed.</P>
      <P>"I told the Chinese  investigators  they should detain me immediately if I am
found guilty, but they should clear me of the accusations if I am not," Gou
said.</P>
      <P>Gou, took more than 200 reporters on a tour to show them the conditions at the
company's Shenzhen complex in China on May 25 after the ninth worker at Foxconn
-- as Hon Hai is known in China -- jumped to his death from the company's
factory building in Shenzhen earlier that day.</P>
      <P>The next day, another Foxconn worker jumped to his death, bringing the total
number of suicides to 10 and the number of attempts to 12 and fueling criticism
that Gou is "running a blood and sweat factory."</P>
      <P>"It's regrettable that after touring the Shenzhen complex, many journalists
still tried to demonize me and Hong Hai rather than find out the truth," Gou
said.</P>
      <P>Guo said that after a thorough investigation, the Chinese officials did not
"detain" him, which meant that Hon Hai was not at fault.</P>
      <P>"None of the 12 suicide attempts at the Shenzhen complex were a result of poor
working conditions or low salaries as has been alleged," Guo said.</P>
      <P>He said he would not rule out the possibility of suing the media organizations
or journalists for their groundless reports.</P>
      <P>Citing surveys in China, he said more than 100 million people in China suffer
from various types of mental disorders and 16 million of them are categorized as
being in "serious condition".</P>
      <P>Based on these statistics, Gou said, the percentage of attempted suicides among
Foxconn's 450,000 workers in Shenzhen is substantially lower than the percentage
of mentally ill people in China's total population.</P>
      <P>As part of the group's efforts to stem the suicide attempts, it will stop
offering compensation of 10 years salary to the families of suicide victims, Guo
said.</P>
      <P>The decision was made after one of the workers who attempted suicide was found
to have told his family in a suicide note that the company will pay them a large
sum if he succeeded in killing himself, according to Kuo.</P>
      <P>In the last week, Hong Hai has announced two pay raises for its workers in
China, which would bring their monthly salaries from 900 yuan to 2,000 yuan.</P>

      <P>A pocket of marine life off the coast of Taiwan's southeastern Green Island has
recovered from damage caused by a shipwreck in 1992, a diver said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"It's spectacular, " local diving coach Yu Ming-hong said after diving in the
area of the sunken ship. Yu said that coral and fish have returned to a two-
hectare radius area that local people had said was lifeless since the accident.</P>
      <P>A Greek cargo ship hit a rock and sank near Green Island on Nov. 9, 1992,
leaking oil and wreaking havoc on the oceanic ecosystem in the area. When the
14,000 ton ship broke apart and sank into the sea, parts of the ship crushed
coral reefs, the main habitat of marine life.</P>
      <P>The wreckage now functions as protection, he said.</P>
      <P>"I cannot believe a past disaster scene has become a heaven, " Yu said, adding
that he had seen more than 10 kinds of coral and various fish.</P>
      <P>Yu said that although the wreckage provides a habitat for fish, some of the
debris remains a threat to coral as it tumbles in strong currents during
typhoons. He said the debris should be removed to assure the safety of the
precious sea area.</P>

      <P>The Taipei District Court ruled Tuesday that former President Chen Shui-bian is
not guilty of embezzling funds that were earmarked for diplomatic missions.</P>
      <P>A panel of three judges said in their judgment that the prosecutors from the
Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office failed to
prove in their indictment that Chen had siphoned off any of the funds.</P>
      <P>Chen was indicted Sept. 22, 2009 for withholding US$30,000 from a sum of
US$100,000 given to him by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for discretionary
spending during each of his 11 overseas trips as president between August 2000
and September 2006.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors charged in the indictment that Chen wired the funds -- a total
of US$330,000 -- to his son Chen Chih-chung, who was studying in the United
States at the time.</P>
      <P>But the judges dismissed the indictment as "a shoddy mishmash of evidence
without a morsel of credibility."</P>
      <P>They said the prosecutors contradicted themselves by claiming in their
indictment that the spending of the allowances was "totally under the control of
the Foreign Ministry and the president had no say in the matter, " but in the
same breath, the indictment said that "the allowances were meant to finance the
president's unexpected spending on state affairs."</P>
      <P>The judges also criticized the prosecutors  for using the testimony of Wu Wang-
hsia, mother of ex-first lady Wu Shu-jen, against her daughter, despite being
fully aware that Wu Wang-hsia was not of sound mind and actually misidentified
her son as her husband occasionally in her deposition.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the judges said, there were long gaps between the times Chen Shui-
bian wired funds to Chen Chih-chung and the times he allegedly embezzled the
diplomatic funds, making the prosecutors' claims that the ex-president used the
diplomatic funds to finance his son's studies in the United States "utterly
unbelievable."</P>
      <P>Prosecutor-General Huang Shyh-ming, who is the immediate superior of the Special
Investigation Division, said he would examine the judgment very carefully after
receiving it and that he will appeal to the high court if he finds it to be not
well-grounded.</P>
      <P>The case is only one of four criminal cases in which Chen Shui-bian is involved.
The former president, who has been detained since Dec. 30, 2008, was sentenced
to life imprisonment Sept. 11, 2009 in another corruption case.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved Tuesday the nominations of four members of the
National Communications Commission (NCC) . With more than half of its seven
commissioners replaced this time, the NCC is in effect entering a new stage.</P>
      <P>Looking back over the past two years, we have seen a spate of complaints filed
by the private sector against the NCC. This shows that the NCC was creating
disputes more than it was resolving problems, and its performance failed to win
the trust and respect of most communications business operators.</P>
      <P>The other controversy surrounding the NCC was the alleged existence of
"factions" within the organization, which allowed a small number of members to
control the NCC's policy.</P>
      <P>These controversies must not be repeated. With reports of "internal maneuvering"
emerging ahead of the Aug. 1 election for the NCC chairmanship and vice

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Are wage hikes irreversible trend in China?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/09/10  10:36:11
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wage hikes across China's manufacturing and service sectors will be an
irreversible trend, the founder of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (also known as
Foxconn Technology Group) predicted Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Terry Gou further forecast that the upward pressure on wages will be much faster
and steeper than many have expected because China's social structure is
undergoing dramatic changes.</P>
      <P>The 59-year-old Gou said Foxconn's decision to more than double its assembly-
line workers' wages in China is simply a harbinger of things to come. "A
butterfly effect is hatching and Foxconn will be the bellwether of the high wage
trend in China, " he predicted.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Gou said at a shareholders meeting in Taipei that Foxconn Group, which has a
work force of 800,000 in China and accounted for 4 percent of China's total
exports last year, began to raise the salaries of its employees in the fourth
quarter of 2009.</P>
      <P>"As the transitional period of the wage adjustment will take three to nine
months, the pay hike will therefore have limited effects on the group's earnings
for this year, " Gou told Hon Hai shareholders confidently.</P>
      <P>The salary adjustment effect may become more evident in the first half of next
year when the electronics industry hits its off-peak season, he acknowledged.</P>
      <P>"But you would be underestimating our group's adaptability if you think that the
pay raises will eat up all of our earnings, " Gou said.</P>
      <P>The adjustment of the basic monthly salary for Foxconn employees at its Shenzhen
factories in southern China to 2,000 yuan is a reasonable move in consideration
of consumption levels there, he noted.</P>
      <P>In the future, workers at the group's factory complexes in other parts of China,
such as Kunshan and Shandong, will all receive similar pay raises.</P>
      <P>Although most major electronics companies have said they will not follow the
lead of Foxconn in raising wages for their workers in China, Gou said he
believes adjusting wages will not just be a "problem for Foxconn."</P>
      <P>"I'm convinced that our move will definitely have a nationwide effect in China,"
he said. (June 9. 2010).</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>After Foxconn  and Japan-based  Honda Co.  raised salaries significantly for
workers at their factories in China, many of their Taiwanese peers are worrying
that they will be forced to follow suit.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese business executives in Kunshan in China's Jiangsu province said
Tuesday they had not expected that the need to hike wages would have come so
quickly.</P>
      <P>A wave of strikes to force pay raises has spread from the Pearl River Delta in
southern China to the Yangtze River Delta in central China.</P>
      <P>Workers at a Honda-affiliated auto parts plant in Foshan City went on strike
Monday to demand a pay raise after their peers at a Honda plant in the same area
got a wage increase in the wake of a two-week strike recently.</P>
      <P>Last weekend,  nearly 1,000 employees at Taiwan-owned  KOK Machinery Co. in
Kunshan also went on strike in an attempt to force a pay raise. The stand-off
was exacerbated Monday and clashes erupted between workers and police forces.</P>
      <P>The recent labor protest movement opened the eyes of China's local governments
in the Yangtze River Delta,  and they took precautionary measures for fears of
affecting the ongoing World Expo in nearby Shanghai. (June 9, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>A New York Times article said Tuesday China's wage hikes could be a mixed
picture for companies: higher costs but richer customers. According to the
paper, wage hikes in China will eventually impact the global economy, with
prices for all made-in-China products going up and fueling worldwide inflation.</P>
      <P>Even though wages only account for a small portion of overall product costs, the
supply chain will definitely be affected and retailers will have to raise
product prices.</P>
      <P>But not all people were pessimistic about the wage hikes in China. Albert
Keidel, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a U.S. think tank,
said wage hikes for workers would just transfer part of corporate profits to
wages and would not necessary fuel price hikes. (June 9, 2010).</P>

      <P>The chairman of the Taiwan Friendship Group in the European Parliament expressed
support Tuesday for the signing of a proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Charles Tannock said his group supported any initiative to improve the cross-

trade pact.</P>
      <P>The group also commended the two sides for expanding their mutual economic and

Tannock said at a cocktail party to welcome David Lin, Taiwan's new

      <P>Tannock also reiterated the European Parliament's support for Taiwan's bid to
participate in international organizations, such as the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, and he urged the EU to offer similar support.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's bid to get visa exemption from the EU, the parliamentarian said
he believes the European Commission, the union's executive body, will deliver a

      <P>At the event, Lin thanked his host for the Friendship Group's support and
stressed that links between the EU and Taiwan are close and important, noting

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Up to Beijing to untie the knot</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/09/10  11:04:38
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Zhang  Mingqing,  a vice  president  of the  Beijing-based semi-official
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, recently agreed that the
"integration theory" is one of the important approaches to allow for the
peaceful development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>According to the theory put forth by National Taiwan University political
science professor Chang Ya-chung, there are three entities across the strait:
the Republic of China, the People's Republic of China, and the entire China.
Both Taiwan and the mainland are part of the whole China.</P>
      <P>Zhang's response indicates that Beijing is trying to adjust its cross-strait
policy.</P>
      <P>First, Beijing seems to have accepted "one China" as a third entity transcending
the ROC and the PRC. Second, Beijing obviously has realized that the "ROC" is an
issue that it has to face up to.</P>
      <P>There are many things Chinese authorities can do, such as removing the
parentheses used for "legislators" and the "president" of Taiwan in news
reports, not avoiding ROC flags and official titles, and not blocking Taiwan's
bids to sign free trade agreements with other countries.</P>
      <P>Zhang's article deserves approval. However, it was Beijing that tied the knot,
and it is up to Beijing to untie it. (June 9, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Huckabee addresses Taiwan, U.S. issues in fundraiser</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
06/09/10  11:45:28
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee said U.S. policy on Taiwan-China
relations remains unchanged under the Obama administration and called for a new
brand of politics in the U.S., at a fundraiser in Taipei Tuesday night.</P>
      <P>The former governor,  who ran unsuccessfully for the 2008 Republican
presidential nomination, delivered a speech to around 350 guests, including
local politicians, businessmen and students from seven universities, at an event
called "An Evening with Governor Mike Huckabee."</P>
      <P>Asked about America's cross-Taiwan Strait policy in a question and answer
session, Huckabee refrained from elaboration or criticism, saying that domestic
issues and Afghanistan, Iraq, North Korea and Gaza are at the top of the current
administration's agenda.</P>
      <P>The Obama administration's position in the cross-Strait issue "hasn't been
radically different from past administrations, " he observed.</P>
      <P>Huckabee suggested, however, that there was a difference of mentality and
thinking between Americans and people across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>While Americans love to put everything on the table and work toward a
"timetable" and "a conclusion right now" to solve problems, he said, Taiwanese
and Chinese seem to be more patient by first asking "do we have peace? " and "do
we have the capacity to live without threats and war?"</P>
      <P>Huckabee reiterated his support for Taiwan, because it shares the same values
with the U.S. and has always been a strong U.S. ally.</P>
      <P>During his last visit in June 2006 when he was governor of Arkansas, a position
he held from 1996-2007, and chairman of the National Governors Association,
Huckabee met then-President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The association passed a resolution in 2003 supporting Taiwan's bid to become an
observer in the World Health Assembly, and in 2005, Huckabee's state of Arkansas
passed a resolution recommending the signing of a Taiwan-U.S. free trade
agreement.</P>
      <P>According to Jack Hu, managing director of the visit's organizer the London
International Group, Huckabee decided to extend his stay in Taiwan to four days
and could meet President Ma Ying-jeou and officials from the National Security
Council.</P>
      <P>Huckabee met with Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and several legislators from
the ruling party Kuomintang Monday night.</P>
      <P>Currently hosting a weekly a weekend political talk show on Fox News Channel,
Huckabee quipped that he's recognized by people more often now than on the
campaign trail in 2008 because Americans "pay more attention to who's on the TV
than who's running the country."</P>
      <P>He did not say whether he will run again for the presidency in 2012 and insisted
that his relocation to Florida had nothing to do with politics, but he expressed
his belief that the Republicans will enjoy a "strong year."</P>
      <P>Huckabee addressed a wide range of topics in his speech, from education and
health care to the economy, and advocated "vertical politics, " saying that U.S.
politics should not be an issue of "left or right but up or down."</P>
      <P>"Barack Obama won in 2008 because he was a upward politician, " he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he expressed concerns over Obama's "inexperience and lack of
preparation" in governance, citing the latest poll on Obama's handling of the
Gulf of Mexico oil spill.</P>
      <P>The poll found that dissatisfaction with Obama is 9 percent higher than for
former U.S. President George Bush over his handling of the aftermath of
Hurricane Katrina, which was widely seen as a blow that weakened Bush's
presidency.</P>

    <DATELINE>06/09/10  12:05:09
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Speaking of the government's rising debt burden, Minister of Finance Lee Sush-
der recently said the government would be foolish if it does not use its full
debt limit.</P>
      <P>Lee's statement coincided with an attempt by the Executive Yuan to push through
an amendment to the Public Debt Act to raise the debt ceilings of local
governments. It is estimated that the change would increase the government's
combined allowable debt burden from 48 percent to 52 percent of the country's
gross national product, allowing an additional NT$600 billion in debt.</P>
      <P>Whenever the government's debt crisis is discussed, the minister always refers
to taking on more debt as a "fiscal strategy." This concept may be true in
managing a business but is not completely applicable when it comes to running a
government.</P>
      <P>Because of financial leverage, companies that do not take advantage of debt to
do business are indeed fools. The risks are limited because the worst that can
happen is for companies to lose their capital or assets.</P>
      <P>But taking on more debt carries a different meaning with a government. A country
is permanent, and the government cannot repudiate its debts but must repay them.
The people are not only the government's creditors but also debtors.</P>
      <P>The government does not necessarily have to become as smart as a business. A
more important issue is for the government to build up a steady and sustainable
ability to repay its debts. (June 9, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Shares of Hon Hai Precision Industry, the world's biggest contract electronics
maker, rebounded in heavy trading Wednesday after the company's chairman, Terry
Gou, painted a positive outlook at a shareholders meeting the previous day.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai climbed NT$3 (US$0.0925), or 2.7 percent, to NT$114.5 in mid-morning
trading before falling back to NT$113.5 in the early afternoon. Its shares have
plunged more than 10 percent in June and closed at NT$111.5 on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai shares have faced heavy selling recently from foreign institutional
investors, who sold more than NT$8 billion in Hon Hai shares on Tuesday. Sales
of Hon Hai shares accounted for over 70 percent of their share sales on the day.</P>
      <P>At Tuesday's shareholders meeting, Gou asked shareholders to remain confident in
the company's management and said he was not worried about the company's share
prices.</P>
      <P>"As long as the company's management team is sound, the products are good, and
the technologies are still there, there is definitely no need to worry about
share prices," he said.</P>
      <P>Gou also announced that the company will increase Hon Hai Precision's capital by
issuing 880 million shares in the form of global depositary receipts (GDRs).</P>
      <P>The move was more than double the 430 million GDRs the company's board
authorized in March and represents about 10 percent of the company's share
equity.</P>
      <P>It will be the biggest fundraising initiative in Hon Hai's history and will also
set a new record for all companies listed on Taiwan's stock exchange and the
GreTai Securities Market.</P>
      <P>When asked about the GDRs' pricing, Gou replied, "I will definitely not offer
the shares at a price of NT$100. I may not even issue them at NT$150."</P>
      <P>The share sale could raise up NT$132 billion if the sales price is NT$150 per
share.</P>
      <P>Gou said he was not worried about the GDR issuance being undersubscribed because
there is ample liquidity in international capital markets.</P>
      <P>He also said Hon Hai will continue its R&amp;D efforts and has many investments
in new energy, cloud computing, light emitting diodes (LED) and nanotechnology.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Hwang Jung-chiou said Tuesday he is
optimistic that a cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) will be signed in June.</P>
      <P>"The signing time is still set for June, " said Hwang, who added that the
government will do its utmost to meet the timetable.</P>
      <P>The official arrived in Beijing earlier in the day for a meeting on the cross-

the visit, but reporters were still keen to question him about it.</P>
      <P>Asked when the third round of talks between Taiwan and China on the proposed
agreement will be held, Hwang said "it should be soon, " but that it was up to
the two intermediary bodies representing Taiwan and China in cross-Strait
affairs to arrange the formal negotiations.</P>
      <P>When asked about the ECFA's "early harvest" program, Hwang said it will be
composed of two lists -- one for commodities and the other for non-commodities
and services.</P>
      <P>Items to be included in the early harvest list for goods, which will be entitled
to tariff reductions and exemptions, account for 10-15 percent of Taiwan's total
exports, he revealed.</P>
      <P>"Flat panels won't be on the list, " Hwang said, while machinery and
polyethylene will be. He declined to provide any other details.</P>

      <P>Two ruling lawmakers urged National Police Agency Director-General Wang Cho-
chiun to stay on Wednesday after Wang offered to resign over a recent gang
shooting that exposed loose discipline in the police force.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wu Yu-sheng from the Kuomintang (KMT) said Wang's decision shows that
he feels a deep sense of shame, but Wu did not think Wang should have to step
down because he was not directly responsible for the incident.</P>
      <P>"Wang should first seek to resolve the case, shake up police discipline and
further reform the police system," he said.</P>
      <P>Lu Shiow-yen, another KMT legislator, agreed that Wang should continue to lead
the police force and work to strengthen its discipline. She praised Wang as
being "rather efficient" in dealing with the case.</P>
      <P>The police force came under a barrage of criticism after it was discovered that
four police officers were present when Weng Chi-nan, a local gang leader in the
central city of Taichung, was shot dead in his private office May 28.</P>
      <P>The incident led to the resignation of Taichung City Police Bureau Director-
General Hu Mu-yuan on June 3.</P>
      <P>Amid mounting suspicion that the police were trying to cover up the incident,
Taichung police on June 7 made public surveillance footage that showed the four
police officers playing mahjong in Weng's office when the shooting took place.</P>
      <P>Five other police officers were also found to have visited Weng's office between
May 24 and May 28.</P>
      <P>The footage fueled more speculation about police ties with Weng's ring, with
Weng's office being likened to a private police club.</P>
      <P>In a TV interview Tuesday, Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said Wang had
expressed his intention to step down to take responsibility for the incident,
but indicated he turned down Wang's proposal.</P>
      <P>The Taichung City Council met Wednesday to discuss the city's worsening law and
order, and some council members believed the punishments for the nine involved
police officers were too light.</P>
      <P>In response to the doubts, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu urged the politicians to
support the city police in their battle against gangsters, instead of declaring
a war on the police.</P>
      <P>Hu said the majority of police officers have been faithfully fulfilling their
duty, and the small number of officers who committed errors were punished
accordingly.</P>
      <P>Chiu Feng-kuang, the new Taichung police chief, said the police will continue
their investigation into the case to clear up public doubts.</P>
      <P>Also Wednesday,  KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung denied allegations that he
was pulling strings behind the replacement of Hu Mu-yuan.</P>
      <P>King said the decision was made by the mayor himself because he is the head of
the city.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is planning to establish a partnership with the private sector to
carry out public works projects that it hopes will enhance the technical
capabilities of local companies and boost Taiwan's economy over the next decade.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the local media Tuesday, Christina Liu, chairwoman of the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) , said the council is in
discussions with other government agencies about how to push for a public-
private partnership in carrying out public construction programs.</P>
      <P>Liu said the concept would be applied to 32 infrastructure initiatives,
including proposals to upgrade islandwide transportation links and build a
knowledge-based  economy,  develop  emerging industries, such as biotechnology
and green energy, and strengthen the island's service industry.</P>
      <P>The 32 projects incorporate the "12 infrastructure projects" that were  one of
the key platforms  of President  Ma Ying-jeou's presidential election campaign
in 2008.</P>
      <P>The concept for public-private  partnerships came after Ma outlined a vision on
the eve of the second anniversary of his inauguration in mid-May to create a
"golden decade" for Taiwan, stressing the importance of innovation to Taiwan's
economic future.</P>
      <P>Liu said "golden decade" development will look beyond economic growth numbers to
focus on improving Taiwan's investment environment and raise the island's
international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The top economic planner singled out the local health care sector in the
interview as one of the areas targeted, saying Taiwan has earned a reputation
for providing high quality medical services.</P>
      <P>Once the government relaxes certain restrictions, she said, the sector will be
able to cooperate with the tourism industry to attract foreign visitors and
eventually  enhance Taiwan's international visibility.</P>
      <P>Liu said the motivation  behind  developing  public-private partnerships is not
to raise funds for future investment, which she described as a non-issue, but to
encourage local high-tech or biotech firms to build strategic alliances with
foreign enterprises and develop know-how and patents.</P>
      <P>Because the 32 projects will be huge and involve in a wide variety of
disciplines, the government needs to carefully consider their value, the order
of implementation, fund allocations and their impact on the local job market,
she said.</P>
      <P>No timetable has been set for the projects, she added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu said existing measures to create short-term jobs will be phased
out once the local economy and job market improve, though she did not specify
the degree of improvement necessary for the programs to be eliminated.</P>
      <P>She also acknowledged that short-term job creation measures were designed to
solve short-term problems but that Taiwan still needs to restructure itself to
meet long-term challenges.</P>
      <P>The short-term measures were taken to stem rising unemployment triggered by the
global financial meltdown that started in September 2008.</P>
      <P>In 2009 alone, the job measures created 73,000 short-term jobs, and the
government anticipates that an additional 103,000 new jobs of varying lengths
will be created by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's jobless rate fell to 5.39 percent in April after hitting a record high
of 6.13 percent in August 2009.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Animal handlers needed for Taiwan's stray dogs: activists</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government needs to hire professional animal control officers to ensure
stray animals are not injured or abused during capture,  activists  said
Wednesday,  urging the government to immediately end the use of untrained
sanitation workers or private individuals as dog catchers.</P>
      <P>The Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan (EAST) said that environmental
protection bureaus use the Waste Disposal Act passed in 1970 to justify treating
stray animals as "living rubbish."</P>
      <P>"In the last 40 years, countless numbers of stray dogs have been tortured and
abused by unprofessional dog catchers who use brutal and inhumane methods to
capture the animals, " said Chen Yu-min, a supervisor of EAST.</P>
      <P>A documentary made by EAST shows sanitation workers or private contractors
yanking dogs by their necks or tails and stuffing the howling animals into
chicken coops to be sent off to government-run shelters.</P>
      <P>Often the animals are exposed to rain or extreme heat because the vehicles used
to transport the animals have no covering, said Chen, citing cases in which dogs
have died en route to the shelters.</P>
      <P>Huang Pi-chu, the executive director of the Taichung Universal Animal Protection
Association, said most dog catchers in Taiwan lack the professional training to
handle stray animals and their fear of getting attacked by dogs forces them to
resort to violent methods.</P>
      <P>"The fact is that animals have no voting rights, so local elected leaders don't
care about stray animal issues," she lamented.</P>
      <P>Two lawmakers attended the press conference to voice their support, but were
unable to make any promises of a change in policy.</P>
      <P>Lin Tsung-yi, chief of the Council of Agriculture's (COA's) Animal Protection
Section, said the video clips showed the tools and equipment used by the dog
catchers were standard, "but their methods need to be improved."</P>
      <P>He said introducing government animal control officers has always been a goal of
the COA, but that the council still needs to evaluate the manpower and finances
of each local government before taking the next step.</P>
      <P>Huang said that depending on living conditions, most street dogs in Taiwan have
a life span of five years, adding that the best way to curb the country's stray
animal population would be a dedicated nation-wide campaign to neuter cats and
dogs.</P>
      <P>Using the "trap-neuter-return" method, her Taichung association helps reduce the
number of stray animals by desexing over 25 dogs a month without traumatizing
the animals, she said.</P>
      <P>"But the problem is, even though we clip the ears of the neutered animals to
show they are suitable to live on the streets, the dog catchers still capture
them because they're not trained recognize the markings," Huang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan shares close down 1.12 percent</HEADLINE>

      <P>Shrugging off a rebound on Wall Street overnight, Taiwan share prices closed
down 1.12 percent Wednesday in heavy trading amid fears that rising wages in
China will erode the earnings of Taiwanese companies operating there, dealers
said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index closed down 80.32 points at 7,071.67, after moving between
7,048.60 and 7,193.04, on turnover of NT$91.47 billion (US$2.82 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened 0.20 percent higher on Wall Street's 1.3 percent gain, but
selling emerged in mid-morning trading due to pessimism over the earnings
outlook of Taiwanese firms in China, which are facing pressure to raise wages,
dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,245 stocks closed down while 674 went up, with 258 stocks
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The financial sector fell by 1.7 percent, the most of any sector. Textile shares
fell 1.5 percent and plastics and chemical shares fell 1.2 percent, while
foodstuffs, and machinery and electronics issues lost 1.0 percent each.</P>
      <P>Construction shares fell 0.7 percent, paper and pulp issues dropped 0.6 percent,
and cement shares were down 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>The gloomy sentiment arose after Terry Gou, chairman of Hon Hai Group, which
employs 800,000 Chinese workers in China, said Tuesday that wage hikes in China
have become an irreversible trend.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai announced two separate pay hikes for its Chinese employees last week,
and analysts expected the wage increases will add more than NT$20 billion in
operating costs for the group.</P>
      <P>"Hon Hai has large economies of scale and can weather the particularly negative
factor. But how about other investors with relatively smaller production bases?
" Concord Securities analyst Allan Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said that while the Dow Jones Industrial Average staged a three-digit
comeback overnight, the high tech-heavy NASDAQ index closed three points lower.</P>
      <P>"The lackluster performance of U.S. tech stocks also promoted investors here to
think global demand for high-tech products will be compromised by debt problems
in Europe," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Among flat panel makers, Chimei-Innolux fell 3.28 percent to NT$32.45 and AU
Optronics lost 2.72 percent to NT$28.60.</P>
      <P>However, Hon Hai gained 1.79 percent to NT$113.50 on a technical rebound after
recent heavy sell-offs following the pay hikes.</P>
      <P>"Today's expanded turnover indicated selling pressure has turned heavier. The
market needs more time to digest the pressure, " Lin said. "It could test 7,000
points soon."</P>
      <P>Bucking the downward trend, Asia Cement closed up 0.55 percent at NT$27.60 on
production expansion, while rival Taiwan Cement fell 0.19 percent to NT$26.80.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Online game helps Taiwan locate overseas football talent</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Playing online games isn't necessarily a waste of time.  Without it,  Taiwan's
Chinese Taipei Football Association  (CTFA)  wouldn't  have  found  Xavier
Chen,  a Taiwanese-Belgian professional footballer who the association hopes
will play for Taiwan internationally.</P>
      <P>Ginola Chen, CTFA public relations director, found the name "Xavier Chen" when
he was playing an online FIFA football game last October and thought it was
probably a "patch" or a role created by gamers.</P>
      <P>But it only took a Google search for him to realize he was wrong. The real-life
Xavier Chen is a 26-year-old right back in KV Mechelen, a Belgian First Division
team in Antwerp Province, who had been a captain on the Belgian under-19
national team.</P>
      <P>After weeks of e-mail correspondence with the footballer, Ginola Chen knew the
recruiting opportunity was too good to miss for Taiwan, currently ranked 167th
in the FIFA world rankings. He flew to Brussels,  Belgium  and spent a week
trying to persuade  the Taiwanese-Belgian, who has a Taiwanese father and a
French mother, to play for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"That's the beauty of the Internet -- a modern way to find players, isn't it? "
Xavier Chen said in Taipei Tuesday when he was greeted at the Taipei Stadium by
dozens of television cameras and reporters.</P>
      <P>In his first trip to Taiwan in 15 years, Xavier Chen plans to meet his
grandfather, a former Taiwan diplomat, and to get to know Taiwan better, Ginola
Chen said. "We're not trying to force him into making any decision, " he added.</P>
      <P>Xavier Chen said that while his family still keeps some Taiwanese traditions --
mostly foods, especially the mapo tofu his mother cooks -- his knowledge of
Taiwan and Mandarin has been limited because his father insisted on full
integration into Belgian culture.</P>
      <P>He said that he hasn't made any decision on joining the Taiwanese national team,
but Taiwan "is my father's country -- and mine as well -- which has a special
part in my heart. I think my family will be glad if I choose to play for Taiwan,
" he said.</P>
      <P>China, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory, also made a run to recruit
Chen in April, three months after CTFA contacted him. Chen said he was open to
meet with anyone to "check  every opportunity" and that Taiwan was definitely
one of the options.</P>
      <P>A report on a Chinese media Web site in April, however, said that because
Beijing does not accept dual citizenship, Chen would have to relinquish his
Belgian citizenship to represent China. Taiwan allows dual citizenship.</P>
      <P>"It's a dream for every player to play for a national team, " he said, adding
that at 26, the window of opportunity for him to earn a place on the Belgian
national team is closing fast and that was why he wanted to keep his options
open.</P>
      <P>For Chen to play on the Taiwan squad, the CTFA will have to negotiate with
Chen's club in Belgium. Insurance and travel between Europe and Taiwan during
the European football season will have to be taken into consideration, Ginola
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Xavier Chen, who reportedly earns 700,000 euros (NT$27 million) annually with
Mechelen, is unlikely to play regularly in Taiwan, where football is a minor
sport and the domestic league is weak.</P>
      <P>"It's a shame because football is popular in the world. I don't know why it
couldn't be popular in Taiwan, " Xavier Chen said.</P>
      <P>If he were to agree to play for Taiwan, it is likely his first games would be
Asian Cup qualifiers next year.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to fly back to Belgium Saturday, which means he will watch the
opening game of the South Africa World Cup Friday in Taipei. The University of
Brussels law school graduate said his favorite player is French winger Franck
Ribery and hopes France does well in South Africa.</P>
      <P>This is not the first foreign-born Taiwanese player the CTFA has tried to
recruit. The association has also been in contact with Taiwanese-Spanish player
Victor Chou, an 18-year-old defender who plays for the youth team of UD
Salamanca. To date, however, a foreign-born player has never represented Taiwan
on the national team.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) signed a memorandum of
understanding with Solarprint Ltd. of Ireland Tuesday to cooperate in the
development of third generation solar cells.</P>
      <P>Solarprint CEO Mazhar Bari said he felt honored to have entered into a
cooperative  relationship  with the Taiwanese  research institute, which he
praised as playing a leading role in solar energy research.</P>
      <P>Solarprint has developed dye sensitized solar cells, which Bari said are third
generation cells able to transform solar energy into power more efficiently than
conventional solar cells and also cost less to produce.</P>
      <P>Similar to thin film solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells are considered to
have great promise because they use cheaper, more accessible materials and are
easier to produce than other solar cells.</P>
      <P>Solarprint envisions a wide range of applications for the technology, including
in consumer electronics to extend battery life in notebooks, in construction, or
even to cover the surface of an entire automobile to produce auxiliary power.</P>
      <P>The commercialization of dye-sensitized cells has been limited, however, by its
use of an electrolyte that has stability problems in varying temperatures.
Solarprint has been able to solve the problem, opening the way for more
potential applications.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Representative to Ireland Lee Nan-yang said he expected the cooperation
initiative to accelerate the commercialization of the third-generation cells and
other solar energy products.</P>
      <P>He also urged Taiwanese businesses to use the opportunity to seek links with
Irish companies as a springboard to other European markets.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, further cooperative ventures between Taiwan and Ireland are on
the horizon. An energy conference sponsored by Taiwan's science authorities and
their Irish counterparts, will be held in Dublin in August.</P>
      <P>Participants from the two countries will discuss technical cooperation in the
fields of wind power, tidal power and solar energy generation.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and India on Wednesday celebrated a connection that dates back 37 years
ago when Taiwan purchased 132 train coaches from India.</P>
      <P>Of that number, 38 still remain in operation around the island, said Taiwan
Railways Administration (TRA) Director-General Frank Fan at an annual railway
exhibition at Taipei Train Station.</P>
      <P>Fan said the coaches from India, upholstered in blue leather, are "important
relics" in Taiwan's railway history.</P>
      <P>Director-General of the India-Taipei Association Pradeep Kumar Raway said that
when he found out about the unique link that was established in 1973 between
Taiwan and India, he became eager to celebrate it with the TRA.</P>
      <P>"We think that through this event, we can help revive our old contacts and
cooperation, " he said. "In the 1970s, some India- manufactured trains were
brought to Taiwan and now we are seeing Taiwanese companies involved in the
construction of railways in India."</P>
      <P>Raway urged Taiwanese travelers to India to take some train trips in order to
"really savor the beauty" of the country.</P>
      <P>The first passenger train service in India was inaugurated in 1853 and ran
between Bombay and Thane. Today, the Indian railway is one of the largest and
busiest rail networks in the world, carrying over 18 million people and 2
million tons of freight each day.</P>
      <P>Three Indian railways -- Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, Kalka Shimla Railway, and
Nilgriri Mountain Railway -- are classified as UNESCO world heritage sites.</P>
      <P>According to Raway, the railway system is a vital part of India's development
and despite the recent train crash in which more than 100 people died, it is
still a very safe network.</P>
      <P>Expressing regret over the recent accident, he said by and large the entire
transportation sector is becoming safer because corrective action is usually
taken after a tragedy.</P>
      <P>An exhibition featuring the Indian railway system is being held at the north
gate of Taipei Train Station until June 13. Traditional Indian dancing is on
display every day at the booth and the public can sample Indian delicacies, the
TRA said.</P>
      <P>Visitors to the booth also have a chance to win a free eight-day train trip to
some of India's most famous holy sites, it said.</P>

      <P>Ruling party lawmakers called on the government Wednesday proceed cautiously on
a plan to increase the debt ceilings of the central and local governments.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lai Shyh-bao said such a move could lead to
excessive government indebtedness and pass a huge debt burden to future
generations.</P>
      <P>In line with the creation of four new special municipalities at the end of this
year, the Cabinet has been seeking to amend the Public Debt Act and the Act
Governing the Allocation for Government Revenues and Expenditures to change the
calculation methods for the debt ceilings of local governments.</P>
      <P>The two bills are among a number  of pieces of priority legislation that the
Cabinet hopes the Legislative Yuan will deal with in a special session that is
likely to be held during its current summer recess.</P>
      <P>Under the Ministry of Finance's (MOF) proposal, the debt ceiling for special
municipalities would be changed from 5.4 percent of the average nominal gross
national product (GNP) for the past three years to 250 percent of their annual
expenditure.</P>
      <P>The MOF reportedly also intends to raise the overall ceiling for debt at all
levels of government from 48 percent of GNP to 52 percent or even 54 percent of
GNP.</P>
      <P>Alex Fai, another KMT legislator, suggested that revenue, instead of
expenditure, should be used as the basis to calculate the local governments'
debt ceilings to prevent their finances from worsening further.</P>
      <P>Also, local governments should pay a higher percentage of principal every year
when they service their debts, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>AU Optronics Corp (AUO), the world's third largest flat panel maker, said
Wednesday it will not follow Foxconn Technology Group's lead in raising wages
for its Chinese workers because the company's compensation is already higher
than average.</P>
      <P>Paul Peng, executive vice president of AUO's global business unit, told
reporters that while pay hikes have become an irreversible trend on the
mainland, his company has no plan to hike salaries.</P>
      <P>AUO operates flat panel assembly facilities in Suzhou and Songjiang in Jiangsu
Province and in Xiamen in Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>The company has sought regulatory approval to build a US$3 billion
7.5-generation thin-film-transistor LCD plant in Jiangsu's Kunshan to churn out
panels for large TV screen use.</P>
      <P>Peng said that cheap labor in China is a thing of the past and that producing
value-added products and developing patents to boost competitiveness will be a
top priority for investors on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Fears that rising wages on the mainland will erode earnings of Taiwanese
investors have recently haunted Taiwan's stock market. The weighted index closed
down 1.12 percent Wednesday despite a Wall Street rebound overnight.</P>
      <P>The higher wage concerns came after Foxconn announced two pay hikes in one week
to assuage employees after a string of suicides and suicide attempts that left
10 dead and two injured.</P>
      <P>Some Taiwanese notebook computer companies -- including Compal Electronics,
Quanta Computer and Wistron -- said earlier they would not hike wages because
they already met legal requirements.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Peng said he expects second quarter shipments of AUO-made large-sized
panels, defined as 10 inches or above, to rise 10 percent from the first quarter
on continued growth in global demand.</P>
      <P>In May, AUO's shipments of large-sized panels hit a record high of 10.23 million
units, up 6 percent from April, with analysts saying the company has benefited
from a strong demand for large TV screens.</P>
      <P>Peng said he is upbeat about the second half of this year as demand from China
will continue to grow because customers have lowered their inventories.</P>

      <P>The  county  government's  Indigenous  Peoples  Department collaborated with a
local travel agency to launch the services May 22 on an experimental basis. The
mountainous township is home to the Atayal tribe, one of Taiwan's 14 officially
recognized indigenous tribes.</P>
      <P>"We originally planned to offer the services for one month to test the market,"
said Lin Chen-rong, director of the department. "In light of the enthusiastic
public response to the new service, the program may be continued after the one-
month trial period expires."</P>
      <P>The pilot program includes a guide on each tour that gives an in-depth
introduction to aboriginal culture, Lin said, adding that the buses provide
convenience for visitors who don't want to travel with their own vehicle.</P>
      <P>Tour buses departing from Taipei Main Station on Saturdays and Sundays offer a
wide range of tour routes, including an Atayal religious culture tour, an Atayal
hunting tour and a "tribal village culture tour."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLA hopes to see at least 80 new trade unions in the next four years</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Wednesday that it will advocate the
formation of more trade unions in Taiwan and hopes the number will increase by
at least 80 in the next four years.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed an amendment to the Trade Labor Union Law on June 1,
making it compulsory for employees to join their company's trade union.</P>
      <P>However, some labor rights groups said at a seminar Wednesday that currently
there are too few trade unions in Taiwan to adequately protect workers' rights.</P>
      <P>In response, Liu Chuan-min, head of the CLA's Department of Labor Relations,
said the goal of 20 new trade unions per year for the next four years is a
minimum.</P>
      <P>"Of course, we hope the number of unions will increase by more than that," Liu
said.</P>
      <P>At present there are 947 trade unions in Taiwan, which is about 3.3 percent of
the total number possible if all eligible enterprises -- those that employ more
than 30 workers -- set up trade unions for their workers.</P>
      <P>Currently, about 30,000 enterprises in Taiwan are eligible to have trade unions,
according to Hsieh Chuang-chih, secretary-general of the Taiwan Confederation of
Trade Unions.</P>
      <P>"There is not a single workers' union in the hi-tech companies, " said Hsieh,
calling on the government to help workers unionize.</P>
      <P>Sun You-lien, secretary-general of the Taiwan Labor Front, said his organization
will set up a center to organize trade unions, in the hope that they will
increase to about 20 percent or 30 percent of the possible number.</P>
      <P>Due to the economic slump and legal restrictions, the number of trade unions in
Taiwan dropped from 1,310 in 1992 to 947 in 2009, Sun said.</P>

      <P>This year's Display Taiwan and Photonics Festival in Taiwan have attracted a
record number of exhibitors, organizers said at the opening ceremony Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"This year's exhibitions will be bigger than those in the past and will include
Display Taiwan, LED Lighting Taiwan, Solar Taiwan and Optics Taiwan, " said
Peter Shih, chairperson of the Photonics Industry and Technology Development
Association (PIDA).</P>
      <P>The multiple shows in the optical and optoelectronics fields have drawn a record
614 exhibitors occupying 1,580 booths, up from about 550 exhibitors and 1,300
booths last year.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the opening ceremony, Vice President Vincent Siew encouraged
Taiwanese companies to develop their own brand names instead of relying on the
traditional original equipment manufacturer or original design manufacturer
business models.</P>
      <P>"What we need to do for this industry is to develop emerging markets, especially
the Chinese market, " said Siew. Twenty buying groups from China totaling more

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of environmental protection activists Wednesday urged the government to
step up efforts to protect  Chinese  white dolphins,  a species which is already
endangered.</P>
      <P>Led by Tsai Chia-yang, chairman of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union
Changhua division, the activists staged a protest in front of the Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA), calling for the government to shelve plans to
build a naphtha cracking plant near the mouth of the central Jhuoshuei River.</P>
      <P>The petrochemical complex, planned by partially state-owned Kuokuang
Petrochemical Technology Co., is expected to produce 12 million tons of carbon
dioxide a year and would raise the temperature of the sea near the mouth of the
river where the dolphins live, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the warming effect is likely to push the dolphins toward extinction as
the animals rarely stray far from their habitat.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the number of Chinese white dolphins has fallen to fewer than 100 and
the United Nations has urged immediate efforts to protect the animal after
widespread development brought 40 years of pollution, threatening its habitat.</P>
      <P>He said the EPA needs to conduct further research on the ecology of Chinese
white dolphins, assessing how further pollution in the Jhuoshuei River will
affect the animal's breeding and feeding habits.</P>
      <P>He added that without a careful environmental assessment, the construction of
the cracker plant could be catastrophic for the dolphins.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) on Wednesday unveiled a package of regulations
requiring that people who apply to hire foreign caregivers pay for their own in-
house assessments.</P>
      <P>"The in-house Barthel Index assessment service is designed to assess whether
patients' disabilities are serious enough to qualify for the employment of
foreign caregivers, " said Tsai Shu-feng, deputy director of the DOH's Bureau of
Nursing and Health Service Development.</P>
      <P>The Barthel Index consists of seven items that measure a person's ability to
perform daily functions: feeding, moving between a wheelchair and a bed,
grooming, bathing, dressing, using a toilet and walking. Only those whose
Barthel score falls below 30 points on the 100-point scale are eligible to apply
for foreign caregivers.</P>
      <P>Under the new regulations, patients who cannot leave bed without help, those who
are comatose or continuously reliant on life-support devices, and those who
possess government-issued serious disability documentation can apply for in-
house Barthel Index assessments, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Patients, however, have to pay for the in-home evaluation services. The standard
charges for a home visit range between NT$1,700 (US$52) and NT$2,000, and the
assessment fee ranges between NT$700 and NT$1,000. They must also pay for
traffic expenses, which will be determined by local governments  depending on
traffic situations in their districts.</P>
      <P>Tsai said each applicant will have to pay an estimated NT$3,000 to NT$4,000 for
an in-house assessment.</P>
      <P>Patients from low-income families will be exempt from the payments, and those
from middle- to low-income families will only pay 10 percent of the standard
charges, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she added, local health authorities must ensure that each in-house
assessment case is finalized in 30 days.</P>

      <P>An exhibition of installation art and space design by Oscar-winning artist Tim
Yip will open this weekend at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Taipei (MOCA).</P>
      <P>"The exhibition will feature Yip's work, from 2007 to the present, in
photography, video and other media," the organizers said. "The entire exhibition
space is a display of Yip's talent in creating environments and using space."</P>
      <P>Yip won an Oscar in 2001 for Best Art Direction in the movie "Crouching  Tiger,

in film, theater, television, costume design, space design, photography,
painting, and literature.</P>
      <P>Many of the pieces in the exhibition, "Summer Holiday -- a solo exhibition by
Tim Yip", will portray the artist's views of and experiences in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The display will revolve around a fictional character called "Lili", who is a
symbol of the people in contemporary urban culture, according to one of the
organizers.</P>
      <P>"Actually, 'Lili' represents you, me, and every person living in this city," the
organizer said. "Each visitor becomes the protagonist in Yip's summer festival."</P>
      <P>On the first floor of the museum, Lili will be portrayed from different
perspectives in photography, video, and sculpture, while the second floor will
be occupied by elements of the past such as songs, clothes, and statues, in a
dark narrow space.</P>
      <P>"In order to explore the spiritual world of 'Lili', Yip has also projected
himself as the subject of observation, " the organizers said.</P>

      <P>Although shares of Hon Hai Precision Industry, the world's biggest contract
electronics maker, have faced heavy selling from foreign institutional investors
recently, most foreign brokerages maintained their buy ratings on the stock as
they are upbeat about the company's revenue growth.</P>
      <P>As the pay hikes in its Chinese facilities are expected to erode the company's
profits, however, most brokerages have lowered the stock's target price, with
Citigroup Global Markets cutting its 12-month target to NT$114.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai climbed NT$2, or 1.79 percent, to close at NT$113.5 on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Wan-li, head of Taiwan Research at HSBC Securities, said that he rated Hon
Hai "overweight" because its share prices have plunged about 20 percent in the
past month.</P>
      <P>Wang also pointed out that Hon Hai's revenue this year is expected to rise 32
percent from last year -- benefiting from the growth of orders in flat panel
TVs, iPads, iPhones and notebook computers.</P>
      <P>Wang cut the stock's target price from NT$179 to NT$170, however, saying the pay
hikes are expected to increase Hon Hai's cost by NT$24 billion a year, which
would reduce its operating profit by 20 percent.</P>
      <P>Calvin Huang, analyst at Daiwa Securities, was also worried that the increase in
labor cost will hurt the company's ability to grab market shares. He maintained
an "underperform" rating for Hon Hai.</P>
      <P>In addition, JPMorgan Chase cut Hon Hai's target price from NT$175 to NT$148,
and Merrill Lynch decreased it from NT$190 to NT$159. But both brokerages kept
their buy rating on the stock, according to media reports.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley expected Hon Hai to stage a rebound in the next two
months and set a target price at NT$150, saying the worst was over after the
company's share prices fell 20 percent in the past month, the reports said.</P>
      <P>The highest target price for Hon Hai -- NT$173 -- came from Credit Suisse, which
reiterated its "outperform" rating for the stock, saying the impact from the pay
hikes would be less than expected and the overall labor cost would become lower
after the company hires more quality workers, a media report said.</P>

      <P>A bridge-building project that Taiwan started in 2009 to foster industrial
cooperation with China is showing results in the information and communication
technology (ICT) sector, according to a high-ranking Taiwanese official
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The project is entering a phase of substantial negotiations" on the
establishment of business links across the Taiwan Strait," said Vice Minister of
Economic Affairs Hwang Jung-chiou at the opening of a two-day cross-strait
meeting in Beijing on industrial cooperation and exchanges.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan's ICT sector has built a complete industrial chain in the
research and production of terminal equipment.</P>
      <P>Thanks to its global logistics capability and its innovation, Taiwan's ICT
sector is now a leader in the world market, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>In China, strong domestic demand has led to the emergence of big suppliers of
telecommunications equipment and solutions, such as Datang Telecom Technology
Co. and Huawei Technologies Co., he noted.</P>
      <P>If the two sides could combine their respective strengths in the ICT field, they
would be able to not only provide high-quality communications solutions in
China, but also make inroads into the global market, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>He said that there has also been progress in cross-strait industrial exchanges
in a wide range of fields, ranging from solar energy,  electric  vehicles  and
Chinese  herbal  medicine  to biotechnology.</P>
      <P>So far, he said, 522 Taiwanese and Chinese enterprises have held business talks
within the project's framework, which has led to the signing of 50 cooperation
agreements or memorandums of understanding.</P>
      <P>Concurring with Hwang's views, Shyu Jyuo-min, president of Taiwan's Industrial
Technology Research Institute, cited as examples of cross-strait cooperation in
the ICT industry the development of Internet-enabled cell phone chips by
Taiwan's MediaTek and Beijing's China Mobile.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan's HTC worked with China Mobile on the customization of smart
phones, and Acer joined forces with MSI China to develop netbooks, Shyu said.</P>
      <P>Other examples include Hon Hai's contract to produce e-readers for China Mobile,
which is also interested in e-paper developed by Delta Electronics, he said.</P>

      <P>The Consumers' Foundation said Wednesday that 25 percent of the bean curd
products it inspected recently contained enough benzoic acid and other chemicals
to cause liver damage or stomach cancer.</P>
      <P>With the approach of the Dragon Boat Festival, many people are buying bean curd
products to stuff the rice dumplings that are popular at this time of year, the
foundation noted.</P>
      <P>However, the foundation said, in its recent inspections, it found that eight out
of the 32 bean curd samples contained excessive levels of the preservative
benzoic acid and traces of fungicide.</P>
      <P>The 32 items included six samples of bean curd noodles, seven samples of deep-
fried tofu, five samples of vegetarian chicken, eight samples of bean curd
squares, and six samples of bean curd sheets, it said.</P>
      <P>One of the bean curd noodle samples purchased at a traditional market in Muzha
was found to contain between 0.6 g/kg and 1.0 g/kg of benzoic acid, which was
over the highest permissible level of 0.6g/kg set by the Department of Health,
it said. Consumption of products containing such high levels of the preservative
could lead to liver damage, the foundation warned.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has banned the use of benzoic acid in deep-fried
tofu, the foundation said traces of the chemical was found in four of the seven
samples purchased at traditional markets in Changchun, Banciao, and at a
Carrefour supermarket in Chungho.</P>
      <P>Other samples of bean curd noodles were found to contain traces of fungicides,
which the foundation said could cause stomach cancer.</P>
      <P>According  to the  Act  Governing  Food  Sanitation,  food manufacturers whose
products are found to contain chemicals in excess of the permitted level could
be subject to fines of between NT$300,000 and NT$150,000, the foundation pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Two or more violations in the space of a year could lead to a revocation of
business licenses and closure of the production unit until corrective action is
taken, the law states. Repeat offenders could be also fined between NT$180,000
and NT$900,000.</P>

      <P>As Taiwan tries to improve ties with old-time foe China to attract more foreign
investment, experts said Wednesday that the tactic works with some investors,
but that others are worried about losing technologies to Chinese firms.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to have an edge over main rival South Korea in attracting
foreign investors after Taiwan signs a pact for more liberalized trade with
China later this month, the head of Taiwan's top economic planning body said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors can invest in the mainland through Taiwan and their investment
in China will be protected under the economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA), Christina Liu, chairwoman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Recent media reports have said China and South Korea will start talks on a free
trade agreement later this year or early next year.</P>
      <P>Liu said Taiwan already has advantages over South Korea.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has cut its corporate income tax to 17 percent, while South Korea's
stands at 22 percent," Liu said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan also better understands the mainland," she added.</P>
      <P>As a result, Liu predicts the ECFA will prompt international companies with
major manufacturing bases in China to choose Taiwanese companies as strategic
partners.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, better relations between Taiwan and China have resulted
in opening Taiwan to direct cross-strait flights, tourists and investment.</P>
      <P>Polaris Research Institute President Liang Kuo-yuan told the CNA Wednesday that
South Korea is closely monitoring progress on the Taiwan-China trade pact as it
is aware the agreement will negatively affect South Korea.</P>
      <P>But he also said that although the trade pact and a cultural background similar
to China's would give Taiwan advantages, it would be difficult for Taiwan to
lure many of South Korea's existing foreign partners because they have "long-
established connections."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liang said that international investors have yet to act as it is
unclear what industries in Taiwan will first enjoy tariff reductions from the
trade pact.</P>
      <P>"They are still waiting to see what 'great benefits' will come from the trade
pact," he said.</P>
      <P>Yang Chia-yen, a director at the Taiwan Institute for Economic Research, told
the CNA Wednesday that the trade pact would appeal to foreign companies that
want to enter the Chinese market by working with Taiwanese partners.</P>
      <P>But there is another group of foreign companies who are concerned that Chinese
companies might learn their technologies, he said.</P>
      <P>"In the field of machinery, some foreign companies don't want to work with
Taiwanese companies because they are worried that their technologies might go to
China," he said.</P>
      <P>Although the Taiwan government said that the trade pact will include
intellectual property rights protection, it is difficult to carry it out in
reality, which triggers concerns, Yang said.</P>
      <P>He said he learned about this from recently interviewing people who have
contacts with companies in countries including Japan, Germany, Switzerland and
the United States.</P>
      <P>The director also said that foreign companies might relocate investments from
Taiwan to China if some industries move their production there.</P>
      <P>"For example, if a lot of flat panel manufacturers move to China, foreign
companies, such as Corning Inc., will follow suit, " Yang said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government recently eased restrictions on flat panel manufacturers
investing in China, he noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is an important overseas investment destination for the U.S.-based
Corning as the country is a major flat panel maker, Yang said.</P>

Hangzhou, accounting for 20 percent of all overseas visitors, the deputy mayor
said.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Taiwan is also seeing more tourist arrivals from Hangzhou. In
the first four months of this year, 90,000 Hangzhou residents visited Taiwan,
which represents a 92 percent growth rate compared to the same period last year.</P>
      <P>At the new Hangzhou tourism office,  which was opened in collaboration with
Taiwan's Lion Travel, there are displays of Hangzhou's indigenous tea, silk
products and old rare books. Visitors can also surf the Internet on computers

National Police Agency (NPA) Wednesday to produce visible results in their fight
against crime and to institute better discipline in the police force, within one
month.</P>
      <P>Ma issued the directive at a weekly meeting of the ruling Kuomintang's decision-
making Central Standing Committee, in his capacity as party chairman, after a
series of daytime gunfights in the central city of Taichung.</P>
      <P>In the latest gangland killing in Taichung on May 28, Weng Chi-nan, a local
crime boss, was shot dead in the presence of four city police officers who were
playing mahjong at Weng's office at the time.</P>

other city police officers visited Weng's office between May 24 and May 28.</P>
      <P>Ma said the MOI and the NPA should step up their crime-fighting efforts,
particularly against organized crime, in order to provide a safe living
environment for the people of the country.</P>
      <P>Special attention should be given to the penetration of crime rings into local

      <P>During his eight-year tenure as mayor of Taipei, Ma said, he hosted an inter-
agency meeting twice a month on public order issues.</P>
      <P>"Unless I was on an overseas trip, I had never skipped those meetings, " Ma
recalled. "I'm convinced that success in the fight against organized crime
hinges on the determination  of local government heads and the importance they
attach to this issue."</P>
      <P>On police discipline and integrity, Ma said it is a longstanding problem that
requires long-term efforts.</P>
      <P>"First of all, the police supervisory mechanism should be reinforced," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The NPA and the MOI should review whether individual police officers responsible
for internal supervision and the divisions that handle police ethics are
carrying out their duties, Ma said.</P>
      <P>His suggestion was made against the background of the replacement of the
Taichung City Police Bureau chief after it was determined that the investigation
into the May 28 shooting  was sloppy  and perfunctory.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Executive Yuan promulgated an ethical code of conduct for police
detectives two years ago, Ma said he hopes all detectives will observe the fine
lines drawn in the code and adhere strictly to the rules.</P>
      <P>If necessary, Ma said, the ethical code should be updated to give more detailed
and specific guidelines for policemen, detectives and high-ranking police
officers to follow.</P>
      <P>Even though official statistics show that crime-solving rates have been
improving in Taiwan, people's feelings about public order are equally important,
Ma said.</P>
      <P>"The NPA should conduct regular public opinion surveys at both the national and
community level to gain a better idea of public opinion on law and order," he
added.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung City government Wednesday said its competition for the design of
the Kaohsiung Maritime Cultural and Popular Music Center has attracted entries
from 135 international architecture teams around the world.</P>
      <P>The 12.5-hectare property that spans from pier 11 to 15 of the Kaohsiung Harbor
will be the future home of the center, which is scheduled to be dedicated in
2015.</P>
      <P>The Council of Cultural Affairs originally set the overall construction budget
at NT$4 billion (US$123 million) for a pop music center. However, the figure was
bumped to the current NT$5.45 billion when the Executive Yuan decided the center
should also include elements involving maritime culture.</P>
      <P>According to Chung Wan-shun, the chief of the Construction Office under the
Public Works Bureau, the possibility of landing a lucrative bid has attracted
numerous international teams to enter the design competition.</P>
      <P>The call was announced at the end of May and his office received applications
from 135 teams from across the globe, including the U.S., Japan, Russia, Italy
and Bulgaria, he said.</P>
      <P>Chung said the center will become a major city landmark. The city government
hopes the structure will increase the city's international visibility as well as
reflect the country's efforts to promote eco-friendly buildings.</P>
      <P>The winner was originally scheduled to be announced on June 8, but due to a
delay in the selection of judges, the city government decided to postpone the
decision to an unspecified date.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou told servicemen on the frontline Matsu Islands Wednesday
that despite the fact that Taiwan is seeking further detente in the Taiwan
Strait by negotiating a trade pact with China, they should remain on high alert.</P>
      <P>The president was on a one-day tour of the island group off the coast of China's
Fujian Province and was accompanied by Secretary- General to the President Liao
Liou-yi, National Security Council Secretary-General Hu Wei-chen and Minister of
National Defense Kao Hua-chu.</P>
      <P>Ma visited an observation deck on the 1.3-square kilometer Gaodeng Isle to look
at a lighthouse on the other side of the water, and then proceeded to Liang Isle
to inspect the troops there. Both Gaodeng and Liang Isle lie less than 10 miles
off the coast of Fujian.</P>
      <P>Expressing concern about the readiness of the Taiwan military, President Ma told
the soldiers that Taiwan must remain on high alert in the face of China's
military buildup.</P>
      <P>Later in the afternoon,  Lienchiang County Magistrate Yang Shui-sheng
accompanied the president on an inspection tour of a local hospital. The
Lienchiang county government administers the Matsu Islands.</P>
      <P>Yang told the president that tourism might be the only way to bring prosperity
to the minor archipelago. The government of the county, which has scare
resources, is hoping to obtain the central government's support to establish air
and sea links between Matsu and Taiwan proper, the magistrate said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Wednesday it is working
with think tanks to establish a platform for dialogue and exchanges between
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said the party is not opposed to talks and
exchanges between Taiwan and China, but it does not support the stance of
eventual unification of the two sides.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Tsai said, the party does not permit its members in public office
to engage in formal exchanges between Taiwan and China, such as the upcoming
Straits Forum to be held in China this month or the forum in July between the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the Chinese Communist Party.</P>
      <P>The platform that the DPP has in mind will not be a party mechanism, but rather
a public one that will accommodate officials and the general public, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>It will be established on the basis of equality and respect and should not
include political preconditions, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, it will demonstrate to the Chinese government and people the
values that Taiwanese hold dear, such as democracy and sovereignty, a position
that he said the KMT does not represent and does not discuss.</P>
      <P>The mechanism is still in the planning stages and there is no timeline for its
development, he said.</P>
      <P>The DPP's announcement of its plans to establish a platform for cross-strait
exchanges came on the heels of a statement last month by the party's chairwoman
Tsai Ing-wen that the party will not rule out the possibility of direct dialogue
with China as long as there are no political preconditions.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has long impressed Hong Kong visitors with its food and now it is
promoting wedding and medical tourism at a Hong Kong travel fair to draw more
visitors to the country, officials of Taiwan's Tourism Bureau said at a press
event Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau officials, Taiwan is among the five biggest delegations
that have an official presence at the Hong Kong Travel Expo from June 10-13, and
it plans to highlight wedding photo shoots, medical tourism, and spas and
resorts at this year's event.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has many scenic spots, such as Sun Moon Lake, the northern coast and the
islet of Liuqiu off the southwestern coast, which are perfect settings for
wedding photo shoots, they said, adding that these attractions are gaining
popularity among Hong Kong couples about to be wed.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese  travel agents are also teaming up with medical institutions to offer
tour packages that include high-end medical examinations, in view of the fact
that medical services in Taiwan cost less than in Hong Kong, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Noting that some 720,000 Hong Kong travelers visited Taiwan in 2009, up 16.19
percent from 2008, Chen Zao-ming, the Tourism Bureau's representative in Hong
Kong, said "we expect the number of visitors from Hong Kong this year to
increase by 4.5 percent from last year."</P>
      <P>Hong Kong residents will see Taiwan as a more attractive destination once Taiwan
starts allowing them visa-free entry, he added.</P>
      <P>According to a survey released by MasterCard Wednesday, 56 percent of Hong Kong
residents are planning to travel overseas in the next six months, with 47
percent choosing China as their destination, 39 percent Japan, and 34 percent
Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Hon Hai Precision Industry, the world's</P>
      <P>biggest contract electronics maker, is planning to relocate its advanced
processing operations from China to Taiwan amid rising labor costs in China, a
Taiwan economics official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Terry Gou, the founder and chairman of Hon Hai, has been in discussions since
late last year with Taiwan's Ministry of Economics Affairs on the possibility of
setting up a unmanned factory near the company's headquarters in Tucheng City,
northern Taiwan, said the official who asked not to be named.</P>
      <P>However, there is no available space for the factory at the moment, the official
told the Central News Agency, adding that the ministry is working to solve the
problem.</P>
      <P>"Hon Hai does not plan to move its factory in Shenzhen back to Taiwan, the
official said. "Instead, it wants to relocate its advanced processing
operation."</P>
      <P>Hon Hai has been in the spotlight since early this year when the first of 12
workers at its Shenzhen factory committed suicide.</P>
      <P>In addition to Hon Hai, at least two other Taiwanese electronics companies plan
to return to Taiwan because workers at their China factories are demanding
higher wages, the official said.</P>
      <P>These companies want the ministry to help them find a location for their
factories and allow them to hire more foreign workers, the official disclosed.</P>
      <P>As wages in Taiwan are relatively high, it will not make economic sense for
companies to relocate from China and engage in the processing operations that
they now have there, the official said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Chi-tung, the deputy head of an association of China-based Taiwanese
businesses, told reporters Wednesday that many Taiwanese companies want to
return from China but the Taiwan government will first have to help them deal
with the problem of labor shortage.</P>
      <P>He noted that while there are Indonesian and Filipino workers in Taiwan who
would accept lower wages than Taiwanese workers, there is the problem of
language and cultural barriers.</P>
      <P>To deal with this problem, the Taiwan government should allow Chinese workers
into Taiwan, he suggested.</P>
      <P>At a press conference after Hon Hai's shareholders meeting the previous day, Gou
said that his company will relocate some of its production lines to central and
western China to capitalize on the cheaper labor there.</P>
      <P>Chien Pei-pin, a senior analyst with Digitimes Research, told CNA Wednesday that
central and western China could be the next major production sites for
electronics companies, as the Chinese government plans to step up the
development of those areas in the next decade.</P>

      <P>Ruling party lawmakers called on the government Wednesday proceed cautiously on
a plan to increase the debt ceilings of the central and local governments.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lai Shyh-bao said such a move could lead to
excessive government indebtedness and pass a huge debt burden to future
generations.</P>
      <P>In line with the creation of four new special municipalities at the end of this
year, the Cabinet has been seeking to amend the Public Debt Act and the Act
Governing the Allocation for Government Revenues and Expenditures to change the
calculation methods for the debt ceilings of local governments.</P>
      <P>The two bills are among a number  of pieces of priority legislation that the
Cabinet hopes the Legislative Yuan will deal with in a special session that is
likely to be held during its current summer recess.</P>
      <P>Under the Ministry of Finance's (MOF) proposal, the debt ceiling for special
municipalities would be changed from 5.4 percent of the average nominal gross
national product (GNP) for the past three years to 250 percent of their annual
expenditure.</P>
      <P>The MOF reportedly also intends to raise the overall ceiling for debt at all
levels of government from 48 percent of GNP to 52 percent or even 54 percent of
GNP.</P>
      <P>Alex Fai, another KMT legislator, suggested that revenue, instead of
expenditure, should be used as the basis to calculate the local governments'
debt ceilings to prevent their finances from worsening further.</P>
      <P>Also, local governments should pay a higher percentage of principal every year
when they service their debts, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>AU Optronics Corp (AUO), the world's third largest flat panel maker, said
Wednesday it will not follow Foxconn Technology Group's lead in raising wages
for its Chinese workers because the company's compensation is already higher
than average.</P>
      <P>Paul Peng, executive vice president of AUO's global business unit, told
reporters that while pay hikes have become an irreversible trend on the
mainland, his company has no plan to hike salaries.</P>
      <P>AUO operates flat panel assembly facilities in Suzhou and Songjiang in Jiangsu
Province and in Xiamen in Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>The company has sought regulatory approval to build a US$3 billion
7.5-generation thin-film-transistor LCD plant in Jiangsu's Kunshan to churn out
panels for large TV screen use.</P>
      <P>Peng said that cheap labor in China is a thing of the past and that producing
value-added products and developing patents to boost competitiveness will be a
top priority for investors on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Fears that rising wages on the mainland will erode earnings of Taiwanese
investors have recently haunted Taiwan's stock market. The weighted index closed
down 1.12 percent Wednesday despite a Wall Street rebound overnight.</P>
      <P>The higher wage concerns came after Foxconn announced two pay hikes in one week
to assuage employees after a string of suicides and suicide attempts that left
10 dead and two injured.</P>
      <P>Some Taiwanese notebook computer companies -- including Compal Electronics,
Quanta Computer and Wistron -- said earlier they would not hike wages because
they already met legal requirements.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Peng said he expects second quarter shipments of AUO-made large-sized
panels, defined as 10 inches or above, to rise 10 percent from the first quarter
on continued growth in global demand.</P>
      <P>In May, AUO's shipments of large-sized panels hit a record high of 10.23 million
units, up 6 percent from April, with analysts saying the company has benefited
from a strong demand for large TV screens.</P>
      <P>Peng said he is upbeat about the second half of this year as demand from China
will continue to grow because customers have lowered their inventories.</P>

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Wednesday that it will advocate the
formation of more trade unions in Taiwan and hopes the number will increase by
at least 80 in the next four years.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed an amendment to the Trade Labor Union Law on June 1,
making it compulsory for employees to join their company's trade union.</P>
      <P>However, some labor rights groups said at a seminar Wednesday that currently
there are too few trade unions in Taiwan to adequately protect workers' rights.</P>
      <P>In response, Liu Chuan-min, head of the CLA's Department of Labor Relations,
said the goal of 20 new trade unions per year for the next four years is a
minimum.</P>
      <P>"Of course, we hope the number of unions will increase by more than that," Liu
said.</P>
      <P>At present there are 947 trade unions in Taiwan, which is about 3.3 percent of
the total number possible if all eligible enterprises -- those that employ more
than 30 workers -- set up trade unions for their workers.</P>
      <P>Currently, about 30,000 enterprises in Taiwan are eligible to have trade unions,
according to Hsieh Chuang-chih, secretary-general of the Taiwan Confederation of
Trade Unions.</P>
      <P>"There is not a single workers' union in the hi-tech companies, " said Hsieh,
calling on the government to help workers unionize.</P>
      <P>Sun You-lien, secretary-general of the Taiwan Labor Front, said his organization
will set up a center to organize trade unions, in the hope that they will
increase to about 20 percent or 30 percent of the possible number.</P>
      <P>Due to the economic slump and legal restrictions, the number of trade unions in
Taiwan dropped from 1,310 in 1992 to 947 in 2009, Sun said.</P>

      <P>A group of environmental protection activists Wednesday urged the government to
step up efforts to protect  Chinese  white dolphins,  a species which is already
endangered.</P>
      <P>Led by Tsai Chia-yang, chairman of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union
Changhua division, the activists staged a protest in front of the Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA), calling for the government to shelve plans to
build a naphtha cracking plant near the mouth of the central Jhuoshuei River.</P>
      <P>The petrochemical complex, planned by partially state-owned Kuokuang
Petrochemical Technology Co., is expected to produce 12 million tons of carbon
dioxide a year and would raise the temperature of the sea near the mouth of the
river where the dolphins live, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the warming effect is likely to push the dolphins toward extinction as
the animals rarely stray far from their habitat.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the number of Chinese white dolphins has fallen to fewer than 100 and
the United Nations has urged immediate efforts to protect the animal after
widespread development brought 40 years of pollution, threatening its habitat.</P>
      <P>He said the EPA needs to conduct further research on the ecology of Chinese
white dolphins, assessing how further pollution in the Jhuoshuei River will
affect the animal's breeding and feeding habits.</P>
      <P>He added that without a careful environmental assessment, the construction of
the cracker plant could be catastrophic for the dolphins.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) on Wednesday unveiled a package of regulations
requiring that people who apply to hire foreign caregivers pay for their own in-
house assessments.</P>
      <P>"The in-house Barthel Index assessment service is designed to assess whether
patients' disabilities are serious enough to qualify for the employment of
foreign caregivers, " said Tsai Shu-feng, deputy director of the DOH's Bureau of
Nursing and Health Service Development.</P>
      <P>The Barthel Index consists of seven items that measure a person's ability to
perform daily functions: feeding, moving between a wheelchair and a bed,
grooming, bathing, dressing, using a toilet and walking. Only those whose
Barthel score falls below 30 points on the 100-point scale are eligible to apply
for foreign caregivers.</P>
      <P>Under the new regulations, patients who cannot leave bed without help, those who
are comatose or continuously reliant on life-support devices, and those who
possess government-issued serious disability documentation can apply for in-
house Barthel Index assessments, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Patients, however, have to pay for the in-home evaluation services. The standard
charges for a home visit range between NT$1,700 (US$52) and NT$2,000, and the
assessment fee ranges between NT$700 and NT$1,000. They must also pay for
traffic expenses, which will be determined by local governments  depending on
traffic situations in their districts.</P>
      <P>Tsai said each applicant will have to pay an estimated NT$3,000 to NT$4,000 for
an in-house assessment.</P>
      <P>Patients from low-income families will be exempt from the payments, and those
from middle- to low-income families will only pay 10 percent of the standard
charges, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she added, local health authorities must ensure that each in-house
assessment case is finalized in 30 days.</P>

perspectives in photography, video, and sculpture, while the second floor will
be occupied by elements of the past such as songs, clothes, and statues, in a
dark narrow space.</P>
      <P>"In order to explore the spiritual world of 'Lili', Yip has also projected
himself as the subject of observation, " the organizers said.</P>
      <P>"Summer Holiday" is a display of the artist's multi-media, cross-cultural
creativity, according to the organizers.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will be held from June 11 through August 8.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Most foreign brokerages maintain 'buy' on Hon Hai</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although shares of Hon Hai Precision Industry, the world's biggest contract
electronics maker, have faced heavy selling from foreign institutional investors
recently, most foreign brokerages maintained their buy ratings on the stock as
they are upbeat about the company's revenue growth.</P>
      <P>As the pay hikes in its Chinese facilities are expected to erode the company's
profits, however, most brokerages have lowered the stock's target price, with
Citigroup Global Markets cutting its 12-month target to NT$114.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai climbed NT$2, or 1.79 percent, to close at NT$113.5 on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Wan-li, head of Taiwan Research at HSBC Securities, said that he rated Hon
Hai "overweight" because its share prices have plunged about 20 percent in the
past month.</P>
      <P>Wang also pointed out that Hon Hai's revenue this year is expected to rise 32
percent from last year -- benefiting from the growth of orders in flat panel
TVs, iPads, iPhones and notebook computers.</P>
      <P>Wang cut the stock's target price from NT$179 to NT$170, however, saying the pay
hikes are expected to increase Hon Hai's cost by NT$24 billion a year, which
would reduce its operating profit by 20 percent.</P>
      <P>Calvin Huang, analyst at Daiwa Securities, was also worried that the increase in
labor cost will hurt the company's ability to grab market shares. He maintained
an "underperform" rating for Hon Hai.</P>
      <P>In addition, JPMorgan Chase cut Hon Hai's target price from NT$175 to NT$148,
and Merrill Lynch decreased it from NT$190 to NT$159. But both brokerages kept
their buy rating on the stock, according to media reports.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley expected Hon Hai to stage a rebound in the next two
months and set a target price at NT$150, saying the worst was over after the
company's share prices fell 20 percent in the past month, the reports said.</P>
      <P>The highest target price for Hon Hai -- NT$173 -- came from Credit Suisse, which
reiterated its "outperform" rating for the stock, saying the impact from the pay
hikes would be less than expected and the overall labor cost would become lower
after the company hires more quality workers, a media report said.</P>

      <P>A bridge-building project that Taiwan started in 2009 to foster industrial
cooperation with China is showing results in the information and communication
technology (ICT) sector, according to a high-ranking Taiwanese official
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The project is entering a phase of substantial negotiations" on the
establishment of business links across the Taiwan Strait," said Vice Minister of
Economic Affairs Hwang Jung-chiou at the opening of a two-day cross-strait
meeting in Beijing on industrial cooperation and exchanges.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan's ICT sector has built a complete industrial chain in the
research and production of terminal equipment.</P>
      <P>Thanks to its global logistics capability and its innovation, Taiwan's ICT
sector is now a leader in the world market, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>In China, strong domestic demand has led to the emergence of big suppliers of
telecommunications equipment and solutions, such as Datang Telecom Technology
Co. and Huawei Technologies Co., he noted.</P>
      <P>If the two sides could combine their respective strengths in the ICT field, they
would be able to not only provide high-quality communications solutions in
China, but also make inroads into the global market, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>He said that there has also been progress in cross-strait industrial exchanges
in a wide range of fields, ranging from solar energy,  electric  vehicles  and
Chinese  herbal  medicine  to biotechnology.</P>
      <P>So far, he said, 522 Taiwanese and Chinese enterprises have held business talks
within the project's framework, which has led to the signing of 50 cooperation
agreements or memorandums of understanding.</P>
      <P>Concurring with Hwang's views, Shyu Jyuo-min, president of Taiwan's Industrial
Technology Research Institute, cited as examples of cross-strait cooperation in
the ICT industry the development of Internet-enabled cell phone chips by
Taiwan's MediaTek and Beijing's China Mobile.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan's HTC worked with China Mobile on the customization of smart
phones, and Acer joined forces with MSI China to develop netbooks, Shyu said.</P>
      <P>Other examples include Hon Hai's contract to produce e-readers for China Mobile,
which is also interested in e-paper developed by Delta Electronics, he said.</P>

      <P>The Consumers' Foundation said Wednesday that 25 percent of the bean curd
products it inspected recently contained enough benzoic acid and other chemicals
to cause liver damage or stomach cancer.</P>
      <P>With the approach of the Dragon Boat Festival, many people are buying bean curd
products to stuff the rice dumplings that are popular at this time of year, the
foundation noted.</P>
      <P>However, the foundation said, in its recent inspections, it found that eight out
of the 32 bean curd samples contained excessive levels of the preservative
benzoic acid and traces of fungicide.</P>
      <P>The 32 items included six samples of bean curd noodles, seven samples of deep-
fried tofu, five samples of vegetarian chicken, eight samples of bean curd
squares, and six samples of bean curd sheets, it said.</P>
      <P>One of the bean curd noodle samples purchased at a traditional market in Muzha
was found to contain between 0.6 g/kg and 1.0 g/kg of benzoic acid, which was
over the highest permissible level of 0.6g/kg set by the Department of Health,
it said. Consumption of products containing such high levels of the preservative
could lead to liver damage, the foundation warned.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has banned the use of benzoic acid in deep-fried
tofu, the foundation said traces of the chemical was found in four of the seven
samples purchased at traditional markets in Changchun, Banciao, and at a
Carrefour supermarket in Chungho.</P>
      <P>Other samples of bean curd noodles were found to contain traces of fungicides,
which the foundation said could cause stomach cancer.</P>
      <P>According  to the  Act  Governing  Food  Sanitation,  food manufacturers whose
products are found to contain chemicals in excess of the permitted level could
be subject to fines of between NT$300,000 and NT$150,000, the foundation pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Two or more violations in the space of a year could lead to a revocation of
business licenses and closure of the production unit until corrective action is
taken, the law states. Repeat offenders could be also fined between NT$180,000
and NT$900,000.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>As Taiwan tries to improve ties with old-time foe China to attract more foreign
investment, experts said Wednesday that the tactic works with some investors,
but that others are worried about losing technologies to Chinese firms.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to have an edge over main rival South Korea in attracting
foreign investors after Taiwan signs a pact for more liberalized trade with
China later this month, the head of Taiwan's top economic planning body said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors can invest in the mainland through Taiwan and their investment
in China will be protected under the economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA), Christina Liu, chairwoman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Recent media reports have said China and South Korea will start talks on a free
trade agreement later this year or early next year.</P>
      <P>Liu said Taiwan already has advantages over South Korea.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has cut its corporate income tax to 17 percent, while South Korea's
stands at 22 percent," Liu said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan also better understands the mainland," she added.</P>
      <P>As a result, Liu predicts the ECFA will prompt international companies with
major manufacturing bases in China to choose Taiwanese companies as strategic
partners.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, better relations between Taiwan and China have resulted
in opening Taiwan to direct cross-strait flights, tourists and investment.</P>
      <P>Polaris Research Institute President Liang Kuo-yuan told the CNA Wednesday that
South Korea is closely monitoring progress on the Taiwan-China trade pact as it
is aware the agreement will negatively affect South Korea.</P>
      <P>But he also said that although the trade pact and a cultural background similar
to China's would give Taiwan advantages, it would be difficult for Taiwan to
lure many of South Korea's existing foreign partners because they have "long-
established connections."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liang said that international investors have yet to act as it is
unclear what industries in Taiwan will first enjoy tariff reductions from the
trade pact.</P>
      <P>"They are still waiting to see what 'great benefits' will come from the trade
pact," he said.</P>
      <P>Yang Chia-yen, a director at the Taiwan Institute for Economic Research, told
the CNA Wednesday that the trade pact would appeal to foreign companies that
want to enter the Chinese market by working with Taiwanese partners.</P>
      <P>But there is another group of foreign companies who are concerned that Chinese
companies might learn their technologies, he said.</P>
      <P>"In the field of machinery, some foreign companies don't want to work with
Taiwanese companies because they are worried that their technologies might go to
China," he said.</P>
      <P>Although the Taiwan government said that the trade pact will include
intellectual property rights protection, it is difficult to carry it out in
reality, which triggers concerns, Yang said.</P>
      <P>He said he learned about this from recently interviewing people who have
contacts with companies in countries including Japan, Germany, Switzerland and
the United States.</P>
      <P>The director also said that foreign companies might relocate investments from
Taiwan to China if some industries move their production there.</P>
      <P>"For example, if a lot of flat panel manufacturers move to China, foreign
companies, such as Corning Inc., will follow suit, " Yang said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government recently eased restrictions on flat panel manufacturers
investing in China, he noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is an important overseas investment destination for the U.S.-based
Corning as the country is a major flat panel maker, Yang said.</P>

      <P>Hangzhou on Wednesday became the first Chinese city to open a tourism office in
Taiwan, with the aim of tapping into fast-growing Taiwan tourist market.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening ceremony in Taipei, Hangzhou City Deputy Mayor Dong
Guili said that last year her city attracted over 53 million tourists, 2.3
million of whom were from abroad.</P>
      <P>A total of 420,000 Taiwanese visited the city in Zhejian province in 2009, which
was the largest of number of overseas tourists to Hangzhou, and that figure has
been climbing steadily, she said.</P>
      <P>From January to April this year, more than 150,000 tourists from Taiwan visited
Hangzhou, accounting for 20 percent of all overseas visitors, the deputy mayor
said.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Taiwan is also seeing more tourist arrivals from Hangzhou. In
the first four months of this year, 90,000 Hangzhou residents visited Taiwan,
which represents a 92 percent growth rate compared to the same period last year.</P>
      <P>At the new Hangzhou tourism office,  which was opened in collaboration with
Taiwan's Lion Travel, there are displays of Hangzhou's indigenous tea, silk
products and old rare books. Visitors can also surf the Internet on computers
provided by the office, to obtain information about the Chinese city.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Travel Quality Assurance Association said that other Chinese cities in
Shangdong and Jiangsu provinces are also expected to set up similar offices in
Taiwan in the near future.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou ordered the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) and the
National Police Agency (NPA) Wednesday to produce visible results in their fight
against crime and to institute better discipline in the police force, within one
month.</P>
      <P>Ma issued the directive at a weekly meeting of the ruling Kuomintang's decision-
making Central Standing Committee, in his capacity as party chairman, after a
series of daytime gunfights in the central city of Taichung.</P>
      <P>In the latest gangland killing in Taichung on May 28, Weng Chi-nan, a local
crime boss, was shot dead in the presence of four city police officers who were
playing mahjong at Weng's office at the time.</P>
      <P>Surveillance footage released by the police bureau June 7 also showed that five
other city police officers visited Weng's office between May 24 and May 28.</P>
      <P>Ma said the MOI and the NPA should step up their crime-fighting efforts,
particularly against organized crime, in order to provide a safe living
environment for the people of the country.</P>
      <P>Special attention should be given to the penetration of crime rings into local
school campuses, Ma told Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah, who is the head of the
nation's police force.</P>
      <P>Ma also asked Premier Wu Den-yih to call a meeting of local government chiefs
once every month on issues of law and order in various parts of the country.</P>
      <P>During his eight-year tenure as mayor of Taipei, Ma said, he hosted an inter-
agency meeting twice a month on public order issues.</P>
      <P>"Unless I was on an overseas trip, I had never skipped those meetings, " Ma
recalled. "I'm convinced that success in the fight against organized crime
hinges on the determination  of local government heads and the importance they
attach to this issue."</P>
      <P>On police discipline and integrity, Ma said it is a longstanding problem that
requires long-term efforts.</P>
      <P>"First of all, the police supervisory mechanism should be reinforced," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The NPA and the MOI should review whether individual police officers responsible
for internal supervision and the divisions that handle police ethics are
carrying out their duties, Ma said.</P>
      <P>His suggestion was made against the background of the replacement of the
Taichung City Police Bureau chief after it was determined that the investigation
into the May 28 shooting  was sloppy  and perfunctory.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Executive Yuan promulgated an ethical code of conduct for police
detectives two years ago, Ma said he hopes all detectives will observe the fine
lines drawn in the code and adhere strictly to the rules.</P>
      <P>If necessary, Ma said, the ethical code should be updated to give more detailed
and specific guidelines for policemen, detectives and high-ranking police
officers to follow.</P>
      <P>Even though official statistics show that crime-solving rates have been
improving in Taiwan, people's feelings about public order are equally important,
Ma said.</P>
      <P>"The NPA should conduct regular public opinion surveys at both the national and
community level to gain a better idea of public opinion on law and order," he
added.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung City government Wednesday said its competition for the design of
the Kaohsiung Maritime Cultural and Popular Music Center has attracted entries
from 135 international architecture teams around the world.</P>
      <P>The 12.5-hectare property that spans from pier 11 to 15 of the Kaohsiung Harbor
will be the future home of the center, which is scheduled to be dedicated in
2015.</P>
      <P>The Council of Cultural Affairs originally set the overall construction budget
at NT$4 billion (US$123 million) for a pop music center. However, the figure was
bumped to the current NT$5.45 billion when the Executive Yuan decided the center
should also include elements involving maritime culture.</P>
      <P>According to Chung Wan-shun, the chief of the Construction Office under the
Public Works Bureau, the possibility of landing a lucrative bid has attracted
numerous international teams to enter the design competition.</P>
      <P>The call was announced at the end of May and his office received applications
from 135 teams from across the globe, including the U.S., Japan, Russia, Italy
and Bulgaria, he said.</P>
      <P>Chung said the center will become a major city landmark. The city government
hopes the structure will increase the city's international visibility as well as
reflect the country's efforts to promote eco-friendly buildings.</P>
      <P>The winner was originally scheduled to be announced on June 8, but due to a
delay in the selection of judges, the city government decided to postpone the
decision to an unspecified date.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou told servicemen on the frontline Matsu Islands Wednesday
that despite the fact that Taiwan is seeking further detente in the Taiwan
Strait by negotiating a trade pact with China, they should remain on high alert.</P>

      <P>Ma visited an observation deck on the 1.3-square kilometer Gaodeng Isle to look

to inspect the troops there. Both Gaodeng and Liang Isle lie less than 10 miles
off the coast of Fujian.</P>
      <P>Expressing concern about the readiness of the Taiwan military, President Ma told
the soldiers that Taiwan must remain on high alert in the face of China's

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Wednesday it is working
with think tanks to establish a platform for dialogue and exchanges between
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said the party is not opposed to talks and
exchanges between Taiwan and China, but it does not support the stance of
eventual unification of the two sides.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Tsai said, the party does not permit its members in public office
to engage in formal exchanges between Taiwan and China, such as the upcoming
Straits Forum to be held in China this month or the forum in July between the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the Chinese Communist Party.</P>
      <P>The platform that the DPP has in mind will not be a party mechanism, but rather
a public one that will accommodate officials and the general public, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>It will be established on the basis of equality and respect and should not
include political preconditions, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, it will demonstrate to the Chinese government and people the
values that Taiwanese hold dear, such as democracy and sovereignty, a position
that he said the KMT does not represent and does not discuss.</P>
      <P>The mechanism is still in the planning stages and there is no timeline for its
development, he said.</P>
      <P>The DPP's announcement of its plans to establish a platform for cross-strait
exchanges came on the heels of a statement last month by the party's chairwoman
Tsai Ing-wen that the party will not rule out the possibility of direct dialogue
with China as long as there are no political preconditions.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has long impressed Hong Kong visitors with its food and now it is
promoting wedding and medical tourism at a Hong Kong travel fair to draw more
visitors to the country, officials of Taiwan's Tourism Bureau said at a press
event Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau officials, Taiwan is among the five biggest delegations
that have an official presence at the Hong Kong Travel Expo from June 10-13, and
it plans to highlight wedding photo shoots, medical tourism, and spas and
resorts at this year's event.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has many scenic spots, such as Sun Moon Lake, the northern coast and the
islet of Liuqiu off the southwestern coast, which are perfect settings for
wedding photo shoots, they said, adding that these attractions are gaining
popularity among Hong Kong couples about to be wed.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese  travel agents are also teaming up with medical institutions to offer
tour packages that include high-end medical examinations, in view of the fact
that medical services in Taiwan cost less than in Hong Kong, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Noting that some 720,000 Hong Kong travelers visited Taiwan in 2009, up 16.19
percent from 2008, Chen Zao-ming, the Tourism Bureau's representative in Hong
Kong, said "we expect the number of visitors from Hong Kong this year to
increase by 4.5 percent from last year."</P>
      <P>Hong Kong residents will see Taiwan as a more attractive destination once Taiwan
starts allowing them visa-free entry, he added.</P>
      <P>According to a survey released by MasterCard Wednesday, 56 percent of Hong Kong

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hon Hai Precision Industry, the world's</P>
      <P>biggest contract electronics maker, is planning to relocate its advanced
processing operations from China to Taiwan amid rising labor costs in China, a
Taiwan economics official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Terry Gou, the founder and chairman of Hon Hai, has been in discussions since
late last year with Taiwan's Ministry of Economics Affairs on the possibility of
setting up a unmanned factory near the company's headquarters in Tucheng City,
northern Taiwan, said the official who asked not to be named.</P>
      <P>However, there is no available space for the factory at the moment, the official
told the Central News Agency, adding that the ministry is working to solve the
problem.</P>
      <P>"Hon Hai does not plan to move its factory in Shenzhen back to Taiwan, the
official said. "Instead, it wants to relocate its advanced processing
operation."</P>
      <P>Hon Hai has been in the spotlight since early this year when the first of 12
workers at its Shenzhen factory committed suicide.</P>
      <P>In addition to Hon Hai, at least two other Taiwanese electronics companies plan
to return to Taiwan because workers at their China factories are demanding
higher wages, the official said.</P>
      <P>These companies want the ministry to help them find a location for their
factories and allow them to hire more foreign workers, the official disclosed.</P>
      <P>As wages in Taiwan are relatively high, it will not make economic sense for
companies to relocate from China and engage in the processing operations that
they now have there, the official said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Chi-tung, the deputy head of an association of China-based Taiwanese
businesses, told reporters Wednesday that many Taiwanese companies want to
return from China but the Taiwan government will first have to help them deal
with the problem of labor shortage.</P>
      <P>He noted that while there are Indonesian and Filipino workers in Taiwan who
would accept lower wages than Taiwanese workers, there is the problem of
language and cultural barriers.</P>
      <P>To deal with this problem, the Taiwan government should allow Chinese workers
into Taiwan, he suggested.</P>
      <P>At a press conference after Hon Hai's shareholders meeting the previous day, Gou
said that his company will relocate some of its production lines to central and
western China to capitalize on the cheaper labor there.</P>
      <P>Chien Pei-pin, a senior analyst with Digitimes Research, told CNA Wednesday that
central and western China could be the next major production sites for
electronics companies, as the Chinese government plans to step up the
development of those areas in the next decade.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Negotiators meet in Beijing on ECFA 'early harvest' list</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's chief negotiator for a trade pact with China is visiting Beijing to
discuss inclusion of several key industries in an "early harvest" program for
concessionary tariff treatment, sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , left for Beijing Tuesday to meet Chinese
counterpart Tang Wei, director of the Department of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau
Affairs under China's Ministry of Commerce, on the signing of the much-
anticipated economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), the sources said.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the ongoing undisclosed Huang-Tang talks focused on
inclusion of Taiwan's machine tool and petrochemical industries in the "early
harvest" list for tariff waivers under the proposed trade pact.</P>
      <P>The results of the informal talks will decide whether a third formal round of
ECFA talks will take place next week to pave the way for sealing the accord by
the end of this month as originally expected, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang would not comment Wednesday on
reports about Huang's visit to Beijing, but said a third formal round of ECFA
talks will definitely be held in a transparent manner.</P>
      <P>"Holding a third formal round is necessary because both sides should examine and
confirm the outcome of negotiations, " Shih said.</P>
      <P>Shih reportedly met China's Minister of Commerce Chen Deming on the sidelines of
a ministerial meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Japan
last week. They held policy talks on the content of the "early harvest" list
that will form the backbone of the ECFA, a scaled-down free trade agreement
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Media reports said Huang is now in Beijing making last-ditch efforts to seek a
breakthrough to deadlocked talks on the inclusion of machine tool, polypropylene
and PVC industries in the "early harvest" list for tariff exemptions or
reductions.</P>
      <P>If satisfactory results are achieved in the ongoing Huang-Tang talks, the
reports said, a third round of ECFA talks will be held in Beijing next week.</P>
      <P>Since the second round of talks took place in Taiwan March 31-April 1, the two
sides have held several rounds of informal talks to try to sort out their
differences, MOEA sources said.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following the spate of suicides among its Chinese workers, Taiwan-registered
Foxconn Group recently announced two waves of pay hikes that will in effect
double the workers' wages.</P>
      <P>For more than a decade, China has deliberately kept the pay of its workers at
low levels, which was like putting the labor force in a pressure cooker. The
Foxconn pay hikes, however, have uncovered the cooker. If not handled properly,
the incident could lead to widespread effects that would cost China dearly.</P>
      <P>Other Chinese workers may follow suit and demand that their pay be doubled. For
most Taiwanese businesses in China, doubling the pay for their workers would be
an unbearable weight. The widening labor-capital gap would inevitably lead to a
labor movement and strikes.</P>
      <P>In the short run, China-based Taiwanese businesses would suffer from higher
production costs and lower profits, while the social unrest in China would
worsen, leading China farther and farther away from a "harmonious society."</P>
      <P>In the long run, the strike campaign would damage the harmony and mutual trust
between labor and capital, which would in turn undermine investment intentions
and lead businesses to close their operations there.</P>
      <P>The possible repercussions of the Foxconn situation deserve our attention. (June

      <P>Taiwan's northern  seaport Keelung established  sister-port ties with Belgium's
Port of Zeebrugge Thursday, paving the way to further enhance exchanges.</P>
      <P>Wang Chun-yu, director-general of the Keelung Harbor Bureau, and Joachim Coens,
president of Port Authority Zeebrugge,  jointly presided over a sister-port
ceremony in Keelung.</P>
      <P>The agreement is expected to further enhance ties between Taiwan and Belgium in
the fields of maritime transportation and logistics, said Benoit Ryelandt,
director of the Belgian Office in Taipei, who was among guests witnessing the
signing ceremony.</P>
      <P>Both  Keelung  and  Zeebrugge  are  medium-sized,  highly industrialized and
export-oriented economies generating significant volumes of international trade.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Belgium are also situated at strategic locations for international
trade and both can rely on major seaports to bolster their economic presence
worldwide, Ryelandt said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is a fast-growing East Asian hub and an important link for international
trade between the Far East and America and Europe, while Belgium is a gateway to
the integrated European market of 500 million consumers.</P>
      <P>"Once combined, the clout of both sides can generate tremendous synergies,"
Ryelandt said.</P>
      <P>"Taking this into account, there is no doubt that the cooperation between the
two port authorities will be a win-win opportunity, " he added.</P>

      <P>While attending an event marking World Ocean Day Tuesday, President  Ma Ying-
jeou came across Coast Guard Administration Minister Wang Ginn-wang in the
elevator and was told of a conference held by the Coast Guard on the Pratas
Islands last year.</P>
      <P>Apparently misunderstanding what he had heard, Ma later told his audience in his
formal speech that the Coast Guard was planning to invite experts to the Pratas
for an international conference. He praised the plan as "very rare" and said it
would allow Taiwan to declare its sovereignty over the Pratas "in a different
way."</P>
      <P>The incident raised some questions about Ma's personal style. First, how could
the president have included such "hearsay" in a pre-arranged speech? Is he using
the same casual manner in making his policies?</P>
      <P>Second, Ma obviously was not aware there was a meeting on the Pratas last year.
Does he lack complete comprehension of all other government affairs?</P>
      <P>Third, Ma was releasing information he had just received a few minutes prior
without checking the facts. Has he ever done any deep and serious pondering
before speaking?</P>
      <P>This shows the president is speaking a different language from other people in
this country, and it is not an isolated incident.</P>
      <P>In the wake of Foxconn Group's decision to raise the pay for its Chinese
workers, Taiwan's electrical and electronics manufacturers have indicated their
intention to transfer their operations in China to other developing countries in
Asia. Ma, however, is still insisting on signing an economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China this month. Is this not the most
ridiculous example of Ma speaking a different language? (June 10, 2010)</P>

      <P>Taiwan's government is working hard in an attempt to convince Taiwanese
companies to relocate production lines back to their home turf from China amid
surging wages there.</P>
      <P>In a recent interview with the Economic Daily News, Minister of Economic Affairs
Shih Yen-shiang revealed that a leading business group will return to Taiwan for
investment in the near future.</P>
      <P>Shih was referring to Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the parent of the world's
largest electronics contract manufacturer, China-based Foxconn Technology Group.</P>
      <P>Industry sources said the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is helping Hon Hai
find a suitable location to accommodate its massive investment project. Once Hon
Hai comes up with a detailed blueprint, the ministry will also assist it in
resolving power, water and labor force issues, the sources said.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>MOEA officials familiar with the Hon Hai investment plan said the ministry has
assigned staff to help with the group's land acquisition bid in hopes that Hon
Hai's new high-end production lines will generate jobs to lower the country's
unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>The ministry also hopes the Hon Hai project will inspire other Taiwanese
enterprises to follow suit by launching new investment programs on their home
turf to cash in on the recently lowered corporate income tax rate (from 20
percent to 17 percent) under the Industrial Innovation Act, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Wednesday the government has taken a number of measures
to lure Taiwanese companies back to Taiwan amid a changing business environment
in China, where wages are skyrocketing and labor supply is no longer abundant.</P>
      <P>Officials from economics and labor affairs agencies also said they are seeking
ways to help companies  reduce labor costs, particularly those related to hiring
foreign laborers, in order to enhance incentives to lure back Taiwanese
investors. (June 10, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>After Foxconn and Japanese automaker Honda Co. significantly raised basic wages
for workers at their factories in southern China to quell labor unrest, their
peers in other major Chinese industrial hubs have felt the pinch.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese information technology companies in the Pearl River Delta and the
Yangtze River Delta are worried workers at their plants will go on strike to
force wage hikes.</P>
      <P>The manager of a Taiwanese-owned factory in Shanghai said Chinese authorities
have asked Taiwanese corporations in the Shanghai and Kunshan areas to offer
psychological counseling services for their workers, many of whom are migrants
from China's rural areas and need help coping with their new lives in the big
cities. (June 10, 2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Ling Chia-yuh, director of the MOEA's Department of Investment Services,  said
Wednesday the government  can offer customized assistance to Taiwanese companies
willing to launch new investment projects in their homeland.</P>
      <P>With wages rising quickly and furiously in China, Ling said his department will
sponsor a seminar June 15 on luring China-based Taiwanese companies to come back
for investment. More than 300 Taiwanese businessmen have registered for the
meeting, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Ling, the MOEA will offer assistance in land acquisition, special
loans, R&amp;D subsidies and manpower resourcing for businesses intending to
invest in their home turf. (June 10, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Christina Liu, the new chairwoman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, has on several occasions pledged to lead Taiwan back to the top
position among Asia's "four little dragons." We hope this is a goal that can
truly be achieved, rather than one that only ends up a disappointment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which was the top "dragon" 20 years ago, has fallen to the bottom spot
in the last eight years because of various political, economic and social
factors.</P>
      <P>For example, during the authoritarian period led by the late President  Chiang
Ching-kuo,  the  government's  policy  was "economy-oriented" and focused on
economic development and exports.</P>
      <P>After former President Lee Teng-hui declared a "go slow, be patient" policy
toward China in 1996, the government's policy changed to become "politics-
oriented."  Then a "de-sinicization" policy tantamount to a closed-door approach
was adopted after the Democratic Progressive Party came to power in 2000.
Vicious partisan struggle and ethnic rifts during this period dragged down the
economy.</P>
      <P>Since the inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou, Taiwan has recovered its
"economy-oriented" policy. However, partisan struggle remains a problem, and
there has not been any progress in terms of our administrative and legislative
efficiency.</P>
      <P>The wisdom, resolve and fortitude of the government will be put to the test if
Taiwan is to return to the top position in the coming four or six years. (June

    <TEXT>
      <P>Flat panel maker Chimei Innolux Corp.'s sales value in May was affected by
falling product prices, while sales volume of its large-sized panels recorded a
mild increase compared with April, an analyst said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chimei Innolux said Wednesday it posted NT$49.68 billion (US$1.53 billion) in
sales for May. Although the figure was down 0.5 percent from April, shipments of
large-sized panels, the company's major products, rose 3 percent month-on-month
to 11.75 million units. Large-sized panels are defined as those 10 inches or
above.</P>
      <P>Rival AU Optronics (AUO) earlier reported NT$43.8 billion in May sales, up 6.4
percent from April, while shipments of its large-sized panels hit a record high
of 10.23 million units, up 6 percent from a month earlier, boosted by strong
demand for TV screens.</P>
      <P>Large-sized flat panels are used in TVs, desktop computers and notebook
computers.</P>
      <P>Jeff Chang, an analyst with Grand Cathay Securities, said large-sized panels for
TV screens have appeared resilient in terms of pricing on demand growth, beating
out those for monitors and notebook computers.</P>
      <P>"Panels for TVs accounted for less than 40 percent of Chimei Innolux's total
sales, but the weighting in AUO was almost 50 percent," Chang said.</P>
      <P>"That's why AUO weathered the falls in average selling prices in May, but Chimei
Innolux's sales declined slightly," he added.</P>
      <P>Chang said the global electronics sector will enter its peak season in July and
the impact from falling average sales prices is expected to be alleviated.</P>
      <P>In May, Chimei Innolux shipments of small and medium-sized panels dropped 4
percent from April to 36.38 million units.</P>
      <P>Chang said the fall in small and medium-sized panels is expected not to cause
concern as the segment only made up about 10 percent of the company's sales.</P>

      <P>At its board of trustees meeting on May 27, the AIU agreed to accept academic
degrees from all 167 Taiwanese universities. It means that Indian nationals who
study in Taiwan will have their university degrees recognized in India, MOE
officials said.</P>
      <P>Most Indian students in Taiwan are studying for doctorates at top-notch
universities. The number of doctorate candidates from India tops those from any
other foreign country, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>Currently, about 500 Indian students are enrolled in Taiwan's universities,
according to the MOE.</P>
      <P>India's 497 universities and colleges enroll about 3 million students annually,
and about 500,000 graduates  pursue higher education in the United States,
Canada, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and other countries.</P>

      <P>Nearly 40 percent of last year's university graduates are still unemployed,
mostly because of a lack of foreign language and professional skills, according
to a recent online survey by a job bank.</P>
      <P>The 104 Job Bank poll found that 62 percent of last year's graduates have found
jobs, while 38 percent are still unemployed.</P>
      <P>When asked what was the biggest obstacle to the employment of people in that
group, employers as well the graduates themselves said a lack of foreign
language and professional skills.</P>
      <P>The employers surveyed scored the 2009 graduates highest in the area of
communications skills, while the graduates said they perform best in the areas
of computer skills and time management.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, about 78 percent of corporate employers said there was a gap between
school training and job requirements.</P>
      <P>According to Huang Han-sheng, head of the job bank's learning Web site, about 70
percent of employers are likely to interview graduates who have professional
certificates. He encouraged graduates to obtain professional certificates in
order to land better jobs.</P>

      <P>Franz Collection Inc., a Taiwanese company that makes high-quality porcelain,
said Thursday that its operations in China will not be affected by rising wages
there because it does not adhere to a low-cost strategy.</P>
      <P>According to Franz CEO Francis Chen, the company instead has adopted the Blue
Ocean Strategy, which means that it strives to create new demand in an
uncontested market space rather than compete with other suppliers for existing
customers.</P>
      <P>He said he is not considering moving the Franz factory out of China, but instead
will expand the product line to include more items, from tableware for everyday
use to luxury furniture for hotels, in a bid to reinvent the public's perception
of porcelain products.</P>
      <P>"I think that is the right decision, " he told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>It has been reported that a number of Taiwan companies in China are considering
relocation as a decision by Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Hon Hai -- known
in China as Foxconn --- to sharply increase the pay of its factory workers is
likely to set off a trend of rising wages in industry there.</P>
      <P>"We  are  not  affected  by this  situation  because  our competitiveness is not
based on low-cost production," said Chen.</P>
      <P>Franz's products are made in the town of Jingde in Jingxi Province, which is
known as the Porcelain Capital of China because of its 1,700 years history of
quality porcelain production.</P>
      <P>Franz journey to prominence has been a long one, from its establishment as an
original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to its development as a internationally
recognized brand, Chen said.</P>
      <P>This year, he said, a collection of Franz items that were produced in
collaboration with French designer Jean Boggio will go on display at Bergdorf
Goodman, a luxury department store in Manhattan, New York City, from August to
December.</P>
      <P>"It is no mean achievement to be invited to display products at this department
store, " Chen said. "It is famous for its successful promotion of brands and
designers such Christian Dior, Olivier Theyskens, Giorgio Armani Prive, Jean-
Paul Gaultier and Vionnet when they were new names."</P>

      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) filed a misfeasance suit against 12
members of the Referendum Screening Committee Thursday in protest against their
rejection of the latest referendum initiative by the party.</P>
      <P>The case was lodged in the Taipei District Prosecutors Office by TSU Secretary-
General Lin Jih-jia.</P>
      <P>In a written statement, TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei accused the committee
members of damaging Taiwan's democratic system by turning down the initiative --
on the strength of personal views -- which was endorsed by more than 109,000
citizens.</P>
      <P>Huang urged the committee to reconsider its decision "so as not to disgrace
Taiwan's democracy."</P>
      <P>The question in the TSU referendum initiative asked: "Do you agree that the
government should sign an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China? " On June 3, it was voted down 12-4 by the committee, on grounds that it
did not conform to the law.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, the TSU on Wednesday started the second phase of its signature
drive for the ECFA referendum proposal. It also launched a new petition for a
referendum on whether the Referendum Screening Committee should be abolished.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the TSU's latest move, ruling Kuomintang Legislator Wu Yu-sheng
said the pro-independence party should respect the committee's ruling and "stop

      <P>A big haul of rare birds, including the highly prized laughing thrush --
garrulax canorus -- were seized and destroyed  on Taiwan's outlying island of
Kinmen Thursday  in accordance  with  quarantine  regulations,  the  Coast
Guard Administration (CGA) said that day.</P>
      <P>Kinmen coast guard personnel obtained a radar spotting of a motorized sampan out
of Dadeng Island, off China's Xiamen City, and intercepted the vessel after it
sneaked into Yangshan Bay in northern Kinmen, the CGA's Kinmen Coastal Patrol
Office said.</P>
      <P>The two fishermen aboard the sampan, later identified as Zhang Qingchun and
Zhang Lingyi, threw 10 cages of birds into the sea before trying to flee.</P>
      <P>The two men, their boat and all the cages containing the birds, were brought to
Kinmen's major port of Shueitou for investigation.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine
under the Council of Agriculture counted the smuggled birds and found 25 of the
laughing thrushes, 487 Japanese white-eyes and 163 scaly-breasted munia. Half of
them had already drowned.</P>
      <P>After collecting samples of the smuggled birds, the Kinmen quarantine officials
euthanized them, the CGA officials said. China is a bird flu-affected country
and first announced human cases of bird flu in 2005.</P>
      <P>The two men told investigators they were hired to transport the birds from
Dadeng Island to waters near Kinmen, where they were supposed to have made a
local contact via mobile phone for delivery.</P>
      <P>They were handed over to the Kinmen District Prosecutors Office for further
investigation on charges of smuggling and violations of the Wildlife
Conservation Act, CGA officials said.</P>
      <P>The birds were believed to have been bound for Taiwan proper, where there is a
thriving market. The street value in Taiwan for the laughing thrush averages
about NT$30,000 (US$926), while the Japanese white-eye could fetch
NT$2,000-NT$3,000 per bird, according to Kinmen CGA officials.</P>

      <P>Large cap stocks led Taiwan shares on a technical rebound Thursday as investors
took advantage of low valuations after recent heavy losses, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index closed up 110.10 points or 1.55 percent at 7,181.77, after
moving between 7,085.34 and 7,182.99, on turnover of NT$65.66 billion (US$2.02).</P>
      <P>The market opened 0.88 percent up on bargain hunting and the momentum extended
until the end of the session as investors bought into market heavyweights,
encouraged by gains posted by other markets in the region such as Japan, Hong
Kong and South Korea, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,826 stocks closed up and 966 down, with 292 unchanged.</P>
      <P>The textile sector posted the largest gains, rising 2.4 percent. The foodstuff
sector closed up 2.1 percent, the financial sector was 1.7 percent higher,
machinery and electronics were up 1.6 percent and construction climbed 1.4
percent.</P>
      <P>The plastics and chemical sector rose 1.3 percent, cement added 1.2 percent and
the paper and pulp sector grew 0.8 percent.</P>
      <P>"After yesterday's selling, it seems that investors have left behind the impact
from rising wages in China, at least for the moment," President Securities
analyst Vickie Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>"To many  investors,  in particular  foreign  institutional investors, Taiwan's
large cap stocks look very attractive after being battered by earnings
concerns," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said concerns about possible reduced consumption in Europe due to debt
problems have been partially digested in the local bourse.</P>
      <P>"So bargain hunters turned active today, ignoring a fall on Wall Street
overnight," she said.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai Precision closed up 3.52 percent at NT$117.50, while Foxconn Technology
gained 5.39 percent to NT$107.50.</P>
      <P>Nan Ya Plastics gained 2.42 percent to NT$50.80 and Far Eastern New Century
added 2.14 percent to NT$33.35.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that after Thursday's rebound, the local bourse has become
technically healthier.</P>
      <P>"I expect that after the market absorbed selling in the past few sessions, the
index will see support above the key 7,000-point mark in the short term, " Hsieh
said.</P>
      <P>The transport  sector  was boosted  by hopes  that closer cross-strait business
ties will lift demand, with China Airlines up 5.36 percent at NT$14.75 and EVA
Airways 4.19 percent higher at NT$17.40.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) , the world's largest contract
chipmaker, said Thursday that its sales in May hit a record high, with analysts
saying the company has benefited from strong global demand for consumer
electronics.</P>
      <P>TSMC posted sales of NT$34.82 billion (US$1.07 billion) in May, up 3 percent
from April and up 37.9 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>It was the consecutive second month the microchip maker had broken its monthly
sales record.</P>
      <P>In the first five months of this year, TSMC's sales totaled NT$160.82 billion,
up 84.4 percent from a year ago.</P>
      <P>"Like its rival, United Microelectronics Corp (UMC) , TSMC's strong performance
was within expectations, as the global economy is on the road to recovery,"
Concord Securities analyst Jim Cheng said.</P>
      <P>May sales of UMC, the world's second-largest contract chipmaker, hit a 30-month
high to reach NT$10.09 billion, up 8.27 percent from a month earlier and up
34.28 percent from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Cheng said TSMC's major customers, such as Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc. and
Broadcom Corp., have placed large orders since the beginning of this year on an
upbeat outlook on global personal computer and cell phone sales.</P>
      <P>"It is no surprise to see that TSMC has enjoyed full production capacity on
these large orders," Cheng said</P>
      <P>"With a buying spree ahead of the Christmas season, the full capacity
utilization will continue into the third quarter. We will see TSMC's sales
continue to grow," he forecast.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A decrease in visits to Taiwan by U.S. Congress members in recent years can be
attributed to some structural reasons and does not indicate weaker support for
Taiwan, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Harry Tseng, director-general of the Department of North American
Affairs, the focus of the government's diplomatic policy toward the United
States is not how many members of the U.S. Congress have visited Taiwan, but how
much support has been obtained.</P>
      <P>"An overly quantitative assessment would take the issue out of context," Tseng
said.</P>
      <P>The arrival of Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) , Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) and
Mark Udall (D-Co.) in Taiwan on June 4 marked the first visit by U.S. senators
since President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>Citing U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif.) who visited Taiwan in April, Tseng
said fewer U.S. Congress members are visiting Taiwan because the U.S. political
environment is different from in the past, but the situation should not be
interpreted  to mean reduced congressional support for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The fact that there are now fewer domestic controversies in Taiwan means it is
not that pressing for U.S. politicians to visit, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>Also, he said, U.S. Congress members continue to face pressure from China, which
is why they have been trying to keep their Taiwan visits low-profile.</P>
      <P>According to the official, Senators Feinstein, Hagan and Udall had planned to
visit only China, but they later added Taiwan to their itinerary because of the
efforts of Taiwan's representative office in the United States.</P>
      <P>After they wrapped up their China visit, the group flew directly from Shanghai
to Taipei's Songshan Airport aboard a U.S. military plane, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>Feinstein departed Taiwan aboard her private jet, while Hagan and Udall took a
United Airlines flight, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan hopeful beef issue will not hinder resumption of TIFA talks</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 10 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government hopes the controversy over its partial ban on American beef
imports will not hinder a potential resumption  of Trade and Investment
Framework Agreement (TIFA) negotiations with the United States before the end of
the year, a foreign affairs official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"For Taiwan, the U.S. beef issue is closed, but apparently this is not the case
for the U.S. Hopefully, it will not affect the TIFA negotiations,"  said Harry
Tseng, director-general of the Department of North American Affairs under the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Raymond Burghardt told a media
roundtable in Taipei June 4 that the beef row is a "lingering issue" because
U.S. senators and the U.S. government see Taiwan's market as still not totally
open to U.S. beef due to "non-scientific" reasoning.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's legislature passed an amendment in January to the Act Governing Food
Safety that bans imports of various beef products from countries with documented
cases of mad cow disease in the past decade. The amendment effectively bars U.S.
ground beef, beef offal and other beef parts such as skulls and eyes from
Taiwan's market, in contravention of a bilateral beef trade protocol signed by
the two countries last October.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that the banned items -- ground beef, beef offal and other parts --
only account for a few percent of Taiwan's U.S. beef imports and that U.S. beef
exporters have made profits from the Taiwanese market since the Taiwan-U.S. beef
protocol went into effect.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, that will ease some of the opposition (to the partial ban), " he
said.</P>
      <P>Tseng also expressed hope that the TIFA talks will resume before the end of the
year -- as Burghardt mentioned in the media roundtable -- because "it's not
worthwhile for both the U.S. and Taiwan to let other economic and trade issues
be kidnapped by the beef dispute" as the trade volume of U.S. beef is only a
tiny part of the total two-way trade volume.</P>
      <P>On the TIFA talks, Burghardt said Taiwan and the U.S. have agreed that the last
round of talks under the TIFA -- a deputy ministerial meeting held in July 2007
-- was too long ago and that new talks should take place before the end of the
year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the U.S. both understand the importance of the TIFA negotiations
because they cover a wide range of topics related to bilateral economic
relations, Tseng said, adding that the talks would provide a much-needed
platform for both sides to resolve economic and trade problems.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Not all dip slopes sensitive or dangerous: expert</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A geology expert said Thursday that people who live on the so-called dip slopes
in Taiwan need not worry too much about their safety as not all sites of this
type are sensitive or vulnerable to geological disasters.</P>
      <P>However, people should pay close attention to areas which are classified as
geologically sensitive in the geology bill that is being legislated to help
prevent catastrophic landslides, said Lin Chao-tsung, director of the Ministry
of Economic Affairs' Central Geological Survey.</P>
      <P>"The dip slopes that are genuinely sensitive areas will be identified by the
government in the Geology Act," Lin said at a press conference that was hosted
by opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tien Chiu-chin.</P>
      <P>In geological terms, a dip slope is a slope of the surface of the land
determined by and conforming approximately to the dip of the underlying rocks.</P>
      <P>Lin said that while areas identified as geologically sensitive may be dangerous
from a scientific point of view, it does not necessarily mean that landslides or
other types of geological disasters would occur there any time soon.</P>
      <P>"There may be no landslides in such areas during our lifetime, " he said.</P>
      <P>However, the sites classified as geologically sensitive would undeniably be more
sensitive than other areas, he said.</P>
      <P>Lin was responding to Legislator Tien, who asked about the possibility of panic
among residents whose homes are located on sites that may be identified as
sensitive areas.</P>
      <P>The government would not publicize the list of sensitive areas without first
going through detailed surveys and having the list screened by specialists,
scholars and public office representatives, Lin said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the contents of the Geology Act would be reviewed
periodically to update the scientific data, and the list of geologically
sensitive areas may be revised based on the new data.</P>
      <P>Tien called for the Geology Act to be passed as soon as possible, even it
requires an extra legislative session. The legislature is now in summer recess.</P>

      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait will not exchange "early harvest" lists for a
proposed cross-strait trade pact during a third round of talks on the deal,
Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait  economic cooperation framework agreement's (ECFA's) early
harvest lists of each side, which form the backbone of the pact, include items
that will be subject to immediate tariff reductions or exemptions, or improved
market access, upon the signing of the pact.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chi-liang said Thursday that his
department is aware of a serious shortage of hospital beds in medical centers
and promised to remedy the situation.</P>
      <P>Yaung made the comments after a local newspaper reported that many patients have
been turned away by 19 medical centers with no beds to spare, leaving them
without treatment.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, medical centers are more popular than regional or local hospitals, as
their facilities are believed by the health authorities to be better for a wide
range of services, including faculty numbers, bed numbers and equipment.</P>
      <P>In sharp contrast, many regional hospitals are less than 70 percent full, while
up to half of the beds at some local hospitals lie vacant.</P>
      <P>Yaung said the DOH hopes medical centers will reserve beds for seriously ill
patients rather than admitting patients with trifling complaints.</P>
      <P>He said this would encourage patients who have only mild illnesses to go to
regional or local hospitals, thereby improving the bed shortage in medical
centers.</P>
      <P>Yaung also urged the public to cooperate and to refrain from rushing to a
medical center when they feel unwell.</P>
      <P>He said the DOH will improve the hospital transfer mechanism and make it more
efficient, to meet demand from patients who need to be transferred to medical
centers from regional or local hospitals.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The decision by the Foxconn Technology Group, as Hon Hai is known in China, to
sharply increase the wages of its factory workers may create a butterfly effect,
resulting in higher pay at its upstream and downstream companies in China and at
its competitors' enterprises, a senior Taiwanese consultant in China said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Jackey Lee, general manager of Hamber Consulting Service in Kunshan City, said
that if other companies do not follow Foxconn's lead, they may run into labor
shortages in the future.</P>
      <P>Lee said that as Foxconn is a big contract manufacturer, it is unlikely to lose
orders from its major international customers. But although big companies like
Foxconn can better absorb higher labors cost, Foxconn should ask customers such
as Apple to help meet some of those costs, Lee suggested.</P>
      <P>Lee also agreed with Hon Hai Chairman Terry Gou's forecast that some Taiwanese
contract manufacturers will speed up their relocation or expansion to China's
inland provinces.</P>
      <P>However, some electronics component suppliers are likely to move their
operations back to Taiwan, Lee predicted, saying that the signing of a proposed
cross-strait trade pact is expected to lower their tariffs costs and their
transportation costs will drop as result of the increasing number of direct
flights across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In addition, other Taiwanese businesses in China may move inland or abroad, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>At a shareholders meeting on Tuesday, Gou said that wage hikes across China's
manufacturing  and service  sectors will be an irreversible trend.</P>
      <P>He also forecast that the upward pressure on wages will be much faster and
steeper than many have expected because China's social structure is undergoing
dramatic changes.</P>
      <P>Foxconn announced a second pay raise Sunday,  amid public criticism of its
management practices following a rash of suicides at its Shenzhen complex this
year. The two pay hikes will push the monthly wages of Foxconn's workers from
900 yuan to 2,000 yuan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) said Thursday that as graduation
season approaches, more should be done to protect teenage girls from being
exploited while trying to find jobs.</P>
      <P>With the help of FamilyMart, the NGOs vowed to raise NT$20 million (US$617,000)
for "Youth Empower, " a program launched last year that helps underprivileged
teens fit into the job market. Among other projects, the program aims to find
proper jobs for at least 300 teenagers this year.</P>
      <P>Chi Hui-jung, CEO of the Garden of Hope Foundation, said it was particularly
important to assist teenage girls because they are often subject to
discrimination.</P>
      <P>More than 100,000 teenage girls in Taiwan seek jobs each year. Citing a 2009
survey conducted by halfway houses, Chi said that girls who run away from home
or drop out of school were the most vulnerable to sexual abuse on the job
market. Of 278 respondents, 75.9 percent of runaways and 59.2 percent of
dropouts said they had been sexually abused.</P>
      <P>Chi said that many of the girls have debt problems and lack education or job
training, making them particularly prone to joining the seemingly high-profit
sex industry.</P>
      <P>Not only do these teenagers often work long hours for low wages, they are also
excluded from national labor or health insurance.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ta-hua,  secretary-general  of the Taiwan Alliance for Advancement of Youth
Rights and Welfare, urged the government to give more help to teens who don't
fit in the educational system and to offer them career training as early as
possible.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that compared with neighboring countries such as Japan and South Korea,
Taiwan doesn't help children find out what they really want to do or are good
at.</P>
      <P>For instance, she said, both Japan and South Korea have set up "Job Cafe"
programs that encourage teenagers to develop their careers instead of just
pushing them back in school if they can't afford to attend or aren't suitable
for the classroom.</P>
      <P>"The classroom is not the only place for learning, " Yeh said. "Those teenagers
deserve to have a chance to discover themselves."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of cases in May involving the sale of illegal drugs increased
significantly after the formation of a Cabinet anti-drug task force in April,
Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In May, the number of illegal drug cases averaged 204 per week and 96 were
referred to law enforcement agencies, according to Yaung.</P>
      <P>This was a sharp increase from April when drug cases averaged 48 cases per week
and 11 were referred to law enforcement authorities, Yaung added.</P>
      <P>Most of the illegal drugs seized were weight-loss products, virility drugs and
anti-inflammatory painkillers, Yang said at a press conference to report on the
work of the anti-drug task force.</P>
      <P>The task force, which is made up of representatives from the DOH, the Ministry
of Justice (MOJ) and the National Communications Commission, has been cracking
down on the sale of counterfeit drugs that are mostly advertised on underground
radio stations.</P>
      <P>Yaung said that between April 1 and June 8, the DOH imposed fines totalling
NT$46.32 million for illegal drug and food advertising in 1,415 cases. However,
the advertising violation rate dropped in May to 9.4 percent from 13.93 percent
in January, he said.</P>
      <P>Since mid-February, prosecutors have carried out three rounds of crackdowns on
the sale of counterfeit and substandard drugs, the MOJ reported. As of June 8,
prosecutors were handling 575 drug cases and had made indictments in 35 of them,
the MOI said. So far, there has been one conviction, it added.</P>
      <P>The volume of illegal drugs seized as of May 27 this year was 2.5 times the
volume in the whole year of last year, according to the MOJ.</P>
      <P>The NCC said that between March and May, it had shut down 41 unlicensed radio
stations in an aggressive crackdown against the advertisement of illegal
medicine.</P>
      <P>The NCC said it will step up its efforts to gather information to prevent the
resurgence of underground radio stations.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) Chairman Morris Chang said
Thursday that wage hikes in China are an irreversible trend but that his company
is not considering any such pay raises.</P>
      <P>Recent pay hikes by Foxconn Technology Group and Honda in China are like
catalysts that will speed up the trend, Chang said after attending his wife's
new book launch.</P>
      <P>Asked whether TSMC, the world's largest contract chip maker, is considering any
salary raises in its factory in China, Chang replied: "Not for now."</P>
      <P>He said the base monthly salary in its Chinese factory is over 2,000 Chinese
yuan (US$292.7) , which is increased every year under the company's plan.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that TSMC has only 1,200 workers in China, compared to more than
27,000 in Taiwan. He said the number of workers in its Chinese factory has
maintained the same level for many years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kenneth Yen, chief executive officer of Yulon Group -- the largest
automaker in Taiwan, echoed Chang's remarks that pay hikes in China have become
a trend.</P>
      <P>Companies operating in China can only put more efforts into R&amp;D and
innovation to reduce the impact from wage hikes, he added.</P>
      <P>Yen said, however, that his company, which began its investment in China in
1995, also does not plan to raise salaries for its Chinese workers.</P>
      <P>As China is the biggest market in the world -- with a growth rate of over 10
percent in auto markets, Yulon will not withdraw from that market, Yen added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah announced Thursday the launch of a
national crackdown on gangsters to ensure social order.</P>
      <P>In a news conference at the Criminal Investigation Bureau under the National
Police Agency, the minister said the campaign will last until Aug. 31.</P>
      <P>Prosector-General Huang Shyh-ming of the Supreme Prosecutors Office said at the
news conference that the campaign will be carried out by all law enforcement
officials, including prosecutors, police, military police and agents from the
Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Justice.</P>
      <P>"One of our aims is to detect government officials who collude with gangsters to
commit crimes," he said.</P>
      <P>The nation's top prosecutor said he will call a meeting next week of the chiefs
of law enforcement offices to review their work and map out a route for the next
step of the campaign.</P>
      <P>Yen Ta-he, lead prosector of the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office, will be charged
with the task of leading the country's prosecutors to weed out criminal
organizations by prosecuting not only gangsters but also their financial
providers, abetters and kingpins, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Officials who work hand in glove with gangsters to commit high-profile crimes
will be referred to the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office for investigation, the prosecutor-general said.</P>
      <P>The Special  Investigation  Bureau  was set up under  the prosecutor-general to
probe major crimes.</P>
      <P>Noting that it is the job of law enforcement officials to ensure social peace
and order, Huang expressed confidence that the campaign will bear fruit.</P>
      <P>The campaign was launched one day after President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as
chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , echoed concerns by several KMT
Standing Committee members during a KMT conference that the worsening social
order might undermine the KMT's year-end election campaign in five
municipalities.</P>
      <P>Ma was quoted by KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin as saying during Wednesday's
conference that police are a symbol of the government's power and that their
good name "is sooner lost than won."</P>
      <P>The president was cited as saying that the ruling party should face up to the
issue without fear of exposing the skeleton in its closet.</P>
      <P>Ma was referring to a recent scandal in Taichung City in which a gangster was
shot dead in the lobby of his company in broad daylight May 28.</P>
      <P>A video tape of the scene played in public 11 days later showed that the
gangster's company was a hangout for local police officials and that when the
murder took place, four officers were gambling in a room in the gangster's
company and narrowly escaped being hurt by ricochets.</P>
      <P>The close association between the dead gangster and the police caused an outcry
among the public and mushroomed into a crisis threatening Taichung City Mayor
Jason Hu's bid for the mayorship of the Taichung City municipality, which will
be formed through a merger of Taichung City and Taichung County at the end of
the year.</P>
      <P>Hu replaced the city's police chief June 5 in an attempt to control the damage,
but this seemed not enough to preempt the havoc the scandal is set to wreak on
his campaign.</P>
      <P>During Wednesday's KMT meeting, National Policy Agency Deputy Director-General I
Yung-jen was reported as saying that police began from June 1 to increase the
number of its regular crackdown on gangsters from once every two months to three
times every two months.</P>
      <P>The national deputy police chief said the police have been monitoring 948 gangs
and their hangouts and have kept a record of 9,000 gangsters around the country,
adding that it will raid these places simultaneously on an as-yet undetermined
date.</P>
      <P>In order to prevent plain clothes police officials from visiting controversial
places while they are on duty, the deputy police chief said the Criminal
Investigation Bureau is working on a plan to tighten up the control of
detectives' movements, for example obliging them to report to their superiors
before going out to conduct investigations.</P>
      <P>He promised at the KMT meeting that the National Police Agency will probe the
scandal surrounding the police as seriously as it probes any criminal case.</P>
      <P>The scandal also raised eyebrows in the Cabinet Thursday, with Premier Wu Den-
yih asking the National Police Agency to tighten police discipline.</P>
      <P>Government Information Minister Johnny Chi-chen Chiang quoted the premier as
saying during the Cabinet meeting that only a highly disciplined police force
can fulfill its job of cracking down on criminal organizations, drug abuse and
obscenity, which he described as the root of most crimes.</P>
      <P>In a related development Thursday, police in Taoyuan County, northern Taiwan,
said they had busted a gang in Longtan Township.</P>
      <P>The boss of the gang, identified only by his family name of Lin, had been
brought to justice in 2007 but did not mend his ways and continued to engage in
racketeering, exact repayment of debts by violence and be involved in more than
a dozen criminal cases.</P>
      <P>After collecting evidence against him for at least six months, the police raided
17 hideouts of the gangsters simultaneously that day, nabbing 13 of them. (By

      <P>Amid grave public concern about worsening public order, an opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker urged the government Thursday to set up an
independent anti-corruption agency to restore public trust.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference called by the DPP legislative caucus, Wong Chin-
chu suggested that the government follow Hong Kong's model and open an
"Independent Commission Against Corruption" to effectively combat crime.</P>
      <P>"If President Ma Ying-jeou is really determined to draw a clear line between
local factional forces and the underworld to eliminate corruption, he should ask
the KMT-controlled Legislative Yuan to list my draft organization bill for
establishing the body as the top issue for screening in its coming extra
legislative session in July, " she said.</P>
      <P>Ma also serves as chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>According to Wong, she submitted the draft bill for legislative review in
September 2008. "But it has been stuck in the Legislative Yuan due to the KMT's
hindrance," she said.</P>
      <P>"The Legislative Yuan should quickly approve the bill to allow for the ruling
and opposition camps to jointly crack down on corruption, which was also a
campaign promise of Ma two years ago, "she said.</P>
      <P>Wong also criticized the existing Central Integrity Committee, set up under the
Executive Yuan in August 2008 after Ma took office, as simply "paying lip

      <P>"This indicates Ma's unwillingness to fight crime across the board, " she
alleged, suggesting that an independent and competent anti-corruption body must
comprise ethics, investigative and police authorities in order to overwhelmingly
destroy the complex links between gang organizations and corrupt local
politicians.</P>
      <P>Accusing the KMT of having long schemed with local gangsters as a means of
cementing its power base, Wong urged it to distance itself from the underworld
and to reinstate the public's trust in politics.</P>
      <P>A spate of high-profile killings in recent months, particularly several cases in

    <HEADLINE>Over 200 goats culled in southern Taiwan in GPV scare</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 269 goats were culled Wednesday over fears of goat pox virus (GPV) at
a farm in Chiayi City, southern Taiwan, animal health officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>As of the end of May, a total of 8,419 goats from 56 goat farms in nine cities
and counties have been slaughtered to prevent the spread of the virus, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>The affected farm, the largest in Chiayi City,  has been disinfected after the
cull, according to a city official in charge of agriculture and animal husbandry
affairs.</P>
      <P>The infections have given rise to increased concerns over the spread of the
virus around the nation.</P>
      <P>The infections surfaced after nearly 800 infected goats were culled in April at
two farms in Yunlin County's Siluo Township in central-south Taiwan.</P>
      <P>GPV, a highly contagious disease of small ruminants that is characterized by
fever and ocular and nasal discharges, causes lesions on the skin and on the
mucous membranes of the nostrils, mouth and vulva. Mortality can be high. Most
kids and lambs with the disease tend to die and the death rate among adult
animals is around 50 percent.</P>
      <P>GPV cannot infect humans and can be destroyed by exposure to high temperatures,
according to the city official.</P>
      <P>The city government will inform the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA)
and the COA will compensate for farmers' losses for the slaughter of infected
goats, he said.</P>
      <P>This is the second time the disease has been reported in Taiwan. The first
outbreak was in July 2008 in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County, and is believed
to have been related to animal smuggling from GPV-affected areas, which include
Vietnam, China, Mongolia, Africa and the Middle East, although the exact source
has never been confirmed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan sees more `taishang' return like `salmon swimming home'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  10  (CNA)
06/10/10  21:25:31

    <TEXT>
      <P>An increasing number of Taiwanese businessmen operating in China, known locally
as "taishang, " have returned to launch new investment projects on their home
turf over the past two or three years, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"We have seen the return of `taishang' like `salmon swimming home' in the past
couple of years or so, " said Woody Duh, director-general of the Industrial
Development Bureau under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>Citing official statistics, Duh said "taishang" invested about NT$34 billion
(US$1.05 billion) in their homeland last year and that the amount is expected to
reach NT$40 billion this year.</P>
      <P>In the first five months of this year, capital investment by "taishang" already
hit NT$22.1 billion in 52 projects, he added.</P>
      <P>To cope with this rising trend, Duh said, the government has come up with an
overall strategy and plan, and will also offer customized assistance to
Taiwanese companies intending to return and invest here.</P>
      <P>Duh made the remarks at a post-weekly Cabinet meeting news conference in which
the return of "taishang" was a focus, as Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Gou
revealed two days ago his intention to launch a massive investment project in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Gou's announcement came after Hon Hai's China-based subsidiary Foxconn
Technology Group -- the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer --
boosted basic wages for the workers in its various factories in China after a
spate of suicides reported at its Shenzhen plant.</P>
      <P>Many other Taiwan-owned companies in China's Pearl River Delta and Yangtze River
Delta have felt the pinch following Foxconn's massive wage hikes, according to
media reports.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Duh said, the MOEA will host a seminar June 15 to brief
"taishang" on the changing domestic investment environment and the government's
strenuous efforts to assist them in relocating back home.</P>
      <P>Among the measures, Duh said, the MOEA has set up a one-stop service counter for
returning "taishang"  and has lowered the corporate income tax rate and the gift
and inheritance tax rates to enhance investment incentives.</P>
      <P>The government has also lowered prices for land plots in major industrial parks
around the country to make it easier for prospective investors to acquire
factory space, Duh went on, adding that the one-stop service counter will help
with land acquisition and power and water supply issues.</P>
      <P>While government assistance will not be limited to specific industries, Duh
said, the government hopes the returning "taishang" will focus their investments
on environmentally friendly green industries or emerging high-tech industries to
meet the general world market trend.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Wu Den-yih said earlier in the day that "taishang" are
welcome to invest in several old industrial parks where traffic congestion
issues have largely been resolved, as well as in Danhai New Town in Taipei
County's Danshui Township, the Changhua Coastal Industrial Park and the Central
Taiwan Science Park.</P>
      <P>On the same day, President Ma Ying-jeou also made the same appeal to "taishang,
" urging them to set up footholds in the special free trade zones at Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport and five major sea ports to cash in on Taiwan's
largely improved investment climate.</P>

      <P>Relations between Taiwan and the United Kingdom in the areas of trade, tourism
and cultural exchanges have been going well, but Taiwan's reversion to death row
executions is disappointing,  the top British  diplomat  in Taipei indicated
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, said David Campbell, Director of the British Trade and Cultural
Office (BTCO) in Taipei, he is generally optimistic about the direction of the
bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's decision last year to make two international human rights covenants
part of its domestic law was widely welcomed," said Campbell in a speech at the
celebration of Britain's Queen Elizabeth's birthday.</P>
      <P>"It was all the more disappointing, therefore, to see in April the abrupt end to
Taiwna's de facto moratorium on the use of the death penalty," he said.</P>
      <P>Campbell cited Taiwan's silver medal win for its orchids at the prestigious
Chelsea Flower Show and the Queen's visit to the Taiwan stand there last month
as indicators of the scope of U.K.-Taiwan ties and the potential for Taiwan-made
products to succeed in the U.K. market.</P>
      <P>Although 2009 was a bad year for the global economy, Campbell said, U.K. exports
to Taiwan were up 30 percent in the first quarter of 2010 over the same period
last year.</P>
      <P>According to Campbell, the number of Taiwanese visitors to the U.K. increased
more than one third from previous years, after Taiwan was granted a visa-free
privilege in March last year.</P>
      <P>Campbell also said he was pleased to see strong educational links between the
two countries.</P>
      <P>At any given time, there are at least 15,000 Taiwanese students studying in the
U.K., which is the second most popular destination for overseas study among
Taiwan students.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan is cooperating with an online shopping
platform to help businesses promote local produce and food online, Kaohsiung
Mayor Chen Chu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The city government said 25 local businesses selling fruit, sweet and snacks
have set up online shops with help from the Kaohsiung office of Japan's biggest
online shopping platform, Rakuten. The businesses also enjoy good deals from the
Internet platform in terms of online shop fees, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>Chen said a portal has been set up to link to the shops and she expressed hope
that this will help local businesses reach a wider range of customers. She added
that she has been trying to work with Rakuten since making a 2008 visit to the
company in Japan.</P>
      <P>The platform will allow businesses to sell online, take orders via the telephone
and through convenience stores in Taiwan, and use the site's Japan connection to
tap into the Japanese market.</P>
      <P>The mayor said her administration has been promoting local produce by setting up
dedicated display areas in 10 stores of the hypermarket chain Carrefour, and by
holding a farmer's market every month in the city. She said the year-end merger
of Kaohsiung city and county will further benefit local producers.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) set up two first aid stations at Alishan, one of
Taiwan's most popular tourist destinations, after more than 10 Chinese tourists
died this year due to poor health or acute disease, a health official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>A first aid station will also be set up at Sun Moon Lake, another "must-see"
attraction for Chinese tourists, said Wang Zong-si, deputy head of the
Department of Health's Bureau of Medical Affairs.</P>
      <P>Tour guides  should  learn CPR techniques  and familiarize themselves with
medical facilities along their tour routes, he said at a press conference in
Taipei on safety measures for Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Chen Mei-siou, a section chief of the Tourism Bureau, said the bureau is working
to ensure the safety of Chinese tourists and had introduced courses that teach
tour guides how to take care of the elderly. Chen also said tour bus drivers
were prohibited from driving more than 10 hours a day.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Hung-chun, who invited both the officials and travel industry
business leaders to the conference, said 17 Chinese tourists had died of non-
accidental causes since Taiwan opened to cross-strait tourism in July 2008.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kao-ching of the Travel Agency Association said agencies should encourage
elderly tourists to choose less crowded tours, while the Tourist Guide
Association's Chao Man-pai reminded tourists to buy travel insurance.</P>
      <P>Lee urged the Tourism Bureau to look into the issue of tours with overly tight
schedules and suggested local health offices near tourist attractions improve
their services for travelers.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih touted Taiwan's reputation for fine tea Thursday during a
promotion of the 2010 World Tea Expo to be held in central Taiwan's Nantou
County June 19-27.</P>
      <P>The premier took a sip of exquisite Nantou tea, which has been described as a
precious drop that can cost as much as NT$2,000 (US$65) per cup.</P>
      <P>Wu, a former Nantou magistrate, is always keen to help his hometown, which has a
climate and topography that are perfect for growing high quality tea.</P>
      <P>Wu said the tea industry in Nantou reached its peak when he was still the
incumbent there, with oolong tea from Lugu Township Farmer's Association selling
for NT$50,000 per kilo at that time.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the tourism industry in Nantou County has suffered a decline
for the past 10 years, which has also crippled agricultural products, although
the direct flights between China and Taiwan that have brought increasing numbers
of Chinese tourists have helped the county find the new lease on life.</P>
      <P>The 2010 World Tea Expo, organized by the Nantou country government, has invited
tea masters from around the world to demonstrate the art of the tea ceremony and
will also feature a tea exhibition, with an outdoor tea ceremony on the opening
day, said Nantou magistrate Lee Chao-ching.</P>

      <P>The launch of flights between Taipei's Songshan Airport and Shanghai's Hongqiao
Airport will break a bottleneck in Taipei's development, Mayor Hau Lung-bin said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Addressing journalists at a tea party hosted by the mayor, Hau said the flights
will bring the two cities closer together and will make it easier for passengers
to make round trips between the two cities in a single day.</P>
      <P>This will make Taipei a truly international city, according to the mayor.</P>
      <P>Although there are already 28 flights between Songshan and Shanghai's Pudong
International Airport every week, Hongqiao is much nearer to the inner city of
Shanghai and will save passengers about 40 minutes drive time between the city
and Pudong.</P>
      <P>China and Taiwan agreed May 22 to kick off the service between Songshan and
Hongqiao with four flights per day.</P>
      <P>When the flights begin June 14, Hau said, he will lead a team of city officials
on the first flight from Songshan to Hongqiao for a trip to Shanghai to promote
the Taipei Culture Week and the Taipei International Flora Expo.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Culture Week, which began June 3 in Shanghai and will last through
June 28, will feature performances by various opera troupes and music companies
from Taipei in several theaters in the city.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Flora Expo will open Nov. 6 and will run through April 26, 2011.</P>
      <P>During a June 14 meeting with Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng, Hau said he would
present Han with a Taiwan-made e-reader loaded with all 15 of the martial art
novels written by Louis Cha, better known by his pen name of Jin Yong.</P>
      <P>"In order  to provide  Han with a glimpse  into Taiwan's high-technology power
and cultural creative strength, the e-reader will also contain a guided tour of
Taipei," Hau said.</P>
      <P>After the tea party, Hau departed for Hong Kong to promote the Taipei
International Flora Expo.</P>
      <P>He is expected to meet representatives of travel agencies and journalists there

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Thursday that the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait will need to make serious efforts if they are to
sign a cross-strait trade pact in June.</P>
      <P>"The two sides will really need to work hard, " Lai said before a meeting with
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jyn-ping.</P>
      <P>She was referring  to the proposed  cross-strait  economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) that Taiwan hopes to sign with China later this month.</P>
      <P>Lai noted that a third round of ECFA talks has been scheduled for Sunday in
Beijing, which will focus on the agreement itself.</P>
      <P>But the "early harvest" lists, which form the backbone of the pact and include
items that will receive immediate tariff reductions or exemptions or improved
market access following the ECFA signing, will need further communication, she
said.</P>
      <P>Asked if the signing of the ECFA still is the goal of a round of meetings
between the heads of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) scheduled for this month, Lai
said June is still the goal.</P>
      <P>She added that the SEF-ARATS meeting will be aimed at dealing with the issues of
ECFA and with intellectual property rights protection.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that day, Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Bureau  of Foreign
Trade,  said  that  informal  cross-strait communications on the ECFA have "made
headway."</P>
      <P>Huang, who had just returned to Taiwan after a visit to Beijing to negotiate
with China on major items on the "early harvest" lists, said bilateral
differences on whether to include machine tools, PP and PVC on the lists had not
been resolved, but he added that the items still requiring communication "are
now limited."</P>
      <P>He said that "the ECFA talks are approaching their end, but some negotiations

      <P>The revenues of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the maker of Apple's iPads and
iPhones and the world's largest electronics and computer components
manufacturer, reached NT$163.26 billion (US$5.03 billion) in May, the highest
figure since November 2008, a spokesman for the company announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The figure represents a 6.1 percent growth over April and a whopping increase of
78.1 percent year-on-year, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>He attributed the record high revenues to the hot sales of iPads, iPhones and
Amazon.com Inc.'s Kindle e-books. Apple announced May 31 that its iPad sales had
topped 2 million in less than 60 days since its April 3 launch.</P>
      <P>The company's contracted orders from Sony for LCD TVs and its venture into the
notebook business have also contributed a great deal to the rise of its
revenues, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai's revenues over the first five months amounted to NT$731.89 billion, a
57.71 percent growth over the same period of last year, he said.</P>
      <P>Wang Wan-li, head of Taiwan Research at HSBC Securities, pointed out that a
single-month figure does not reflect the company' overall operations, but he
predicted that Hon Hai's consolidated revenue this year is expected to increase
by 30 percent, based on its consolidated revenue of NT$1.6 trillion in 2009 and
NT$1.95 trillion in 2008.</P>
      <P>On Hon Hai's decision to increase the monthly pay for its Foxconn Technology
assembly line workers in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen by about 90
percent, Wang said the move might affect about 20 percent of its profits.</P>
      <P>Wang also said it will be difficult for the electronics giant to fulfill its
intention to transfer the increased labor costs to its clients, given the fierce
competition in the market, particularly in the notebook sector.</P>

      <P>The number of goats culled due to fears of goat pox virus (GPV) had broken
10,000 as of Thursday, and a meeting will be convened next week to discuss
whether to vaccinate the rest of the country's goats to contain the spread of
the disease, a Council of Agriculture (COA) official said that day.</P>
      <P>Yeh Kuo-ching, deputy director of the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
inspection and Quarantine, said the number of goats culled had reached more than
11,000 so far this year in 10 cities and counties -- Chiayi and Tainan cities
and Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung, Changhua, Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung
counties.</P>
      <P>The infections first gave rise for serious concern in April after nearly 800
goats were culled at two farms in Yunlin County's Siluo Township in south-
central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"As the outbreak of the goat pox has yet to reach a peak, the bureau will
convene a meeting  next week to discuss ways of controlling the disease," said
Yeh.</P>
      <P>The bureau will also conduct an overall investigation of nearly 3,000 goat farms
around the country to learn if there have been other sporadic outbreaks that
were not reported, and to learn the views of the farmers.</P>
      <P>The findings will be submitted to experts, who will decide if vaccinations are
needed to control the disease.</P>
      <P>He noted that the bureau purchased 50,000 doses of vaccine June 1 and will buy
180,000 more in two weeks. If a vaccination program is needed, the supplies will
be sufficient to treat 220,000 animals.</P>
      <P>He said this is the second time the disease has been reported in Taiwan. The
first outbreak was in July 2008 in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County, and is
believed to have been related to animal smuggling from GPV-affected areas, which
include Vietnam, China, Mongolia, Africa and the Middle East, although the exact
source has never been confirmed.</P>
      <P>He said that only two goat farms reported GPV infection at that time and that
the disease was brought under control one week after exterminating the goats on
the two farms.</P>
      <P>GPV, a highly contagious disease of small ruminants that is characterized by
fever and ocular and nasal discharges, causes lesions on the skin and on the
mucous membranes of the nostrils, mouth and vulva. Mortality can be high. Most
kids and lambs with the disease tend to die and the death rate among adult
animals is around 50 percent.</P>
      <P>GPV cannot infect humans and can be destroyed by exposure to high temperatures.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan hopeful beef issue will not hinder resumption of TIFA talks</HEADLINE>

      <P>The government hopes the controversy over its partial ban on American beef
imports will not hinder a potential resumption  of Trade and Investment
Framework Agreement (TIFA) negotiations with the United States before the end of
the year, a foreign affairs official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"For Taiwan, the U.S. beef issue is closed, but apparently this is not the case
for the U.S. Hopefully, it will not affect the TIFA negotiations,"  said Harry
Tseng, director-general of the Department of North American Affairs under the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Raymond Burghardt told a media
roundtable in Taipei June 4 that the beef row is a "lingering issue" because
U.S. senators and the U.S. government see Taiwan's market as still not totally
open to U.S. beef due to "non-scientific" reasoning.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's legislature passed an amendment in January to the Act Governing Food
Safety that bans imports of various beef products from countries with documented
cases of mad cow disease in the past decade. The amendment effectively bars U.S.
ground beef, beef offal and other beef parts such as skulls and eyes from
Taiwan's market, in contravention of a bilateral beef trade protocol signed by
the two countries last October.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that the banned items -- ground beef, beef offal and other parts --
only account for a few percent of Taiwan's U.S. beef imports and that U.S. beef
exporters have made profits from the Taiwanese market since the Taiwan-U.S. beef
protocol went into effect.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, that will ease some of the opposition (to the partial ban), " he
said.</P>
      <P>Tseng also expressed hope that the TIFA talks will resume before the end of the
year -- as Burghardt mentioned in the media roundtable -- because "it's not
worthwhile for both the U.S. and Taiwan to let other economic and trade issues
be kidnapped by the beef dispute" as the trade volume of U.S. beef is only a
tiny part of the total two-way trade volume.</P>
      <P>On the TIFA talks, Burghardt said Taiwan and the U.S. have agreed that the last
round of talks under the TIFA -- a deputy ministerial meeting held in July 2007
-- was too long ago and that new talks should take place before the end of the
year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the U.S. both understand the importance of the TIFA negotiations
because they cover a wide range of topics related to bilateral economic
relations, Tseng said, adding that the talks would provide a much-needed
platform for both sides to resolve economic and trade problems.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Not all dip slopes sensitive or dangerous: expert</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A geology expert said Thursday that people who live on the so-called dip slopes
in Taiwan need not worry too much about their safety as not all sites of this
type are sensitive or vulnerable to geological disasters.</P>
      <P>However, people should pay close attention to areas which are classified as
geologically sensitive in the geology bill that is being legislated to help
prevent catastrophic landslides, said Lin Chao-tsung, director of the Ministry
of Economic Affairs' Central Geological Survey.</P>
      <P>"The dip slopes that are genuinely sensitive areas will be identified by the
government in the Geology Act," Lin said at a press conference that was hosted
by opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tien Chiu-chin.</P>
      <P>In geological terms, a dip slope is a slope of the surface of the land
determined by and conforming approximately to the dip of the underlying rocks.</P>
      <P>Lin said that while areas identified as geologically sensitive may be dangerous
from a scientific point of view, it does not necessarily mean that landslides or
other types of geological disasters would occur there any time soon.</P>
      <P>"There may be no landslides in such areas during our lifetime, " he said.</P>
      <P>However, the sites classified as geologically sensitive would undeniably be more
sensitive than other areas, he said.</P>
      <P>Lin was responding to Legislator Tien, who asked about the possibility of panic
among residents whose homes are located on sites that may be identified as
sensitive areas.</P>
      <P>The government would not publicize the list of sensitive areas without first
going through detailed surveys and having the list screened by specialists,
scholars and public office representatives, Lin said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the contents of the Geology Act would be reviewed
periodically to update the scientific data, and the list of geologically
sensitive areas may be revised based on the new data.</P>
      <P>Tien called for the Geology Act to be passed as soon as possible, even it
requires an extra legislative session. The legislature is now in summer recess.</P>

      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait will not exchange "early harvest" lists for a
proposed cross-strait trade pact during a third round of talks on the deal,
Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait  economic cooperation framework agreement's (ECFA's) early
harvest lists of each side, which form the backbone of the pact, include items
that will be subject to immediate tariff reductions or exemptions, or improved
market access, upon the signing of the pact.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chi-liang said Thursday that his
department is aware of a serious shortage of hospital beds in medical centers
and promised to remedy the situation.</P>
      <P>Yaung made the comments after a local newspaper reported that many patients have
been turned away by 19 medical centers with no beds to spare, leaving them
without treatment.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, medical centers are more popular than regional or local hospitals, as
their facilities are believed by the health authorities to be better for a wide
range of services, including faculty numbers, bed numbers and equipment.</P>
      <P>In sharp contrast, many regional hospitals are less than 70 percent full, while
up to half of the beds at some local hospitals lie vacant.</P>
      <P>Yaung said the DOH hopes medical centers will reserve beds for seriously ill
patients rather than admitting patients with trifling complaints.</P>
      <P>He said this would encourage patients who have only mild illnesses to go to
regional or local hospitals, thereby improving the bed shortage in medical
centers.</P>
      <P>Yaung also urged the public to cooperate and to refrain from rushing to a
medical center when they feel unwell.</P>
      <P>He said the DOH will improve the hospital transfer mechanism and make it more
efficient, to meet demand from patients who need to be transferred to medical
centers from regional or local hospitals.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The decision by the Foxconn Technology Group, as Hon Hai is known in China, to
sharply increase the wages of its factory workers may create a butterfly effect,
resulting in higher pay at its upstream and downstream companies in China and at
its competitors' enterprises, a senior Taiwanese consultant in China said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Jackey Lee, general manager of Hamber Consulting Service in Kunshan City, said
that if other companies do not follow Foxconn's lead, they may run into labor
shortages in the future.</P>
      <P>Lee said that as Foxconn is a big contract manufacturer, it is unlikely to lose
orders from its major international customers. But although big companies like
Foxconn can better absorb higher labors cost, Foxconn should ask customers such
as Apple to help meet some of those costs, Lee suggested.</P>
      <P>Lee also agreed with Hon Hai Chairman Terry Gou's forecast that some Taiwanese
contract manufacturers will speed up their relocation or expansion to China's
inland provinces.</P>
      <P>However, some electronics component suppliers are likely to move their
operations back to Taiwan, Lee predicted, saying that the signing of a proposed
cross-strait trade pact is expected to lower their tariffs costs and their
transportation costs will drop as result of the increasing number of direct
flights across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In addition, other Taiwanese businesses in China may move inland or abroad, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>At a shareholders meeting on Tuesday, Gou said that wage hikes across China's
manufacturing  and service  sectors will be an irreversible trend.</P>
      <P>He also forecast that the upward pressure on wages will be much faster and
steeper than many have expected because China's social structure is undergoing
dramatic changes.</P>
      <P>Foxconn announced a second pay raise Sunday,  amid public criticism of its
management practices following a rash of suicides at its Shenzhen complex this
year. The two pay hikes will push the monthly wages of Foxconn's workers from
900 yuan to 2,000 yuan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) said Thursday that as graduation
season approaches, more should be done to protect teenage girls from being
exploited while trying to find jobs.</P>
      <P>With the help of FamilyMart, the NGOs vowed to raise NT$20 million (US$617,000)
for "Youth Empower, " a program launched last year that helps underprivileged
teens fit into the job market. Among other projects, the program aims to find
proper jobs for at least 300 teenagers this year.</P>
      <P>Chi Hui-jung, CEO of the Garden of Hope Foundation, said it was particularly
important to assist teenage girls because they are often subject to
discrimination.</P>
      <P>More than 100,000 teenage girls in Taiwan seek jobs each year. Citing a 2009
survey conducted by halfway houses, Chi said that girls who run away from home
or drop out of school were the most vulnerable to sexual abuse on the job
market. Of 278 respondents, 75.9 percent of runaways and 59.2 percent of
dropouts said they had been sexually abused.</P>
      <P>Chi said that many of the girls have debt problems and lack education or job
training, making them particularly prone to joining the seemingly high-profit
sex industry.</P>
      <P>Not only do these teenagers often work long hours for low wages, they are also
excluded from national labor or health insurance.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ta-hua,  secretary-general  of the Taiwan Alliance for Advancement of Youth
Rights and Welfare, urged the government to give more help to teens who don't
fit in the educational system and to offer them career training as early as
possible.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that compared with neighboring countries such as Japan and South Korea,
Taiwan doesn't help children find out what they really want to do or are good
at.</P>
      <P>For instance, she said, both Japan and South Korea have set up "Job Cafe"
programs that encourage teenagers to develop their careers instead of just
pushing them back in school if they can't afford to attend or aren't suitable
for the classroom.</P>
      <P>"The classroom is not the only place for learning, " Yeh said. "Those teenagers
deserve to have a chance to discover themselves."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of cases in May involving the sale of illegal drugs increased
significantly after the formation of a Cabinet anti-drug task force in April,
Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In May, the number of illegal drug cases averaged 204 per week and 96 were
referred to law enforcement agencies, according to Yaung.</P>
      <P>This was a sharp increase from April when drug cases averaged 48 cases per week
and 11 were referred to law enforcement authorities, Yaung added.</P>
      <P>Most of the illegal drugs seized were weight-loss products, virility drugs and
anti-inflammatory painkillers, Yang said at a press conference to report on the
work of the anti-drug task force.</P>
      <P>The task force, which is made up of representatives from the DOH, the Ministry
of Justice (MOJ) and the National Communications Commission, has been cracking
down on the sale of counterfeit drugs that are mostly advertised on underground
radio stations.</P>
      <P>Yaung said that between April 1 and June 8, the DOH imposed fines totalling
NT$46.32 million for illegal drug and food advertising in 1,415 cases. However,
the advertising violation rate dropped in May to 9.4 percent from 13.93 percent
in January, he said.</P>
      <P>Since mid-February, prosecutors have carried out three rounds of crackdowns on
the sale of counterfeit and substandard drugs, the MOJ reported. As of June 8,
prosecutors were handling 575 drug cases and had made indictments in 35 of them,
the MOI said. So far, there has been one conviction, it added.</P>
      <P>The volume of illegal drugs seized as of May 27 this year was 2.5 times the
volume in the whole year of last year, according to the MOJ.</P>
      <P>The NCC said that between March and May, it had shut down 41 unlicensed radio
stations in an aggressive crackdown against the advertisement of illegal
medicine.</P>
      <P>The NCC said it will step up its efforts to gather information to prevent the
resurgence of underground radio stations.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) Chairman Morris Chang said
Thursday that wage hikes in China are an irreversible trend but that his company
is not considering any such pay raises.</P>
      <P>Recent pay hikes by Foxconn Technology Group and Honda in China are like
catalysts that will speed up the trend, Chang said after attending his wife's
new book launch.</P>
      <P>Asked whether TSMC, the world's largest contract chip maker, is considering any
salary raises in its factory in China, Chang replied: "Not for now."</P>
      <P>He said the base monthly salary in its Chinese factory is over 2,000 Chinese
yuan (US$292.7) , which is increased every year under the company's plan.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that TSMC has only 1,200 workers in China, compared to more than
27,000 in Taiwan. He said the number of workers in its Chinese factory has
maintained the same level for many years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kenneth Yen, chief executive officer of Yulon Group -- the largest
automaker in Taiwan, echoed Chang's remarks that pay hikes in China have become
a trend.</P>
      <P>Companies operating in China can only put more efforts into R&amp;D and
innovation to reduce the impact from wage hikes, he added.</P>
      <P>Yen said, however, that his company, which began its investment in China in
1995, also does not plan to raise salaries for its Chinese workers.</P>
      <P>As China is the biggest market in the world -- with a growth rate of over 10
percent in auto markets, Yulon will not withdraw from that market, Yen added.</P>

06/10/10  20:48:13</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah announced Thursday the launch of a
national crackdown on gangsters to ensure social order.</P>
      <P>In a news conference at the Criminal Investigation Bureau under the National
Police Agency, the minister said the campaign will last until Aug. 31.</P>
      <P>Prosector-General Huang Shyh-ming of the Supreme Prosecutors Office said at the
news conference that the campaign will be carried out by all law enforcement
officials, including prosecutors, police, military police and agents from the
Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Justice.</P>
      <P>"One of our aims is to detect government officials who collude with gangsters to
commit crimes," he said.</P>
      <P>The nation's top prosecutor said he will call a meeting next week of the chiefs
of law enforcement offices to review their work and map out a route for the next
step of the campaign.</P>
      <P>Yen Ta-he, lead prosector of the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office, will be charged
with the task of leading the country's prosecutors to weed out criminal
organizations by prosecuting not only gangsters but also their financial
providers, abetters and kingpins, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Officials who work hand in glove with gangsters to commit high-profile crimes
will be referred to the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office for investigation, the prosecutor-general said.</P>
      <P>The Special  Investigation  Bureau  was set up under  the prosecutor-general to
probe major crimes.</P>
      <P>Noting that it is the job of law enforcement officials to ensure social peace
and order, Huang expressed confidence that the campaign will bear fruit.</P>
      <P>The campaign was launched one day after President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as
chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , echoed concerns by several KMT
Standing Committee members during a KMT conference that the worsening social
order might undermine the KMT's year-end election campaign in five
municipalities.</P>
      <P>Ma was quoted by KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin as saying during Wednesday's
conference that police are a symbol of the government's power and that their
good name "is sooner lost than won."</P>
      <P>The president was cited as saying that the ruling party should face up to the
issue without fear of exposing the skeleton in its closet.</P>
      <P>Ma was referring to a recent scandal in Taichung City in which a gangster was
shot dead in the lobby of his company in broad daylight May 28.</P>
      <P>A video tape of the scene played in public 11 days later showed that the
gangster's company was a hangout for local police officials and that when the
murder took place, four officers were gambling in a room in the gangster's
company and narrowly escaped being hurt by ricochets.</P>
      <P>The close association between the dead gangster and the police caused an outcry
among the public and mushroomed into a crisis threatening Taichung City Mayor
Jason Hu's bid for the mayorship of the Taichung City municipality, which will
be formed through a merger of Taichung City and Taichung County at the end of
the year.</P>
      <P>Hu replaced the city's police chief June 5 in an attempt to control the damage,
but this seemed not enough to preempt the havoc the scandal is set to wreak on
his campaign.</P>
      <P>During Wednesday's KMT meeting, National Policy Agency Deputy Director-General I
Yung-jen was reported as saying that police began from June 1 to increase the
number of its regular crackdown on gangsters from once every two months to three
times every two months.</P>
      <P>The national deputy police chief said the police have been monitoring 948 gangs
and their hangouts and have kept a record of 9,000 gangsters around the country,
adding that it will raid these places simultaneously on an as-yet undetermined
date.</P>
      <P>In order to prevent plain clothes police officials from visiting controversial
places while they are on duty, the deputy police chief said the Criminal
Investigation Bureau is working on a plan to tighten up the control of
detectives' movements, for example obliging them to report to their superiors
before going out to conduct investigations.</P>
      <P>He promised at the KMT meeting that the National Police Agency will probe the
scandal surrounding the police as seriously as it probes any criminal case.</P>
      <P>The scandal also raised eyebrows in the Cabinet Thursday, with Premier Wu Den-
yih asking the National Police Agency to tighten police discipline.</P>
      <P>Government Information Minister Johnny Chi-chen Chiang quoted the premier as
saying during the Cabinet meeting that only a highly disciplined police force
can fulfill its job of cracking down on criminal organizations, drug abuse and
obscenity, which he described as the root of most crimes.</P>
      <P>In a related development Thursday, police in Taoyuan County, northern Taiwan,
said they had busted a gang in Longtan Township.</P>
      <P>The boss of the gang, identified only by his family name of Lin, had been
brought to justice in 2007 but did not mend his ways and continued to engage in
racketeering, exact repayment of debts by violence and be involved in more than
a dozen criminal cases.</P>
      <P>After collecting evidence against him for at least six months, the police raided
17 hideouts of the gangsters simultaneously that day, nabbing 13 of them. (By

    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid grave public concern about worsening public order, an opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker urged the government Thursday to set up an
independent anti-corruption agency to restore public trust.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference called by the DPP legislative caucus, Wong Chin-
chu suggested that the government follow Hong Kong's model and open an
"Independent Commission Against Corruption" to effectively combat crime.</P>
      <P>"If President Ma Ying-jeou is really determined to draw a clear line between
local factional forces and the underworld to eliminate corruption, he should ask
the KMT-controlled Legislative Yuan to list my draft organization bill for
establishing the body as the top issue for screening in its coming extra
legislative session in July, " she said.</P>
      <P>Ma also serves as chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>According to Wong, she submitted the draft bill for legislative review in
September 2008. "But it has been stuck in the Legislative Yuan due to the KMT's
hindrance," she said.</P>
      <P>"The Legislative Yuan should quickly approve the bill to allow for the ruling
and opposition camps to jointly crack down on corruption, which was also a
campaign promise of Ma two years ago, "she said.</P>
      <P>Wong also criticized the existing Central Integrity Committee, set up under the
Executive Yuan in August 2008 after Ma took office, as simply "paying lip
service" that has achieved nothing.</P>
      <P>"This indicates Ma's unwillingness to fight crime across the board, " she
alleged, suggesting that an independent and competent anti-corruption body must
comprise ethics, investigative and police authorities in order to overwhelmingly
destroy the complex links between gang organizations and corrupt local
politicians.</P>
      <P>Accusing the KMT of having long schemed with local gangsters as a means of
cementing its power base, Wong urged it to distance itself from the underworld
and to reinstate the public's trust in politics.</P>
      <P>A spate of high-profile killings in recent months, particularly several cases in
the central Taichung area, have provoked deep public concern about the country's
deteriorating rule of law and decaying morals of the police.</P>

      <P>A total of 269 goats were culled Wednesday over fears of goat pox virus (GPV) at
a farm in Chiayi City, southern Taiwan, animal health officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>As of the end of May, a total of 8,419 goats from 56 goat farms in nine cities
and counties have been slaughtered to prevent the spread of the virus, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>The affected farm, the largest in Chiayi City,  has been disinfected after the
cull, according to a city official in charge of agriculture and animal husbandry
affairs.</P>
      <P>The infections have given rise to increased concerns over the spread of the
virus around the nation.</P>
      <P>The infections surfaced after nearly 800 infected goats were culled in April at
two farms in Yunlin County's Siluo Township in central-south Taiwan.</P>
      <P>GPV, a highly contagious disease of small ruminants that is characterized by
fever and ocular and nasal discharges, causes lesions on the skin and on the
mucous membranes of the nostrils, mouth and vulva. Mortality can be high. Most
kids and lambs with the disease tend to die and the death rate among adult
animals is around 50 percent.</P>
      <P>GPV cannot infect humans and can be destroyed by exposure to high temperatures,
according to the city official.</P>
      <P>The city government will inform the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA)
and the COA will compensate for farmers' losses for the slaughter of infected
goats, he said.</P>
      <P>This is the second time the disease has been reported in Taiwan. The first
outbreak was in July 2008 in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County, and is believed
to have been related to animal smuggling from GPV-affected areas, which include
Vietnam, China, Mongolia, Africa and the Middle East, although the exact source
has never been confirmed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan sees more `taishang' return like `salmon swimming home'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  10  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>An increasing number of Taiwanese businessmen operating in China, known locally
as "taishang, " have returned to launch new investment projects on their home
turf over the past two or three years, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"We have seen the return of `taishang' like `salmon swimming home' in the past
couple of years or so, " said Woody Duh, director-general of the Industrial
Development Bureau under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>Citing official statistics, Duh said "taishang" invested about NT$34 billion
(US$1.05 billion) in their homeland last year and that the amount is expected to
reach NT$40 billion this year.</P>
      <P>In the first five months of this year, capital investment by "taishang" already
hit NT$22.1 billion in 52 projects, he added.</P>
      <P>To cope with this rising trend, Duh said, the government has come up with an
overall strategy and plan, and will also offer customized assistance to
Taiwanese companies intending to return and invest here.</P>
      <P>Duh made the remarks at a post-weekly Cabinet meeting news conference in which
the return of "taishang" was a focus, as Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Gou
revealed two days ago his intention to launch a massive investment project in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Gou's announcement came after Hon Hai's China-based subsidiary Foxconn
Technology Group -- the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer --
boosted basic wages for the workers in its various factories in China after a
spate of suicides reported at its Shenzhen plant.</P>
      <P>Many other Taiwan-owned companies in China's Pearl River Delta and Yangtze River
Delta have felt the pinch following Foxconn's massive wage hikes, according to
media reports.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Duh said, the MOEA will host a seminar June 15 to brief
"taishang" on the changing domestic investment environment and the government's
strenuous efforts to assist them in relocating back home.</P>
      <P>Among the measures, Duh said, the MOEA has set up a one-stop service counter for
returning "taishang"  and has lowered the corporate income tax rate and the gift
and inheritance tax rates to enhance investment incentives.</P>
      <P>The government has also lowered prices for land plots in major industrial parks
around the country to make it easier for prospective investors to acquire
factory space, Duh went on, adding that the one-stop service counter will help
with land acquisition and power and water supply issues.</P>
      <P>While government assistance will not be limited to specific industries, Duh
said, the government hopes the returning "taishang" will focus their investments
on environmentally friendly green industries or emerging high-tech industries to
meet the general world market trend.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Wu Den-yih said earlier in the day that "taishang" are
welcome to invest in several old industrial parks where traffic congestion
issues have largely been resolved, as well as in Danhai New Town in Taipei
County's Danshui Township, the Changhua Coastal Industrial Park and the Central
Taiwan Science Park.</P>
      <P>On the same day, President Ma Ying-jeou also made the same appeal to "taishang,
" urging them to set up footholds in the special free trade zones at Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport and five major sea ports to cash in on Taiwan's
largely improved investment climate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UK-Taiwan relations headed in right direction: British diplomat</HEADLINE>

      <P>Relations between Taiwan and the United Kingdom in the areas of trade, tourism
and cultural exchanges have been going well, but Taiwan's reversion to death row
executions is disappointing,  the top British  diplomat  in Taipei indicated
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, said David Campbell, Director of the British Trade and Cultural
Office (BTCO) in Taipei, he is generally optimistic about the direction of the
bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's decision last year to make two international human rights covenants
part of its domestic law was widely welcomed," said Campbell in a speech at the
celebration of Britain's Queen Elizabeth's birthday.</P>
      <P>"It was all the more disappointing, therefore, to see in April the abrupt end to
Taiwna's de facto moratorium on the use of the death penalty," he said.</P>
      <P>Campbell cited Taiwan's silver medal win for its orchids at the prestigious
Chelsea Flower Show and the Queen's visit to the Taiwan stand there last month
as indicators of the scope of U.K.-Taiwan ties and the potential for Taiwan-made
products to succeed in the U.K. market.</P>
      <P>Although 2009 was a bad year for the global economy, Campbell said, U.K. exports
to Taiwan were up 30 percent in the first quarter of 2010 over the same period
last year.</P>
      <P>According to Campbell, the number of Taiwanese visitors to the U.K. increased
more than one third from previous years, after Taiwan was granted a visa-free
privilege in March last year.</P>
      <P>Campbell also said he was pleased to see strong educational links between the
two countries.</P>
      <P>At any given time, there are at least 15,000 Taiwanese students studying in the
U.K., which is the second most popular destination for overseas study among
Taiwan students.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan is cooperating with an online shopping
platform to help businesses promote local produce and food online, Kaohsiung
Mayor Chen Chu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The city government said 25 local businesses selling fruit, sweet and snacks
have set up online shops with help from the Kaohsiung office of Japan's biggest
online shopping platform, Rakuten. The businesses also enjoy good deals from the
Internet platform in terms of online shop fees, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>Chen said a portal has been set up to link to the shops and she expressed hope
that this will help local businesses reach a wider range of customers. She added
that she has been trying to work with Rakuten since making a 2008 visit to the
company in Japan.</P>
      <P>The platform will allow businesses to sell online, take orders via the telephone
and through convenience stores in Taiwan, and use the site's Japan connection to
tap into the Japanese market.</P>
      <P>The mayor said her administration has been promoting local produce by setting up
dedicated display areas in 10 stores of the hypermarket chain Carrefour, and by
holding a farmer's market every month in the city. She said the year-end merger
of Kaohsiung city and county will further benefit local producers.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) set up two first aid stations at Alishan, one of
Taiwan's most popular tourist destinations, after more than 10 Chinese tourists
died this year due to poor health or acute disease, a health official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>A first aid station will also be set up at Sun Moon Lake, another "must-see"
attraction for Chinese tourists, said Wang Zong-si, deputy head of the
Department of Health's Bureau of Medical Affairs.</P>
      <P>Tour guides  should  learn CPR techniques  and familiarize themselves with
medical facilities along their tour routes, he said at a press conference in
Taipei on safety measures for Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Chen Mei-siou, a section chief of the Tourism Bureau, said the bureau is working
to ensure the safety of Chinese tourists and had introduced courses that teach
tour guides how to take care of the elderly. Chen also said tour bus drivers
were prohibited from driving more than 10 hours a day.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Hung-chun, who invited both the officials and travel industry
business leaders to the conference, said 17 Chinese tourists had died of non-
accidental causes since Taiwan opened to cross-strait tourism in July 2008.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kao-ching of the Travel Agency Association said agencies should encourage
elderly tourists to choose less crowded tours, while the Tourist Guide
Association's Chao Man-pai reminded tourists to buy travel insurance.</P>
      <P>Lee urged the Tourism Bureau to look into the issue of tours with overly tight
schedules and suggested local health offices near tourist attractions improve
their services for travelers.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih touted Taiwan's reputation for fine tea Thursday during a
promotion of the 2010 World Tea Expo to be held in central Taiwan's Nantou
County June 19-27.</P>
      <P>The premier took a sip of exquisite Nantou tea, which has been described as a
precious drop that can cost as much as NT$2,000 (US$65) per cup.</P>
      <P>Wu, a former Nantou magistrate, is always keen to help his hometown, which has a
climate and topography that are perfect for growing high quality tea.</P>
      <P>Wu said the tea industry in Nantou reached its peak when he was still the
incumbent there, with oolong tea from Lugu Township Farmer's Association selling
for NT$50,000 per kilo at that time.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the tourism industry in Nantou County has suffered a decline
for the past 10 years, which has also crippled agricultural products, although
the direct flights between China and Taiwan that have brought increasing numbers
of Chinese tourists have helped the county find the new lease on life.</P>
      <P>The 2010 World Tea Expo, organized by the Nantou country government, has invited
tea masters from around the world to demonstrate the art of the tea ceremony and
will also feature a tea exhibition, with an outdoor tea ceremony on the opening
day, said Nantou magistrate Lee Chao-ching.</P>

      <P>The launch of flights between Taipei's Songshan Airport and Shanghai's Hongqiao
Airport will break a bottleneck in Taipei's development, Mayor Hau Lung-bin said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Addressing journalists at a tea party hosted by the mayor, Hau said the flights
will bring the two cities closer together and will make it easier for passengers
to make round trips between the two cities in a single day.</P>
      <P>This will make Taipei a truly international city, according to the mayor.</P>
      <P>Although there are already 28 flights between Songshan and Shanghai's Pudong
International Airport every week, Hongqiao is much nearer to the inner city of
Shanghai and will save passengers about 40 minutes drive time between the city
and Pudong.</P>
      <P>China and Taiwan agreed May 22 to kick off the service between Songshan and
Hongqiao with four flights per day.</P>
      <P>When the flights begin June 14, Hau said, he will lead a team of city officials
on the first flight from Songshan to Hongqiao for a trip to Shanghai to promote
the Taipei Culture Week and the Taipei International Flora Expo.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Culture Week, which began June 3 in Shanghai and will last through
June 28, will feature performances by various opera troupes and music companies
from Taipei in several theaters in the city.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Flora Expo will open Nov. 6 and will run through April 26, 2011.</P>
      <P>During a June 14 meeting with Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng, Hau said he would
present Han with a Taiwan-made e-reader loaded with all 15 of the martial art
novels written by Louis Cha, better known by his pen name of Jin Yong.</P>
      <P>"In order  to provide  Han with a glimpse  into Taiwan's high-technology power
and cultural creative strength, the e-reader will also contain a guided tour of
Taipei," Hau said.</P>
      <P>After the tea party, Hau departed for Hong Kong to promote the Taipei
International Flora Expo.</P>
      <P>He is expected to meet representatives of travel agencies and journalists there
before returning Friday.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Thursday that the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait will need to make serious efforts if they are to
sign a cross-strait trade pact in June.</P>
      <P>"The two sides will really need to work hard, " Lai said before a meeting with
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jyn-ping.</P>
      <P>She was referring  to the proposed  cross-strait  economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) that Taiwan hopes to sign with China later this month.</P>
      <P>Lai noted that a third round of ECFA talks has been scheduled for Sunday in
Beijing, which will focus on the agreement itself.</P>
      <P>But the "early harvest" lists, which form the backbone of the pact and include
items that will receive immediate tariff reductions or exemptions or improved
market access following the ECFA signing, will need further communication, she
said.</P>
      <P>Asked if the signing of the ECFA still is the goal of a round of meetings
between the heads of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) scheduled for this month, Lai
said June is still the goal.</P>
      <P>She added that the SEF-ARATS meeting will be aimed at dealing with the issues of
ECFA and with intellectual property rights protection.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that day, Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Bureau  of Foreign
Trade,  said  that  informal  cross-strait communications on the ECFA have "made
headway."</P>
      <P>Huang, who had just returned to Taiwan after a visit to Beijing to negotiate
with China on major items on the "early harvest" lists, said bilateral
differences on whether to include machine tools, PP and PVC on the lists had not
been resolved, but he added that the items still requiring communication "are
now limited."</P>
      <P>He said that "the ECFA talks are approaching their end, but some negotiations
are still going on."</P>

      <P>The revenues of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the maker of Apple's iPads and
iPhones and the world's largest electronics and computer components
manufacturer, reached NT$163.26 billion (US$5.03 billion) in May, the highest
figure since November 2008, a spokesman for the company announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The figure represents a 6.1 percent growth over April and a whopping increase of
78.1 percent year-on-year, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>He attributed the record high revenues to the hot sales of iPads, iPhones and
Amazon.com Inc.'s Kindle e-books. Apple announced May 31 that its iPad sales had
topped 2 million in less than 60 days since its April 3 launch.</P>
      <P>The company's contracted orders from Sony for LCD TVs and its venture into the
notebook business have also contributed a great deal to the rise of its
revenues, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai's revenues over the first five months amounted to NT$731.89 billion, a
57.71 percent growth over the same period of last year, he said.</P>
      <P>Wang Wan-li, head of Taiwan Research at HSBC Securities, pointed out that a
single-month figure does not reflect the company' overall operations, but he
predicted that Hon Hai's consolidated revenue this year is expected to increase
by 30 percent, based on its consolidated revenue of NT$1.6 trillion in 2009 and
NT$1.95 trillion in 2008.</P>
      <P>On Hon Hai's decision to increase the monthly pay for its Foxconn Technology
assembly line workers in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen by about 90
percent, Wang said the move might affect about 20 percent of its profits.</P>
      <P>Wang also said it will be difficult for the electronics giant to fulfill its
intention to transfer the increased labor costs to its clients, given the fierce
competition in the market, particularly in the notebook sector.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Meeting planned to discuss goat vaccinations to stem GPV</HEADLINE>

      <P>The number of goats culled due to fears of goat pox virus (GPV) had broken
10,000 as of Thursday, and a meeting will be convened next week to discuss
whether to vaccinate the rest of the country's goats to contain the spread of
the disease, a Council of Agriculture (COA) official said that day.</P>
      <P>Yeh Kuo-ching, deputy director of the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
inspection and Quarantine, said the number of goats culled had reached more than
11,000 so far this year in 10 cities and counties -- Chiayi and Tainan cities
and Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung, Changhua, Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung
counties.</P>
      <P>The infections first gave rise for serious concern in April after nearly 800
goats were culled at two farms in Yunlin County's Siluo Township in south-
central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"As the outbreak of the goat pox has yet to reach a peak, the bureau will
convene a meeting  next week to discuss ways of controlling the disease," said
Yeh.</P>
      <P>The bureau will also conduct an overall investigation of nearly 3,000 goat farms
around the country to learn if there have been other sporadic outbreaks that
were not reported, and to learn the views of the farmers.</P>
      <P>The findings will be submitted to experts, who will decide if vaccinations are
needed to control the disease.</P>
      <P>He noted that the bureau purchased 50,000 doses of vaccine June 1 and will buy
180,000 more in two weeks. If a vaccination program is needed, the supplies will
be sufficient to treat 220,000 animals.</P>
      <P>He said this is the second time the disease has been reported in Taiwan. The
first outbreak was in July 2008 in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County, and is
believed to have been related to animal smuggling from GPV-affected areas, which
include Vietnam, China, Mongolia, Africa and the Middle East, although the exact
source has never been confirmed.</P>
      <P>He said that only two goat farms reported GPV infection at that time and that
the disease was brought under control one week after exterminating the goats on
the two farms.</P>
      <P>GPV, a highly contagious disease of small ruminants that is characterized by
fever and ocular and nasal discharges, causes lesions on the skin and on the
mucous membranes of the nostrils, mouth and vulva. Mortality can be high. Most
kids and lambs with the disease tend to die and the death rate among adult
animals is around 50 percent.</P>
      <P>GPV cannot infect humans and can be destroyed by exposure to high temperatures.</P>

      <P>Besides the creation of four new special municipalities, a plan to restructure
the central government is the other policy that will have the greatest impact
and has drawn the most criticism.</P>
      <P>The scale of this upcoming overhaul will be extremely large, with the number of
second-level agencies reduced from 37 to 29 and third-level agencies from 279 to
70.</P>
      <P>The administration of President Ma Ying-jeou should allow time for detailed
discussion about the reforms before pushing them through. While the amended
organic law for the Executive Yuan provides a legal basis for the project's
January 2012 start, it does not mean the work has to be completed in a rush by
that time.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan reportedly has required its subordinate agencies to present
draft plans to revise their organic laws in June or July. This is not a good
idea, because once the drafts are mapped out, it will allow very limited
flexibility for adjustment.</P>
      <P>So far, we have heard a great deal of backlash from the affected agencies and
there will inevitably be chaos if all these agencies are to be restructured at
the same time.</P>
      <P>The Ma administration's  achievements in improving Taiwan's relations  with
China  and  expanding  Taiwan's  international participation will not be crucial
factors that decide the outcome of the 2012 presidential election. The bone of
contention in 2012 will very likely be inter-agency conflicts, civil servants'
undermined rights, and reduced efficiency as a result of the restructuring.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Major technology firms report robust sales</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Undaunted by euro woes, Acer Group reported higher-than-expected business
turnover in May,  reaching NT$50.49 billion (US$1.56 billion) , according to new
data released by the world's largest PC vendor.</P>
      <P>The amount marked an impressive 36.38 percent month-to-month growth and an even
heftier 45.31 percent year-on-year growth.</P>
      <P>Other well-known Taiwan-based technology companies also reported robust  sales
in May.  Among  them was Taiwan  Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC) ,
whose May revenues hit a new high of NT$34.82 billion.</P>
      <P>Buoyed by the company's strong business record, TSMC Chairman Morris Chang
reiterated his previous forecast Thursday that the semiconductor industry's
business prospects will be even rosier in the second half of the year than in
the first half.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the topic:</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Acer's May sales record substantiated Acer CEO J.T. Wang's prediction earlier
this year that the group's business turnover would be better in May and June
than in April.</P>
      <P>Market analysts attributed Acer's stronger-than-expected sales growth in May to
two main factors -- low inventory levels in Europe and advance orders from
retailers in anticipation of price hikes due to the tremendous euro
depreciation.</P>
      <P>Even though some operators said market demand is weakening in Europe amid the
sovereign debt crises in the euro zone, the analysts said notebook sales will
remain brisk in the third quarter of the year, judging from brisk shipments
recorded in May by nearly all major local OEM makers. (June 11, 2010).</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>TSMC Chairman Morris Chang said Thursday that although Europe's debt crisis
might affect market demand there, it will not have a great impact on the global
semiconductor industry because the industry's largest market is in North
America,  which remains relatively healthy.</P>
      <P>Chang's optimism also lies in the fact that China has emerged as the
semiconductor industry's fastest-growing market in the world, which will help
sustain the industry's steady growth.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chang has admitted that the euro debt crisis might fuel irrational
panic across the global financial market. The continued impact from this
irrational reaction is something that deserves concern, he observed. (June 11,
2010)</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Major  Taiwanese  electronics  and  information  technology manufacturers also
reported strong sales growth in May.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the maker of Apple's iPads and iPhones and the
world's largest electronics and computer components manufacturer, posted
NT$163.26 billion in business revenues for May, the highest figure since
November 2008, according to data released by the company Thursday.</P>
      <P>The figure represents a 6.1 percent growth over April and a whopping increase of
78.1 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Quanta Computer reaped NT$92.5 billion in revenues in May, up 84.4 percent from
the same month of last year, while Compal Electronics grossed NT$72.74 billion
in sales, marking a 96.69 percent year-on-year growth.</P>
      <P>ASUSTek Computer also achieved a hefty 79.71 percent annual growth in May, with
monthly revenues amounting to NT$21.84 billion.(June 11, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With an eye on the vast international aerospace market, Taiwan for the first
time opened an exhibition pavilion  this  year  at  the  June  8-13
Internationale Luftfahrt-Ausstellung (ILA) air show in the German city of
Berlin.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan pavilion is hosted by the Gloria Material Technology Corp. (GMTC) ,
a fabricator of special alloy materials,  and Carbon-based Technology Inc. (CBT)
, which designs and produces unmanned aerial systems.</P>
      <P>The ILA, held every two years, has been an important event in the European
aerospace industry since it first opened in 1909.</P>
      <P>Some 1,150 exhibitors from 47 countries are attending the exhibition, giving it
the largest-ever participation rate.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Mei-hua, an executive of the GMTC's planning and control center, said the
company hopes to use the show to gain a toehold in the global supply chain for
the manufacture of Airbus aircraft.</P>
      <P>"Exposing itself in Europe more often and making more contacts with other
businesses, the GMTC will have a bigger chance to become a parts and components
supplier to the international aerospace sector," she said.</P>
      <P>The company, founded in southern Taiwan in 1988, is the country's first
specialty steel fabricator to engage in the manufacture of special alloy
materials. In recent years, it has gained certification from many international
aerospace manufacturers and energy producers, including Boeing, Siemens and GE,
according to Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taichung City-based CBT is presenting its unmanned aerial system
at the show, attracting a lot of attention. CBT Chairman Chung Wen-lung said he
is confident of securing government deals at the show with the system, which
includes a 3.45-kg electrically powered vehicle with a 90-minute cruising time.</P>
      <P>The craft is designed for disaster rescue and military monitoring missions and
has the ability to transmit images directly to a ground control center, Chung
said.</P>

    <DATELINE>06/11/10  11:04:19
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Among the various  national-level  agencies,  the Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC), the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) and the National
Communications Commission (NCC)  are three independent organizations that
operate according to the collegial system of shared decision-making.</P>
      <P>Whether a collegial or chief executive system is more suitable is an issue that
deserves close study.</P>
      <P>In practice, the roles of FTC commissioners are similar to those of prosecutors
and judges and therefore must follow a collegial system.</P>
      <P>As far as the FSC is concerned, however, there are seldom occasions where shared
decision-making is required, so that adopting a chief executive system is
perhaps the right choice.</P>
      <P>In the case of the NCC, which oversees broadcasting content and competition
within the television  and radio industries,  its performance is barely
satisfactory because broadcasting content is a discipline issue, while
competition is a fair trade issue.</P>
      <P>In addition, the NCC is made up of experts with totally different backgrounds,
including   telecommunications   engineering, communications, law and economics.
This leads to the existence of various  factions  within  the organization  and
makes  shared decision-making impossible.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan must assume its responsibility and carry out a
comprehensive overhaul of the NCC organic law. (June 11, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Price-fixing charges will not impact operations: AU Optronics</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) , the world's third-largest flat panel maker, said
Friday that the company's indictment by the U.S. Justice Department for price-
fixing will not have a "material adverse impact" on its day-to-day operations.</P>
      <P>"The company believes in the integrity and fairness of the U.S. justice system
and will continue to defend itself, " AUO said in a statement.</P>
      <P>A federal grand jury in San Francisco charged a Houston-based U.S. subsidiary of
AUO and six of its executives Thursday for participating in a conspiracy to fix
prices of thin-film-transistor liquid crystal display (TFT LCD) panels from
September 2001 to December 2006.</P>
      <P>The six executives facing the indictment include AUO Vice Chairman H.B. Chen and
President L.J. Chen.</P>
      <P>If convicted of price-fixing, they could face up to 10 years in prison, a US$1
million (NT$32.39 million) fine for each individual and a US$100 million fine
for the company, according to the Justice Department.</P>
      <P>AUO said it has cooperated with the Justice Department and other judicial
authorities in the probes into the price-fixing allegations since December 2006
and that it is disappointed with the indictments.</P>
      <P>According to the company, the allegations do not reflect the reality and "the
facts of the case do not warrant such charges, as shown, among others, by
intense competition within the industry."</P>
      <P>This competition, AUO said, has benefited consumers through sharp declines in
flat panel prices over the years.</P>
      <P>AUO said it is "confident justice will prevail."</P>
      <P>So far, the Justice Department said, six electronics companies have pleaded
guilty in connection with the conspiracy case and have paid fines totaling more
than US$860 million.</P>
      <P>It added that following the AUO indictments, a total of 17 executives have been
charged.</P>

      <P>Following recent pay hikes announced by Taiwan-based Foxconn Group for its
Chinese workers, some Chinese businesses in coastal regions of China have also
begun to increase pay for their workers.</P>
      <P>This trend is causing extreme concern among Taiwanese businesses that have

      <P>Options  such as moving to China's hinterland,  seeking a transformation or
upgrade, and relocating to Southeast Asia all pose tremendous challenges. In
comparison, moving back to Taiwan will be more feasible and will generate more

      <P>The government should take advantage of this opportunity to create incentives to

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's red bean cakes -- the next bubble tea craze?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/11/10  13:10:18</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>They're sweet, tasty, and are one of the most popular snacks in Taiwan, but
unlike their beverage cousin -- the Made-in-Taiwan bubble tea or pearl milk tea
which has gained popularity worldwide -- few people outside Taiwan know what red
bean cakes are.</P>
      <P>Thick round cakes slightly bigger than golf balls, they are made of waffle-style
batter, which is poured into round-shaped molds for each side. The sides are
filled with red bean paste. When the two sides are pressed together, like a
waffle maker, they form an easily portable snack which tastes best right out of
the grill.</P>
      <P>But even people from mainland China, which shares a similar culinary heritage as
Taiwan, haven't seen the snacks until they came to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>That's about to change.</P>
      <P>Makers of red bean cakes in Taiwan are hoping to take the snacks overseas and
promote them to become one of the island's best known products.</P>
      <P>Their campaign is getting some help from President Ma Ying-jeou, who is a huge
red bean cake fan, and has inadvertently raised the profile of the little snacks
since he took office in 2008.</P>
      <P>In a widely shown picture taken at the first National Day's party held under
Ma's administration, Ma was just about to put a red bean cake in his mouth while
his wife Christine Chow stared at him.</P>
      <P>During Ma's trip to visit allies in the South Pacific region, red bean cakes
were prepared for guests at a party aboard a Taiwanese Navy's vessel.</P>
      <P>And on many other occasions -- such as ceremonies, media interviews or visits to
markets, Ma was often treated to red bean cakes by various people and
organizations.</P>
      <P>Red bean cakes are believed to have originated from a Japanese dessert known as
"Imagawayaki". The desserts in Japan, which were first baked over 200 years ago,
are often found at Japanese festivals or the food courts of supermarkets.</P>
      <P>But in Taiwan -- a Japanese colony for 50 years -- the desserts have become much
more widely available as they can be found being made fresh on many busy
streets. Long queues are often found outside some famous red bean cake stores.</P>
      <P>"Red bean cakes have been successfully localized in Taiwan," said Andy Wu, a
food critic and radio host of a local food program, adding that the flavor of
the cakes is mostly determined by the quality of the red beans.</P>
      <P>"Although red beans from Pingtung County's Wandan Township in southern Taiwan
are smaller than Japanese ones, they have a richer flavor," Wu added.</P>
      <P>An owner of a red bean cake shop estimated that there are more than 5,000 red
bean cake vendors in Taipei City and Taipei County alone.</P>
      <P>As red bean cakes are popular throughout the country, many people -- especially
middle-aged, unemployed people, want to step into the business. All they need is
a red bean making grill.</P>
      <P>One of the most successful red bean cake makers in Taiwan is Wu Chin-yang, a
former billionaire who lost his fortune in a failed investment, began to sell
red bean cakes late last year.</P>
      <P>With an improved machine invented by himself, Wu's business now can sell up to
1,000 red bean cakes -- at NT$10 apiece -- in Taipei each day.</P>
      <P>"I got to make something different to succeed in fierce competition, " said Wu,
whose shop is located near the largest computer market in the city.</P>
      <P>Wu spent several months inventing a new machine to produce the cakes in a larger
size -- at about 7 centimeters in diameter and 100 grams in weight.</P>
      <P>He also asked for help from a Japanese relative -- who owns a traditional bakery
in Japan -- to create a unique recipe for his red bean cakes, which will not
lose crispness even when they become cold.</P>
      <P>So taken by his red bean cakes, some people from the U.S., South Africa, New
Zealand and Italy have expressed interests in buying Wu' s machines and learning
his know-how so they can sell the cakes in their countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the fast growing number of Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan has not
only brought red bean cake vendors here more business, but also made
entrepreneur Wu eying the vast Chinese market.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese bank has even asked Wu about the possibility of future cooperation
-- in which the bank is willing to offer preferential loans to Wu to expand his
business into China if he can set up 100 vendors. In exchange, they would want
him to post the bank's logo on Wu's red bean cake machines at his shop.</P>
      <P>Chen Jia-tse, a Taiwanese businessman operating in southern China, said the
outlook for the red bean cake business is bright, especially as most people in
wealthy southern provinces like to eat sweets.</P>
      <P>"It is absolutely doable to sell a red bean cake at three Chinese yuan (NT$14)
there, " Chen said, adding that a small cup of Taiwanese pearl milk tea is
priced at least eight Chinese yuan (NT$37) -- nearly 50 percent higher than that
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Victoria Bi, a Chinese manager from Shanghai, found red bean cakes to be the
most delicious food she tasted during her recent two-week visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I have never seen such desserts in China, I really want to bring some red bean
cakes back to Shanghai, " Bi said, adding the local cake's price is surprisingly
low.</P>
      <P>However, it seems there is not much room for vendors to raise red bean cake
prices at present.</P>
      <P>"My clients almost all disappeared after I raised the price by 20 percent, "
said an owner of a renowned red bean cake store, who was forced to cut the price
back to the original level.</P>
      <P>But unlike bubble tea -- which has inspired people overseas to even buy the
tapioca ingredients to make the beverages at home, red bean cakes might face
challenges if it wants to go global.</P>
      <P>For one thing, many Westerners are not used to eating sweet beans, as they are
much more accustomed to lentil, chili or other salt- flavored bean soups.</P>
      <P>Also, food critic Wu said that as red bean cakes usually taste better while
served hot, they may not be easy to be promoted after they are taken far away
from grills and exported.</P>
      <P>If these obstacles can be overcome, however, fans hope red bean cakes can take
the culinary world by storm. By Fanny Liu, CNA staff writer</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 1.63 percent Friday after a strong showing on Wall
Street overnight as a euro rebound against the U.S. dollar gave investors at
home and abroad some relief from concerns over debt problems in the eurozone,
according to dealers.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 117.72 points to 7,299.49 after moving between 7,273.70
and 7,321.60, on turnover of NT$86.96 billion (US$2.68 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 1.69 percent as investors hailed the Dow Jones Industrial
Average's comeback to above the key 10,000-point level overnight, and the
momentum continued throughout the session, led by financial stocks, the dealers
said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,401 stocks closed up and 677 ended the day down, with 276 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The financial sector posted the largest gains, up 2.7 percent. Paper and pulp,
and plastics  and chemicals closed up 1.6 percent each, while machinery and
electronics shares were 1.5 percent higher.</P>
      <P>The cement and construction sectors both gained 1.3 percent, while textiles were
up 0.6 percent and foodstuff shares grew 0.3 percent.</P>
      <P>After recent heavy selling, the valuation of the financial sector has fallen
below that of the broader market, Grand Cathay Securities analyst Mars Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"More importantly, many life insurance companies enjoyed revenue growth in May,
making the financial sector look very attractive at the moment," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Fubon Financial gained 4.08 percent to NT$35.75, Cathay Financial rose 3.76
percent to NT$45.50 and Chinatrust Financial added 2.09 percent to NT$17.10.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, financial holding companies operate insurance, banking and securities
businesses.</P>
      <P>"The local bourse has staged a strong rebound for two trading sessions in a row.
Market sentiment has improved a lot, paving the way for further gains," Hsu
said.</P>
      <P>The previous day, the local bourse closed up 1.55 percent.</P>
      <P>"However, trading volume remained moderate so it will not be easy for the market
to break the heavy technical resistance 7,400-point level unless turnover
expands to NT$110 billion or above," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Flat panel manufacturer AU Optronics saw its shares rise 3.05 percent to
NT$30.40, despite news that a federal grand jury in San Francisco has charged
the company and six of its executives with price-fixing.</P>
      <P>PC maker Acer closed up 3.13 percent at NT$79.20 on its strong May sales
figures, while United Microelectronics Corp. added 2.51 percent to end the
session at NT$14.30 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. rose 1.85 percent
to finish at NT$60.50.</P>

      <P>A common type of protein modification could be a cause of various health
problems, including osteoporosis and hair loss, according to the results of an
international study led by Taiwanese scientists.</P>
      <P>The research,  conducted  on mice,  reveals that defective palmitoylation
resulted in hair loss, severe osteoporosis, cachexia, systemic amyloidosis and
early death in the animals, Academia Sinica said a statement released Friday.</P>
      <P>Palmitoylation is a common protein modification that involves the addition of
palmitate, a fatty acid, to proteins. The study found that the defective
palmitoylation was caused by a mutation in the Zdhhc13 gene, the nation's top
research institute said in the statement.</P>
      <P>It said the mouse model developed by the team will be useful in further
investigation  of the  mechanisms  by which  improper palmitoylation leads to
disease, including the identification of Zdhhc13 target proteins.</P>
      <P>"The elucidation of these proteins would be an exciting first step to
understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying human alopecia, osteoporosis
and many neurodegenerative diseases caused by protein misfolding and
amyloidosis," the statement said.</P>
      <P>The study, headed by Chen Yuan-tsong, director of Academia Sinica's Institute of
Biomedical Sciences, and research fellow Jeffrey Yen, was published in the June

      <P>A dropping birth rate is not the only population problem challenging Taiwan, as
the gender ratio of newborns recorded 109 males for every 100 females in 2009,
the Bureau of Health Promotion (BHP) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The natural ratio of its kind should be 105 males per 100 females, said BHP
Director-General Chiou Shu-ti. Based on this ratio, the higher number of male
births means that "around 4,000 baby girls disappeared last year," according to
Chiou.</P>
      <P>This suggests that the missing female fetuses were intentionally aborted, Chiou
said.</P>
      <P>According to BHP statistics, Taiwan had 191,310 newborns in 2009.</P>
      <P>Among the obstetrics and gynecology departments at hospitals and local clinics
nationwide that delivered at least 80 infants in 2009, 34 observed a notable
gender imbalance, the BHP said.</P>
      <P>One of the facilities even recorded an astonishingly high gender ratio of 178.13
male infants per 100 females, the bureau noted.</P>
      <P>While no clinics specializing in artificial insemination were included on the
list, the BHP has excluded the possibility that the births in the 34 observed
clinics were delivered according to "orders" for male babies, the bureau added,
which leaves only elective gender-based abortion as an explanation for the
skewed figures.</P>
      <P>According to Su Yi-ning, a spokesman for the Taiwan Society of Perinatology, big
hospitals will not agree to accept orders for male babies.</P>
      <P>Technically, the success rate for separating the Y sperm from semen reaches 70
percent, this does not guarantee a male child, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan Receipt Lottery to Celebrate 60th Anniversary</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/11/10  15:58:13</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>You just bought a drink at a convenience store and got a receipt. You look at
the receipt and wonder if you should stick it in your wallet or throw it in the
trash. Maybe there's a reason to think again.</P>
      <P>Twenty-nine people won the NT$2 million (US$61,735) grand prize in Taiwan's most
recent receipt lottery draw of uniform invoice numbers that covered March and
April.</P>
      <P>One winner spent as little as NT$10 on a drink at a convenience store and
another spent NT$1,460 at a department store, while another paid NT$1,040 for
cable TV fees, according to the lottery's winning list.</P>
      <P>To mark the 60th anniversary of the implementation of Taiwan's uniform invoice
this year, a road-run event took place in June 6 in Kaohsiung, part of a series
of events all over Taiwan to celebrate the anniversary. More than 10,000 people
took part in the "Health, Hope and Run Forward" run, and more than 20,000
receipts were collected and donated to Kaohsiung's Liouguei elementary school
track team.</P>
      <P>Additional runs will take place in Taichung City Aug. 1 and in Taipei City Oct.
17.</P>
      <P>First introduced in 1950, the receipts also serve as lottery tickets, with
prizes awarded every two months ranging from NT$200 to NT$2 million.</P>
      <P>The 60th anniversary of the issuing of uniform invoices is meaningful because
without the invoices, value-added business tax could not have been implemented,
according to Deputy Finance Minister Chang Sheng-ford.</P>
      <P>Since its implementation, the lottery has helped the government prevent tax
evasion and generate more revenue by giving the public the incentive to demand
receipts for their purchases.</P>
      <P>A year after the enactment of the receipt lottery, Taiwan's business revenue
increased by 75 percent, according to the Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>By 1988, as much as 3 percent of the country's total business tax revenue was
being allocated for the receipt lottery, spurring a national craze over the
collection of the receipts that could bring fortune.</P>
      <P>The lottery has been promoted by the government on variety shows and has even
had a promotional song that touts the benefits of demanding a receipt.</P>
      <P>Business owners that have outstanding records of giving uniform invoices are
rewarded with government medals and certificates, and are given privileges when
passing through customs.</P>
      <P>In addition to its role as a print record of commercial transactions and a
lottery ticket, the invoice has another role -- as an important source of income
for local charity groups.</P>
      <P>Genesis Social Welfare Foundation, one of the first charity groups to collect
unwanted uniform invoices, received over 99 million receipt donations in 2009,
worth a total of over NT$92 million, and today, uniform invoice donation boxes
can be seen in shops and businesses around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Ministry  of Finance  said in late May that it will significantly increase
the chances of winning the lottery in 2011 in the wake of demands from the
public to raise the probability of hitting the jackpot.</P>
      <P>An NT$1.8 billion increase in lottery prizes can be expected, according to
Ministry of Finance officials.</P>
      <P>The government is also pushing for E-uniform invoices that will allow receipts
to be saved electronically to a government service platform that stores and
matches winning numbers automatically.</P>
      <P>It has been estimated that the implementation of E-uniform invoices will save
the printing of 8 billion receipts each year, along with reduced management and
mailing costs. By Christie Chen CNA Staff Writer</P>

    <HEADLINE>Magazine digest - Purpose of China delegations' visits to Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/11/10  16:11:39
(translated by Kay Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Since May 2009, delegations from various provinces in China have been visiting
Taiwan, as relations between the two sides continue to warm up. The visits have
become more about putting on a good show to impress Taiwanese rather than
bringing business to the country.</P>
      <P>The first two delegations from China in May and November 2009 comprised a total
of some 5,000 people, including officials and tourists, and both revolved around
the theme of trade and economic cooperation. The focus was on the number of
business deals and product procurement orders and on banquets for the Chinese
officials, Taiwanese politicians and business leaders, which drew criticisms of
extravagance.</P>
      <P>The Chinese were quick to react to the criticisms. When a delegation from
central China's Henan Province visited in December 2009,  a cultural aspect was
introduced with performances  of traditional Chinese opera and demonstrations of
Shaolin Temple kung fu. The delegation also ventured outside Taipei to Tainan in
southern Taiwan, a stronghold of the pro-independence opposition party.</P>
      <P>When Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng arrived in Taiwan in April as the head of a
delegation to promote the 2010 World Expo in his city, his visit took on a
different profile from those of the previous delegations. Han visited night
markets and talked with high school students to get a feel of life in Taiwan,
rather than just meeting with leaders.</P>
      <P>Since then, other delegations have softened the themes of their trips, citing
purposes such as "visiting relatives" (according to a delegation from Fujian
where many Taiwanese families originated) and "giving thanks" (according to a
delegation from Sichuan, for the help Taiwanese offered during the 2008
earthquake) . They all visited cities and towns around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The economic value of these visits is not as important as their cultural impact
on Taiwan, because the purchasing orders will be placed whether or not the
delegations visit Taiwan. The important thing is that the visits make both sides
look good. China can use them as propaganda, while the ruling Kuomintang in
Taiwan can tout them as indications of economic progress.</P>
      <P>For the Taiwan people, these cultural exchanges are bringing China too close to
their daily lives for comfort. The the challenge for the Taiwan government now
is how to maintain the right distance. (The Journalist 1214).</P>

      <P>With Taipei's Songshan Airport expected to launch direct flights to Shanghai's
Hongqiao Airport, Taiwanese businesspeople operating in China accounted for
nearly 30 percent of all Taipei luxury home sales in May, a real estate agent
said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the Yung Ching Realty Group, among buyers of luxury homes in May,
China-based Taiwanese businesspeople accounted for 27.4 percent of sales -- the
highest ever in the company's record, compared with 9.5 percent in January.</P>
      <P>The real estate company defined luxury homes as those sold at a minimum of
NT$300,000 (US$9,270) per square meter (or NT$1 million per ping).</P>
      <P>Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport is located in the northern part of Minhang District,
a major commercial and residential area for Taiwanese people, with about 74,000
of them residing short term and 8,050 long term, according to the district's
data.</P>
      <P>Jeffrey Huang, assistant manager of the research department at Yung Ching, said
that statistics showed that many Taiwanese people have business-travel needs
across the Taiwan Strait, so direct flights between Songshan and Hongqiao
sharply increase  their willingness to buy houses in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang said, however, that the time it takes to reach a deal did not shorten,
because it is basically a sell-side market.</P>
      <P>"Most owners of those luxury homes have deep pockets. If there isn't a good
offer, they would rather wait for the next expected buying spree -- from
mainland Chinese investors," Huang said.</P>
      <P>He said that the extremely expensive homes -- those that sell for over NT$60
million -- accounted for about 3.5 percent of its property sales recently, more
than double from around 1.3 percent late last year.</P>

      <P>Environmental protection groups held a flash mob protest Friday in front of the
Presidential Office, calling on the government to draw a clear line between
government and business and to respect the normal environmental impact
assessment process for a petrochemical park project.</P>
      <P>Gan Chen-yi, a spokesman for Taiwan Matsu's Fish Conservation Union, said the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) has held intensive  meetings  on
issues  related  to the Kuokuang Petrochemical Park development project in
central Taiwan's Changhua County.</P>
      <P>Last week, a meeting was held on the possible impact of the project on the
coastal topography in the area. This week, three experts meetings were convened
on the possible impact of the project on dolphins, water resources and human
health, according to Gan.</P>
      <P>The frequency and intensity of the meetings has broken all records, including
the weekly meetings that preceded the fourth phase of the Central Science Park
development project, Gan said.</P>
      <P>The EPA's move to speed up the environmental assessment process for the project
was made under the instruction of Premier Wu Den-yih to allow the construction
of the project to go ahead as planned.</P>
      <P>Wu's order came after a threat from Kuokuang Petrochemical Technology Co. in May
that private investors will withdraw their funds from the project if it fails to
pass the EPA environmental assessment at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Some of the environmentalists who showed up at the flash mob event said that
President Ma Ying-jou came up with the line of saving the country through
environmental protection, but he was mouthing only empty platitudes as the
government is only serving the interests of a few business conglomerates.</P>
      <P>They said they therefore staged the protest to demand that the government match
its deeds to its words and to impose strict restrictions on high-polluting
industries.</P>

      <P>Shares of personal computer vendor Acer Inc. closed sharply higher Friday after
its robust May figures boosted buying, overcoming concerns over reduced
consumption in Europe, dealers said.</P>
      <P>Acer rose 3.13 percent at NT$79.20 (US$2.44) with 20.39 million shares changing
hands, while the weighted index closed up 1.63 percent at 7,299.49.</P>
      <P>The world's largest notebook computer vendor posted NT$50.49 billion in sales
for May, up 36.38 percent from April and up 45.29 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>"The figures did surprise me, " MasterLink Securities analyst Tom Tang said.</P>
      <P>"The May sales showed Acer was not affected by falling demand from Europe amid
lingering debt worries, but shipments of its rivals are weakening," he said.</P>
      <P>AsusTek Computer reported a 22 percent decline in May sales from April, while
Quanta Computer recorded a 4.7 percent fall.</P>
      <P>An analyst with a regional brokerage pointed out that Acer posted a 17 percent
decline in April from March after the European debt crisis surfaced.</P>
      <P>"Acer's performance in April and May was not consistent. We need more sales
figures to determine whether Acer will be able to weather the weakness of the
euro," said the analyst, who requested anonymity.</P>
      <P>The analyst added that she suspected Acer's May figure came after the company
delayed deliveries from April to May.</P>
      <P>In the first quarter, Acer ranked the largest PC computer vendor in Western
Europe, taking a 23.4 percent share of the market, according to Gartner Inc., a
U.S.-based information technology research firm.</P>
      <P>Tang said Acer's performance on Friday largely came from bargain hunters after a
recent sell-off.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ex-president offers to wire more money back in return for release</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former president Chen Shui-bian, who has been in detention since Dec. 30, 2009
in connection with corruption, forgery and money laundering charges, promised
Friday to wire more of his overseas funds back to Taiwan if the court releases
him.</P>
      <P>In his oral plea for release on bail, the former president told the Taiwan High
Court that he will wire another NT$570 million back to Taiwan in addition to the
US$21 million that the court is seeking to confiscate from the former first
family.</P>
      <P>During a hearing on his request for release on bail, Chen thanked the court for
cutting his sentence from life imprisonment to 20 years. He said he appreciated
the court's refusal to grant the prosecutors' request for the harshest penalty
to be handed down to him or for lower court's sentence to be upheld.</P>
      <P>"It gave me hope that the court will free me to allow me to clear my name though
the justice system," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said that his family has NT$570 million in the Wegelin bank in Switzerland,
in addition to funds in Merrill Lynch Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland in that
country. If he is released, he said, he will complete the paperwork to transfer
the Wegelin bank funds to Taiwan within one week.</P>
      <P>"All of that money was political contributions from my supporters and has
nothing to do with the charges against me, " the former president said.</P>
      <P>Regarding the US$21 million deposits at Merrill Lynch Bank and Royal Bank of
Scotland, one of Chen's lawyers said US$14.52 million has already been remitted
to Taiwan as requested by prosecutors, and the balance has been frozen by Swiss
authorities.</P>
      <P>The attorney said the prosecutors' claim that Chen would try to flee the country
if he was released cannot hold water.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors have asked the court to keep Chen in custody to ensure that he
serves his full sentence when the trials end.</P>
      <P>The high court, which had suggested during its hearing of Chen's appeal that it
might favorably consider his request for bail if he transfers his overseas funds
back to Taiwan, ordered that he be remanded in custody while he is awaiting the
ruling.</P>
      <P>The court will decide before June 23, when Chen's detention period expires,
whether to detain him for another two months.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife Wu Shu-jen were accused of accumulating about NT$1 billion in
embezzled public funds and bribes during Chen's terms as president.</P>

      <P>Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services has upgraded its outlook on Taiwan's
long-term sovereign credit rating to stable from negative on optimism over the
prospects for sustained growth.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued by S&amp;P Friday, the rating agency also affirmed its
'AA-' long-term and 'A-1+' short term ratings for the country.</P>
      <P>"The revision in outlook reflects our expectations that the Taiwan economy will
build on its strong rebound from the recent slowdown to achieve sustained growth
at close to a trend annual rate of 4 percent," said KimEng Tan, an S&amp;P
credit analyst.</P>
      <P>"We believe that this will help to stabilize Taiwan's public finances by
gradually bringing down the general government fiscal deficit," Tan added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan emerged from a recession in the fourth quarter of 2009 after its economy
contracted by a record 9.06 percent in the first quarter of the year amid a
global financial meltdown.</P>
      <P>In May, Taiwan's government raised its forecast for economic growth in 2010 to
6.14 percent from a previous estimate of 4.72 percent after the country's
economy grew 13.27 percent in the first three months of 2010, the highest rate
of quarterly growth since Q3 1978.</P>
      <P>"The stable outlook reflects our expectation that sustained growth will
contribute to the stabilization of the government's fiscal position in the
coming three-to-five years," said Tan.</P>
      <P>S&amp;P said that because Taiwan has a strong external balance sheet, a dynamic
private sector and abundant domestic liquidity, it can fund government deficits
through domestic channels.</P>
      <P>Those strengths were tempered, however, by a high government debt burden and
high structural deficits relative to similarly rated peers, the rating agency
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's outstanding government debt totals NT$4.2 trillion (US$130 billion) ,
roughly 32 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) . The figure is expected
to rise to NT$4.5 trillion next year, or about 35 percent of GDP.</P>
      <P>The government has repeatedly said its finances are tight but stable.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's exports to Europe's PIIGS countries (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece
and Spain) totaled US$1.72 billion in the first five months of this year,
accounting for 1.6 percent of the country's total exports, the Ministry of
Finance said Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported a total of US$109.3 billion in goods in the first five months,
up nearly 53 percent from the same period last year.</P>
      <P>Exports to all of Europe reached US$11.5 billion during the five-month period,
representing 40.4 percent growth year-on-year, while imports from Europe
increased by 59.3 percent to US$10.1 billion.</P>
      <P>Germany was Taiwan's biggest export market in Europe, with US$2.5 billion in
exports between January and May, followed by exports of US$2.1 billion to the
Netherlands and US$1.4 billion to the U.K.</P>
      <P>Hu Chung-ying, deputy minister of the Council for Economic Planning and

      <P>Consolidation in Taiwan's local banking sector is essential for the survival of
local banks in an environment where interest rate spreads are falling below one
percent, a prominent local banker said Friday.</P>
      <P>Victor Kung, president of Fubon Financial Holding Co., Taiwan's second-largest
publicly traded financial holding company, said local banks will only be able to
operate profitably in the future if they merge with their counterparts.</P>
      <P>At present, fierce competition among local banks and the low interest rate
environment are narrowing profits and present major obstacles to future
development, Kung said in a speech at a seminar organized by Taipei-based Shih
Chien University and the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance.</P>
      <P>Narrowing interest spreads -- the difference between the rates at which banks
lend and the rates they pay on deposits -- have particularly squeezed bank
profits since the financial crisis in late 2008.</P>
      <P>The excessive fragmentation of Taiwan's banking sector has also limited profit
potential, Kung said.</P>
      <P>Though the top five banks account for market shares of more than 80 percent in
Singapore and South Korea respectively, the top five banks in Taiwan have a
relatively small 43 percent share of the local market, he said.</P>
      <P>"No one can earn enough to thrive unless they can expand their scale of
operations through mergers to ease competition, " Kung argued.</P>
      <P>Because state-controlled banks control half of Taiwan's market, Kung said they
must play an important  role in the sector's consolidation and should move
toward privatization and mergers as part of a financial reform campaign.</P>
      <P>While the Fubon Financial president advocated the approach, he acknowledged  the
process would be challenging because of the difference in corporate cultures
between private and state-owned banks.</P>
      <P>Fubon engineered such a union in 2005 when it formally merged its Fubon
Commercial Bank with the publicly-owned Taipei Bank, which it acquired in 2002.</P>

      <P>If there is going to be a conflict between the United States and China, it would
start with Taiwan, and the scale of the conflict would be larger than the wars
in Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. scholars said in Taipei on Friday.</P>
      <P>"The rise of China will be one of the most important issues in 21st century U.S.
foreign policy" and the Taiwan Strait is the core of potential conflict between
the world's two superpowers, although the possibility is low, said Richard Bush,
former chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and director of the
Brookings Institution's Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies.</P>
      <P>Bush and Michael O'Hanlon, a researcher at Brookings Institution who specializes
in national security and defense policy, were in Taipei launching "A War Like No
Other -- The Truth About China's Challenge to America, " a book they co-authored
in 2007 that is now being released in Chinese.</P>
      <P>"As a defense analyst like many others in the United States who spent a lot of
time studying Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan, these problems -- as bad as
they have been -- are modest in scale compared to what the cross-strait conflict
can quickly become, " O'Hanlon said.</P>
      <P>Most Americans and people on this side of the Pacific Ocean were not aware of
the potential size of the conflict, he added.</P>
      <P>The risk of Chinese invasion of Taiwan is small, O'Hanlon said, because modern
technology makes it unlikely that big ships could cross the Taiwan Strait
without being detected. China is more likely to use a blockade, complemented by
missile strikes and a cyber-attack -- a move that is "less threatening but in a
more acute sense, " he said.</P>
      <P>China would be able to carry out offensives against merchant ships during the
blockade, cease the operation if the U.S. reacts, and re-impose it later, he
said.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what some people think, O'Hanlon said, China would not be able to
take Taiwan by force easily because Taiwan has a "robust survivable commanding
control." The survivability of Taiwan's air force, including its ability to
repair airfields quickly, would be crucial in the early days of an attack
because it could make it very difficult for China to carry out a successful
assault. Anti-submarine warfare is also important for Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, avoiding conflicts is equally important, Bush said, because "when you
realize modern war, you treasure peace even more."</P>
      <P>Although the U.S. is bound by the Taiwan Relations Act, passed by the U.S.
Congress in 1979, to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character and help
Taiwan resist any force of coercion that would jeopardize its people, whether or
not the U.S. would intervene in a cross-strait conflict has been much discussed.</P>
      <P>Bush said that how the U.S. reacts would depend on who made the provocation,
although he added that sometimes the definition of "provocation" is ambiguous.</P>
      <P>Alexander Huang, a professor at Tamkang University's Graduate Institute of
International Affairs and Strategic Studies, said that as the Chinese economy is
rising rapidly, it would not be wise for China's next generation of leaders to
ignite a conflict.</P>
      <P>"How Taiwan shapes up its China policy is more important, " Huang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No new conditions set for private school tuition subsidy: MOE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Education Minister Wu Ching-ji reaffirmed Friday that his ministry's plan to
level the difference in tuition payments at private and public high schools will
be implemented based on three factors that would exclude well-to-do families.</P>
      <P>Wu said that in addition to annual household income, the value of real estate
and annual interest income will also be factored into the formula to determine
which families would be eligible to receive subsidies for private school tuition
fees.</P>
      <P>"When the ministry devised the plan to offer the subsides, real estate value and
annual interest income were considered as factors to be used to determine
eligibility, " he said. "These are not new conditions."</P>
      <P>Wu's remarks came on the heels of his ministry's statement Thursday that the
initiative will exclude families with an annual household income of more than
NT$900,000, those who own three or more pieces of real estate with a minimum
total value of NT$6.5 million, or have annual interest income of more than
NT$100,000.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) first announced the new tuition policy in March,
saying it will be a major step toward its goal of 12-year compulsory education.</P>
      <P>Since then, many private high schools have been using the ministry's promise of
subsidized fees in their advertisements, and some 10,000 junior high school
graduates have been accepted to private vocational and high schools for the new
academic year that starts in September.</P>
      <P>However, the Cabinet announced early this month that families with an annual
household income of more than NT$600,000 will not qualify for the subsidy. But
amid public criticism of that decision, the income ceiling was raised to
NT$900,000.</P>
      <P>Under the policy, students in the first, second and third year of senior and
vocational high schools and the first three years of junior college, whose
families qualify for the subsidy, will receive around NT$17,000 per semester
from the government. This means they would be left to pay only around NT$6,000
per semester, which is in line with the fees at public senior high schools.</P>
      <P>According to the MOE's initial estimates, raising the annual household income
ceiling to NT$900,000 will allow an additional 40,000 students to receive the
subsidy, instead of the 120,000 originally estimated.</P>
      <P>When added to the 170,000 students who receive tuition waivers or reductions
under various programs, it will bring the number of private school students at
that level receiving subsidies to 330,000, which is 70 percent of the total
number attending such schools.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan High Court reduced the sentence of former President Chen Shui-bian
and his wife on appeal in a corruption case because it used a tighter standard
than a lower court in defining what constituted "embezzlement," the court said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen and wife Wu Shu-jen were found guilty last September by the Taipei District
Court of embezzling more than NT$100 million (US$3.09 million) from a special
state affairs fund, receiving bribes worth NT$870 million, and laundering part
of the money through Swiss bank accounts.</P>
      <P>After Chen and Wu appealed the verdict, the Taiwan High Court upheld the
convictions Friday but reduced their life sentences to 20 years in prison after
concluding the couple embezzled less from the state affairs fund than the
district court had ruled, presiding judge Teng Chen-chiu said.</P>
      <P>Unlike the district court, which found that the couple had siphoned off NT$100
million from the fund designated for the president's discretionary use for
official purposes, the high court said the couple embezzled about NT$14 million.</P>
      <P>The high court determined that part of the funds deemed by the district court as
being misused were actually allocated to secret diplomatic missions and
therefore went to appropriate public uses.</P>
      <P>Other funds that went to cover expenses in the presidential residence were
considered by the lower court to be embezzled were appropriately spent, the high
court said, because the residence is an official entity.</P>
      <P>The former first couple were given life sentences and fined NT$35 million each
by lower court for the abuse of the state affairs fund, but the high court cut
the sentences to 14 years and the fines to NT$20 million.</P>
      <P>On the charges of taking kickbacks in a Longtan land deal, the former first
couple saw their 20-year imprisonment shortened to 12 years in prison, but the
high court maintained the couples eight-year sentences for taking bribes after
helping a businesswoman land the Taipei 101 CEO post.</P>
      <P>The 18-year prison term for Wu for her role in a Nangang Exhibition Hall
construction kickback case was reduced to 16 years.</P>
      <P>Only Wu had been indicted of money laundering charges and the high  court  meted
out a seven-month  prison  term  for the wheelchair-confined former first lady.</P>
      <P>The high court combined the sentences to a total of 20 years in prison for Chen
and Wu.</P>
      <P>Chen and Wu's fines were also reduced to NT$170 million and NT$200 million,
respectively, down from the original NT$200 million and NT$300 million.</P>
      <P>The period for which each of them will be deprived of their civil rights was
also shortened to 10 years from life.</P>
      <P>Chen has adamantly insisted on his innocence, arguing that he is the victim of
efforts by incumbent President Ma Ying-jeou to punish him for his pro-
independence stance.</P>
      <P>According to his lawyer, Chen accepted the high court ruling with mixed
feelings.</P>
      <P>"He was not pleased by the ruling and believes he should have been acquitted, "
said Shih Yi-lin. "But he also believes he has a good chance on the next appeal
to the Supreme Court, so he was not especially upset."</P>
      <P>Prosecutors from the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office said they will decide whether to appeal the reduced sentences
after receiving the high court ruling.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Firms mull moving production from China to Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 11 (CNA)

      <P>A growing number of China-based Taiwanese companies are planning to move parts
of their production lines back to Taiwan amid rising wages in China, a Taiwanese
business alliance said Friday.</P>
      <P>"It is obvious that the labor cost (in China) is no longer low," Taiwan's
General Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of China said in a statement.
"Taiwanese companies have lost their advantages in setting up factories in the
mainland."</P>
      <P>"Many companies are thinking about relocating some of their production lines
back to Taiwan," the statement noted.</P>
      <P>The statement came after Foxconn Technology Group, as the world's biggest
contract electronics maker Hon Hai is known in China, and Japanese carmaker
Honda raised their Chinese workers' pay to cope with labor disputes.</P>
      <P>In the statement, the chamber urged the Taiwan government to help local
businesses investing in China deal with the fallout from wage hikes.</P>
      <P>The chamber also recognized the government's efforts in easing restrictions to
attract more Taiwanese companies to return from China.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs said Friday that NT$22.1 billion (US$683
million) from China-based Taiwanese companies was invested in Taiwan between
January and May this year.</P>
      <P>The combined amount accounts for 58 percent of the ministry's goal of NT$38
billion for the entire year, the ministry said in a statement.</P>
      <P>A cross-strait pact that is expected to be signed later this month to further
liberalize trade could also prompt some China-based Taiwanese businesses to
increase their investment in Taiwan, said C.Y. Ling, the director-general of the
ministry's Department of Investment Services.</P>
      <P>For example,  Tingyi (Cayman  Islands)  Holding  Corp.,  a Taiwanese-owned
company that is the biggest maker of instant noodles in China, told Ling late
last year that it might expand its production line in Taiwan and transport goods
from Taiwan to its markets in central and southern China to save costs.</P>
      <P>The ministry will organize a summit on June 15 to better inform China-based
Taiwanese businesses on how to use Taiwan's research and development to upgrade
their competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang Pen-tsao, the chairman of the chamber of commerce, told
reporters before a seminar in Taipei that Foxconn's pay hikes could force other
Taiwanese companies to follow suit.</P>
      <P>"We don't want to see Foxconn's large pay raises trigger a domino effect that
forces other companies to increase their workers' pay, " he said.</P>
      <P>"Many Taiwanese companies might be forced out of business, as electronics
companies' profits are already small," he said.</P>

      <P>Taipei-based Yuanta Futures signed a cooperation agreement with a Chinese
futures company Friday to take advantage of new opportunities in the cross-
Taiwan Strait market and possibly set the stage for investing in each other in
the future.</P>
      <P>The cooperative arrangement with Hangzhou-based Yongan Futures is the largest
strategic alliance between futures companies across the strait, Yuanta said in a
statement issued Friday.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan's futures market has long stressed the development of financial
futures, coinciding with futures development trends in China, Yuanta said the
cooperative alliance between the two companies should be mutually beneficial.</P>
      <P>Yuanta and Yongan also have similar levels of capitalization, making it easy for
them to invest in each other or to form joint ventures, the statement said.</P>
      <P>As a state-run company, Yongan has capital of 184 million yuan, and has
memberships in the stock exchanges in Shanghai, Dalian, northeastern China, and
Zhengzhou, central China.</P>
      <P>It has 22 business outlets around China's coastal economic zones, in addition to
a branch office in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Yongan led China's futures companies last year in brokerage income and net
income and third in trading volume.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, Yuanta and Yongan will explore the possibility of
further commercial cooperation once investment in futures companies across the
Taiwan Strait is permitted.</P>
      <P>For now, the two companies will share their experience in training staff members
and may cooperate on futures consulting if approved by the authorities.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Taiwanese executive at China's First Sino Bank said Friday that despite
the vast Chinese market, it is very difficult for foreign banks to do business
in China.</P>
      <P>Steve H. Y. Hsieh, who has served as CEO and president of the bank since 2006,
said at a forum in Taipei that Taiwanese banks should not be overly optimistic
about venturing into China.</P>
      <P>Noting that the market share held by foreign banks is less than 2 percent, Hsieh
said that although many Taiwanese financial holding companies think China offers
tremendous opportunities, based on his four years of work experience in China,
he feels business there is very difficult for foreign banks.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that as China has lifted banking restrictions only gradually, foreign
banks in China have limited access to China's financial services market.</P>
      <P>Despite acknowledging the difficulties, Hung Hsin-shih, vice president of
Taiwan's First Financial Holding Co., said that Taiwan's financial institutions
and banks still need to tap into China's market because Taiwan is saturated.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's financial services sector hopes to be included in the "early harvest"
list of a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) that will
give it better access to the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>The "early harvest" list refers to merchandise and services that will be granted
tariff concessions or more liberal market access immediately after the ECFA is
signed.</P>
      <P>Victor Kung, president of Fubon Financial Holding Co., said earlier this year
that the company hopes to set up 200 outlets in China within five to 10 years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government began accepting applications in late May from Chinese banks
wishing to set up offices in Taiwan or purchase stakes in domestic banks.</P>
      <P>Shen Chung-hua, a professor at National Taiwan University's Department of
Finance, said Chinese banks' investment in Taiwan is aimed at attracting
Taiwanese clients operating large companies in China, rather than local
customers in Taiwan or China-based small and medium-sized enterprises. They will
also target Chinese businesses with investments in Taiwan, Shen said.</P>
      <P>By investing in Taiwan,  Chinese banks could also acquire knowledge of financial
services and hire local talent to set up footholds, Shen said. They will be able
to gather credit information about Taiwanese businesses in China and use it to
expand mortgage lending to those companies.</P>
      <P>Chinese banks can also collaborate with foreign banks that have operated in
Taiwan for years by gaining stakes or forming strategic alliances in order to
gain access to more potential customers, Shen said.</P>

      <P>The prison sentences for former President Chen Shui-bian and his family were
greatly reduced when the Taiwan High Court announced its verdict on Chen's
corruption and money-laundering case Friday.</P>
      <P>Although the verdict contained very harsh criticism of Chen, the sentence did
not reflect the judicial detachment and accountability that the court should
have displayed.</P>
      <P>At the same time, a group of Chen's supporters were gathering outside the court
singing "Taiwan and China, One Country On Either Side" -- a song written by
Chen. The protesters repeatedly accused the court of "persecuting Chen" and the
administration of President Ma Ying-jeou of "currying favor with China."</P>
      <P>In today's Taiwan, some people think Chen is an unforgivable corrupt politician,
and some others consider him a hero of the Taiwan independence movement.</P>
      <P>Politics has confused the judiciary, and the judiciary has been sunk in
political uproar. As a result, the judicial sense of right and wrong cannot be
upheld, nor can the political standard of right and wrong be established. (June

      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian and his family all received lighter sentences
when the second-trial verdict on his corruption and money-laundering case was
announced Friday.</P>
      <P>No matter how disappointed they were, those who disagree with the court's
decision should not invent some conspiracy theories, which could undermine the
people's trust in the judiciary.</P>
      <P>The main conspiracy theories are grounded on various assumptions. First, the
judges based their decision on political considerations. Second,  both the
ruling Kuomintang  and opposition Democratic Progressive Party had great
influence over the judges. Third, the judges maintain a strong friendship with
the defendants. Fourth, President Ma Ying-jeou interfered with the trial.</P>
      <P>None of this speculation is supported by evidence.</P>
      <P>Many people lack confidence in the judiciary because they still hold the past
authoritarian impression that the judiciary is enslaved by politics. As a matter
of fact, Taiwan's judiciary has made a lot of progress and is far more
independent than before. Let's offer our trust and support for the judiciary to
encourage it to make even more progress and become more independent. (June 12,

waiting for this chance for a long time, " he said, adding that he and his
sister heard about the language center from their brother, who studied there
years ago.</P>
      <P>The Dragon Boat Festival is one of three major festivals in Chinese culture. It
takes place on the fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar, which
falls on June 16 this year, a public holiday in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During this period of time, dragon boat races will be held in the northern,
central and southern parts of Taiwan to commemorate Qu Yuan, a Chinese poet and
minister in the state of Chu.</P>
      <P>Qu lived in the Warring States Period more than 2,000 years ago and was banished
from Chu for opposing an alliance with the state of Qin. During his exile, he
composed a great deal of poetry, for which he is now remembered.</P>
      <P>Later, when Qin conquered Chu, the poet committed suicide in despair. He drowned
himself in a river and legend has it that a crowd gathered and beat the water
with paddles to keep fish from eating Qu's body -- the origin of today's dragon
boat races.</P>
      <P>Pamela Maldonado from Honduras, who has lived in Taiwan for about eight months,
said that after hearing the story of Qu Yuan and the Dragon Boat Festival, she
felt joining the races would be a good opportunity to experience culture in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Even though I have to get up very early, around 5:30 a.m. every morning, it is
a commitment which made me believe I could do something if I really want to, "
she said.</P>
      <P>The team went from land training on the university's track to training in a
swimming pool and then moved to the Keelung River to actually paddle boats,
learning that teamwork and synchronization are more important than strength. A
stronger but less coordinated team will almost always lose to one with paddlers
that move in perfect harmony.</P>
      <P>"I learned a lot about leadership from this, who can make a group maintain
balance," said American Julie Tu, who returned to Taiwan to learn Mandarin again
and chose to enter the competition again after a gap of 19 years.</P>
      <P>Tu was a consultant on Wall Street for many years, but now has a different plan
for her career, so she came to Taiwan to attend the Lee Teng-Hui Academy and
learn Mandarin at the center.</P>
      <P>Carlos Carter, also from the United States, admitted that it's a little painful
at the first stage of training -- having to get up early and do a lot of
exercise -- but later he found that he had become addicted to it.</P>
      <P>"I have learned a lot about my limits and how to conquer them, " he said, adding
that he'd picked up a few new Mandarin terms as well, such as "jiaolian" (coach)
and "yubei" (get ready).</P>
      <P>Married to a Taiwanese, Rebecca Huang from New Zealand is experiencing her first
Dragon Boat Festival in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Everything is so new and different to me, " she said, but by joining the team,
she felt she could more easily assimilate into Taiwan's culture and lifestyle.</P>
      <P>"I believe this will become the most important memory in my life," she said. By

      <P>According to a press release from Taiwan's embassy in St. Lucia, the police

      <P>The government's efforts to encourage Taiwanese businesses in China to return
home for investment in recent years have produced few results. Businesses always
ask: What can we do after returning?</P>
      <P>The question raised by businesses shows that unless there are other production
models or new industries worth trying, they may not be able to move regardless
of their intentions.</P>
      <P>To attract the businesses, the government has put forth the idea of setting up
"special economic and trade zones" in selected ports or "special zones" for
returned businesses.</P>
      <P>How to complement the strengths of Taiwanese businesses overseas and at home is
crucial to whether the idea can truly be materialized.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's competitive edge lies in the mass production capacity of its overseas
businesses, the strong capacity by businesses at home to produce intermediate
goods and innovate, and the country's cultural plurality. The special zones
should function as a platform that effectively integrates these advantages.</P>
      <P>If that goal is realized, overseas businesses will no longer wonder what they
would do after returning home. (June 12, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Court slashes Chen's sentence to 20 years</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/12/10  14:00:32
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court rejected former President Chen Shui-bian's appeal of his
conviction on charges of corruption, forgery and money laundering Friday, but
lightened the sentences for him and former first lady Wu Shu-jen from life
imprisonment to 20 years.</P>
      <P>Fines for Chen and Wu were also reduced to NT$170 million (US$5.26 million) and
NT$200 million from the earlier NT$200 million and NT$300 million, respectively.
Chen maintained his innocence and said he will appeal the case to the Supreme
Court.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the topic:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Chen returned  to the detention  center after hearing the announcement of the
ruling. The chief judge told Chen that the court will issue a written statement
next week informing him of whether he will be granted bail or remain in custody.</P>
      <P>In its indictment, the High Court accused the former first couple of
disappointing  high public expectations  and of a lack of self-examination after
news erupted of their alleged embezzlement of state funds. The couple's
pressuring of subordinates to tamper with evidence made it more difficult for
prosecutors to investigate, thus seriously hurting the image of the judicial
system, it said.</P>
      <P>The sentence of Chen's son, Chen Chih-chung, was also lowered. He received one
year and two months and a fine of NT$30 million, a reduction from two and a half
years and a fine of NT$150 million. Huang Jui-ching, Chen's daughter-in-law, was
given a one-year jail term and a fine of NT$20 million, which was also lighter
than the previous verdict of one year and eight months in jail and a fine of
NT$150 million.</P>
      <P>Sentences for Chen's other 10 former aides and associates were also considerably
lightened, with the exception of Chen Chen-hui, the ex-president's former
bookkeeper, who was given seven months in jail after a "not guilty" ruling in
the first trial.</P>
      <P>Although the three-judge panel did not decide whether the former president
should be kept in custody or set free while being tried on other charges, Chen
and his attorneys believe that he stands a good chance of "regaining freedom."</P>
      <P>Chen promised  to wire back another  NT$570 million  from Switzerland, which he
said was all political contributions from enterprises, in addition to the US$21
million that the court is seeking from his family in exchange for his release on
bail. Chen has remained in detention since Dec. 30, 2008. (June 12, 2010).</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division (SID) under the Supreme Prosecutors Office
said it will decide whether to appeal after receiving the High Court's rulings.</P>
      <P>The High Court lowered the sentences for the former first couple mainly on the
grounds that the amount of the special presidential funds they were charged with
embezzling was only NT$14.96 million. The figure was significantly lower than
the over NT$100 million previously ruled by the Taipei District Court, which
adopted a looser standard in defining Chen's alleged embezzlement. High Court
judges said they believed that Chen had used part of the money for legitimate,
secret diplomatic missions.</P>
      <P>According to the SID, it has received NT$460 million, or 70 percent of the US$21
million Chen's family kept in Swiss bank accounts. Chen's release on bail will
be mainly up to whether the family can remit all the money back to Taiwan,
judges have said.</P>
      <P>In line with regulations, the Supreme Court must close Chen's case within three
months if the High Court decides to keep Chen in custody. If Chen is granted
bail, the Supreme Court must close the case within one year. (June 12, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The question of whether the High Court will release Chen on bail next week has
surfaced as an issue of major public concern.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors asked that Chen be kept in detention, saying that the reason he was
detained has not changed. Despite this, Chen still stands a chance of being set
free, though bail could exceed NT$100 million, law experts said.</P>
      <P>According to the director at the former president's office, an unnamed "friend"
has promised to lend money to help with Chen's possible bail. (June 12, 2010).</P>

      <P>Dozens of reporters packed a new shop at a location famous for serving large
toppings of diced fresh mangoes on shaved ice as the new management conducted a
test run Saturday, ahead of the official opening on June 14.</P>
      <P>"Ice Monster, " which was once introduced in a New York Times article on travel
in Taipei, is under new ownership and now called "Yung Kang 15."</P>
      <P>Greg Kao, the shop's consultant and spokesman, opened the door for the trial run
Saturday. The media frenzy also drew a crowd of curious passersby.</P>
      <P>Kao left a U.S. electronics company in October last year and later joined the
F&amp;B (Food and Beverage) Gourmet Group that now runs the shop. He said he
will not put too much pressure on the employees over sales performance.</P>
      <P>"We will take it slowly on the sales," Kao said. "I don't want my employees to
be too stressed out. They're already nervous enough about getting the shop ready
for the opening on Monday."</P>
      <P>But he also expressed confidence that the new shop will bring Taiwanese and
foreign visitors back to Yongkang Street, which is lined with small places to
eat and buy clothes.</P>
      <P>Kao said the newly formed gourmet group is also investing in other kinds of
Taiwanese food and aims to promote them to foreigners.</P>
      <P>Kao and other store owners in the area want to see the community's business
return to the level it attained before the 15-year-old shaved ice shop
unexpectedly closed in January amid an ownership dispute caused by an alimony
lawsuit involving the original owner and his ex-wife.</P>
      <P>Sales in stores near the shop have dropped by more than 20 percent during the
past five months, according to Lee Ching-long, director-general of the Yung Kang
Commercial and Cultural Promotion Association.</P>
      <P>The reopening of the shop might be good news, particularly to Japanese tourists
who see the shop as a "must visit" place in Taiwan, local tour guides said.</P>
      <P>In recent years, many other stores in Taiwan have cashed in on the increasing
popularity of mango shaved ice and similar products.</P>
      <P>Early on the trial run day, the shop served small cups of mango ice cream to 10
disadvantaged children.</P>
      <P>The shop planned to give free servings to 100 such visitors scheduled to arrive
that day, Lee said.</P>

      <P>The amount of inward investment by Taiwanese businesses in China totaled NT$22.1
billion (US$6.83 million) in the first five months of this year, achieving over
50 percent of this year's target of NT$38 billion, a Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to Ling Chia-yuh, director-general of the Department of Investment
Services under the MOEA, investment from China-based Taiwanese businesses is
expected to exceed NT$40 billion by the end of this year, compared to NT$36.2
billion last year.</P>
      <P>According to Ling, some Taiwanese businessmen in China are considering
increasing their production lines in Taiwan to meet market demand. Ling said
that costs for these businessmen would be lower than the costs of getting
supplies for coastal cities from inland Chinese provinces. He did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>Ling also said that Taiwan-based instant noodle maker Master Kong -- one of the
biggest Taiwanese companies operating in China -- might increase its production
lines in Taiwan after a proposed cross- Taiwan Strait economic cooperation
framework agreement is signed.</P>
      <P>Since the Taiwan-based Foxconn Technology Group decided to sharply increase the
wages of its factory workers in China, several China-based Taiwanese businesses
have expressed interest in moving their investment back to Taiwan, according to
MOEA officials.</P>
      <P>The officials added, however, that they have received a lot of calls asking
about land acquisition, financing, taxation and R&amp;D in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Many Taiwanese businessmen have left Taiwan over the last decade, so they do
not really know about the initiatives offered by the government, " Ling said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lien Ching-chang, deputy director of the Industrial Development
Bureau under the MOEA, said his bureau holds meetings regularly  to discuss  how
to promote  China-based  Taiwanese businessmen's investments in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that due to a lack of space in the country's industrial parks to
accommodate any returning Taiwanese businessmen,  the ministry could help
appropriate land from the state-run Taiwan Sugar Corp., which owns a lot of
land, to provide factory space for such investment projects.</P>

      <P>A 12-year-old  boy who developed encephalitis following influenza A(H1N1)
vaccination last December will be paid NT$250,000 (US$7,730) in compensation,
the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The decision was made a day earlier by the Vaccine Injury Compensation  Program
(VICP)  after "failing to rule out" the connection between the infection and the
vaccine,  CDC Deputy Director-General Lin Ting said.</P>
      <P>The sixth-grader, who received the shot Dec. 8, was hospitalized Dec. 17 after a
headache, convulsions and losing consciousness, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>He was later diagnosed with acute encephalitis, and tests found no indications
of the influenza A(H1N1) virus, the official said.</P>
      <P>VICP experts, however, said the disease could be the result of influenza A(H1N1)
infection or co-infection of the new type of flu with other viruses, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The VICP has received 528 petitions for compensation over alleged side effects
from influenza A(H1N1) vaccination, 236 of which have been concluded, CDC
statistics show.</P>
      <P>Of the concluded cases, two were determined to be related to the vaccine and 29
could not be ruled out as having no connection with the vaccine. The other 205

      <P>Although Taiwan and China hope to sign an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) by the end of June, it is not certain whether the two sides
will arrive at an accord by that time, Premier Wu Den-yih said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"As some issues relating to the 'early harvest list' are stuck in negotiations,
we are not sure whether a breakthrough can be made soon or whether the ECFA can
be inked by the end of this month," Wu said.</P>
      <P>"We want China to offer tariff concessions  for our weak industries to compete
with other ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries in the
Chinese market, but China also has to take care of the interest of its
industries, " the premier explained. "This is exactly where the negotiations are
stuck."</P>
      <P>The premier also reiterated that as a member of the World Trade Organization
(WTO), Taiwan will "certainly" seize the opportunity to sign free trade
agreements (FTAs) with other countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a ranking government official told the Central News Agency Saturday
that Taiwan's signing of FTAs with other countries does not require China's
approval and that cross-Taiwan Strait talks on trade would have no
"international complications."</P>
      <P>"The  question  of whether  cross-strait  negotiations  are internationally
bound is simply a 'non issue,'" the official said.</P>
      <P>The two sides will start a third round of ECFA negotiations in Beijing Sunday to
discuss its text and provisions and the "early harvest list" that will determine
items to be subject to preferential treatment in future cross-strait trade.</P>
      <P>Fan Liqing, spokeswoman for the Taiwan Affairs Office under the Beijing-based
State Council, said earlier Saturday that noticeable progress has been made in
the ECFA negotiations and that more than 500 Taiwanese export items could be put
on the "early harvest list."</P>
      <P>"China has done its best and will accept a high number of the items that Taiwan
put forth on the list," she said.</P>
      <P>"China will benefit much less than Taiwan from the list in terms of the total
valuation of the items or in terms of the market scale," she said.</P>
      <P>"Whether or not the ECFA can be signed by the end of June will depend on both
sides making further efforts," she added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's LED manufacturers expect a bright outlook for revenue by the end of

    <HEADLINE>Former president speaks out against ECFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui spoke out Saturday against a proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) Taiwan hopes to sign with China this
month, saying that the pact should be approved through a referendum.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the ECFA is a one-China market framework agreement and a
political economic arrangement that will jeopardize Taiwan's sovereignty, Lee
said in a forum organized by Taiwan Advocates, a pro-independence think tank
founded by Lee himself in 2001.</P>
      <P>The agreement,  which  aims to reduce  tariffs  and relax cross-Taiwan Strait
trade regulations, is a precursor for the eventual goal of free flow of
personnel,  investment,  goods, technology and services across the strait and
could result in a "second wave of local industries exodus, " Lee claimed.</P>
      <P>As a World Trade Organization (WTO) member, Taiwan has the right to directly
negotiate a free trade agreement (FTA) with China instead of "bypassing the WTO
mechanism for an ECFA with China, " Lee said.</P>
      <P>The danger of signing the ECFA, according to Lee, lies in the implication that
Taiwan is in the same position as Hong Kong and Macau as special administrative
regions of China, both of which have signed similar trade pacts with China.</P>
      <P>Citing the example of Hong Kong, which signed a Closer Economic Partnership
Arrangement with China in 2003, Lee said Hong Kong's economy "plummeted" after
that and that he expects Taiwan to take an even harder hit because, unlike Hong
Kong, most Taiwanese businesses are in the manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the decision of the Referendum Screening Committee to reject a
referendum initiative on the ECFA "was a dereliction of duty and deviated from
the core value of direct democracy."</P>
      <P>The committee rejected an ECFA referendum proposal submitted by the tiny
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) June 3 on the grounds that it was not
in conformity with the Referendum Act. The main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said June 4 that it will launch a "10-year war of
resistance" and continue pushing for a referendum.</P>

      <P>A U.S. Academy Award-winning expert said during a recent visit to Taiwan that in
future, movie actors will be digitized as a matter of efficiency.</P>
      <P>"In the future, probably every actor on a movie will be digitized at the start
of shooting, " Paul Debevec, a computer science professor at the University of
Southern California in Los Angeles, told CNA.</P>
      <P>"That way, if they need to fix something and the actor is no longer available,
they can do it," he said.</P>
      <P>"If one of the actors dies and is not available half-way through the production,
they could create the actor digitally and finish the movie," the professor
added.</P>
      <P>Debevec, who is also an executive producer for graphics research at the
university's Centers for Creative Technologies, received his Oscar in February
for developing the Light Stage technology that helped create realistic digital
faces in films including Avatar, the Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Spider-
Man 2.</P>
      <P>Debevec and his team digitally cloned the actors by putting them inside the
Light Stage device, a hollow black ball equipped with small light emitting diode
(LED) panels controlled by computer.</P>
      <P>In the first 52 minutes of the Benjamin Button film, he said, there were 325
shots of a fully digital Brad Pitt as a bald old man who ages backwards in the
film.</P>
      <P>This digital Brad Pitt looked so real that he fooled not just the audience's
eyes but also those of movie critics, Debevec claimed.</P>
      <P>It is possible that in the future, movies will use digital versions of people
rather than actually hiring real people, because it will be cheaper, he said.</P>
      <P>The Light Stage technology, which has been advancing in recent years to seek
better digital quality, might sound like a big threat to actors, but Debevec
said actors like it.</P>
      <P>"So far, the actors like the technology because it saves them time. They can get
their work done faster," he said.</P>
      <P>Right now, actors have to spend a lot of time waiting for lighting to get set
up, and may have to keep going back to get their makeup fixed.</P>
      <P>Unexpected noise is also a problem while shooting, he added.</P>
      <P>Debevec said there will be "another groundbreaking movie with a photo- real
digital actor" released this year, in which his company was involved, but
declined to elaborate.</P>

      <P>Environmentalists spoke at the opening of a film festival in Taipei Saturday,
saying that people should catch, buy and eat marine resources more
conscientiously or risk having no seafood to enjoy in the near future.</P>
      <P>"We really need to be cautious about the oceans and the marine resources,
otherwise there will be no fish left by 2048," said Jenner Lin, secretary-
general of the Society of Wilderness (SOW), a Taiwan- based non-governmental
organization that promotes nature education and conservation.</P>
      <P>"World Oceans Day Film Festival" will include more than 55 showings of three
documentaries nationwide. The featured films are: "The End of the Line, "
"Sharkwater" and the Oscar-winning "The Cove."</P>
      <P>"The Cove" will show at Tzu Chi University in the eastern county of Hualien on
June 19 and at National Tainan Living Art Center in the southern city of Tainan
on June 26. The festival runs through the end of July.</P>
      <P>During the opening at Eslite Bookstore's Dunnan branch, Lin called on the public
to stop buying seafood that is endangered or captured in a way that damages the
ecosystem. Before buying seafood, people should find out whether it is
sustainable and how it was captured, he said.</P>
      <P>The film festival is part of activities to promote the United Nations' World
Oceans Day, which was on June 8.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday that Taiwan's universities should admit
more students from Southeast Asia and reiterated that the government hopes the
percentage of foreign students enrolled at local universities can be increased
from 1.3 percent to 2.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Addressing a graduation ceremony at Kunshan University in Tainan County, Ma said
that if Taiwanese universities can admit outstanding high school graduates from
Southeast Asia, it would help speed up the globalization  of  local
universities  and  enhance  students' competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Ma also said that the government's policy of helping overseas Chinese students
to study in Taiwan is one of the country's most successful education policies of
the past 60 years.</P>
      <P>It has not only provided more than 100,000 graduates for overseas Chinese
communities in Southeast Asia but has also made the graduates the most loyal
supporters of Taiwan in international society, according to Ma.</P>
      <P>At the ceremony, Ma also presented a lifelong learning award to a 59-year-old

    <HEADLINE>Air carrier hopes to resume flights by autumn</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 12 (CNA)
06/12/10  21:56:27
(By Wang Shu-fen and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) confirmed Saturday that it had
received a plan for a resumption of flights that was submitted by the Far
Eastern Air Transport Corp. (FEAT) , which has suspended all its flights since
May 2008 due to financial troubles.</P>
      <P>In addition to reviewing the flight resumption proposal, the CAA will also
review the company's fleet and examine the certification of related personnel.</P>
      <P>According to FEAT'S plan, it will repair and maintain three aircraft that will
be used on domestic routes between Taipei and the island of Kinmen and Taipei
and the Penghu Islands in late September or early October.</P>
      <P>It also plans to offer cross-Taiwan Strait flights, as well as flights to Japan
and Southeast Asia, on a charter basis, according to the proposal.</P>
      <P>The CAA said it is not sure when the review will be completed, but added that as
long as the company has sufficient funds and the correct certification, the
flight resumption should not take long.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court ruled on the company's reconstruction plan May 31,
which means that FEAT must resume operations in six months -- by November 30 --
or risk having its aviation licence revoked.</P>
      <P>However, the carrier's plan to resume flights became less certain after the
Securities and Futures Investors Protection Center, a group that protects
investors' rights, appealed the court ruling.</P>
      <P>The CAA said that under civil aviation law, the carrier must have a paid-in
capital of at least NT$500 million if it is to operate domestic routes, and NT$2
billion paid-in capital for cross-strait and international routes.</P>
      <P>FEAT was the first privately owned airline in Taiwan and had its heyday as the
major carrier on Taiwan's domestic routes before the Taiwan High Speed Railway
started its north-south services in March 2007.</P>
      <P>Ever-dwindling business and rising fuel prices took a heavy toll on the airline
and it was forced to file for bankruptcy protection.</P>
      <P>Court approval of the bankruptcy protection failed to save the carrier, however,
because it failed to obtain the necessary funds and it suspended all its
flights, with its last service -- between South Korea's Jeju and the Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport -- flying May 16, 2008.</P>
      <P>The carrier has sought to resume flights ever since. Last September, Huafu
Enterprise Group moved in and agreed to pay the salaries of FEAT's staff.
Approximately 230 staff are now preparing for the flight resumption.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A third formal round of negotiations for a cross-Taiwan Strait free trade pact
opened in Beijing Sunday, with both Taiwanese and Chinese negotiators  promising
to sort out differences on a few remaining issues with goodwill and sincerity.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs who arrived in Beijing Saturday as head of the
Taiwan delegation, said at the opening ceremony that both sides already reached
consensus on a number of key points of the proposed economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) in the first two formal rounds of talks and numerous
informal meetings.</P>
      <P>The two sides have come to terms on the text of the accord and the principles
for an "early harvest" list of goods and services to be subject to tariff
waivers or easier market access under the pact, Huang said, adding that both
sides have also largely agreed on appendixes to the "early harvest" program,
such as "place of origin" regulations, definition of service providers and
relief measures for trade disputes.</P>
      <P>"We have laid a good foundation for concluding ECFA talks through concerted
efforts based on the principle of 'finding commonalities despite differences,'"
Huang said, adding that only a few issues need further discussion.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the two sides need to craft an encompassing cooperative framework
for mutual market opening and protection of investment  and intellectual
property rights for upgrading of competitive edge, Huang said he hopes the third
round of ECFA talks will be richly fruitful with both sides displaying
sincerity, flexibility and cooperative spirit.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On the eve of the opening of a third round of talks in Beijing Sunday on a
cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , Wang Yi,
director of the Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) of China's State Council, said he is
sure the accord can be signed by the end of June.</P>
      <P>However, Premier Wu Den-yih said the same day that it remains uncertain whether
the trade deal can be struck late this month as originally expected, because
talks on the "early harvest" lists are still deadlocked over certain items.</P>
      <P>Also Saturday, former President Lee Teng-hui spoke out against the proposed
trade pact, saying the ECFA should not be signed unless it is approved by the
people through a national referendum.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Wang said at a weekend dinner with new directors and supervisors of a nationwide
federation of associations  of Taiwanese-owned companies in China that the ECFA
talks have proceeded very smoothly.</P>
      <P>"I'm rather sure at the moment that the agreement can be signed at the end of
this month, " Wang was quoted as having told Taiwanese business executives at
the dinner.</P>
      <P>He further revealed that petrochemicals, machine tools and textile goods, as
well as auto parts and components, will definitely be included in the "early
harvest" lists for tariff concessions or reductions.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwanese products to benefit from the ECFA tariff waivers will
reach 500, worth an estimated US$13.6 billion, Wang was quoted as disclosing,
adding that the number of items account for about 15 percent of Taiwan's overall
exports to China.</P>
      <P>Asked about his views on Wang's remarks, Vice Economic Affairs Minister Lin
Sheng-chung said China has consistently been more optimistic about the progress
of the ECFA talks, whereas Taiwan has been more reserved.</P>
      <P>"We hope the ECFA can truly be inked in late June under what China calls its
concessionary moves... At any rate, we have not given up our goal of concluding
the deal by the end of this month, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Wu admitted that some items related to the "early harvest"
lists remain stuck in negotiations.</P>
      <P>"We are not sure whether any breakthrough on those issues can be achieved soon,"
Wu said.</P>
      <P>Even if the agreement is not signed late this month, Wu said, the failure should
not be regarded as a "default" on the government's promise, because the so-
called "end of June deadline" is actually just an "expectation" of both sides.
(June 13, 2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>The third round of ECFA talks opened Sunday in Beijing, with financial market
access as the main focus of the negotiations.</P>
      <P>Analysts said the financial supervisory institutions of both sides have reached
a consensus that Taiwanese banks will be allowed to operate Chinese yuan-
denomination deposits and loans two years after they set up branches in China
and post profits at least in either of those years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan originally hoped that its banks will be allowed to operate yuan-
denomination business immediately after they open branches in China.</P>
      <P>Beijing rejected this, but agreed to offer better treatment to Taiwanese banks.
At present, foreign banks must wait for at least three years to operate yuan-
denomination business after they open branches in China. (June 13, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Lee reiterated his view at a seminar organized by the Taiwan Advocates Saturday
that the ECFA should be approved through a referendum.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the deal is a one-China market framework agreement and a
politically motivated economic arrangement that will jeopardize Taiwan's
sovereignty.</P>
      <P>"The agreement is a precursor for the eventual goal of free flow of personnel,
investment, goods, technology and services across the strait and could result in
a "second wave of local industries exodus, " Lee claimed.</P>
      <P>As a World Trade Organization member, Taiwan has the right to directly negotiate
a free trade agreement with China instead of "bypassing the WTO mechanism and
signing an ECFA with China, " Lee said, adding that the danger of signing the
ECFA is the implication that Taiwan is in the same position as Hong Kong and
Macau -- special administrative regions of China -- both of which have signed
similar trade pacts with China. (June 13, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Learn from lessons of Greek crisis</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/13/10  14:07:42
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan could face a financial crisis of Greek proportions if it does not tackle
its mammoth debt but instead schemes to amend a public debt law to cancel
government debt ceilings in an attempt to cover up its huge deficit.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's administration should heed the Greek debt crisis and
take it as a lesson to help it rebuild Taiwan's finances amid global jitters
over government balance sheets.</P>
      <P>Although the European Union and the International Monetary Fund provided Greece
with 110 billion euros in May as emergency aid and resolved to establish the
largest-ever eurozone stabilization fund of 750 billion euros, the world felt a
new shockwave last week after Hungary announced that it has also been caught in
its own debt crisis.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, U.S. and Japanese stocks plummeted over 3 percent last Friday after a
-worse-than-expected U.S. monthly employment situation report was published.
With the eurozone's debt crisis poised to spread to other weaker economies,
there are concerns that the crisis could trigger the second global financial
meltdown since 2008.</P>
      <P>The London-based Economist forecast that it will take at least five years for
the Greek government to smooth out its debt problem. Even by 2014, the Greek
government debts and the nation's GDP will still be at a ratio of 140: 100, far
exceeding the tolerable level by EU standards of national debts, the magazine
forecast.</P>
      <P>The new Hungarian government has accused its predecessor of fabricating
financial statistics that has led the country into a "Greek debt crisis."</P>
      <P>What is more shocking to the world is not only runaway government debts but
governments' schemes to cover up their huge deficits by wrapping up the debts as
financial derivatives  and incorrect statistics to fool the people and
investors.</P>
      <P>Government  debts and runaway government spending will not disappear by
themselves. If the debts are not repaid in this generation, they will become the
debts of the next generation. (June 13, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Blood Service Foundation said Sunday -- World Blood Donor Day -- that
much of the blood donated in Taiwan is unusable because of elevated lipid
levels.</P>
      <P>According to foundation staff Chen Shih-li, the percentage of "fatty blood"
collected by the foundation in the last three years has been on a steady climb
-- from 3.7 percent in 2008 to 4.7 percent the following year, to the current
8.8 percent reported from January to April this year.</P>
      <P>Chen explained that recipients of such blood can end up with clogged arteries,
which can lead to other serious complications.</P>
      <P>At times the foundation is forced to dispose of entire bags of donated blood, he
said, urging donors to adhere to a low-fat diet and to avoid eating prior to
making their donations.</P>
      <P>At a World Blood Donor Day carnival held in Taipei that day, seasoned donor Judy
Wang, 50, said she has donated blood more than 50 times since her first donation
30 years ago when she was a high school student.</P>
      <P>"I make sure I am always in good health because I want to make sure the blood I
donate is usable. If I am going to get pricked by a needle every three months, I
want to be certain that my blood won't get tossed away," she said.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that one of her relatives once had a blood transfusion and said that
strengthened her motivation to keep donating blood, "because you never know who
you will end up helping."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Airport taxi drivers do not expect gains from new air links</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the launch of direct flights between Taipei's Songshan Airport and
Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport slated for Monday are expected to help boost Taipei
City's economy, most taxi drivers operating around Songshan Airport were
reserved Sunday about the benefits the direct flights will bring them.</P>
      <P>The Taipei city government has expressed high expectations that the direct air
links will provide closer connections and create more commercial opportunities
for businesses on both sides.</P>
      <P>However, several taxi drivers working around the Songshan airport said they do
not expect to make much money from the direct flights.</P>
      <P>One complained  that even though direct flights have been operating between
China and Taiwan since July 2008, his business has not received a boost, because
Chinese tourists, who are still not allowed to travel alone, usually do not take
taxis.</P>
      <P>According to another, most Chinese tourists and businessmen are dropped off or
picked up at the airport by relatives and friends or use the Mass Rapid Transit
(MRT) system, adding that only those needing very short rides take taxis.</P>
      <P>Another driver said there are 800 taxis operating around the airport, each of
which gives an average of just four or five rides per day, most of which cost
around NT$100 each. The situation will not change much even after the direct
flights are launched, he predicted.</P>
      <P>However, Chen Ming-chao, chief of an airport taxi association, said additional
air passengers will bring in cash, given that four more direct flights will be
added daily, each of which carries about 180-200 passengers.</P>
      <P>At the same time, some passengers on the MRT's Wenhu line linking Nangang, Neihu
and Songshan, complained that the cars on the line are too small.</P>
      <P>Feng Chi-ying, a Taiwanese businessman operating in China, said that the line
provides convenience but that the cars are too small for his luggage.</P>
      <P>Others expressed concern that the transport capacity of the line might not meet
the needs of the increasing number of passengers between the two airports.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Yi-hsuan, chief executive of a Taipei travel agency in Taipei,
individual travelers are expected to benefit the most from the direct air links.</P>
      <P>Chen said that as Songshan  Airport  is only capable  of accommodating medium-
sized aircraft such as the Boeing 738, which usually has 160 seats, travel
agencies find it difficult to make block bookings for groups.</P>
      <P>At present, Songshan Airport maintains direct air links with seven Chinese
cities and areas -- Pudong, Fuzhou, Nanchang, Wuhan, Changsha, Chongqing and
Chengdu.</P>

      <P>The government should make sure that Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision Industry,
which owns Foxconn Tech Co., meets global labor standards and is not allowed to
operate as a sweatshop, local academics said Sunday.</P>
      <P>In less than a week, more than 180 scholars had signed a petition in response to
a recent wave of suicides by workers employed in China's Shenzhen by Foxconn, a
subsidiary of Hon Hai.</P>
      <P>The scholars said the government should punish Hon Hai by denying benefits such
as tax reduction on its Taiwanese investments.</P>
      <P>They also urged the authorities in both Taiwan and China to use the ongoing
economic cooperation framework agreement negotiations to hammer out ways to
prevent labor exploitation.</P>
      <P>Besides accusing Hon Hai owner Terry Guo of exploiting his workers, the scholars
also accused government officials of covering up Guo's wrongdoings because of
his contributions to Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>"Guo is the shame of Taiwan, " said Huang Te-pei, director of the Graduate
Institute for Social Transformation Studies at Shih Hsin University.</P>
      <P>In the era of globalization, Huang said, capitalists should not simply focus on
where and how to find the cheapest workers but should also take corporate social
responsibility.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the biased value chain and the worldwide practice of "lean
production" are to be blame because under the efficiency-first rule, workers are
subject to unlawful overtime, which he said is the case with Foxconn.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, global brands such as Apple should cut back their low-price
competition policy and distribute profits more fairly to their OEMs, such as Hon
Hai.</P>
      <P>The scholars also said Guo should open Foxconn's Shenzhen complex to public
investigation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Commercial Times: There must be ways to sign FTAs</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/13/10  15:30:30
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese government spokesman said recently that Beijing is strongly opposed to
Taiwan developing official links with other countries in any form.</P>
      <P>The remarks whipped up widespread disenchantment in Taiwan, with some critics
taking it as an outright declaration of opposition to Taiwan's signing free
trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries.</P>
      <P>The remarks even prompted President Ma Ying-jeou to call on Beijing not to
disrupt Taiwan's efforts to sign FTAs with other countries and to say that
Taiwan must take this path because foreign trade is the country's lifeline.</P>
      <P>The backlash caused in Taiwan by Beijing's reaction on the FTA issue might not
disappear any time soon, but fortunately, besides "political" diplomacy, there
is also "economic and trade" diplomacy, which is the track on which FTAs
operate.</P>
      <P>There must be some way for Taiwan to sign FTAs with other countries, based on
the argument that as a member of the World Trade Organization, Taiwan is
eligible to sign FTAs with other countries and on the fact that China has said
it "is not against its diplomatic allies developing economic and trade links
with Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Taiwan is also a full member of several other major global economic
organizations, including the Asian Development Bank and the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should take a pragmatic approach when it comes to FTAs -- taking the
initiative to communicate with China before FTA signing plans mature -- a move
that will not cause Taiwan to be "belittled" as some critics fear.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should be flexible in the designation issue when it comes to FTAs. It
would be wonderful if a country ready to sign an FTA with Taiwan would agree
that Taiwan could sign as "Taiwan, " but if not, Taiwan should be flexible and
should agree to use an alternative title such as "Chinese Taipei" or "Separate
Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu."</P>
      <P>Beijing, as one of the world's major economies, should also demonstrate its
magnanimity on the issue.</P>
      <P>Since FTAs are vital to Taiwan's lifeline and the wellbeing of its people,
Beijing's tolerance of Taiwan's efforts to sign FTAs with other countries would
be tantamount to taking care of Taiwan people's interests, a move that would
facilitate peaceful engagement across the Taiwan Strait. (June 13, 2010)</P>

      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen called on
DPP members and officials Sunday to make greater efforts to achieve victory in
the year-end elections of grassroots officials in five municipality mayoral
races.</P>
      <P>Tsai offered her congratulations to those DPP officials who won the previous
day's elections  of village chiefs and township representatives in 17 cities and
counties around the country, DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said.</P>
      <P>The DPP head also called for greater efforts to ensure DPP victories in borough
chief elections scheduled to take place in tandem with the mayoral races of five
special municipalities slated for Nov. 27, according to Tsai Chi-chang.</P>
      <P>About 600 DPP candidates and DPP-backed independents won seats in Saturday's
polls, almost double the number won by the DPP in the last grassroots elections,
the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>"Saturday's victories reflect voters' approval of the reforms that have been
made by the DPP over the past two years," he said.</P>
      <P>He also relayed the DPP chairwoman's call for party officials to strive harder
to further broaden the party's support base in the hope the party can boost the
number of its seats to over 1,000 after the Nov.  27 elections  for borough
chiefs  in the five special municipalities.</P>

next week after Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin approves the proposal at a city

Sunday.</P>
      <P>The unprecedented measures will first be implemented near the Technology
Building Station of the Mass Rapid Transit system and if all goes smoothly, will
be expanded to bicycles illegally parked around the Gongguan, National Taiwan
University Hospital and Taipei City Hall stations before eventually covering the

      <P>The traffic police division proposed that owners of impounded bikes  should  be
fined NT$300-NT$600,  in line with existing regulations, although the final

    <TEXT>
      <P>A civic group of liberal scholars challenged the Referendum Review Commission
under the Executive Yuan Sunday to a debate about the commission's role and
function.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Society said in a news conference that the commission has exceeded
its authority by rejecting two requests for a referendum on a trade pact the
government hopes will be sealed between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Kun Chung-hwa and Allen Y. Houng, two executive members of the Taipei Society,
said the commission should not have examined the referendum requests based
purely on whether the commission felt they had merit.</P>
      <P>They were referring to the commission's decision Aug. 27, 2009 to reject a
referendum request made by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and
a June 3 decision to reject a request by the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU).</P>
      <P>Hawang Shiow-duan, the chief of the group, said both opponents and proponents of
the trade pact are entitled to request a national referendum on it.
Unfortunately, she went on, the review commission rejected the TSU's referendum
request. She said that rather than protecting the people's right to referendum,
the commission actually restricted the right.</P>
      <P>Noting that the commission rejected the TSU's request on the grounds that the
party's proposal did not match its purpose, that its results would not make any
difference, and that the referendum was therefore unnecessary, Hawang said the
commission's decision raised questions about the necessity of the TSU's
referendum request and the purpose of the referendum system.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the existing Referendum Act is ambiguous on many issues and needs
to be reviewed and improved, Hawang challenged the members of the commission to
debate the restrictions on referendum and the criteria for a proper referendum
proposal.</P>
      <P>"If the members of the commission have scruples about a public debate, a seminar
or a forum with the Taipei Society will be acceptable," she added.</P>
      <P>She said the Taipei Society will publish an open letter to the commission and
extend an invitation to debate to every commission member.</P>
      <P>The DPP's referendum request had earlier been rejected on the grounds that it
was an attempt to misuse the right to referendum by asking whether a referendum
should be held on an issue, as well as being an attempt to hold a referendum on
something that had not yet taken place.</P>
      <P>Both the DPP and TSU oppose the proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement initiated by the ruling Kuomintang administration with the intention
of boosting the economy, out of fear that it will undermine Taiwan's
sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on the pact have shifted into high gear in the last few months, and
both sides intend to wrap up the discussions and sign the pact later this month.</P>

      <P>The number of the first-time applicants for unemployment benefit fell greatly in
May to the same level as before the financial meltdown took place in late 2008,
the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The CLA's Bureau of Labor Insurance said the number of first-time applicants for
the benefit averaged between 5,000 and 7,000 per month before the financial
crisis, and surpassed 10,000 in October 2008 before peaking at 35,000 -- a
historic high -- in February 2009.</P>
      <P>The bureau said that for the whole of 2009, there were 217,000 applicants, who
received a combined NT$20.82 billion (about US$670 million) in unemployment
subsidies -- both the highest figures on record.</P>
      <P>The number of first-time applicants fell to below 10,000 in October 2009, and
dropped further to 6,800 in May this year, according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>The bureau said that the number of first-time applicants is one of the
indicators of the economic climate and that falling figures represent increased
job opportunities following an economic recovery.</P>
      <P>It ruled out the possibility that the number of applicants will go up again when
new university graduates enter the job market in June, as they are not qualified
to apply for unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>Under related regulations, qualified applicants are limited to workers covered
by the labor insurance program for over a year and who lost their jobs through
no fault of their own.</P>
      <P>Approved applicants are entitled to up to nine months of benefit, which is
calculated at 60 percent of their insured salaries.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's  signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China will help its efforts to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, a Thai scholar said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Sompop Manarugsan,  a professor of economics at Thailand's prestigious
Chulalongkorn University, said the ECFA initiative will be mutually beneficial
to both Taiwan and China, since the two sides' economies complement rather than
compete against each other.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which is not a member of the United Nations and has difficulty
maintaining normal relations with the world's major economies due to Beijing's
opposition, should use its engagement with China as a stepping stone to
clinching FTAs with other countries, Sompop told CNA.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Taiwan plays an important role in global investment,
particularly in Southeast Asia, it has difficulty striking any form of economic
or trade pact with ASEAN members because of its unique political situation, he
said.</P>
      <P>The third round of cross-strait ECFA negotiations took place in Beijing that
same day, paving the way for the eventually signing of the deal, hopefully at
the end of June.</P>
      <P>Sompop, who has visited Taiwan many times and is a former director of the China
Studies Center at Chulalongkorn University, also warned that South Korea,
Taiwan's major rival in terms of industrial exports, has already signed an FTA
with ASEAN and that the ASEAN Plus China, Japan and South Korea FTA will take
effect shortly --  developments  that will adversely affect Taiwan's regional
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>He said that once the ECFA is signed, some labor-intensive, low-end industries
and agricultural sectors in Taiwan might suffer a negative impact, but predicted
that Taiwan should be able to skirt the overall adversity as it is a high-
technology powerhouse.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should work to upgrade its industrial structure, including wage levels
and the workforce, he continued.</P>
      <P>"You win some and lose some. The ECFA will be worth signing if Taiwan finds the
pact brings more benefits than losses," he added.</P>

      <P>Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the Taiwanese  parent company  of the world's
leading electronics manufacturer Foxconn, asked the public Sunday to give the
company more time to improve its employee management system after a recent spate
of suicides at one of its factories in China.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai spokesman Edmund Ding issued the call after several academics urged the
electronics giant in a press conference earlier that day to stop exploiting its
workers and to safeguard their human rights.</P>
      <P>Following the string of suicides, Hon Hai owner and Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou
led a media tour of the company's industrial park in Shenzhen in late May and
promised to set up mental counseling and take other measures to prevent more
deaths.</P>
      <P>Foxconn has raised pay levels for its workers in China from 900 yuan (US$130)
per month to 1,200 yuan and is to raise them further to 2,000 yuan. The company
employs 400,000 people in Shenzhen alone.</P>
      <P>Labor activists have accused the company of having a too-rigid management style
and of forcing staff to work overtime, and have put Foxconn under great pressure
to improve conditions in its Chinese factories.</P>
      <P>However, Louis Woo, a Foxconn executive, attributed part of the suicide problem
to the high number of employees aged between 18 and 24 -- the prime age for
suicides in China.</P>

      <P>A direct selling company dealing in health care and personal care products based

      <P>"Joymain Sci-Tech Development Co., one of the largest direct marketing
enterprises in China's biotech sector, is scheduled to open its Taiwan branch
June 17, " said Ivan Lin, vice president of China Travel Service (Taiwan).</P>
      <P>In connection with the opening of the office in Taipei, Joymain Chairman Wang
Youshan will head nearly 1,000 of the company's outstanding sales staff on a
five-day incentive trip to Taiwan that will start June 14, Lin said.</P>
      <P>"The Joymain salespeople from all over China are scheduled to arrive in Taipei
Monday in several groups, " said Lin, whose company helped arrange the incentive
tour.</P>
      <P>The visitors will be given a welcoming reception upon their arrival and on the
eve of their departure, Wang will preside over an opening ceremony for the
Taiwan branch, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Unlike similar tours of Taiwan offered by other Chinese direct marketing
companies in the past, which invariably focused on visiting popular tourist
destinations and enjoying local food, the Joymain tour will highlight
environmentally friendly themes, Lin said.</P>
      <P>On June 15, the group will participate in a sports competition at the Flying Cow
Leisure Farm in northern Taiwan's Miaoli County and on June 17, they will go on
a cycle tour along the banks of the Danshui River in Bali Township on the
outskirts of Taipei, as well as visit the Shihsanheng Museum of Archaeology in
the same neighborhood.</P>
      <P>"We hope these activities will help expand Chinese tourist itineraries. The
introduction of lesser-known destinations will help the Chinese visitors
understand that Taiwan's tourist attractions are not limited to just a few
landmarks such as Alishan and Sun Moon Lake," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Classifying the Joymain staff as a high-end tour group, Lin said they will stay
at four-star or five-star hotels and will also tour other "must-see" sightseeing

      <P>It is more difficult to get a teaching job in public elementary schools in
Taipei City than it is to find work as a flight attendant for China Airlines
(CAL), an on-line employment agency said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Citing the fact that 6,588 people have registered to apply for just 64 teaching
vacancies in Taipei City's public elementary schools this year, the 1111 Job
Bank said that only 0.97 percent of the contestants will land a job, much less
than the 1.15 percent success rate for flight attendant jobs with CAL, which are
generally considered more desirable.</P>
      <P>Ho Chi-sheng,  a job bank official,  ascribed  the fierce competition to the
1995 Teacher Training Act, which allowed 16 universities to open elementary
school teacher training programs.</P>
      <P>However, the country's declining birth rates have cut deeply into student
numbers around the country, leading to a drop in the number of teachers needed
by schools, Ho said.</P>
      <P>The solution, said Ho, would be to set up a mechanism to retire poorly
performing teachers and to reduce the number of pupils per class.</P>
      <P>He warned prospective teachers that their teaching credentials are no longer
guarantees of finding teaching jobs in schools, they should ask themselves
whether they are really enthusiastic about teaching, a career Ho described as
"boring."</P>
      <P>According to a press release issued by the Taipei city government that same day,
among the 6,588 people who applied for a teaching post, only 6,289 showed up for
that day's writing test.</P>
      <P>Those who pass that test will have to sit a second test July 4 that will include
another writing test, a teaching demonstration and an interview.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu said Monday that she had urged the La New Bears
baseball team to keep its home stadium at the Chengcing Lake Baseball Field in
Kaohsiung County's Niaosong Township.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening of a baseball championship in the southern port city,
Chen said that several days ago she visited Liu Pao-you, owner of the La New
Bears, to urge him to keep his team in Kaohsiung and to promise more help to
solve the team's problems.</P>
      <P>The mayor said that Liu complained to her about the poor box office returns at
the Chengcing Lake field despite the team's six-year run in Kaohsiung County,
and said the problems worsened even more after a recent game-rigging scandal
involving many of the players in the Chinese Professional  Baseball League that
has effectively killed much of the interest remaining among former fans.</P>
      <P>Chen said the city government  is trying to revive local enthusiasm  for the
sport and has earmarked  NT$11.8  million (US$36,479) to promote the sport in
elementary schools throughout the city.</P>
      <P>Former Minister of the Interior Yu Cheng-hsien, who also gave a speech at the
opening of the championship, said moving the La New Bears would deal a hard blow
to baseball in southern Taiwan, and said the Kaohsiung city and county
governments should work together to keep the team from leaving.</P>
      <P>It was earlier reported that La New Bears, which has seen attendances dip to
only about 2,000 per game at its home stadium, will move to Chingpu Baseball
Stadium in Taoyuan County, which boasts the country's highest attendance figures
of about 8,000 people per game.</P>
      <P>The reports said Liu has been disappointed that he has been unable to muster
local support for his team and that people in the area have remained
indifferent, despite La New Bears having made Kaohsiung County its home for six
years.</P>
      <P>La New Bears is one of four teams in the Chinese Professional Baseball League,
which was on the brink of collapse in February when 24 players from the league
were indicted in the game-throwing scandal.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) across the Taiwan
Strait is now seen as a done deal, as both sides have reached consensus on the
text of the accord, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Each side's "early harvest" lists of goods and services to be subject to tariff
waivers or easier market access terms under the agreement will be incorporated
as appendices to the ECFA after being further verified by the two sides, the
quasi-official intermediary body announced in a press statement.</P>
      <P>The SEF announcement came after the Taiwanese and Chinese chief negotiators --
Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade under Taiwan's
Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Tang Wei, director of the Department of
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs under China's Ministry of Commerce -- said
in Beijing earlier in the day that expert-level ECFA negotiations had been
completed.</P>
      <P>According to the SEF statement, the ECFA text is composed of five chapters --
preface, general principles, trade and investment, economic cooperation, early
harvest lists and other affairs -- that comprise a total of 16 articles
regulating  nearly all major cross-strait economic activities.</P>
      <P>The trade and investment chapter outlines principles and items requiring further
negotiation in terms of bilateral merchandise trade, service trade and
investment, the SEF statement said.</P>
      <P>On economic cooperation, the text requires the two sides to cooperate on
intellectual property rights protection, financial services cooperation, trade
facilitation, and industrial cooperation.</P>
      <P>The chapter on the "early harvest" program lays down regulations on tariff
waivers for merchandise trade and preferential market access terms for service
industries.</P>
      <P>Detailed lists of products and services to benefit from the "early harvest"
program will be included in the ECFA as appendices, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Huang and Tang confirmed that China will offer tariff exemptions or reductions
on about 500 items of merchandise from Taiwan under the agreement, while only
around 200-plus Chinese products will enjoy similar tariff concessions upon
entering the Taiwanese market.</P>
      <P>Other clauses stipulate relief measures for trade disputes, as well as
procedures for the agreement to take effect or be terminated.</P>
      <P>The agreement also comprises documentation of "place of origin" regulations for
"early harvest" list products, as well as on the definition of service providers
with regard to services included in the "early harvest" roster.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese and Chinese working-level officials began their third formal round of
ECFA talks earlier that day.</P>
      <P>According to consensus reached at the meeting, the two sides agreed to begin
offering tariff exemptions or reductions on "early harvest" list products and
easier market access terms for "early harvest" list services within a certain
period after ECFA takes effect.</P>
      <P>Now that both sides have come to terms on the text of the agreement, the deal
should be able to be formally sealed by the end of June as originally expected,
observers said.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president
of the Association for Relations across the Taiwan Strait, are scheduled to hold
a fifth meeting in the first half of this year during which ECFA is expected to
be formally sealed.</P>

    <DATELINE>06/14/10  10:52:38
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new model patterned after the Taiwan-U.S. Trade and Investment Framework
Agreement (TIFA) will be introduced in negotiations across the Taiwan Strait,
Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan confirmed in an interview
Sunday.</P>
      <P>In the just-concluded third round of talks on the cross-strait economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), the two sides agreed to form a cross-
strait economic cooperation commission to take charge of follow-up consultations
and coordination on bilateral trade, investment and economic issues, according
to Lai.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, major progress was made in Sunday's working-level ECFA talks in
Beijing, with basic consensus reached on the text of the agreement and its five
appendices.</P>
      <P>On the contentious "early harvest" program that forms the backbone of the
agreement, China agreed to offer tariff waivers or easier market access terms
for 500 Taiwanese products and services, whereas Taiwan promised to allow
similar privileges for 200-plus Chinese goods and services.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the new commission to be assembled after the ECFA signing will
be a cross-strait version of the TIFA-style engagement between Taiwan and the
United States that was formed in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>The commission will comprise representatives from both sides, and its main tasks
will be consultation, supervision and evaluation of ECFA-related affairs, Lai
said.</P>
      <P>"The commission will be responsible for negotiating ECFA-related issues,
overseeing and evaluating ECFA enforcement,  resolving disputes about the
definition of ECFA clauses and dealing with relevant relief measures," Lai said.</P>
      <P>If necessary, the commission will be able to appoint special task forces to
address specific issues related to the agreement, Lai said. It will meet once
every six months but will have the option of holding provisional meetings at any
time with the consent of both sides, she said.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the new commission will allow for refinement of the content
of the ECFA and help to realize  its goals progressively, Lai added. (June 14,
2010).</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>In Sunday's ECFA talks, Taiwan failed to get items such as automobiles, key
petrochemical materials, or machine tools on the early harvest list of goods
that would qualify for tariff exemptions or reductions under the ECFA.</P>
      <P>This is why the two sides did not unveil the detailed "early harvest" list at
the end of the meeting.</P>
      <P>While the number of Taiwan products on the early harvest list was increased from
300 to 500, the Chinese side also added another 100-plus items to its list of
100 through hard-nosed negotiations.</P>
      <P>The China products that will qualify for concessionary tariffs upon entry to
Taiwan are mostly textiles,  petrochemicals and machinery items.</P>
      <P>In the area of service trade, China agreed to offer better terms to Taiwanese
banks setting up branches or establishing footholds in the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Negotiators from both sides agreed Sunday that a fourth round of formal ECFA
talks may take place simultaneously with the preparatory talks for the fifth
Chiang-Chen meeting at which the ECFA will be formally signed.</P>
      <P>They also reached a tacit agreement that the ECFA should be concluded by the end
of June or in early July so that it can take effect at the beginning of next
year.</P>
      <P>The Chiang-Chen meeting refers to engagements  between top cross-strait
negotiators -- Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his
Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president of the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits. (June 14, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>After the completion of the working-level ECFA negotiations, opponents of the
agreement said Sunday they will launch a decade-long campaign against the pact
as they are worried that it would "lock Taiwan into China's embrace, " making
Taiwan more and more dependent on the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>In the first step of their long-term campaign, the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, the Taiwan Solidarity Union and other pro-independence groups
said they will step up preparations for a massive street protest on June 26.

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Why 'New Township' projects have not succeeded</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/14/10  11:22:24
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan announced in May that the Danshui mass rapid transit (MRT)
line will be extended to Danhai New Township in Taipei County as part of efforts
to revive the new township project that was launched 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>The new township project, which is seen as a solution to Taiwan's problem of
urban overcrowding, is failing because of people's reluctance to migrate to
those areas. Not a single local government in the country has succeeded in
establishing a new township.</P>
      <P>The reasons for their failure in this regard include poorly planned development
projects, inadequate financial preparations and rigid budgeting by the relevant
authorities.</P>
      <P>Now, despite the government's promise to improve the public transportation
service, it is unlikely to revive the dying Danhai community if it cannot
resolve other major problems such as the lack of educational, medical, cultural
and entertainment facilities.</P>
      <P>After studying new township development projects in other cities abroad, such as
Tama City in Tokyo, Tsuen Wan in Hong Kong and La Defense in Paris, we found
that the key to success lies in a coordinated approach to providing all the
necessary services.</P>
      <P>It would be difficult to revive the Danhai New Township project if the
government cannot come up with a more comprehensive plan than improving
transportation to the area. (June 14, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of 12 businessmen and officials from major cities around Taiwan, led by
the president of Taiwan's Giant bicycle company, began a cycling tour of the
Netherlands Monday.</P>
      <P>On the six-day trip, dubbed "Green World on Wheels, " the group will ride a
500-kilometer route to look at the cycling infrastructure of the Netherlands,
which is known as a "cycling paradise."</P>
      <P>The riders will also study ways in which Taiwan can improve its cycling
environment, said King Liu, 76, who is president of Giant Manufacturing and
chairman of the Giant Global group, the world's largest bicycle manufacturer.</P>
      <P>The group is scheduled to cycle 95-100 kilometers per day to see for themselves
how and why 27 percent of all travel in the Netherlands is done by bicycle.</P>
      <P>Fifty other Taiwanese expatriates in the Netherlands have also joined the
cycling tour, said Frank R.H. Liu, Taiwan's representative to the Netherlands.</P>
      <P>He welcomed the group from Taiwan, saying that under King Liu's leadership, the
cyclists will help the Dutch people to learn more about Taiwan's efforts to save
energy and cut carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>"Riding Giant bicycles is the best way to promote Taiwan-made products," the
diplomat said.</P>
      <P>He quoted Menno Goedhart, representative of the Netherlands Trade and Investment
Office in Taiwan, as having said that because the Giant brand is the most
popular in the Netherlands, many Dutch people mistakenly think that it is a
Dutch product.</P>
      <P>Local authorities in many Dutch cities, including Almere and Amstelveen, have
promised to help facilitate the tour when the group enters their cities, the
representative said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Liberty Times: Opportunity for Taiwan amid labor movement in China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/14/10  12:50:17
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>This is the time for Taiwan to stop its economic reliance on China, amid a
budding labor movement there that was prompted in part by Taiwan's Foxconn
Technology Group's offer of a 120 percent wage increase to its China factory
workers.</P>
      <P>If the labor movement continues to grow, it could result in public outcry over a
widening gap between rich and poor. Beijing has adopted a capitalist approach to
the development of its economy although it is essentially a socialist system.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the convenience of communication via the Internet and mobile phones,
exploited Chinese workers are no longer isolated. Once the fire of a labor
movement is lit, it will spread fast.</P>
      <P>Although  China has promised  to double the wages of its blue-collar workers, it
is now in a sticky situation. On one hand, it risks angering its workers with
too small a wage increase, and on the other, its competitiveness on the global
market could drop if wages become too high for the companies operating there.</P>
      <P>We believe that now, when China's global competitiveness is about to weaken, is
the best opportunity for Taiwan to rise again. It is time for the Ma Ying-jeou
government to abandon its China-tilting policy and work out efficient measures
to attract overseas Taiwanese businesses and foreign investors to Taiwan. (June

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: Opportunities, challenges in the Golden Circle</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/14/10  12:56:15
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The inauguration of direct flights between Taipei's Songshan Airport and
Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport on Monday has laid the basis for the formation of a
golden flight circle that will also include Tokyo's Haneda Airport and Seoul's
Kimpo Airport.</P>
      <P>The golden flight circle is expected to be completed by next year when the
Republic of China will celebrate its 100th anniversary. By then, Songshan
Airport's role as one of the world's top commercial airports will be cemented.</P>
      <P>The new flight routes will also upgrade Taipei's status as an East Asian
commercial hub, and the resulting business opportunities and economic momentum
will benefit all of Taiwan, not just Taipei and its environs.</P>
      <P>Such  advantages,  however,  will  not materialize  if the accompanying
challenges cannot be overcome.</P>
      <P>First of all, Songshan Airport's hardware and software facilities must live up
to the standards of a top-notch commercial airport. The government has budgeted
NT$1 billion for a three-phase renovation project that we hope can be completed
in the shortest possible time.</P>
      <P>Second,  the government should negotiate with China for a substantial increase
in the number of Songshan-Hongqiao flights to meet the enormous market demand,
as there is a large cluster of Taiwanese business people in Shanghai and its
nearby regions who frequently travel across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Third, innovative ways should be worked to ensure that Songshan Airport
complements Taoyuan International Airport to produce a multiplying effect rather
than divert passengers away from Taoyuan Airport.</P>
      <P>Fourth, special efforts should be made to prevent further imbalance between the
development of southern and northern Taiwan as a result of the quicker flying
time of 90 minutes between Shanghai and Taipei, which is the same as the time it
takes to travel between Taipei and Kaohsiung on the high-speed rail. (June 14,

    <HEADLINE>Demand for office space in Taipei set to rise: analysts</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The expansion of air links across the Taiwan Strait is expected to boost demand
for commercial properties in Taipei, particularly as direct flight services have
now been launched between Taipei's Songshan Airport and Shanghai's Hongqiao
Airport, analysts said Monday.</P>
      <P>The direct flight services, which started Monday, and are expected to save at
least two hours in travel time between the airports that are located in the
downtown areas of the two cities.</P>
      <P>"Flying time between Taipei and Shanghai has been shortened and Taiwanese
businessmen can now make one-day trips between the two cities," said Jeffrey
Huang, head of research at Yung Ching Realty.</P>
      <P>"The expansion of cross-strait air links is expected to boost demand for
Taipei's commercial properties," he said. "I expect office space rental in the
city to grow by about 10 percent by the end of this year."</P>
      <P>Huang said Taiwan and China are close to signing an economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) that is expected to encourage Chinese enterprises to
set up headquarters in Taipei, especially now that air travel between the two
sides is less time consuming.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, foreign companies that want to use Taiwan as a springboard
to China will be more encouraged to establish a foothold in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"I expect more growth in the rental of office space in Taipei in 2011," Huang
said.</P>
      <P>Howie Wang, head of research at Jones Lang LaSalle Taiwan agreed, saying that
there is "good potential" for growth in office space rental in Taipei.</P>
      <P>According to a Jones Lang LaSalle research paper, there was a 0.16 decline in
the rental of Grade A office space in Taipei in the first quarter of this year
compared to the fourth quarter of last year.</P>
      <P>The slight drop came with the beginning of Taiwan's economic recovery, it said.</P>
      <P>"The decline could be halted on an increase in cross strait economic exchanges,
" Wang said. "We will see growth by the end of this year or next year... as
demand increases."</P>
      <P>In the first quarter of this year, the vacancy rate of Grade A offices in Taipei
stood at 15 percent, down 1.13 percentage points from the fourth quarter of last
year, according to Jones Lang LaSalle.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that democracy has taken root in Taiwan
because it has been practiced without break over the past six decades.</P>
      <P>Ma told a group of visitors from the United States that he has heard it said
democratization is not suitable for oriental people, particularly Chinese, but
what he has seen in Taiwan over the past several decades has destroyed that
prejudiced view.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's democracy may be young, even immature, but we have made the first step
forward, which may be a positive answer to those who may be concerned, " Ma told
the U.S. group that was led by Nicholas Dirks, vice president and dean of the
faculty of arts and sciences at Columbia University.</P>
      <P>The president said he is glad to see more and more top-notch U.S. universities
paying closer attention to Taiwan's development.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is indeed worthy of study by academics at home and abroad, given the huge
and drastic changes in the society over the last six decades -- changes that had
been seldom seen in the preceding 400 years, he said.</P>
      <P>Over the last 60 years, he said, people in Taiwan have developed a unique and
diverse Chinese culture, which can be attributed to the fact that they were
allowed to fully use their wisdom and talent in a free, open and democratic
environment.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's achievement serves as a significant example for people across the
Taiwan Strait as well all ethnic Chinese around the world," Ma said.</P>
      <P>In the months ahead, the president said, cross-strait relations, which have been
focus of attention over the past two years, will continue to improve. In
addition, many cultural activities will be held in the lead up to Jan 1. 2011
when the Republic of China on Taiwan will celebrate its 100th founding
anniversary, he said.</P>
      <P>Dirks and his group are in Taiwan for an academic symposium, titled "Taiwan in
the 21st Century: Politics, Economy and Society, " sponsored by Columbia
University's Weatherhead East Asian Institute.</P>

      <P>Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-bin said he is excited to see the bright future of
direct flights between Taipei Songshan Airport and Shanghai Hongqiao Airport
before boarding the first direct Taipei-Shanghai flight at 8:45 a.m. on Monday
morning.</P>
      <P>"I feel like a bird ready to come out of the cage," he said.</P>
      <P>Scheduled to arrive at Hongqiao Airport at 10:30 a.m., Hau's team will be
greeted by Shanghai Vice Mayor Shen Jun as part of the launching of a Taipei
Culture Celebration campaign in the city.</P>
      <P>Hau said the next step for Taipei is to make air connections with other Asian
cities like Tokyo and Seoul. He said Taipei will benefit culturally and
economically from such convenient routes.</P>
      <P>According to China Airlines (CAL) , it will provide six direct flights a week.
The company will use Boeing 737-800 carriers, each with a capacity of 158
passengers.</P>
      <P>CAL said that once Songshan Airport finishes reconstruction this October, it
will use Air Bus 330-300 carriers instead.</P>
      <P>Bruce Huang, a 27-year-old information technology worker, said direct cross-
strait flights save him a lot of time.</P>
      <P>"Before, my colleagues had to first stop at Hong Kong and then transfer to
Pudong, " he said. "The travel time that used to take all morning has been
reduced to about one hour."</P>
      <P>Two other Taiwan-based carriers, TransAsia Airways and EVA Airways, provided
direct flight services Monday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, China Eastern Airlines was the only Chinese carrier operating the

    <DATELINE>06/14/10  14:39:32
(CommonWealth 446) (translated by Kay Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Banking is expected to be the first in Taiwan's service sector to benefit once
Taiwan and China sign an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , but
the industry is walking a fine line between rushing into a new market and
remaining competitive.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese banks are pulling out all the stops to begin operations in China. On
April 19 -- the first day Taiwan's regulator began accepting applications -- six
banks applied to set up branches in China by upgrading their existing
representative offices. They mainly chose the Yangtze River Delta, where most
Taiwanese businesses gather.</P>
      <P>Setting up a branch, a subsidiary or investing in local banks are three
approaches Taiwanese banks use in the China market, and each demonstrates a
different strategy. Opening a branch means the bank will focus on Taiwanese
customers in China, while the latter two mean the bank will build on a local
customer base.</P>
      <P>Experts on banking in China said banks taking the branch approach should focus
on making profits for two consecutive years so they can apply for a license to
use the Chinese yuan, and should work with other banks to expand service regions
and share costs.</P>
      <P>Taking another route, Chinatrust Financial applied to set up a subsidiary so it
can begin operating in both Chinese yuan and foreign exchange from the
beginning. It plans to invest NT$3.2 billion (US$99 million) in China, the most
among Taiwanese banks.</P>
      <P>Fubon Financial invested in Xiamen Bank in southeastern China and targets local
communities and small and medium-sized businesses. Fubon expects to invest in
more banks in other regions to expand. Both Fubon and Chinatrust focus on retail
banking such as credit cards, small loans and wealth management.</P>
      <P>While trying to get ahead in China, Taiwanese banks also see warning signs.
Chinese regulators have been requiring detailed descriptions of operation
procedures as China is interested in learning from Taiwanese banks, especially
about how to control credit card risk.</P>
      <P>What the Taiwanese banking industry will face is the same as the manufacturing
industry has experienced in China:  how to stay competitive after the Chinese
learn from Taiwanese businesses. That will require the banks to evolve and find
their niche.</P>

    <DATELINE>06/14/10  14:58:56
(Global Views Monthly 287)(translated by Kay Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With its orange, "cool and fun"-themed space decorated with cartoon figures, the
sales center of Taiwanese car manufacturer Yulon Motors' latest brand "tobe"
seems an unlikely place to sell the first "Chinese cars" in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"M'car" (pronounced "my car") , the first model of Yulon's "tobe" brand,  is the
carmaker's  version of Chinese  partner  Geely Automobile's Panda, which
received its name because of its white body and black grill and headlight
frames.</P>
      <P>Yulon said that the adapted cars are built in Taiwan with equipment such as
satellite navigation and six airbags -- rare for an entry-level car selling at
NT$365,000 (US$11,300) -- and that 60 percent of the car's interior and
equipment is not the same as Geely's model.</P>
      <P>With local bloggers' review videos and a cartoon-themed marketing campaign
fronted by Amber Kuo, a Taiwanese pop singer, Yulon is targeting young female
customers unfamiliar with the car market. Geely is interested in using the
approach to attract young buyers in China.</P>
      <P>Yulon downplays the car's China background by focusing directly on consumers.
The only major press event was the "tobe" brand's launch at the Taipei
International Auto Show at the end of 2009.</P>
      <P>While the world's fastest-growing car manufacturer, South Korea, hasn't gained
much market share in Taiwan, Yulon is hoping that after a yearlong preparation,
"M'car" can be a successful beginning for its cooperation with the Chinese
automaker.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 1.20 percent Monday on high hopes that Taiwan and
China will soon sign an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) after
the two sides reached a consensus on the text of the accord over the weekend,
dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 87.91 points to 7,387.40 after moving between 7,347.23
and 7,393.41, with turnover of NT$68.52 billion (US$2.11 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened 1.01 percent higher, in line with other regional markets
boosted by Wall Street's gains at the end of last week, and the momentum
accelerated as investors turned upbeat about Taiwan's potential economic outlook
after Taiwan and China sign the ECFA, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,801 stocks closed up and 1,036 down, with 358 unchanged.</P>
      <P>The textile, plastics and chemical, and financial sectors posted the highest
gains, up 2.1 percent each. The paper and pulp sector closed up 1.9 percent and
the cement sector 0.9 percent higher.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector rose 0.8 percent, while the foodstuff and
construction sectors added 0.7 percent each.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China wrapped up a negotiation session on the ECFA Sunday, including
part of an "early harvest" list for tariff waivers for merchandise and easier
market access for the service sector.</P>
      <P>"The negotiations seem to have proceeded smoothly, prompting investors to leave
behind earlier concerns that the agreement would not be signed in the middle of
this year as scheduled, " Hua Nan Securities Vice President Henry Miao said.</P>
      <P>Both the plastics and chemical and the textile sectors attracted large buying as
investors anticipate the sectors will be included in the "early harvest" list,
Miao said.</P>
      <P>Nan Ya Plastics added 3.05 percent to NT$54.00 and Formosa Plastics gained 2.31
percent to NT$66.40.</P>
      <P>Shinkong Textile closed up 6.98 percent at NT$34.50 and rival Far Eastern New
Century rose 2.99 percent to NT$34.50.</P>
      <P>"However, I do not expect the local bourse will have much upside room ahead of
the nearest technical resistance of 7,500 points unless Wall Street continues to
make significant gains," Miao said.</P>
      <P>"In addition, concerns over the debt problems in Europe remain in place, " he
said. "So, it won't be easy for the market to overcome the technical hurdles
anytime soon."</P>
      <P>He said that as the market moves closer to 7,500 points, it will be a good
chance for investors to pocket profit. "Be cautious and don't chase prices at
the moment," Miao advised.</P>
      <P>Among financial stocks that were lifted largely by bargain hunting, Cathay
Financial rose 2.53 percent to NT$46.65 and Fubon Financial gained 2.66 percent
to NT$36.70.</P>

      <P>Although zongzi are traditionally one of the treats associated with the annual
Dragon Boat Festival in Taiwan, office workers prefer not to receive them as
holiday gifts, according to an online job bank survey Monday.</P>
      <P>Zongzi is a boiled or steamed wrap of glutinous rice and various fillings that
is most often eaten by ethic Chinese around the time of the Dragon Boat
Festival.</P>
      <P>But according to 54 percent of the office workers polled by the 104 Job Bank,
zongzi is at the bottom of the list of gifts they would prefer to receive during
the festival.</P>
      <P>What they want most is cash or gift coupons for department stores or
supermarkets, 76 percent of the respondents said.</P>
      <P>Others said they would prefer office banquets, one-day tours or movie tickets,
in that order.</P>
      <P>Thirty-five percent of the respondents said their least favorite gifts are
soaps, shower gels, and detergents gift sets, while 31 percent said pineapple
cakes, egg rolls, and sausage or bacon gift boxes.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 57 percent of office workers will be given cash or other
gifts by their companies for Dragon Boat Festival, which falls on June 16 this
year.</P>
      <P>Office workers will receive an cash or other gifts averaging NT$3,119 each,
compared to NT$2.964 last year, the poll found.</P>
      <P>Over half of the office workers -- 54 percent -- said they would deposit the
money in their bank accounts, while others said they would buy themselves
presents, treat family members or lovers to a feast, or treat themselves.</P>
      <P>According to 88 percent of office workers, their feelings about their companies
would be affected by whether or not they are given gifts for Dragon Boat
Festival.</P>
      <P>Some 10 percent of the respondents said that they would prefer not to work for
companies that do not offer gifts for the three major festivals -- Chinese New
Year, Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival.</P>
      <P>In an analysis of the poll, Fang Kuang-wei, PR manager of the 104 Job Bank,
said Taiwan's  office workers are "practical"  and unconventional."</P>
      <P>"Because they are practical in that they want to save their cash gifts or would
prefer to receive coupons that are equivalent to cash," Fang said, adding that
"they are also unconventional, that's why they don't want to be given zongzi or
gift sets."</P>

      <P>Direct flights between the city airports of Taipei and Shanghai began Monday,
with Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin taking the maiden flight out of Taiwan's capital
city and attending a ceremony in Shanghai to mark the occasion.</P>
      <P>Hau left Taipei Songshan Airport at 8:45 a.m. on a China Airlines (CAL) flight
that arrived at Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport at 10: 30 a.m. He was greeted there
by Shanghai Vice Mayor Shen Jun.</P>
      <P>At the ceremony at the Shanghai airport, Hau said the opening of direct flights
was of historic significance because it will make traveling between the two
cities easier and will be conducive to engagements between the people and
businesses on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The flight time between Songshan and Hongqiao airports is about 90 minutes, the
same as between the cities' international gateways -- Taoyuan International
Airport and Pudong International Airport.</P>
      <P>But because the airports on the newly opened route are much closer to the cities
they serve, travelers will save an hour each way in travel time on the ground,
enabling Taipei and Shanghai residents to complete a round trip between the two
cities in a single day, Hau said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei mayor also invited Shanghai residents  to take advantage of the air
links to attend the Taipei International Flora Exposition, which is scheduled to
open on Nov. 6.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih confirmed Monday that he has asked the Ministry of Interior
(MOI) to consider the possibility of lowering the threshold for referendums.</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times daily reported ---- that the premier in a recent meeting had
asked the ministry to map out ways to "prevent someone from using the referendum
initiatives  to hobble the government" by amending the referendum law.</P>
      <P>Wu confirmed Monday that he did ask the Interior Ministry to thoroughly examine
the law to see whether the criteria for holding referendums could be loosened
rather than tightened, after the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) complained that
the current law sets too high a threshold.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet's Referendum Review Commission on June 3 rejected a TSU-initiated
referendum proposal on the planned cross- strait economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) on grounds the proposal did not match its purpose, that its
results would not make any difference, and that the referendum was therefore
unnecessary.</P>
      <P>The question in the TSU referendum initiative asked: "Do you agree that the
government should sign an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China?"</P>
      <P>Under the Referendum Law, a national referendum proposal could be put forward
with the endorsement of 0.5 percent of the eligible voters in the last
presidential election. It then requires the endorsement of 5 percent of the
electorate for it to be put to the vote.</P>
      <P>For a referendum to be passed, it has to be supported by 50 percent of valid
ballots cast in a poll that shows at least a 50 percent turnout rate.</P>

      <P>One of Taiwan's carriers dismissed accusations  by the Consumers' Foundation
Monday that it was overcharging for flights between the city airports of Taipei
and Shanghai, saying the fares had been scrutinized by Taiwan's aviation
regulator.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for China Airlines, which flew the first flight from Taipei Songshan
Airport to Shanghai Hongqiao Airport on Monday, told the Central News Agency
that airlines could not dictate fares because they were set only after careful
negotiations with the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA).</P>
      <P>The carrier stressed that the fares charged for nonstop flights between the city
airports -- roughly NT$14,000-NT$17,000 -- were similar to those between the
more commonly used international gateways of Taoyuan International Airport and
Pudong International Airport.</P>
      <P>China Airlines also noted that to celebrate the new route, it has launched
promotions offering 10 percent discounts on tickets used by the end of June.</P>
      <P>Consumers' Foundation Chairman Hsieh Tien-jen said earlier Monday that round
trip fares for direct flights should be no higher than NT$10,000, and he urged
the CAA to cancel the operating rights of carriers that kept their fares
excessively high.</P>
      <P>Spicer Lee, a spokesman for the Taipei Association of Travel Agents, said,
however, that ticket prices for nonstop flights were not likely to fall by the
end of this year because there is still a shortage of capacity between Taiwan
and China.</P>
      <P>"Besides, we have to take the Shanghai Expo into consideration, " he said.</P>
      <P>There are currently 370 nonstop flights between the two countries every week,
but Lee said at least 700 per week are needed to meet demand, a target he did
not think would be met by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Still, Lee believed that the current fares "are a little bit too expensive."</P>
      <P>Bruce Huang, a 27-year-old information technology worker who took Monday's first
flight to Hongqiao Airport, said he was satisfied with the price he paid.</P>
      <P>The NT$17,000 round-trip ticket he bought one week ago for Monday's flight was
"quite fair" in his opinion.</P>
      <P>"Before, my colleagues had to first stop in Hong Kong and then transfer to
Pudong, " he said before boarding the flight. "The travel time that used to take
all morning can be reduced to about one hour as it is today."</P>

      <P>A suicide hotline prevented 143 people from</P>
      <P>killing themselves last year, the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) said
at a press conference Monday.</P>
      <P>The suicide counseling service hotline, jointly run by the DOH and the Lifeline
Association, Taipei, received 61,284 calls in 2009, the department said.</P>
      <P>Of those callers, 143 said they had already begun taking action to commit
suicide, but all of them changed their minds or were prevented from killing
themselves after talking to counselors over the toll-free, round-the-clock
helpline at 0800-788-995, said Chiang Wen-hsien, director of the Lifeline
Association, Taipei.</P>
      <P>Of the 143, 78 were male and 61 were female, Chiang said. Councilors were unable
to identify the gender of four of the callers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, of the 61,284 people who called, 49.9 percent were female, 41 percent
were males and the gender of 9.1 percent was unclear.</P>
      <P>About one-third, or 33.4 percent, of the callers were in the 30-39 age group,
followed by people 40-49 (26.5 percent) and callers in the 20-29 age group (21.6
percent), the association said.</P>
      <P>Counselors said that the reasons given for calling varied, ranging from people
who were suffering from a mental disorder (32.5 percent); relationship problems
(19.7 percent); family problems (12.2 percent); depression (8.2 percent); and
financial difficulties (6.2 percent).</P>
      <P>Chiang said there was a case in Taipei City of a father who sedated his young
son, brought the child into his running car at an underground parking lot in the
Wenshan District, and tried to kill both of them by using a hose to direct the
exhaust back into the car.</P>
      <P>The man dialed the helpline to say his "will, " Chiang said. A counselor managed
to receive his name and location, and police rushed to the scene in time to save
them both.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang Tsung-hsi, deputy director of the DOH's Food and Drug
Administration, called for the Taiwan media to refrain from using misleading
headlines when reporting suicide cases.</P>
      <P>Headlines like "Parents bring their children with them in a suicide attempt"
would cause sympathy, and could even lead to imitation, Wang said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that for similar cases, the media should use headlines like
"Parents kill children before committing suicide" to better reflect the truth.</P>
      <P>The hotline was formally established in January 2009.</P>

      <P>Taiwan needs more venture capital in the biotechnology industry to catch up with
nearby countries, an expert said at a symposium in Taipei on Monday.</P>
      <P>"We used to be ahead of South Korea, but now their production value is six times
greater than Taiwan's, " said Academia Sinica President Wong Chi-huey, accusing
the government of not providing a suitable environment.</P>
      <P>Wong said that compared  with the manufacturing  industry, biotechnology carries
greater investment risks with results that may not be seen in the short-term.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that as an environmental protection industry, biotech is
worth investing in because of its high profit margin -- 60 percent of production
value.</P>
      <P>Wong said the worldwide production value of biotechnology was growing rapidly,
with at least a third of the value in Asia. If Taiwan could seize 5 percent of
the total, it would have a production value of about NT$6 trillion (US$186
billion) , compared with only NT$218 billion in 2009.</P>
      <P>Legislator  Lai Shyh-bao said that Taiwan's government  is determined to develop
the biotech industry,  citing government statistics that said it injected more
than NT$ 110 billion into the sector between 2000 and 2008 -- more than 20
percent of the national science and technology budget.</P>
      <P>Upstream and downstream firms, however, have not adjusted to the acceleration of
the industry, Lai said.</P>
      <P>Lai suggested that the government set up a biotech park as soon as possible to
attract more private investment,  and to form cross-strait biotech collaborative
groups to take advantage of China's quickly growing market and economy.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) has launched a nationwide investigation in a
bid to measure local governments' manpower and finances in terms of stray dog
handling, a council official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin Tsung-yi, chief of the Animal Protection Section under the COA's Department
of Animal Industry, said introducing professional and government-hired animal
control officers (ACOs) has always been a goal. The council, however, still
needs to evaluate the available manpower, budget and vehicles in each of the 25
local governments before taking the next step.</P>
      <P>It will take six more months for the section to complete a fact-finding survey
before making any suggestion to the Legislative Yuan for an amendment to the
Animal Protection Law requiring government ACOs in all 25 local governments, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>"The section could come up with an assessment plan and a proposal in this regard
at the end of this year at the earliest," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan (EAST) joined legislators from
across political lines at a press conference June 9 on the issue, where they
said that the government needs to hire professional ACOs to ensure stray animals
are not injured or abused during capture.</P>
      <P>They urged local governments to immediately end the use of untrained sanitation
workers or private individuals as dog catchers, adding that most of them use
brutal and inhumane methods to capture the animals.</P>

      <P>Taipei Veterans General Hospital opened a dedicated cancer screening center on
Monday that will offer a "one-stop" service to test for the disease, a move in
line with the government's campaign to encourage more people to take the tests.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health's Bureau of Health Promotion has campaigned  to
increase  routine  cancer screening  in Taiwan, subsidizing hospitals to
simplify the cancer test process for patients. That is the goal of Taipei
Veterans General's new unit.</P>
      <P>Chiu Hsiao-hui, a head nurse with the hospital's new Cancer Screening and
Resources Integration Center, said patients interested in screening for more
than one type of cancer can visit the center to complete the tests in a single
visit, instead of having to make appointments with different departments.</P>
      <P>The center has doctors, dietitians, social workers and medical assistants to
provide full-scale consultations on the disease, aside from conducting the
tests, Chiu added.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony Monday to open the center, Bureau of Health Promotion
Director-General Chiou Shu-ti said the government has actively promoted cancer
screening, in part by offering free tests for certain types of the disease.</P>
      <P>She said people of a certain age or those considered to be at high risk can
receive free tests for cervical cancer, breast cancer, oral cancer and
colorectal cancer at hospitals contracted by the Bureau of National Health
Insurance, including Taipei Veterans General.</P>

      <P>Grammy award-winning violinist Joshua Bell arrived in Taipei Monday afternoon
for what he described as the highlight of his current tour.</P>
      <P>The 43-year-old violinist will share the stage with the Academy of St. Martin in
the Fields chamber orchestra to present a repertoire including pieces by
Beethoven and Mendelssohn at the National Concert Hall on June 15.</P>
      <P>He revealed that in the middle of Mendelssohn's "Violin Concerto in E minor, Op.
64" he would add his own composition with a unique cadenza.</P>
      <P>Bell said he will play as a violinist as well as a conductor during the concert,
but when conducting Beethoven's "Symphony No. 7 in A major, " he will not stand
on the platform or use the baton. The chemistry between him and the orchestra
allows them to play without it, he said.</P>
      <P>With a lot of passion for conducting, Bell said that he hopes someday to conduct
and record Beethoven's entire repertoire.</P>
      <P>He also revealed another passion. While Bell and the orchestra were in Singapore
over the weekend for the first stop of their Asian tour, they stayed up at a
hotel bar until after 4: 00 a.m. Sunday morning watching England play the U.S.
in the FIFA World Cup.</P>
      <P>But while he enjoys watching soccer, Bell prefers something more common among
his compatriots.</P>
      <P>"I am totally fanatic about American football, but I have to wait until

      <P>Shares of airlines and hotels posted strong gains Monday on optimism over future
profitability after the opening of nonstop flight services between Taipei
Songshan Airport and Shanghai Hongqiao Airport, dealers said.</P>
      <P>EVA Airways closed up 4.55 percent at NT$18.40 (US$0.57) with 41.38 million
shares changing hands, while China Airlines closed 2.01 percent higher at
NT$15.20 on trading volume of 54.40 million shares.</P>
      <P>Landis Taipei Hotel Co. gained 4.29 percent to NT$29.20 and First Hotel Co.
added 3.45 percent to NT$25.50.</P>
      <P>The services that were launched between the two airports Monday are expected to
cut the time it takes to reach the cities' downtown areas from the airports by
an hour each way.</P>
      <P>"The new route that will mean shorter travel times is welcomed by
businesspeople, " Grand Cathay Securities analyst Mars Hsu said. "Compared with
group tourists, fares and hotel rates set for business travelers are higher."</P>
      <P>Hsu said the market has turned upbeat about the fundamentals of the two carriers
and has reached a consensus that strong demand across the Taiwan Strait will
help them reverse the losses they suffered last year.</P>
      <P>He said China Airlines is expected to post NT$1.7-1.8 in earnings per share
(EPS) for 2010, compared with NT$1.04 in loss per share recorded in 2009.</P>
      <P>EVA Air, he added, is expected to post NT$1.7 in EPS, a turnaround from a loss
of NT$1.14 per share last year.</P>
      <P>"The relatively low valuations have made the two stocks very attractive," Hsu
said.</P>
      <P>The two hotel companies that rose sharply Monday -- Landis Taipei and First
Hotel -- benefited from their geographic proximity to Songshan Airport, Hsu
said.</P>
      <P>"While they are medium-sized hotels, the geographic advantage is expected  to
help them secure  deals to accommodate  business travelers," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, EVA Airways President Cheng Kuang-yuan said Monday in the company's
annual general meeting that EVA Air flights to major Chinese cities, such as
Shanghai and Beijing, have been full on rising demand from business travelers.</P>
      <P>Cheng said flights to second tier Chinese cities, such as Dalian and Qingdao,
are 50-60 percent booked, while flights to Chongqing are even 70 percent full.</P>
      <P>Apart from rising cross-strait demand, Cheng said, his company has also been
helped by a global economic recovery, with its load factor hitting 81-82
percent.</P>
      <P>Cheng predicted that EVA Air will see demand for passenger and cargo flights
continue to grow on the economic rebound at home and abroad, at least until

      <P>Chances remain high that a cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) will be signed late this month as originally expected, Premier
Wu Den-yih said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Otherwise, the agreement can be signed in early July, " Wu said in an interview
with electronic media after negotiators from Taiwan and China concluded a third
round of ECFA talks in Beijing the previous day.</P>
      <P>During Sunday's meeting, the two sides came to terms on the text of the
agreement and exchanged the "early harvest" lists for the first time.</P>
      <P>On reports that China has agreed to offer tariff exemptions or reductions on 500
products from Taiwan under the ECFA's "early harvest" program, Wu said the
number of items is not that important.</P>
      <P>"What really matters is whether the product is one of our main export items," he
noted.</P>
      <P>The items contained in Taiwan's "early harvest" list account for about 15
percent of its total annual exports to China, Wu said.</P>
      <P>More items may be included under the "early harvest" program in future talks
after the pact takes effect.</P>
      <P>"Six months after the signing of ECFA, the two sides will meet to review the
'early harvest' program. Those items that weren't included this time still have
the opportunity to be listed in the future, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that "early harvest" list negotiations have been stuck on certain items
from the beginning, Wu said that if contentious issues can be resolved in the
coming days, the ECFA would still likely be signed in late June.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, China demanded that Taiwan open its market to or offer tariff
reductions on 200 industrial items.</P>
      <P>"We may agree to 100 of them or the number may fall between 100 and 200," he
said, with the items Taiwan will agree to being those in which Taiwan has a
competitive edge.</P>
      <P>"We will definitely not open the market to Chinese products that may threaten
the survival of local manufacturers," Wu said.</P>
      <P>On specific items, Wu said, China has made it clear in the early stage of ECFA
talks that it is not likely to offer tariff concessions for finished cars from
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"They promised that they will consider such a request when the local content
rate of finished cars from Taiwan is further raised, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>For its part, Wu said, Taiwan has insisted on the inclusion of auto parts and
components on the "early harvest" list, a request that China reportedly has
accepted.</P>
      <P>Touching on the petrochemical industry, Wu said Taiwan has been lobbying hard
for inclusion of eight key petrochemical items, but negotiations in this area
remain deadlocked.</P>
      <P>China may consider accepting some of them, but the chances that it will accept
all of them is slim, the premier said.</P>
      <P>Similar scenarios were also seen in talks regarding digitally controlled machine
tools and some other machinery items, he added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Research Institute (TRI) Monday raised its forecast for Taiwan's 2010
gross domestic product (GDP) growth to 5.88 percent from the previous estimate
of 4.45 percent on robust export growth as well as increases in private
investment and consumption.</P>
      <P>The TRI said that on the back of strong global demand, Taiwan's exports are
expected to grow 17 percent in 2010, with imports expected to grow 20 percent.</P>
      <P>"We expect Taiwan's trade surplus for 2010 to hit US$30 billion. The year of
2010 is a good year for Taiwan's external trade, " TRI President Wu Tsai-yi said
at a forum in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In May, Taiwan posted a record high export figure of US$25.54 billion, up 57.9
percent from a year earlier as shipments of high-tech products soared on strong
global demand.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the robust exports have prompted the private sector to invest,
adding that private investment in 2010 is expected to grow 17.37 percent to
reverse an over 18 percent decline recorded last year.</P>
      <P>He said the expected signing of the economic  cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China and government measures to encourage private sector expansion
are also expected to lead Taiwan out of a private investment contraction.</P>
      <P>With consumer confidence on the rise, private consumption is expected to rise
1.37 percent, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu said his institute also expected the jobless rate for 2010 to fall to 5.2
percent from the 5.85 percent recorded a year earlier.</P>
      <P>While Premier Wu Den-yih vowed to bring down the unemployment rate to below 5
percent, Wu said it would not be easy.</P>
      <P>"We are positive about the government's efforts to improve the job market so
far, but the 5.2 percent forecast is more pragmatic, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>In May, the government raised its 2010 GDP forecast from 4.72 percent to 6.14
percent after Taiwan posted 13.27 percent economic growth for the first quarter,
which was the highest since the third quarter of 1978.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Academia Sinica scholar Hu Sheng-cheng warned that labor pay hikes in
China could push up the prices of Chinese goods, raising the prices of goods
Taiwan imports from there and leading to inflation.</P>
      <P>"Pay raises given by companies, such as Hon Hai and Honda will, of course, help
spur prices of Chinese products to increase, " Hu said.</P>
      <P>He was referring to the Taiwan-based world's largest electronic component
contract maker and Japan's second largest automakers, respectively.</P>
      <P>"As Taiwan imports many Chinese goods, we need to pay close attention to whether
Taiwan's inflation will therefore rise, " Hu said.</P>
      <P>Hu added that China should be on guard against its own inflation as China's
consumer price index (CPI) , an indicator of inflation, rose 3.1 percent in May
from a year earlier, which is higher than the official target of 3 percent.</P>

      <P>Taitung County Magistrate Justin Huang was in Hong Kong Monday to promote
tourism in his county and expressed his hope that more people from the former
British colony visit Taitung via nonstop flights in the near future.</P>
      <P>Regular flights between Taitung and Hong Kong should be launched in July and
tourist arrivals from Hong Kong should double by that time, Huang said at a
promotional event in the Chinese special administrative region.</P>
      <P>Mandarin  Airlines launched nonstop charter flights between Taitung and Hong
Kong in May, cutting flying time to only 90 minutes, and one to two regular
flights per week are expected to begin next month, expanding tourism and
economic exchanges, the county chief said.</P>
      <P>Huang told his audience that in contrast to the fast pace of life in Hong Kong,
Taitung offers a wonderful and quiet atmosphere in a rural environment that
allows visitors to slow down their pace and enjoy a leisurely stay.</P>
      <P>At the event, the Taitung delegation presented some custard apples from the
county for representatives of several Hong Kong travel agencies to have a taste.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong people made 720,000 visits to Taiwan in 2009, according to government

      <P>A top official with the ruling Kuomintang urged the public Monday to rationally
examine the pros and cons of the cross-strait trade pact rather than resorting
to rhetorical criticism or other emotional reactions.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung was responding to a plan by the opposition
camp, led by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , to conduct a long-term
protest against the cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA).</P>
      <P>The ECFA is expected to be signed soon after Taiwanese and Chinese negotiators
in Beijing the previous day reached consensus on almost all of the key issues of
the pact, including the "early harvest" lists.</P>
      <P>Included in the lists -- a roster of products drawn up by each side to be
subject to tariff waivers and easier access to each other's markets -- are 500
Taiwan products and more than 200 Chinese goods.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said it's the responsibility of the government to
tell the public details of the pact, especially the early harvest lists.</P>
      <P>"We have reasons to worry that China has yielded concessions to benefit Taiwan
(as claimed by the government) to the extent that no one can rule out the
possibility of an unrevealed plot by China, "Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The DPP has refused to attend a legislative meeting Tuesday in which Mainland
Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan will deliver a report on the latest
progress in the ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>King dismissed as "rhetorical criticism" remarks that China might be "setting a
trap by giving Taiwan benefits."</P>
      <P>King said that after the early harvest lists are made public, everyone can
examine the advantages and disadvantages of the pact to the country through open
discussions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PVC, PP, machine tools fail to make early harvest list with China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) , polypropylene (PP), and machine tools failed to make
the "early harvest" list of a proposed trade pact between Taiwan and China,
leaving Taiwan short of its target of items to receive preferential tariff
treatment under the deal.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had hoped to include products with an annual export value to China of
US$13.6 billion on the early harvest list of an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>But the 500 items reportedly included on the list after the conclusion of the
third round of ECFA negotiations in Beijing on Sunday fall short of the goal
because of the exclusion of the three important export items.</P>
      <P>A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Monday that the
government will try to add PVC, PP, and machine tools to the list to achieve the
goal, most likely in last minute talks before finalizing the agreement instead
of in a fourth round of bilateral negotiations.</P>
      <P>The content of the early harvest list has been closely guarded throughout the
negotiations, but some details emerged after Sunday's talks.</P>
      <P>Vehicles were another item excluded from the list, which local media described
as "surprising." But officials said Taiwan did not insist on including vehicles
from the early stages of the talks as few locally made cars are made entirely
with domestic parts, aside from Yulon's Luxgen brand.</P>
      <P>Local businessmen, however, were disappointed with the exclusion of PVC, PP and
machine tools.</P>
      <P>As a leading global producer of PP, Taiwan is worried that it could be put at a
disadvantage in China's market as Beijing has already agreed to import PP duty
free from Singapore under its trade pact with the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>Government sources said Beijing didn't agree to put PP on the list because
Taiwan's PP is more competitive than that of Singapore and would pose a greater
threat to China's domestic PP producers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's machine tools were another globally competitive sector excluded from
the early harvest list. Instead, China agreed to include  the  categories
"industrial  machinery"  and "machine components".</P>
      <P>Different from the low-end machine tools made in China, Taiwan's machine tools
do not compete head on with Chinese products, but China still balked at giving
Taiwan's machine tools preferential tariff treatment to protect domestic
producers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, several leading local machine tool producers said they will continue
to hope for the best before the agreement is finalized but will prepare for the
worst.</P>
      <P>Enid Tsai, president of Taichung-based Hiwin Technologies, said she was
surprised by the exclusion of machine tools but is not pessimistic about the
sector's prospects as local machine tool producers can diversify their markets
to cushion the impact.</P>
      <P>"Whether our products make the early harvest list or not, we have to improve our
technologies to compete with our counterparts in South Korea and Japan anyway,"
Tsai said.</P>
      <P>"We would risk our own survival if we rely too much on our easy access to the
Chinese market for growth but overlook the necessity of improving our
technology."</P>
      <P>Because China has not yet concluded a free trade pact with either South Korea or
Japan, one executive of another local machine tool producer said the exclusion
of machine tools from the early harvest list was regrettable but not lethal to
the sector.</P>
      <P>Another executive, with Hsinchu-based Awea Mechtronic Co., a maker of C-frame
vertical milling machines and other CNC machining centers,  said China's refusal
to give Taiwan's machine tools preferential tariff treatment was understandable,
as Taiwan's machine tools are superior to those made in China and constitute a
threat.</P>
      <P>"Tariff-free status would help us grab a greater share of the Chinese market,
but we will not relax out efforts to develop the world market with or without
the preferential treatment in China, " the executive said.</P>

      <P>The tourism association of Zhejiang Province signed an agreement with the
Tourism Association  of Kaohsiung City Monday, promising to send 180,000
tourists to the southern Taiwan port city before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The agreement was signed by Chen Yan, chief of the Zhejiang Tourism Association
and Tseng Fu-hsing, chief of the Kaohsiung tourism association during a tourism
promotion event staged jointly by the two organizations in Kaohsiung Monday.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, Chen promised to make the port city a must-see for the
180,000 tourists that will visit Taiwan from his province before the end of this
year.</P>
      <P>Tseng said his association has sealed similar agreements with tourism
associations in the Chinese provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu and Fujian, with each
of them offering to send 100,000 tourists to Kaohsiung within 2010.</P>
      <P>"This will be a shot in the arm to tourism in Kaohsiung City." he said.</P>
      <P>The numbers, however, are only a small fraction of the increasing number of
Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan, which is expected to grow from 600,000 last
year to 1.2 million this year, Tseng said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China will meet in October to discuss whether to increase the number
of direct flights between Taipei Songshan Airport and Shanghai Hongqiao
International Airport, a civil aviation official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The new flight route was launched on Monday, with three Taiwanese carriers and
one Chinese airline flying one round-trip each between the two cities.</P>
      <P>All of the flights were fully booked, and Taiwanese airline executives called
for doubling the number of flights they are allowed to operate on the route to
28 per week from the current 14.</P>
      <P>According to an agreement reached in May, Taiwanese and Chinese carriers can
operate a total of 28 flights per week now, with the two sides evenly sharing
the total.</P>
      <P>Responding to the appeal,  Civil Aeronautics Administration Director-General Lee
Lung-wen said the issue will be discussed when civil aviation officials from the
two sides meet in October.</P>
      <P>Because Songshan Airport is still undergoing a three-phase renovation, it can
only accommodate 12 international flights a day at most at present, with the
number expected to increase to 18 in October and 24 next year.</P>
      <P>Lee could not say how many more flights will be opened on the Taipei Songshan-
Shanghai Hongqiao route.</P>
      <P>"We will observe the Songshan-Hongqiao flight situation for one month, " Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Also influencing future flight numbers is that nonstop flights between Songshan
Airport and Tokyo's Haneda Airport will be launched Oct. 31, and nonstop flights
between Songshan Airport and Seoul's Kimpo Airport may also be opened in the
near future.</P>
      <P>Three Taiwanese carriers are allowed to jointly operate 14 weekly flights on the
Songshan-Hongqiao route, with China Airlines (CAL) and EVA Airways operating six
each and TransAsia Airways operating two.</P>
      <P>Songshan Airport can only accommodate smaller single aisle aircraft at present,
but when Songshan's first-phase facelift project is completed in October, it
will be able to handle Airbus A330 and other double-aisle aircraft.</P>
      <P>At that point, CAL and EVA said, they will use the larger aircraft to fly from
the Taipei city airport to the city airports in Shanghai and Tokyo.</P>

      <P>Former Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao's brush with death in March was due to a
rare complication from blood transfusions during heart bypass surgery,  an
official of the Department of Health (DOH) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Shih Chung-liang, director of the DOH's Bureau of Medical Affairs, was referring
to Liao's transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), often triggered by the
donor's antibody fighting the recipient's antigen or vice versa.</P>
      <P>Liao only escaped death after fighting for his life in an intensive care ward
for 25 days.</P>
      <P>Shih said the condition is more likely to strike women who have received blood
transfusions many times.</P>
      <P>"The chances of patients suffering from TRALI due to blood transfusions is
minimal, " he said, but acknowledged that such complications still cannot be
avoided.</P>
      <P>At present, he said, blood transfusions only screen blood types. More detailed
screening is not conducted unless patients are frequent blood transfusion
recipients.</P>
      <P>Reports said that Liao, who was known for cracking down on organized crime
during his tenure as justice minister from 1996-1998, received cardiovascular
bypass surgery on March 8.</P>
      <P>The surgery was successful, but the blood transfusion "almost killed me, "
reports quoted Liao as saying.</P>
      <P>Liao has since become an advocate of blood transfusion safety, urging that the
blood should be more closely screened or controlled.</P>

      <P>A former top economic planner suggested Monday  that the government  should
direct idle capital  into "substantive" investments or real estate outside
Taipei to keep "hot money" out of the property market and curb soaring housing
prices.</P>
      <P>High housing prices have been listed as one of top 10 sources of complaints
among citizens of Taipei City, and former Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng said that to address the problem, the
government should prevent the illegal inflow of capital into the property
market.</P>
      <P>At a forum on the economic outlook for Taiwan and other major countries in the
second half of 2010, Hu said Taiwan is facing a sharp rise in the cross-border
inflow of hot money, mainly from foreign investors and overseas Taiwanese
businessmen.</P>
      <P>The "hot money" -- foreign capital entering the country in search of short-term
profits -- usually first makes its way into the stock market, Hu said, and then
after profit-taking is reinvested in the real estate market.</P>
      <P>He said that a rise in housing prices is only being seen in certain parts of
Taipei City, such as the Xinyi and Daan districts, and that housing bubbles have
occurred in some parts of the city in the first quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>Because the housing bubbles are occurring in only some parts of the country, the
government cannot use monetary measures to rein in the property market, Hu
added.</P>
      <P>Instead, it should take steps to improve the environment and public transport
infrastructure in regions outside Taipei City so as to create demand for housing
there and help direct excess liquidity into substantive investments.</P>

      <P>The effects of an "early harvest" list included in a trade pact being negotiated

      <P>Negotiators from the two sides completed a third formal round of talks on an
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) in Beijing on Sunday, with a
consensus reached on the "early harvest" list of products.</P>
      <P>The list of items, which will be eligible for tariff exemptions or given market
access,  was the most difficult part of the negotiations for the two sides, said
Fu Ming-tsai, a financial analyst at Standard Chartered Bank (Taiwan) Limited.</P>
      <P>Fu predicted that the finalization of the "early harvest" will be conducive to
Taiwan's establishment of bilateral or multilateral trade agreements with other
countries and regions.</P>
      <P>The economic  and trade effects of tariff exemptions  and concessions will
become gradually apparent over the next one to two years after the proposed ECFA
is signed late this month or in early July as expected, Fu predicted.</P>
      <P>He also expected that the trade accord would help beef up confidence in sectors
included in the early harvest list and that Taiwan's employment situation would

picture after it signed the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement with China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- ECFA effect: Volkswagen to set up plant here?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/15/10  11:35:17
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih revealed on CtiTV Monday that a senior executive of
Volkswagen, the world's largest automaker, met with him last week for a second
time on the company's plans to set up a plant in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the automaker's investment plan is indicative of the positive
effect of a proposed cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) , which will bring tariff reductions or exemptions to some
Taiwan-made exports to China.</P>
      <P>Unlike domestic ECFA opponents, Wu said, many business people from Japan, the
United States, Europe and even Taiwanese businessmen operating in China look
forward to an early striking of the ECFA deal.</P>
      <P>The ECFA benefits, coupled with the reduction of the corporate income tax rate
to 17 percent under the Industrial Innovation Act, have lifted Taiwan's
competitiveness to a world-class level, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Industry sources said the company mentioned by Wu is assessing the feasibility
of launching an investment project in Taiwan and that its consultations with the
government are entering a final stage but have yet to come to a conclusion.</P>
      <P>According to data available in the industry, Germany's Volkswagen replaced
Japan's Toyota as the world's No. 1 automaker last year after it acquired
Porsche Co.</P>
      <P>Wu disclosed Monday that representatives from the company will tour a local
industrial park next week to further gauge the feasibility of establishing an
assembly plant for vehicle modules in Taiwan for sale to the U.S. and Southeast
Asian countries.</P>
      <P>The premier said the company's executive has told him that made-in-Taiwan
products are more attractive than made-in-China ones.</P>
      <P>In addition to manufacturing prowess and management expertise, Wu said Taiwan's
democratic system and rule of law are also its strengths in attracting foreign
investors. Once the ECFA is signed, Taiwan's competitiveness will be further
enhanced, he added. (June 15, 2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Industrial Development Bureau Director-General Woody Duh will accompany
Volkswagen  executives  to tour the Changhua Coastal Industrial Park in central
Taiwan next week to study whether to set up a new auto assembly plant there.</P>
      <P>Swire Group reportedly has invited Volkswagen to launch a joint venture in
Taiwan to produce compact cars for sale to China, as assembled cars are likely
to be included in ECFA's "early harvest" list in the future.</P>
      <P>Volkswagen has asked Volkswagen China Co., a Shanghai-based Germany-China joint
venture auto company,  to study the Swire Group-proposed Taiwan investment plan,
a company manager said.</P>
      <P>The group will take into consideration the market situation in Taiwan, China and
Southeast Asia in deciding whether to set up a production base in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We will not just focus on the ECFA tariff benefit in deciding the fate of the
new investment project. The key lies in whether a division of labor can be
created between the Taiwan plant and those in Southeast Asian nations," the
Volkswagen China Co. official said.</P>
      <P>According to his estimate, the Taiwan plant should be able to churn out at least
100,000 cars a year to reach a scale of economy, a capacity that requires a
capital infusion of NT$3 billion to NT$5 billion. (June 15, 2010).</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Swire Group, Volkswagen's Taiwan sales agent, declined to make any comments on
the report about Volkswagen's investment plant.</P>
      <P>As assembled cars will not be included in the "early harvest" list for tariff
exemptions, it deserves close observation whether the German automaker will
change its mind.</P>
      <P>An IDB official said Volkswagen's German headquarters will send executives to
tour the Changhua industrial park next week. If the company approves the
investment project, the construction of its Taiwan plant will get underway late
this year.</P>
      <P>Duh said the IDB will assist the company in launching its investment project in
Taiwan and will ask it to procure as many Taiwan-made auto parts and components
as possible. Once assembled cars are included in the "early harvest" list in the
future, its cars will be qualified for tariff exemption privileges, he added.</P>
      <P>Industrial sources said that while the assembly plant may only require a capital
investment of NT$1 billion, it could create positive momentum for the country by
signaling foreign investors' confidence in Taiwan's economic prospects with
improvements in cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Volkswagen's potential Taiwan facility would be
targeted at both the Southeast Asia and South Asia markets, where 4 million to 5
million cars are sold a year. (June 15, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's anti-human trafficking efforts recognized</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 14 (CNA)
06/15/10  11:51:41
(By Zep Hu, Jenny W. Hsu and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has regained its status as a country working to eliminate human
trafficking after being downgraded for the previous five years, according to the
U.S. State Department's latest Trafficking in Persons (TIPS) Report released
Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was listed as a "tier 1" country in the TIPS report -- meaning it fully
complies with the minimum standards of the U.S. Trafficking and Violence
Protection Act -- for the first time since 2004.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Taiwanese authorities took various corrective measures
to fight the problem last year, including banning for-profit marriage brokerage
firms and implementing the Human Trafficking Prevention and Control Act, which
took effect in June 2009.</P>
      <P>Those efforts helped Taiwan regain the top tier rating -- along with countries
such as the U.S. and Canada -- after it fell to "tier 2" in 2005 and then
dropped another notch to the "tier 2 watch list" in 2006.</P>
      <P>Taiwan regained "tier 2" status in 2007 and remained there until this year's
annual review.</P>
      <P>The report specifically lauded the government's efforts to identify and protect
trafficking victims, saying that 329 victims were placed in shelters in 2009, up
from 65 the previous year.</P>
      <P>The National Immigration Agency (NIA) in collaboration with local
nongovernmental organizations also opened up two new shelters where victims can
receive counseling services as well as job training.</P>
      <P>Victims who found employment further away from the shelters are permitted to
live off-campus, the report said.</P>
      <P>As of 2009, there were a total of 19 shelters established across the country.</P>
      <P>Luis CdeBaca, ambassador-at-large with the Office to Monitor and Combat
Trafficking in Persons, noted that shelters in Taiwan are different from those
in many countries around the world, where the facilities look more like a
detention center where the victims are just there "being warehoused."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has recognized that, has studied it, and has actually acted to make sure
that these people are not just put in jail after they get liberated," CdeBaca
said.</P>
      <P>The Human Trafficking Prevention and Control Act also helped to boost Taiwan's
ranking. Combined with portions of the Criminal Code, the act criminalizes
trafficking for both commercial sex exploitation and forced labor and mandates
sentences of up to seven years in jail for violators.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the act allows victims to apply for continued residency and a work
permit, the report noted</P>
      <P>"It (the law) allows for victims to work, to be able to stay in Taiwan, to get
jobs with other employers, and to work while their cases are being
investigated," CdeBaca said.</P>
      <P>The report also said that in 2009,  over 4,500 Taiwanese officials, academics,
civic groups, and first responders received anti-trafficking training.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's 2010 anti-trafficking action plan has called for an interagency task
force comprised of authorities, NGOs, and academics to meet every month to
coordinate anti-trafficking efforts.</P>
      <P>The government has also earmarked NT$1.6 million to fund a public awareness
campaign on the issue.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Taiwan remains a destination, rather than a source or
transit territory for victims of human trafficking.</P>
      <P>Most of the victims came to Taiwan via brokers from Southeast Asian countries
such as Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines to work as factory
hands or domestic caregivers.</P>
      <P>The report urged Taiwan to extend the Labor Standards Act to all categories of
workers, including domestic workers and caregivers. It also recommended that the
government subject traffickers to stringent penalties and ensure that the
victims have a clear understanding of their rights.</P>
      <P>Other tier 1 countries include many western European nations, South Korea,
Australia, and New Zealand.</P>
      <P>Neighboring countries and territories such as Japan, Mongolia, Hong Kong, Macau,
Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines were placed in "tier 2" or on the "tier
2" watch list, " where China was ranked for the sixth straight year.</P>

    <DATELINE>06/15/10  12:07:00
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Official statistics show that the debt owed by the central government stands at
just NT$4.6 trillion, accounting for 35.3 percent of Taiwan's average gross
national product for the past three years.</P>
      <P>The calculation was made based on Taiwan's unique definition of public debt,
which excludes debt owed by nonprofit funds, short-term loans, and self-
redeeming debt. In other words, if all these items are included -- which is how
the United States, Europe and Japan define their public debts -- the outstanding
amount of Taiwan's public debt as a percentage of the country's gross domestic
product (GDP) could be much higher.</P>
      <P>According to an estimate by the Legislative Yuan's budget center, the
outstanding amount of central government debt accounted for 90.5 percent of GDP
in 2008. Another estimate by the Ministry of Audit, which includes hidden debt,
put the amount at NT$19.7 trillion, accounting for 151 percent of GDP.</P>
      <P>Such unclear definitions of public debt has drawn widespread doubts and has also
sowed the horrible seeds of crisis. As shown from Greece's example, non-
transparent debt statistics can do far more serious harm than the debt itself.</P>
      <P>We urge legislators to amend the Public Debt Act to adopt the internationally
accepted definition for public debt so as to prevent Taiwan from repeating
Greece's error. (June 15, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Over the period from late April to early June, two sika deer were rescued from
the sea off Taiwan's coast. Instead of embracing their rebirth on the island,
the animals were put down the day after they were brought ashore for quarantine
purposes.</P>
      <P>Quarantine officials did not need more than 24 hours to sentence the unfortunate
deer to the death penalty after pinpointing them as smuggled cargo. Some local
deer farmers, however, were skeptical that money could be made by smuggling the
animal since the raising of sika deer in Taiwan has been very successful.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the quarantine officials were seen putting down the animals out of
concern that they might be carrying infectious diseases that would endanger the
lives of other animals in Taiwan -- without even bothering to perform safety
checks.</P>
      <P>When animal protection advocates and local residents urging that the animals'
lives be spared, the officials replied: "which is more important, a deer's life
or Taiwan's livestock industry?"</P>
      <P>We found the words, "saving Taiwan's livestock industry " to be typical of the
language of the bureaucrats, who were seen as being reluctant to spend time and
energy in performing sophisticated quarantine checks on a stray deer.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in a similar case, the Shou Shan Zoo in Kaohsiung City announced it
will bring in two white tigers from China in the near future. However, under the
government's ban against the reproduction of offspring born by inbreeding, the
zoo promised to neuter the tigers soon after their arrival. The zoo claimed that
it will be "the world's first case" of neutering white tigers.</P>
      <P>The zoo might not know that sterilization violates the law of the nature, as no
zoo has the right to arbitrarily take away animals' right to reproduction. Shou
Shan Zoo was unwilling to sacrifice the commercial opportunity created by having
white tigers in its zoo and also wanted to show off its "eugenic" knowledge. But
with such a mistaken and contradictory approach, how can the zoo demonstrate its
appreciation and concern for life?</P>
      <P>The two unfortunate sika deer and white tigers to be sterilized are two wrong
life education lessons. (June 15, 2010).</P>

      <P>Shareholders of United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC), the world's second largest

proposal that could be used to set up a strategic alliance for its future
operations.</P>
      <P>The number of shares to be issued in the private placement will not exceed 10
percent of the company's 12.99 billion outstanding shares in circulation.</P>
      <P>But UMC Chairman Stan Hung said the sale would not be carried out immediately
because the company's share price is not high enough.</P>
      <P>UMC shares closed up 1.75 percent at NT$14.55 Monday.</P>
      <P>Hung said the future issue price will be set at a level close to the market
price and will not be discounted.</P>
      <P>UMC's majority  shareholders  and its management  will not participate in the

UMC might spend the money to diversify its business.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou praised Burkina Faso Tuesday for its support for the
"Lamp for Africa" lighting project that Taiwan is promoting there to benefit
schoolchildren.</P>
      <P>Ma told visiting Burkina Faso Foreign Minister Bedouma Alain Yoda that he was
moved by Burkina Faso's participation in the program, which will distribute
1,000 light-emitting diode (LED) lighting kits to schoolchildren.</P>
      <P>"The LED lighting kits will allow at least 1,000 schoolchildren to read at their
home at night, instead of reading outdoors under street lights," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Students there will be given an LED lighting kit equipped with a rechargeable
battery that lasts four-and-a-half hours. The lighting kit was developed by the
Central Taiwan Vocational Training Center.</P>
      <P>Ma told Yoda that he was also deeply moved by a Burkinabe student because of his
fluent Mandarin.</P>
      <P>Referring to a student he met when attending a May 25 Africa Day celebration at
Huashan Creative Park in Taipei, Ma said the student was a recipient of a Taiwan
scholarship and has been studying at Shih Chien University in Taipei for two
years.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China have completed their third round of negotiations on the
proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , moving closer to the
goal of signing the pact in late June or early July.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition camp has continued to press forward with its anti-ECFA
campaign.</P>
      <P>At a time when the ECFA negotiations are entering the final stage,  the
government should make public its objectives  and supplementary measures with
regard to the ECFA in order to muster broader public support for the deal. The
text of the agreement and its "early harvest" list should also be publicized as
soon as possible to demonstrate the government's respect for public opinion.</P>
      <P>In addition, we advise President Ma Ying-jeou to declare publicly what roles and
functions the ECFA will serve in national development.</P>
      <P>He should  also give direction  to national  policies  on cross-Taiwan Strait
affairs, foreign affairs, and national security so as to allay public doubts
over these issues and boost morale in the country. This will add the crucial
finishing touches to the signing of the trade pact.</P>

      <P>"Pan-blue" lawmakers suggested Tuesday that the Legislative Yuan will need two
extra sessions to complete its review of a trade pact with China, while their
opposition "pan-green" colleagues called for the deal to be screened "item by
item."</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Hung-chih, secretary-general of the "pan-blue" KMT caucus, said
that if the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) being negotiated
with China is signed before the end of June, the Legislature would open an
additional session between early and mid-July to review it.</P>
      <P>After the first round of screening in committees and one month of inter-party
negotiations, a second extra legislative session would be held before mid-
August, Lin suggested.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Chun-yee, secretary-general of the opposition "pan-green"
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus, said his caucus will ask the
Executive Yuan to deliver its assessment reports on the ECFA's possible impact
on Taiwan to the legislature for discussion.</P>
      <P>The DPP caucus will "definitely demand negotiations" with the ruling party on
the agreement after it is brought to the Legislature, and request that it be
examined "article by article" and "item by item," Lee said.</P>
      <P>The opposition has strongly opposed the proposed trade deal, touted by the
administration of President Ma Ying-jeou as a necessary step to prevent Taiwan
from being marginalized in regional and global trade markets.</P>
      <P>The DPP fears the pact will undermine the interests of local industrial and
agricultural producers by allowing an influx of cheap Chinese goods into Taiwan,
and it has repeatedly demanded strict public scrutiny of the pact.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Monday that if cross-strait talks on the ECFA proceed
without any glitches, it would likely be signed before the end of June, or in
early July at the latest.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's legislative body is currently on its summer recess. Under the country's
Constitution, the Legislature can open an additional session at the request of
the president or one-fourth of all of its members.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday he is optimistic that Taiwan can achieve its
carbon reduction targets ahead of schedule to better deal with global climate
change and help the agricultural sector make the necessary adjustments.</P>
      <P>In 2009, Taiwan cut its level of carbon emissions by 5 percent, and in 2008 by
4.4 percent, the president said, adding that the government's goal is to reduce
emissions by 2025 to the 2000 level.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan could achieve the targeted reduction to the 2005 level by 2020,
three years earlier than previously scheduled 2008, the president said at a
meeting sponsored by the Council of Agriculture, (COA) to discuss climate
change.</P>
      <P>Ma said he was pleased to learn that the COA has begun adopting new strategies
to tackle the effects of climate change on the local agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>"Agriculture in particular, has a low production value, but is closely related
to the livelihoods of many people and to the conservation of the natural
environment," he said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's industry should not be left alone to fight global climate change," he
said, adding that the government should work out a comprehensive policy goal.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic affairs minister declined to comment Tuesday on whether
Volkswagen, the world's largest automaker, plans to set up a factory in Taiwan
to target markets in the region.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of Economics Affairs cannot comment on the case before the
ministry formally receives any investment proposal, " Minister Shih Yen-shiang
told reporters on the sidelines of a forum in Taipei.</P>
      <P>He said the ministry is often contacted  by multinational businesses on possible
investment projects, and that many of them have visited Taiwan to evaluate its
investment environment.</P>
      <P>Shih was badgered with questions about Volkswagen a day after Premier Wu Den-yih
said he had met executives from a global carmaker last week.</P>
      <P>The premier also revealed that Woody Duh, director-general of the ministry's
Industrial Development Bureau, will soon accompany the company's executives to
visit an industrial park in Taiwan, local media reported.</P>
      <P>Wu said the company is hoping to manufacture its cars in Taiwan so that they can
be sold at higher prices than those made in China, the reports said.</P>
      <P>Though Wu did not mention the name of the company, local media cited anonymous
officials and car company executives in identifying the prospective investor as
Germany-based Volkswagen.</P>
      <P>Volkswagen and its distributor in Taiwan, Swire Group subsidiary Beldare Motors
Ltd., declined to comment on the rumors, according to local news reports.</P>
      <P>Late last year, Volkswagen expressed its interest in establishing a factory in
the Changhua Coastal Industrial Park in central Taiwan, and it could break
ground on the project late this year, investing at least NT$1 billion (US$31
million), the reports said.</P>
      <P>If Volkswagen goes ahead with the facility, it would not just focus on the
domestic market but also be used as a base to penetrate Southeast Asian markets
and India.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-language Economic Daily News cautioned, however, that Volkswagen
could scrap its factory plan because of a setback in negotiations on an economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>As of now, only automotive parts rather than assembled vehicles will be included
in the ECFA's "early harvest" list of Taiwan-made items exported to China that
would be eligible for immediate tariff reductions or exemptions.</P>
      <P>That means that Volkswagen cars made in Taiwan for export to China would not
receive preferential tariff treatment, at least in the initial stage of the
agreement.</P>
      <P>The trade pact is expected to be signed later this month or in early July.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.90 percent Tuesday on follow-through buying amid
continued optimism over the economic benefits of the imminent economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 66.66 points to 7,454.06, after moving between 7,364.34
and 7,489.68, on turnover of NT$79.87 billion (US$2.48 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened marginally higher, up 1.17 points, on Wall Street's lackluster
performance overnight, but interest was renewed during the mid-morning trade,
boosting sectors that are expected to be allowed tariff waivers and easier
market access under the ECFA, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,724 stocks closed up and 1,117 down, while 379 remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The financial sector recorded the strongest gains, rising 1.4 percent. The
foodstuff sector closed up 1.10 percent and the paper and pulp sector finished
0.9 percent higher, while plastics and chemicals sector rose 0.7 percent, as did
the machinery and electronics sector.</P>
      <P>The cement and construction sectors both added 0.4 percent and textile shares
gained 0.2 percent.</P>
      <P>"The upbeat mood over the ECFA continued to move the market," Mega Securities
analyst Alex Huang said. "In fact, following the bourse gains in the past few
trading sessions, market sentiment has improved a lot."</P>
      <P>A stable euro against the U.S. dollar and the gains posted by other major
regional markets have also helped to shore up market confidence, with investors
leaving behind concerns over the debt problems in Europe, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Pulp &amp; Paper rose 3.08 percent to NT$11.70 and Formosa Plastics
gained 1.20 percent to reach NT$67.20.</P>
      <P>Food maker Uni-President Enterprises, which has set up a broad manufacturing
base in China, rose 2.22 percent to NT$34.60, while its competitor Ve Wong
increased 1.52 percent to NT$23.40.</P>
      <P>Cathay Financial, closing up 3.00 percent at NT$48.05, led the financial sector
higher on hopes that the company will benefit from its large property assets, as
Chinese enterprises will need office space to set up headquarters in Taiwan
after the signing of the ECFA, dealers said.</P>
      <P>However, Huang said that after its recent gains, the market has moved closer to
the technical resistance point range of 7,500-7,600.</P>
      <P>"So, if the market goes higher again, please pocket your profits. Do not chase
prices now," Huang said.</P>
      <P>EVA Airways rose 4.08 percent to NT$19.15 and China Airlines increased 3.95
percent to NT$15.80 after new direct flight services between Taipei's Songshan
Airport and Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport were launched Monday.</P>

      <P>A fourth round of formal talks on a proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China may not be needed despite unresolved issues, Bureau
of Foreign Trade Director-General Huang Chih-peng said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Negotiations were almost completed" in the third round of formal talks on the
trade pact that concluded in Beijing Sunday, said Huang, Taiwan's chief
negotiator on the deal.</P>
      <P>Huang's comment seemed to run counter to the position of Premier Wu Den-yih, who
said on Monday that the two sides would continue to discuss outstanding issues
in a fourth round of talks.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, Huang said his team had
made every effort to safeguard Taiwan's economic interests during Sunday's talks
in Beijing,  describing it as "professional and conscientious."</P>
      <P>The team held firm on not opening Taiwan's market to Chinese workers or banned
agricultural products from China, Huang said, and it was also successful in
getting more Taiwan-made items with a higher combined export value on the ECFA's
"early harvest" list than those pushed by the Chinese side.</P>
      <P>Items on the early harvest will be given preferential tariff treatment or
greater market access once the pact takes effect.</P>
      <P>A number of items, however, that Taiwan wanted on the list, such as machine
tools and certain petrochemical products, were rejected by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Huang indicated that Taiwan is still insisting on including them, and he said
Chinese negotiators are now weighing the request. He believed that the issues
could be dealt with through various channels and would not require holding a
fourth round of talks to resolve.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had hoped to include products with an annual export value to China of
US$13.6 billion on the early harvest list.</P>
      <P>But the 500 items reportedly included on the list after the conclusion of the
third round of ECFA talks fell short of the goal because of the exclusion of the
important export items.</P>

      <P>Traffic in the Hsuehshan Tunnel was restricted Sunday to allow a donated heart
from Yilan County in northeastern Taiwan to be rushed to a hospital in Taipei,
the first time a lane in the tunnel had been closed for an ambulance since its
inauguration in 2006.</P>
      <P>The route from Yilan's Yangming Hospital to the Taipei Veterans Hospital is
about 65 km and includes three national freeways -- the No. 5 Freeway, the No. 1
Freeway and the No. 3 Freeway.</P>
      <P>Local newspapers reported Tuesday that in order to get the heart to its
destination in time through the usually heavy northbound traffic on Sunday, when
the slowest speed in the Hsuehshan Tunnel, a section of the No. 5 Freeway, can
be as slow as 10 kph, police had to cordon off the outer line of the northbound
traffic, the first time this had been done to allow passage of an ambulance.</P>
      <P>"Organ donation is more important than the average emergency aid," said Chiu
Chung-yuan, a captain of the National Highway Police Bureau.</P>
      <P>The ambulance took only seven minutes to get through the 12.9-km tunnel, which
Chiu said "broke the record for the fastest passage time of 11 minutes since the
tunnel's inauguration."</P>
      <P>The ambulance left the Yilan hospital at 10: 58 p.m. Sunday, traveling at very
high speeds with a police escort, and arrived at Taipei Veterans General
Hospital at 23:37 p.m. The transplant operation on a woman in her 50s began at
midnight and went smoothly, according to hospital officials.</P>
      <P>The donor, surnamed Chen, a man in his early 40s, had been pronounced brain dead
earlier in the day and his family decided to donate his heart, liver, pancreas,
kidneys, corneas and bone marrow, which could benefit at least seven people.</P>
      <P>As hearts have to be transplanted within two hours of culling, its delivery was
given priority, while the other organs arrived in Taipei later.</P>

      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) held an annual event in Taipei Tuesday for its

that this year, they held an "egg standing" competition, a tradition in which
eggs are balanced on their ends for luck.</P>

student from Kiribati, before the competition, which was held the day before the
festival.</P>
      <P>The competition  started  at noon and some 20 contestants successfully stood

city airports in East Asia being developed by Taiwan's capital.</P>
      <P>Direct flights between Taipei Songshan Airport and Shanghai Hongqiao
International Airport were launched Monday, bringing the two cities closer
together and making it easier for passengers to make round trips between the two
cities in a single day, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, nonstop flights between Songshan Airport and Tokyo's Haneda Airport
will be launched Oct. 31, and nonstop flights between Songshan Airport and
Seoul's Kimpo Airport are scheduled to begin at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>"By that time, Taipei Songshan Airport will be the hub of a golden flight circle

cross-strait economic cooperation, improve the two sides' competitiveness, and
strengthen their ability to meet the challenges of economic globalization.</P>

      <P>The categories of Taiwanese goods that will be allowed to enter the Chinese
market with tariff concessions under a proposed trade pact between Taipei and
Beijing have not yet been finalized and more could be added, President Ma Ying-

      <P>At a tea party he hosted for journalists, the president said the kinds of goods
to enjoy preferential tariff status under the "early harvest" program could not
be worked out in one single negotiation session and that more could be added to
the program in ensuing bilateral discussions.</P>
      <P>During the party, Ma was showered with questions about the economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) , which was almost completed during bilateral
negotiations in Beijing Sunday.</P>
      <P>He said the text of the pact has already been finalized but the list of goods
under the "early harvest" program, which includes goods and services and will be
attached to the pact as an appendix, has not yet been approved by either side.</P>
      <P>"The final list should be ready for publication before the top negotiators of

      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with China, Chiang Pin-kung, is expected to meet with

program, including the petrochemical and machine tools industry, which enjoy the
lion's share of the country's exports to China, to refrain from giving vent to
their displeasure, as "the final list is still being negotiated."</P>
      <P>The items on the list are a small but vital fraction of Taiwan's and China's
exports to each other, accounting for 10 percent to 15 percent of their total
exports to the other side, the president said.</P>
      <P>"The list is the thin end of the wedge and more could follow, " according to Ma,

      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) , the world's largest contract
chip maker, on Tuesday raised its forecast for growth in the global
semiconductor sector on optimism over the strength of the rebound in demand for
ICs.</P>
      <P>TSMC Chairman and CEO Morris Chang said the sector should see sales growth rise
by 30 percent in 2010, outpacing his previous estimate of 22 percent made in
April.</P>
      <P>The foundry business is expected to grow by even more than 30 percent, higher
than the integrated IC industry as a whole, Chang added at the company's annual
shareholders' meeting held in Hsinchu Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang also raised his forecast for average annual sales growth for the world's
IC sector over the next five years to 7 percent from an earlier estimate of 5
percent.</P>
      <P>Following a rapid recovery in the global semiconductor business in the first
half of the year, the TSMC chief said he expected it to grow at a more moderate
pace over the next six months.</P>
      <P>Strong demand from China has been one of the factors supporting the global IC
industry's strong growth, Chang indicated, and he said he was targeting China
more for its huge market than its cheap labor.</P>
      <P>TSMC currently operates an eight-inch wafer plant in Songjiang in eastern
Jiangsu province, and the TSMC chairman said his company has no plans to
withdraw from China despite concerns among Taiwanese high tech firms that rising
wages there will hurt their profitability.</P>
      <P>In fact, he said, TSMC's compensation to Chinese employees has been higher than
most other foreign investors in China, including Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision
Industry, which is known as Foxconn in China.</P>
      <P>Foxconn announced two pay hikes for its Chinese workers in one week earlier this
month to appease its employees at its Shenzhen complex after a string of
suicides, leaving 10 workers dead and two others injured so far this year.</P>

      <P>For example, Hsu said, a mineral entrepreneur in Canada has recently talked with
him about the possibility of forming joint ventures in China to take the
advantage of the platform to be created by the ECFA.</P>
      <P>"I need to think hard to figure out which businesses are likely to experience
poor business in the second half of this year because of the ECFA, " said Hsu,
whose group spans the areas of textiles, cement,  petrochemicals,  department
stores,  transport  and telecommunication,  when asked to comment on Taiwan's
economic climate.</P>
      <P>Saying that Far EasTone has prepared a plan to lead Taiwan's service industries
in exploring the Chinese market, Hsu said he would not elaborate on the details
of the plan until the ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese and Chinese negotiators completed their third formal round of ECFA
talks in Beijing last Sunday, paving the way for the signing of the pact in late
June or early July.</P>
      <P>Far EasTone, at a shareholders' meeting in April 2009, decided to set up a
cooperation agreement with China Mobil by selling some of its shares to the
largest telecommunications company in China, but the government has not approved
the project.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President promises all-out effort in renovating Songshan Airport</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
06/15/10  17:32:54

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that the government will go all-out to
finish renovating Taipei's Songshan Airport by October 2011 to cope with
increasing traffic demand.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the makeover will be an essential step in preparing the airport
for further links with Tokyo's Haneda Airport and Seoul's Gimpo International
Airport, after direct flights with Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport was launched
Monday.</P>
      <P>While the first phase of the project is expected to be completed in October this
year, the second and third phases are scheduled to be concluded in March and
October 2011, respectively, he said.</P>
      <P>"By then,  Songshan Airport's shabby look should see some improvement, " Ma told
reporters after a media luncheon marking the Dragon Boat Festival.</P>
      <P>He recalled  that Songshan Airport,  which used to be an international airport,
was changed to a domestic airport in February 1979 and served more than 100
flights a day during the boom years of the domestic aviation industry.</P>
      <P>After the high-speed railway system was launched in 2007, almost all the flights
between Songshan and major cities along the west coast were forced to a halt,
with the airport now mainly serving flights linking Taipei with eastern Taiwan
and outlying islands, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>The domestic aviation industry has since been revived following the launch of
direct air links between Taiwan and China, making it urgent to remodel Songshan
Airport, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Thanks  to efforts  by Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin,  direct Songshan-Hongqiao
flights -- which had been targeted for October -- were realized four months
ahead of schedule, he said.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on the issue Tuesday, Su Tseng-chang, the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP) candidate for the year-end Taipei mayoral election,
described Songshan's hasty launch of direct flights with Hongqiao Airport before
the completion of its makeover  as an "unnecessary"  move based merely on
"election considerations."</P>
      <P>Su expressed disapproval of a proposal by some DPP politicians, including former
Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, to relocate Songshan Airport, because "the
conditions to do so are currently lacking."</P>
      <P>Su said he does not oppose the government's current policy of transforming
Songshan into a major metropolitan airport as long as it is in the interests of
the city's residents.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>K.Y. Lee, chairman of flat panel maker AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) ,  denied again
on Tuesday price fixing allegations that were leveled against the company and
six of its executives in a U.S. Department of Justice indictment last week.</P>
      <P>Lee said AUO has vowed to fight the charges to clear the company of the charges
and protect its reputation and credibility.</P>
      <P>A federal grand jury in San Francisco  charged AUO,  its Houston-based U.S.
subsidiary, and six executives for participating in a conspiracy to fix prices
of thin-film-transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) panels from September
2001 to December 2006.</P>
      <P>If convicted, the AUO executives could each face up to 10 years in prison and a
US$1 million (NT$32.21 million) fine, while the company could be hit with a fine
of US$100 million.</P>
      <P>Lee,  who is also  the chairman  of consumer  electronics manufacturer Qisda
Corp., said at Qisda's annual shareholders' meeting Tuesday that AUO is the
first corporation to fight the U.S. charges.</P>
      <P>He said there is no evidence pointing to the alleged AUO participation in price
fixing and vowed that his company will not plead guilty.</P>
      <P>According to the U.S. Department of Justice, six electronics companies have
already pleaded guilty in connection  with the conspiracy case and a total of 17
executives have been charged.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued immediately after the indictment was handed down, AUO said
it was disappointed with the DOJ's move since it had cooperated with the
department and other authorities in their investigation into the price fixing
allegations.</P>
      <P>The company had said the charges would not have a "materially adverse impact" on
its day-to-day operations.</P>

      <P>Prices of domestically grown vegetables have been rising and are expected to
reach a high prior to the Dragon Boat Festival, the Council of Agriculture (COA)
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The average vegetable wholesale price in Taipei City stood at NT$25.4 (US$0.79)
per kilo Tuesday, up nearly 60 percent from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The wholesale prices of leafy vegetables averaged NT$17.5 per kilo, representing
a year-on-year price hike of 84 percent, according to the COA.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Agricultural Products Marketing Corp. attributed the upward-spiraling
prices to recent rain that has damaged some leafy crops and has led to a decline
in production, as well as greater pre-festival demand.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the price of pork stood at NT$70.43 per kilo Tuesday, slightly lower
than the NT$73 posted five days ago, thanks to the COA's efforts to increase pig
supplies in the week leading up to the Dragon Boat Festival, which falls on June
16 this year, said Wang Chung-shu, an official with the COA's Department of
Animal Industry.</P>
      <P>Tuesday's pork price, nevertheless, was still higher than the figure posted in
May, when the price stood at NT$68.79 per kilo, said Wang.</P>
      <P>The May figure represented a year-on-year rise of 12.9 percent, he added.</P>
      <P>An average of 21,587 pigs were sold daily nationwide in that month, marking a
year-on-year decline of 7.3 percent.</P>
      <P>He attributed the decline in pork supplies mainly to the aftermath of last
year's Typhoon Morakot, in which 170,000 pigs died.</P>
      <P>Pork prices routinely spike before the Dragon Boat Festival as pork is a major
ingredient of zongzi -- a pyramid-shaped glutinous rice delicacy with a savory
filling wrapped in bamboo leaves.</P>

      <P>The government will decide by the third quarter whether or not to renew the full
deposit guarantee scheme after it expires at the end of the year, Vice Premier
Sean Chen said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission last year extended the full guarantee on
deposits from December 2009 to the end of 2010 as part of its efforts to build
market confidence. But it said last month it was considering dropping the scheme
at the end of 2010 because the economy was recovering.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, many financial institutions are now strong enough to handle
any crisis. Therefore, the Central Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) will
consider whether to renew the full deposit guarantee program or if other action
is needed, he said.</P>
      <P>The FSC said last year that if the guarantee was not extended beyond the
original period, many small and medium-sized banks, as well as those with
deteriorating financial health, could see massive outflows of time and demand
deposits.</P>
      <P>Deposits at local banks totalled NT$25 trillion ($781 billion) in the first

      <P>People with depression should not stop taking their prescription medication just
because they feel their condition has improved, especially if they are still
displaying symptoms such as insomnia or shoulder cramps, a doctor warned
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hung Jin-yi, a psychiatrist at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Linkou,
Taipei County, said depression is more than a mental disease and is often
accompanied by chest distress, palpitations, muscle tightness and dizziness.</P>
      <P>"These physical symptoms stemming from depression are more difficult than mental
symptoms to cure, and patients who have ceased to take their medicine could
suffer a relapse when under stress, " Hung said.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by a research team at the Chang Gung Hospital
among 135 patients who sought treatment at the hospital for depression, their
physical symptoms are more serious than their mental symptoms such as anxiety or
melancholy before treatment.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, symptoms such as insomnia and muscle pain are no light matter," he
said.</P>
      <P>Huang also recommended that patients should take more exercise, as it provides
relief from both the mental and physical symptoms of depression.</P>

      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Shih Yen-shiang said Tuesday that the government will
adopt a "double engine" economic development model for the next 10 years, with a
special focus on re-energizing the traditional and service industries.</P>
      <P>"The next 10 years will be a key period for Taiwan in its industrial transition
efforts, " Shih said at a Taipei forum on investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shih mapped out three directions in which Taiwan's industrial adjustments could
rejuvenate the country's economy:</P>
      <P>-- Upgrade traditional industries by combining ICT (information and
communication technologies), design and brand strategies;</P>
      <P>-- Promote the newly emerging industries, including biotech, green energy,
tourism, health care, specialist agriculture and innovation; and</P>
      <P>-- Promote the service industries.</P>
      <P>Shih explained that the manufacturing industries in the past played the major
part in Taiwan's economic development, with the service sector in a supporting
role.</P>
      <P>However, Shih said, taking advantage of China's gradual shift from being the
"world's factory" to the "world's market, " Taiwan stands a good change of

      <P>There is no set timetable for the execution of the 40 prisoners on death row,
Minister of Justice Tseng Yung-fu reiterated Tuesday in response to media
questions on the government's next move following its April 30 execution of four
condemned convicts.</P>
      <P>"It is too early to talk about the issue now, as prosecutors are still screening
the list before they hand it over to an ad hoc committee under the Justice
Ministry that will decide what to do next," Tseng said in response to reporters'
questions.</P>
      <P>"I have no set timetable for the execution of the 40 prisoners on death row," he
said after a visit to Sijhih, Taipei County to see Wu Tong-yen, whose parents
were murdered in front of him in 1991 when he was six years old.</P>
      <P>Wu now suffers from muscular dystrophy and is on a respirator.</P>
      <P>The four executions in April were the first in Taiwan in five years, as an
informal moratorium on the death penalty appeared to be in place.</P>
      <P>However, the issue came to the forefront in March when then Minister of Justice
Wang Ching-feng said publicly that she would not sign any execution orders for
prisoners on death row.</P>
      <P>Wang was later forced to resign amid public outcry over her statement and four
prisoners were executed within weeks of the new minister taking office.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan also took steps to pass a law that would speed up the
process of criminal trials and limit the prosecution of criminal cases in the
courts to no more than eight years.</P>
      <P>Tseng said his ministry will adhere to the regulations in processing cases
involving capital punishment.</P>
      <P>Some senior prosecutors have blamed the Supreme Court for the length of time
criminals trials often take in Taiwan, accusing it of frequently invalidating
the rulings of lower courts on the basis of minor technical details.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GPT strives to take its place in Taiwan as a true green party</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/15/10  19:22:00</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Pan Han-sheng has become used to explaining over and over again that his Green
Party Taiwan (GPT) is a "real political party, " not just an environmental
protection group.</P>
      <P>When it not being mistaken for an environmental group, the GPT is erroneously
associated  with the pan-green affiliates --  the opposition Democratic
Progressive  Party (DPP)  and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU).</P>
      <P>This situation has long been a problem for the GPT, which is seeking to
establish its own identity and character, said Pan, one of the conveners of the
GPT.</P>
      <P>But recently, the party, which was founded in 1996, had an opportunity to polish
its image and highlight its agenda.</P>
      <P>Its success in hosting the second congress of Asia-Pacific Green Network in May
gave it a shot in the arm and a chance to appear in the global spotlight.</P>
      <P>The party is now pumped up and ready to take on political competition, Pan
indicated.</P>
      <P>"While the political environment in Taiwan does not favor minor political
parties, the GPT has reaffirmed its goal of making more of an impact through
elections and prove that it's more than just another environmental group," said
Pan.</P>
      <P>Pan, 40, will lead the way, competing in the year-end elections for Taipei  City
councillors,  making  his second bid in the Songshan-Xinyi district after a
failed attempt in 1996.</P>
      <P>The GPT's goals are inspired by the successes of green parties in various other
countries, he said.</P>
      <P>Although the GPT is yet to obtain more than 1 percent of the votes in any local
or national election, Pan said, it is optimistic that one day it will be like
the New Zealand Green Party, which has 9 seats in the 122-member House of
Representatives, the Australia Greens, which has five seats in the 76-member
Senate, or the Luxembourg Greens, which most recently won 15 percent of the
vote.</P>
      <P>Pan believes that the party will be able to ride the rising wave of
environmental awareness and take advantage of the growth of Taiwan's civil
society, leaving behind the bitter taste of the 1999-2005 period, when it was
practically inactive due to a lack of funding.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, candidates in local council and legislative elections are required by
law to each pay a deposit of NT$200,000 (US$6,195) to the Central Election
Commission (CEC). The deposit is not returned if the candidate fails to obtain
10 percent of the quotient obtained by dividing the number of votes by the size
of the district.</P>
      <P>In addition, political parties that fail to garner more than 5 percent of the
vote in the most recent legislative election do not qualify for the campaign
subsidy of NT$50 per ballot.</P>
      <P>In 2008, the GPT put forward 14 candidates in the legislative election, a move
that brought the party to the brink of bankruptcy because it spent millions on
the deposits and its campaign and did not perform well in the polls, Pan said.</P>
      <P>In the 2008 legislative election, the GPT gained 60,000 party votes, which means
it would have been eligible to receive a subsidy of about NT$3 million -- a sum
that is more than its annual budget -- if the vote threshold was scrapped, Pan
said.</P>
      <P>"However, none of the other political party are interested in amending those
laws," he lamented.</P>
      <P>The issue of having to worry about money is relatively new to Pan, who was a
researcher and fund manager at a security firm before he became deeply involved
in the GPT.</P>
      <P>Like most people in this type of job, he said, he would work under high pressure
for several years, then quit and go traveling and buy luxuries.</P>
      <P>"I never had problems finding a new job, " he said.</P>
      <P>In 2006, fresh from a vacation in Japan, he was recruited by the GPT to run for
city councilor, but his bid failed.</P>
      <P>That same year, two personal experiences -- the death of mother and the birth of
his daughter -- made him rethink his priorities, he said.</P>
      <P>"All of a sudden making money was not that important to me anymore -- I had a
brand new perspective on life, " Pan said.</P>
      <P>It was then that he made the decision to work full time for the GPT.</P>
      <P>These days Pan can be seen at protests and public hearings related to
environmental issues. He has also appeared on a television talk show advocating
the abolition of the death penalty, one of the main policies of the GPT.</P>
      <P>"Once you've chosen to take the path of politics, you have to do it the
'Taiwanese way, ' which means wearing a vest with your name on it, meeting and
talking to people and shaking every hand. And you have to get as much exposure
as possible, " he said.</P>
      <P>However, convincing people to vote for the GPT is not an easy task, he said.</P>
      <P>Most people support the party's position on the environment, human rights and
social justice, but at election time they usually vote for the major political
parties, Pan said.</P>
      <P>"When the independence-unification discussions heat up, swing voters tend to shy
away from the voting booths and that hurts the GPT because most of our
supporters are swing voters," he said.</P>
      <P>However, there are some glimmers of hope, he indicated.</P>
      <P>According to a public opinion poll, he said, the party's support rate now
exceeds 2 percent and if it can expand its support base from the 20-25 age group
to the 35-45 group, it could win a few seats in the year-end elections and go on
from there.</P>
      <P>He is of the view that Taiwan needs a party like the GPT to bring some balance
to the dialogue on major issues.</P>
      <P>"It  would  be a shame  if all the  discussions  on the independence-unification
issue should take place along party lines, " he said. "Those who care about
public policies and social issues should be able to speak out on behalf of the
people."</P>
      <P>For the GPT, party identity, funding and election laws remain big problems, But,
Pan said, the party is determined to continue on its chosen path until it can
claim its place as the only genuinely green party in the country. By Chris Wang

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local contract notebook makers Wistron Corp. and Compal Electronics Corp. said
Tuesday they expect shipments for the third quarter of this year to grow because
of lessening impact on global demand caused by the debt problems in Europe.</P>
      <P>Wistron Chairman Simon Lin said he expects notebook shipments for the third
quarter of this year to rise more than 10 percent from the second quarter.</P>
      <P>Lin said that while the impact from the European crisis on demand for notebooks
was visible in April, the impact moderated in May. He added that the company's
shipments since the beginning of June had returned to normal levels.</P>
      <P>He added,  however,  that he was remaining cautious about developments, as many
market observers are holding a wait-and-see attitude toward the financial crisis
in Europe.</P>
      <P>Lin said that while sales to the eurozone have been affected, demand from the
Asia-Pacific region and Latin America has been on the rise, offsetting the
damage caused by the falling euro. He added that shipments for the second half
of this year are likely to see a rise of 20 percent from the first half.</P>
      <P>For his part, Compal President Chen Jui-tsung said on a separate occasion that
he expects his company's notebook shipments for the third quarter to grow 5
percent-10 percent from the second quarter.</P>
      <P>Chen said the company has not changed an earlier forecast of 50 million units
shipped in 2010.</P>
      <P>He said that as the high tech sector will soon enter its peak season that begins
in July, shipment growth in August and September will become more obvious.</P>

      <P>Not one but several foreign carmakers have expressed interest in setting up
factories in Taiwan, Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"More than one car company from countries including China have asked about how
to establish factories in Taiwan," Wu told reporters.</P>
      <P>He declined to name the companies, saying that their investment proposals had
not been confirmed, but industry sources named one of the companies as
Volkswagen AG, the world's largest car manufacturer.</P>
      <P>According to the premier, the signing of an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and China will give foreign companies greater
confidence in moving their factories or logistics hubs to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said that many Taiwan-
based foreign businesses have told the ministry they will have greater
opportunities to ask their parent companies to allow them to expand their
presences in Taiwan after the ECFA is inked.</P>
      <P>Foreign companies look forward to increasingly  intensified economic activities
between Taiwan and China as a result of the eased tension between the two long-
time foes, he said on the sidelines of a forum in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"This is of great help to them in managing their presences in the Asia-Pacific
region," he added.</P>
      <P>Asked, however, if there is a growing number of foreign companies stepping up
their evaluations of investing in Taiwan, Shih did not reply directly, saying
only that the ministry has been helping foreign companies better understand
Taiwan's investment environment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, speaking at the forum, Vice Economics Minister Francis Liang
described U.S., European and Japanese businessmen as being very interested in
how to strengthen cooperation or build partnerships with Taiwan to explore
regional markets, including China.</P>
      <P>He said, for example, that Mizuho Financial Group, Japan's second largest
banking group, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the ministry in
January this year, as "many Japanese businessmen can see Taiwan's potential."</P>
      <P>The MOU is designed to promote investment between Taiwan and Japan, as well as
help Taiwanese and Japanese companies invest in China or Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, according to the ministry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President clarifies stance on death penalty</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday Taiwan should first reduce the number of
death sentences in Taiwan as a means of gradually phasing out the practice in a
bid to stem controversy over the issue.</P>
      <P>Speaking to representatives of the Taiwan Alliance to End the Death Penalty at
the Presidential Office, Ma described abrogating the death penalty as "a world
trend" but said the government still needs to stick to the principle of rule by
law and carry out the executions of death row inmates until the practice is
legally eliminated.</P>
      <P>Saying that the abolition of capital punishment cannot be achieved overnight, Ma
contended that the government's policy is moving in that direction,  in line
with two non-binding U.N. conventions the government ratified last year.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a recent public opinion poll on the death penalty, he
pointed out that a majority of Taiwan's people remain strongly opposed to its
abolition -- a stance that has not changed since 1993, when a similar survey was
carried out.</P>
      <P>"At present, all the government can do is to reduce the practice of the death
penalty while raising the threshold for parole for inmates sentenced to life in
prison," the president explained.</P>
      <P>"I hope we can begin building consensus on the controversial issue starting from
there," he added.</P>
      <P>The death penalty dispute came back to the forefront in late March, when then-
Minister of Justice Wang Ching-feng was forced to step down from the post after
making it clear that she would not sign any execution orders for prisoners on
death row, as an informal moratorium on the death penalty appeared to be in
place.</P>
      <P>Her successor, Tseng Yung-fu, swiftly decided to carry out four executions in
April -- the first in Taiwan in five years -- provoking heated debate among
those for and against capital punishment and prompting the alliance to step up
the pace of its efforts to have the sentences of the remaining 40 death row
inmates commuted to life in prison.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Tuesday the
committee that will be set up after Taiwan and China sign an economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) will be totally different from the Joint
Steering Committee established by Hong Kong and China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China have agreed to set up an Economic Cooperation Committee (ECC) ,
composed of delegates from both sides, to handle follow-up negotiations and
arrangements related to the ECFA after it is signed.</P>
      <P>The ECFA is generally a framework agreement and much of it's contents will have
to be worked out through bilateral negotiations after it is signed, Lai told
reporters before delivering a report at the Legislative Yuan on the progress of
the latest round of formal ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>The ECC will serve as a platform for follow-up arrangements, just like the Trade
and Investment Framework Agreement between Taiwan and the United States, she
said.</P>
      <P>The ECC will definitely be different from the Joint Steering Committee (JSE),
which was set up on the basis of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement
between Hong Kong and China, in that Taiwan and China are to be represented
equally on the ECC while the JSE is between a central government (China ) and a
local government (Hong Kong), she said.</P>
      <P>Many similar bodies are operating between countries that have forged free trade
agreements, including the one between the United States and Australia, Singapore
and Japan, and Malaysia and New Zealand, she added.</P>
      <P>Lai dismissed criticisms that the ECC is just a cross-strait version of the JSC,
saying that such comments denigrate Taiwan's status.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are expected to sign the ECFA by early next month.</P>

      <P>China's landmark win over Taiwan in the group stage of the 2008 Beijing Olympics
baseball competition was a game in which the best team beat the best talent, but
Taiwan's baseball prowess cannot be denied, a former manager of the Chinese
national baseball team said Tuesday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Jim Lefebvre, who led China to a thrilling 12-inning 8-7 win in Beijing -- its
first ever victory over Taiwan in major international baseball competition --
said the game displayed the plain beauty of baseball because "that day the best
talent did not win. That day the best team won."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's group stage loss to China did not affect the final placing as Taiwan
ranked fifth out of eight teams and China finished in last place. However, the
upset loss was still described by Taiwan's fans as "heartbreaking, "
"unbearable" and "a national disgrace."</P>
      <P>"But it was just our day... I have no idea how we won, " Lefebvre said, drawing
laughter from reporters.</P>
      <P>Lefebvre, 68, recalled that Taiwan seemed to think it had sealed the game after
taking a 2-0 lead. But the game went into an extra innings and China scored five
runs in the bottom the 12th inning after Taiwan scored four times in the top of
the same inning.</P>
      <P>According to Lefebvre, Taiwan let the game slip away because of some tactical
and positioning mistakes late in the game.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's talent has always been impressive, but good talent doesn't always
guarantee a win, he said. He advised Taiwanese baseball players to learn "how to
play the game hard and play it right."</P>
      <P>South Korea, the eventual gold medal winner in Beijing, showed dedication and
commitment every time its players stepped into a ballpark and its "one-way
training system" was consistent at every level, he said.</P>
      <P>Given Taiwan's passion for the game and its rich tradition in the sport, it is
well-positioned to be successful internationally, he said. Local coaches have
been doing exceptionally well in the Little League level by teaching
fundamentals, he noted.</P>
      <P>Lefebvre, who managed three Major League Baseball clubs from 1989-1999 and the
Chinese national team from 2003-2008, held a six-day clinic in which he and
another MLB coach Rick Dell trained 60 coaches from local high schools and
senior-level teams.</P>
      <P>The clinic is a part of Taiwan's four-year Baseball Revival Program, which was
set up after Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball League was crippled by a
major game-fixing scandal involved dozens of active and former players and

      <P>Taiwan's "early harvest" list under its proposed trade pact with China is twice
the length of China's in terms of the number of items and four times bigger in
terms of value, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a brief to the legislature about the country's third round of trade talks
with China that took place in Beijing Sunday, Shih said Taiwan has listed 500
categories of goods on its list, with an annual export value of US$12 billion,
while allowing China to put 250 categories of goods on its list, with an annual
export value of about US$3 billion.</P>
      <P>Goods on the lists will be able to enter the other side's market with
preferential tariffs.</P>
      <P>According to government  statistics,  Taiwan exported US$62 billion-worth of
goods to China in 2009 while importing US$24.5 billion-worth of goods from
there.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's list has three sections, said Shih. The first includes chemicals,
petrochemicals, plastics, rubber, textile fibers, and chemicals used in the
textile industry, the minister said.</P>
      <P>The second section includes iron, aluminum, brass, machinery, machine
components,  machine  tools,  machine tool components, automobile parts,
bicycles and bicycle parts.</P>
      <P>The third section includes electronic products,  electronic materials, and
several optical products.</P>
      <P>Various items not included on the list might be added in ensuing bilateral
talks, Shih went on, adding that negotiations on the text of the pact and its
five appendixes have almost been completed and that both sides are verifying
the content of the documents.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, he said, the pact will be signed in the next meeting between the top
negotiators of both sides.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan, who joined Shih in
the briefing, denied opposition parties' claims that the pact, once concluded,
will oblige Taiwan to open its market to all Chinese goods within 10 years.</P>
      <P>She said the pact has a termination clause that can terminate the agreement when
necessary, and that the market-opening process will take into consideration the
economic conditions of both signatories.</P>

      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) under the Executive
Yuan will present a blueprint of the country's economic development for the next
decade in September, a CEPD deputy chairman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hu Chung-ying said the blueprint, to be titled "Golden Decade National
Development Plan, " is being formulated mainly by the council, rebutting news
reports that the job has been farmed out to the Chung-hua Institute for Economic
Research (CIER), a private think tank.</P>
      <P>"Golden decade" is a term coined by President Ma Ying-jeou during an April 25
televised debate with opposition Democratic Progressive Party Chairwoman Tsai
Ing-wen on the government's proposed trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>The president instructed the CEPD to flesh his idea out with a detailed route
map and Hu said the CIER won an NT$8 million contract to simply round out the
blueprint with more ideas.</P>
      <P>"They will collect data and analyze it for the council, which is only a part of
the whole plan," he went on.</P>
      <P>The blueprint, which will cover the economy, society, the environment, culture,
politics and cross-Taiwan Strait ties, is meant to prepare the country for an
era that will follow the conclusion of the economic cooperation framework
agreement between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The council will seek public opinion about the blueprint through a series of
seminars, Hu said, adding that an ad hoc team in charge of the work met for the
first time June 11.</P>
      <P>The team is required to complete a draft blueprint which, after being approved
by the Executive Yuan, will be presented to the president in September, Hu said.</P>

      <P>People with depression should not stop taking their prescription medication just
because they feel their condition has improved, especially if they are still
displaying symptoms such as insomnia or shoulder cramps, a doctor warned
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hung Jin-yi, a psychiatrist at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Linkou,
Taipei County, said depression is more than a mental disease and is often
accompanied by chest distress, palpitations, muscle tightness and dizziness.</P>
      <P>"These physical symptoms stemming from depression are more difficult than mental
symptoms to cure, and patients who have ceased to take their medicine could
suffer a relapse when under stress, " Hung said.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by a research team at the Chang Gung Hospital
among 135 patients who sought treatment at the hospital for depression, their
physical symptoms are more serious than their mental symptoms such as anxiety or
melancholy before treatment.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, symptoms such as insomnia and muscle pain are no light matter," he
said.</P>
      <P>Huang also recommended that patients should take more exercise, as it provides
relief from both the mental and physical symptoms of depression.</P>

      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Shih Yen-shiang said Tuesday that the government will
adopt a "double engine" economic development model for the next 10 years, with a
special focus on re-energizing the traditional and service industries.</P>
      <P>"The next 10 years will be a key period for Taiwan in its industrial transition
efforts, " Shih said at a Taipei forum on investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shih mapped out three directions in which Taiwan's industrial adjustments could
rejuvenate the country's economy:</P>
      <P>-- Upgrade traditional industries by combining ICT (information and
communication technologies), design and brand strategies;</P>
      <P>-- Promote the newly emerging industries, including biotech, green energy,
tourism, health care, specialist agriculture and innovation; and</P>
      <P>-- Promote the service industries.</P>
      <P>Shih explained that the manufacturing industries in the past played the major
part in Taiwan's economic development, with the service sector in a supporting
role.</P>
      <P>However, Shih said, taking advantage of China's gradual shift from being the
"world's factory" to the "world's market, " Taiwan stands a good change of

      <P>There is no set timetable for the execution of the 40 prisoners on death row,
Minister of Justice Tseng Yung-fu reiterated Tuesday in response to media
questions on the government's next move following its April 30 execution of four
condemned convicts.</P>
      <P>"It is too early to talk about the issue now, as prosecutors are still screening
the list before they hand it over to an ad hoc committee under the Justice
Ministry that will decide what to do next," Tseng said in response to reporters'
questions.</P>
      <P>"I have no set timetable for the execution of the 40 prisoners on death row," he
said after a visit to Sijhih, Taipei County to see Wu Tong-yen, whose parents
were murdered in front of him in 1991 when he was six years old.</P>
      <P>Wu now suffers from muscular dystrophy and is on a respirator.</P>
      <P>The four executions in April were the first in Taiwan in five years, as an
informal moratorium on the death penalty appeared to be in place.</P>
      <P>However, the issue came to the forefront in March when then Minister of Justice
Wang Ching-feng said publicly that she would not sign any execution orders for

      <P>Wang was later forced to resign amid public outcry over her statement and four
prisoners were executed within weeks of the new minister taking office.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan also took steps to pass a law that would speed up the
process of criminal trials and limit the prosecution of criminal cases in the
courts to no more than eight years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GPT strives to take its place in Taiwan as a true green party</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/15/10  19:22:00</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Pan Han-sheng has become used to explaining over and over again that his Green
Party Taiwan (GPT) is a "real political party, " not just an environmental
protection group.</P>
      <P>When it not being mistaken for an environmental group, the GPT is erroneously
associated  with the pan-green affiliates --  the opposition Democratic
Progressive  Party (DPP)  and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU).</P>
      <P>This situation has long been a problem for the GPT, which is seeking to
establish its own identity and character, said Pan, one of the conveners of the
GPT.</P>
      <P>But recently, the party, which was founded in 1996, had an opportunity to polish
its image and highlight its agenda.</P>
      <P>Its success in hosting the second congress of Asia-Pacific Green Network in May
gave it a shot in the arm and a chance to appear in the global spotlight.</P>
      <P>The party is now pumped up and ready to take on political competition, Pan
indicated.</P>
      <P>"While the political environment in Taiwan does not favor minor political
parties, the GPT has reaffirmed its goal of making more of an impact through
elections and prove that it's more than just another environmental group," said
Pan.</P>
      <P>Pan, 40, will lead the way, competing in the year-end elections for Taipei  City
councillors,  making  his second bid in the Songshan-Xinyi district after a
failed attempt in 1996.</P>
      <P>The GPT's goals are inspired by the successes of green parties in various other
countries, he said.</P>
      <P>Although the GPT is yet to obtain more than 1 percent of the votes in any local
or national election, Pan said, it is optimistic that one day it will be like
the New Zealand Green Party, which has 9 seats in the 122-member House of
Representatives, the Australia Greens, which has five seats in the 76-member
Senate, or the Luxembourg Greens, which most recently won 15 percent of the
vote.</P>
      <P>Pan believes that the party will be able to ride the rising wave of
environmental awareness and take advantage of the growth of Taiwan's civil
society, leaving behind the bitter taste of the 1999-2005 period, when it was
practically inactive due to a lack of funding.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, candidates in local council and legislative elections are required by
law to each pay a deposit of NT$200,000 (US$6,195) to the Central Election
Commission (CEC). The deposit is not returned if the candidate fails to obtain
10 percent of the quotient obtained by dividing the number of votes by the size
of the district.</P>
      <P>In addition, political parties that fail to garner more than 5 percent of the
vote in the most recent legislative election do not qualify for the campaign
subsidy of NT$50 per ballot.</P>
      <P>In 2008, the GPT put forward 14 candidates in the legislative election, a move
that brought the party to the brink of bankruptcy because it spent millions on
the deposits and its campaign and did not perform well in the polls, Pan said.</P>
      <P>In the 2008 legislative election, the GPT gained 60,000 party votes, which means
it would have been eligible to receive a subsidy of about NT$3 million -- a sum
that is more than its annual budget -- if the vote threshold was scrapped, Pan
said.</P>
      <P>"However, none of the other political party are interested in amending those
laws," he lamented.</P>
      <P>The issue of having to worry about money is relatively new to Pan, who was a
researcher and fund manager at a security firm before he became deeply involved
in the GPT.</P>
      <P>Like most people in this type of job, he said, he would work under high pressure
for several years, then quit and go traveling and buy luxuries.</P>
      <P>"I never had problems finding a new job, " he said.</P>
      <P>In 2006, fresh from a vacation in Japan, he was recruited by the GPT to run for
city councilor, but his bid failed.</P>
      <P>That same year, two personal experiences -- the death of mother and the birth of
his daughter -- made him rethink his priorities, he said.</P>
      <P>"All of a sudden making money was not that important to me anymore -- I had a
brand new perspective on life, " Pan said.</P>
      <P>It was then that he made the decision to work full time for the GPT.</P>
      <P>These days Pan can be seen at protests and public hearings related to
environmental issues. He has also appeared on a television talk show advocating
the abolition of the death penalty, one of the main policies of the GPT.</P>
      <P>"Once you've chosen to take the path of politics, you have to do it the
'Taiwanese way, ' which means wearing a vest with your name on it, meeting and
talking to people and shaking every hand. And you have to get as much exposure
as possible, " he said.</P>
      <P>However, convincing people to vote for the GPT is not an easy task, he said.</P>
      <P>Most people support the party's position on the environment, human rights and
social justice, but at election time they usually vote for the major political
parties, Pan said.</P>
      <P>"When the independence-unification discussions heat up, swing voters tend to shy
away from the voting booths and that hurts the GPT because most of our
supporters are swing voters," he said.</P>
      <P>However, there are some glimmers of hope, he indicated.</P>
      <P>According to a public opinion poll, he said, the party's support rate now
exceeds 2 percent and if it can expand its support base from the 20-25 age group
to the 35-45 group, it could win a few seats in the year-end elections and go on
from there.</P>
      <P>He is of the view that Taiwan needs a party like the GPT to bring some balance
to the dialogue on major issues.</P>
      <P>"It  would  be a shame  if all the  discussions  on the independence-unification
issue should take place along party lines, " he said. "Those who care about
public policies and social issues should be able to speak out on behalf of the
people."</P>
      <P>For the GPT, party identity, funding and election laws remain big problems, But,
Pan said, the party is determined to continue on its chosen path until it can
claim its place as the only genuinely green party in the country. By Chris Wang

      <P>Local contract notebook makers Wistron Corp. and Compal Electronics Corp. said
Tuesday they expect shipments for the third quarter of this year to grow because
of lessening impact on global demand caused by the debt problems in Europe.</P>
      <P>Wistron Chairman Simon Lin said he expects notebook shipments for the third

      <P>Lin said that while the impact from the European crisis on demand for notebooks

shipments since the beginning of June had returned to normal levels.</P>
      <P>He added,  however,  that he was remaining cautious about developments, as many
market observers are holding a wait-and-see attitude toward the financial crisis
in Europe.</P>
      <P>Lin said that while sales to the eurozone have been affected, demand from the
Asia-Pacific region and Latin America has been on the rise, offsetting the
damage caused by the falling euro. He added that shipments for the second half
of this year are likely to see a rise of 20 percent from the first half.</P>
      <P>For his part, Compal President Chen Jui-tsung said on a separate occasion that
he expects his company's notebook shipments for the third quarter to grow 5
percent-10 percent from the second quarter.</P>
      <P>Chen said the company has not changed an earlier forecast of 50 million units
shipped in 2010.</P>
      <P>He said that as the high tech sector will soon enter its peak season that begins
in July, shipment growth in August and September will become more obvious.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Several carmakers interested in Taiwan investment: premier</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Not one but several foreign carmakers have expressed interest in setting up
factories in Taiwan, Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"More than one car company from countries including China have asked about how
to establish factories in Taiwan," Wu told reporters.</P>
      <P>He declined to name the companies, saying that their investment proposals had
not been confirmed, but industry sources named one of the companies as
Volkswagen AG, the world's largest car manufacturer.</P>
      <P>According to the premier, the signing of an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and China will give foreign companies greater
confidence in moving their factories or logistics hubs to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said that many Taiwan-
based foreign businesses have told the ministry they will have greater
opportunities to ask their parent companies to allow them to expand their
presences in Taiwan after the ECFA is inked.</P>
      <P>Foreign companies look forward to increasingly  intensified economic activities
between Taiwan and China as a result of the eased tension between the two long-
time foes, he said on the sidelines of a forum in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"This is of great help to them in managing their presences in the Asia-Pacific
region," he added.</P>
      <P>Asked, however, if there is a growing number of foreign companies stepping up
their evaluations of investing in Taiwan, Shih did not reply directly, saying
only that the ministry has been helping foreign companies better understand
Taiwan's investment environment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, speaking at the forum, Vice Economics Minister Francis Liang
described U.S., European and Japanese businessmen as being very interested in
how to strengthen cooperation or build partnerships with Taiwan to explore
regional markets, including China.</P>
      <P>He said, for example, that Mizuho Financial Group, Japan's second largest
banking group, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the ministry in
January this year, as "many Japanese businessmen can see Taiwan's potential."</P>
      <P>The MOU is designed to promote investment between Taiwan and Japan, as well as
help Taiwanese and Japanese companies invest in China or Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, according to the ministry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President clarifies stance on death penalty</HEADLINE>

(By S.H. Lee and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday Taiwan should first reduce the number of
death sentences in Taiwan as a means of gradually phasing out the practice in a
bid to stem controversy over the issue.</P>
      <P>Speaking to representatives of the Taiwan Alliance to End the Death Penalty at
the Presidential Office, Ma described abrogating the death penalty as "a world
trend" but said the government still needs to stick to the principle of rule by
law and carry out the executions of death row inmates until the practice is
legally eliminated.</P>
      <P>Saying that the abolition of capital punishment cannot be achieved overnight, Ma
contended that the government's policy is moving in that direction,  in line
with two non-binding U.N. conventions the government ratified last year.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a recent public opinion poll on the death penalty, he
pointed out that a majority of Taiwan's people remain strongly opposed to its
abolition -- a stance that has not changed since 1993, when a similar survey was
carried out.</P>
      <P>"At present, all the government can do is to reduce the practice of the death
penalty while raising the threshold for parole for inmates sentenced to life in
prison," the president explained.</P>
      <P>"I hope we can begin building consensus on the controversial issue starting from
there," he added.</P>
      <P>The death penalty dispute came back to the forefront in late March, when then-
Minister of Justice Wang Ching-feng was forced to step down from the post after
making it clear that she would not sign any execution orders for prisoners on
death row, as an informal moratorium on the death penalty appeared to be in
place.</P>
      <P>Her successor, Tseng Yung-fu, swiftly decided to carry out four executions in
April -- the first in Taiwan in five years -- provoking heated debate among
those for and against capital punishment and prompting the alliance to step up
the pace of its efforts to have the sentences of the remaining 40 death row
inmates commuted to life in prison.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Tuesday the
committee that will be set up after Taiwan and China sign an economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) will be totally different from the Joint
Steering Committee established by Hong Kong and China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China have agreed to set up an Economic Cooperation Committee (ECC) ,
composed of delegates from both sides, to handle follow-up negotiations and
arrangements related to the ECFA after it is signed.</P>
      <P>The ECFA is generally a framework agreement and much of it's contents will have
to be worked out through bilateral negotiations after it is signed, Lai told
reporters before delivering a report at the Legislative Yuan on the progress of
the latest round of formal ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>The ECC will serve as a platform for follow-up arrangements, just like the Trade
and Investment Framework Agreement between Taiwan and the United States, she
said.</P>
      <P>The ECC will definitely be different from the Joint Steering Committee (JSE),
which was set up on the basis of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement
between Hong Kong and China, in that Taiwan and China are to be represented
equally on the ECC while the JSE is between a central government (China ) and a
local government (Hong Kong), she said.</P>
      <P>Many similar bodies are operating between countries that have forged free trade
agreements, including the one between the United States and Australia, Singapore
and Japan, and Malaysia and New Zealand, she added.</P>
      <P>Lai dismissed criticisms that the ECC is just a cross-strait version of the JSC,
saying that such comments denigrate Taiwan's status.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are expected to sign the ECFA by early next month.</P>

      <P>The boy was born in a clinic at the end of May and developed a fever after being

    <TEXT>
      <P>China's landmark win over Taiwan in the group stage of the 2008 Beijing Olympics
baseball competition was a game in which the best team beat the best talent, but
Taiwan's baseball prowess cannot be denied, a former manager of the Chinese
national baseball team said Tuesday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Jim Lefebvre, who led China to a thrilling 12-inning 8-7 win in Beijing -- its
first ever victory over Taiwan in major international baseball competition --
said the game displayed the plain beauty of baseball because "that day the best
talent did not win. That day the best team won."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's group stage loss to China did not affect the final placing as Taiwan
ranked fifth out of eight teams and China finished in last place. However, the
upset loss was still described by Taiwan's fans as "heartbreaking, "
"unbearable" and "a national disgrace."</P>
      <P>"But it was just our day... I have no idea how we won, " Lefebvre said, drawing
laughter from reporters.</P>
      <P>Lefebvre, 68, recalled that Taiwan seemed to think it had sealed the game after
taking a 2-0 lead. But the game went into an extra innings and China scored five
runs in the bottom the 12th inning after Taiwan scored four times in the top of
the same inning.</P>
      <P>According to Lefebvre, Taiwan let the game slip away because of some tactical
and positioning mistakes late in the game.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's talent has always been impressive, but good talent doesn't always
guarantee a win, he said. He advised Taiwanese baseball players to learn "how to
play the game hard and play it right."</P>
      <P>South Korea, the eventual gold medal winner in Beijing, showed dedication and
commitment every time its players stepped into a ballpark and its "one-way
training system" was consistent at every level, he said.</P>
      <P>Given Taiwan's passion for the game and its rich tradition in the sport, it is
well-positioned to be successful internationally, he said. Local coaches have
been doing exceptionally well in the Little League level by teaching
fundamentals, he noted.</P>
      <P>Lefebvre, who managed three Major League Baseball clubs from 1989-1999 and the
Chinese national team from 2003-2008, held a six-day clinic in which he and
another MLB coach Rick Dell trained 60 coaches from local high schools and
senior-level teams.</P>
      <P>The clinic is a part of Taiwan's four-year Baseball Revival Program, which was
set up after Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball League was crippled by a
major game-fixing scandal involved dozens of active and former players and
coaches.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's "early harvest" list under its proposed trade pact with China is twice
the length of China's in terms of the number of items and four times bigger in
terms of value, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a brief to the legislature about the country's third round of trade talks
with China that took place in Beijing Sunday, Shih said Taiwan has listed 500
categories of goods on its list, with an annual export value of US$12 billion,
while allowing China to put 250 categories of goods on its list, with an annual
export value of about US$3 billion.</P>
      <P>Goods on the lists will be able to enter the other side's market with
preferential tariffs.</P>
      <P>According to government  statistics,  Taiwan exported US$62 billion-worth of
goods to China in 2009 while importing US$24.5 billion-worth of goods from
there.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's list has three sections, said Shih. The first includes chemicals,
petrochemicals, plastics, rubber, textile fibers, and chemicals used in the
textile industry, the minister said.</P>
      <P>The second section includes iron, aluminum, brass, machinery, machine
components,  machine  tools,  machine tool components, automobile parts,
bicycles and bicycle parts.</P>
      <P>The third section includes electronic products,  electronic materials, and
several optical products.</P>
      <P>Various items not included on the list might be added in ensuing bilateral
talks, Shih went on, adding that negotiations on the text of the pact and its
five appendixes have almost been completed and that both sides are verifying
the content of the documents.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, he said, the pact will be signed in the next meeting between the top
negotiators of both sides.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan, who joined Shih in
the briefing, denied opposition parties' claims that the pact, once concluded,
will oblige Taiwan to open its market to all Chinese goods within 10 years.</P>
      <P>She said the pact has a termination clause that can terminate the agreement when
necessary, and that the market-opening process will take into consideration the
economic conditions of both signatories.</P>

      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) under the Executive
Yuan will present a blueprint of the country's economic development for the next
decade in September, a CEPD deputy chairman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hu Chung-ying said the blueprint, to be titled "Golden Decade National
Development Plan, " is being formulated mainly by the council, rebutting news
reports that the job has been farmed out to the Chung-hua Institute for Economic
Research (CIER), a private think tank.</P>
      <P>"Golden decade" is a term coined by President Ma Ying-jeou during an April 25
televised debate with opposition Democratic Progressive Party Chairwoman Tsai
Ing-wen on the government's proposed trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>The president instructed the CEPD to flesh his idea out with a detailed route
map and Hu said the CIER won an NT$8 million contract to simply round out the
blueprint with more ideas.</P>
      <P>"They will collect data and analyze it for the council, which is only a part of
the whole plan," he went on.</P>
      <P>The blueprint, which will cover the economy, society, the environment, culture,
politics and cross-Taiwan Strait ties, is meant to prepare the country for an
era that will follow the conclusion of the economic cooperation framework
agreement between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The council will seek public opinion about the blueprint through a series of
seminars, Hu said, adding that an ad hoc team in charge of the work met for the
first time June 11.</P>
      <P>The team is required to complete a draft blueprint which, after being approved
by the Executive Yuan, will be presented to the president in September, Hu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Will cross-strait airfares fall?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/16/10  11:33:59
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese business people operating in China hailed the June 14 inauguration of
nonstop flight services between Taipei Songshan Airport and Shanghai Hongqiao
Airport, but many of them complained that the tickets were too expensive.</P>
      <P>Responding to the complaints, Minister of Transportation and Communications Mao
Chih-kuo said Tuesday that as Songshan Airport is positioned as a commercial
airport aimed at serving those who place a premium on convenience and short
travel times, this group of passengers will have to pay higher airfares.</P>
      <P>On other flight routes, however, Mao said there should be room for a downward
adjustment of ticket prices once the number of direct cross-strait flights are
raised later this year.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Mao said that once Songshan Airport's expansion project is completed next
October, it will be a "small yet beautiful" facility.</P>
      <P>Because of its limited space, Mao said, the airport cannot make major expansions
of its runways and terminals and will therefore not offer transit service even
after its renovation is completed.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, Songshan Airport will maximize its function as an urban
commercial airport by offering convenient and outstanding services," Mao
promised.</P>
      <P>To differentiate the airport from Taiwan's main international gateway, Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport, Mao said Songshan Airport will exact higher
aircraft landing and takeoff charges and terminal rentals.</P>
      <P>"As a result, passengers using Songshan Airport will have to pay higher ticket
prices," he contended.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Amid mounting complaints about a limited supply of seats and high fares for
Songshan-Hongqiao flights, TransAsia Airways (TAA), one of the three Taiwanese
carriers allowed to operate the route, launched a promotion drive Tuesday. It
said it still has seats available on flights until June 25 and is offering the
lowest possible round-trip fare of NT$13,700 until the end of June.</P>
      <P>Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)  Director-General Lee Lung-wen said he is
satisfied with the airline's pricing and will meet with executives of the other
two carriers serving the route to see if they will follow suit.</P>
      <P>But the other carriers said it was easier for TransAsia Airways to offer
promotional  discounts  because it operates only two Songshan-Hongqiao flights
per week. The other two carriers each operate six flights per week on the route.</P>
      <P>Airline executives also argued that the number of direct flights between
Songshan and two Shanghai airports -- Hongqiao and Pudong -- remains limited,
making it difficult for them to lower prices with the market entering its peak
season.</P>
      <P>They urged the CAA not to interfere with ticket pricing issues, insisting that
airfares should be decided by the market.</P>
      <P>They also pushed the CAA to step up preparations for the next scheduled round of
aviation talks with China in October to convince Beijing to allow a further
increase of Songshan-Hongqiao  and Songshan-Pudong flights. (June 16, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou attributed the relatively high airfares for Songshan-
Hongqiao  flights mainly to China's reluctance to increase the number of flights
local carriers are eligible to operate.</P>
      <P>In addition to lobbying China to agree to raise the number in the future, Ma
said, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications should see to it that
the Songshan Airport's first, second and third-phase  renovation and expansion
projects be completed in October, next March and next October as scheduled.

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Nothing wrong with graduation ceremony creativity</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/16/10  12:28:01
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prominent educator Lee Chia-tung who is now a senior adviser to the president,
recently criticized some schools for organizing graduation ceremonies that were
not solemn enough. He said the ceremonies should be like Nobel Prize
presentation ceremonies or a Catholic mass.</P>
      <P>Lee said one school principal, who danced Swan Lake in tights in front of
students and teachers at an event, went overboard in trying to get closer to his
students. But is it bad to have fun and be creative at events for young people?
It should also be pointed out that the Swan Lake dance was performed at an event
aimed at encouraging students to read and not at the school's graduation
ceremony.</P>
      <P>In June, many schools were seen as trying to hold graduation ceremonies that
would be memorable. A high school principal, for example, dressed himself as
Pirates of the Caribbean character Jack Sparrow to encourage graduates to
conquer all challenges in life, just as the fictional pirate did.</P>
      <P>We believe a graduation ceremony has many functions and is meaningful. Minister
of Education Wu Ching-ji said the occasion is a time for giving thanks, a time
when students can make public their feelings for their teachers.</P>
      <P>But in a society with diversified cultures, it is natural to have graduation
ceremonies with different styles. Why not have some that are fun? (June 16,
2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Liberty Times: Pitfalls in DPP-proposed cross-strait platform</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>The   opposition   Democratic   Progressive   Party   (DPP)
06/16/10  13:41:42
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>has commissioned a local think tank to craft a platform for engagements with
China's opinion leaders or academics.</P>
      <P>The DPP's primary goal is to have Chinese leaders hear opinions from Taiwan
other than those of the ruling Kuomintang. The initiative is positively
motivated, but it is unrealistic and could be detrimental to Taiwan's
development.</P>
      <P>As long as China does not abandon its intention to annex Taiwan, the DPP-
proposed  platform  would only give China yet another propaganda channel through
which to win over DPP politicians and other pro-independence activists.</P>
      <P>In reality, the DPP's plan is wishful thinking. For China, the DPP initiative
signifies a softening of its own core values, making it even more unlikely that
China will compromise on its fundamental principles. Instead, it will rigidly
adhere to its stance while waiting for the DPP to adjust its position on its own
to levels acceptable to Beijing.</P>
      <P>In the past, China used the same strategy to deal with the KMT, and the KMT
eventually dropped its anti-communism creed and accepted China's "unification"
overture.</P>
      <P>Even if China exercises flexibility toward the DPP proposal and such a platform
materializes, China may still use it to sow seeds of discord  within  the  DPP
ranks  and ultimately  weaken  the pro-Taiwanization camp.</P>
      <P>Worse still, the platform may offer chances for China to get involved in DPP-KMT
interaction and sink Taiwan into an endless war of attrition.</P>
      <P>As a democratic party, the DPP has limited power to regulate its members'
actions. Some of its members attended a China-organized forum last year and
criticized the DPP on the occasion, which was designed to push for cross-strait
unification.</P>
      <P>If the DPP platform comes into being, similar cases may happen often, which will
not only undermine the DPP's strength but will also affect local people's
confidence  in defending  the country's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>At a time when the KMT is colluding with China to sell their unification goal,
what the DPP should do is step up supervision, deepen democracy  and unite the
people to fight against  the unification goal. (June 16, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Financial services may enjoy 'WTO-plus' status under ECFA: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 16 (CNA)

(By Hsieh Chia-chen and Frances Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's financial services sector will be given "WTO-plus" status if it is
included on the early harvest list of a proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) to be signed with China, a top government official said.</P>
      <P>Talking to reporters Tuesday, Vice Premier Sean Chen said inclusion on the early
harvest list would give the sector access beyond that granted to the majority of
World Trade Organization (WTO) members under WTO guidelines.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China wrapped up the third round of negotiations on the ECFA in
Beijing Sunday, reaching a preliminary consensus on the content of the
agreement, including its early harvest list of goods and services that will be
eligible for preferential tariff treatment or improved market access.</P>
      <P>While Chen emphasized that the early harvest list has not yet been finalized, he
said some 500 items are expected to be included. But "the government is trying
hard to harvest a few more items, " he added.</P>
      <P>If Taiwanese banks are given WTO-plus status, they will be given preferential
treatment  by China compared  with their foreign counterparts, helping them
solidify their footholds in the huge Chinese market.</P>
      <P>He said that as many Taiwanese manufacturers have relocated to China, local
banks will be able to take advantage of the ties already built with these
companies at home to continue to serve them on the mainland.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, as the size of Taiwan's financial services sector is much
smaller than that of China's, the island is likely to impose necessary defensive
measures to shield the domestic sector from possible damage caused by
competition from China, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In terms of goods on the early harvest list, the major items Taiwan has so far
unsuccessfully vied to have included on the list are polyvinyl chloride (PVC),
polypropylene (PP) and machine tools.</P>
      <P>Chen said Chinese negotiators declined to make concessions on these items, in
which Taiwan is globally competitive, but he indicated the government would
continue to discuss them with Chinese officials.</P>
      <P>As for assembled vehicles, which were reportedly excluded from the early harvest
list, Chen said both sides need more time to negotiate how to deal with local
content and origin issues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Overseas study trend in 2009: fewer students, more countries</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei June 16 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of Taiwanese who obtained student visas fell by roughly 10 percent in
2009, but more students decided to expand their horizons to less conventional
destinations, according to the latest Ministry of Education (MOE) figures.</P>
      <P>A total of 33,339 Taiwanese obtained student visas last year, down from the
37,800 received in 2008, and there was a clear shift away from the United States
as an education destination.</P>
      <P>"Though the United States still remains the top choice for Taiwanese students,
the number getting visas to study there dropped the most last year, from 19,402
in 2008 to 15,594 in 2009, " said Liang Li-ling, a section chief in the MOE's
Bureau of International Cultural and Educational Relations.</P>
      <P>"I think the shift was mainly caused by the economic recession last year, " she
told the Central News Agency. Also, fewer students applied for loans to go
abroad for study last year, she said.</P>
      <P>Conversely, the number of students getting visas to study in Australia rose
sharply last year, from 2,370 in 2008 to 4,176, making it the second biggest
destination for local students, Liang said. Japan ranked as the third most
popular place to study abroad.</P>
      <P>"From the figures, we can see that more students prefer going to Australia as
well as some Asian countries due to lower school fees, " she said.</P>
      <P>Liang also pointed to the high quality of schools in those countries and the
increasing number of scholarships being offered as other factors in their
growing popularity.</P>
      <P>Among Asian countries, Japan is the top choice for Taiwanese students, but the
number of students going to Korea increased to 469 last year,  "probably
because  of Korean  movies and fashion influences," suggested one local student.</P>
      <P>The latest figures also indicate that more Taiwanese students applied to study
in diverse countries such as Italy (220) , Russia (143) and Switzerland (240).</P>
      <P>"It is good for our students to receive an education in different countries and
expand their views," Liang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Talks between Taiwan and China on a proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) in Beijing on June 12-13 finally produced a widely-anticipated
list of commodities  that will be given preferential tariff treatment under the
pact. Some 500 Taiwanese products were included in the so-called "early harvest"
list, as the government had expected.</P>
      <P>With China deliberately making concessions, Taiwan will gain greater benefit
from the deal, especially as the early harvest list covers only 200 Chinese
items, none of which pose a threat to Taiwanese agricultural and industrial
sectors considered vulnerable to Chinese competition.</P>
      <P>There is still a long way to go before the trade pact yields expected effects,
and we hope there will be more negotiations between the two sides in the future
on tariff reductions for products that were not on the initial early harvest
list.</P>
      <P>We also expect that Beijing will push Taiwan in the next round of ECFA talks to
open its markets more widely to Chinese products. If the framework agreement
means that all trade hurdles between the two sides will be gradually removed in
the future, we believe Taiwan's government and companies must prepare themselves
as soon as possible to maintain Taiwan's competitiveness in a completely
liberalized trade environment. (June 16, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>To encourage more efficient use of energy, Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) said
Wednesday that it is planning to install smart meters for 23,000 industrial
customers and 10,000 residential customers by 2012.</P>
      <P>Taipower said it has budgeted NT$1.7 billion (US$52.5 million) to deploy the
meters -- which can identify power consumption in more detail and communicate
that information back to the local power supplier -- for its 23,000 industrial
customers.</P>
      <P>The electricity  used by industrial high-voltage  customers accounted for about
58 percent of Taipower's gross power generation, the company said.</P>
      <P>The first batch of residential customers to have smart meters will include 9,500
homes in the greater Taipei area and 500 in outlying Penghu County, which the
government hopes to transform into the country's first low carbon island.</P>
      <P>If the program goes smoothly and helps promote energy efficiency, Taipower will
install smart meters for 1 million customers between 2013 and 2015.</P>
      <P>According to Taipower officials, the deployment of smart meters is expected to
generate considerable  opportunities  for local companies, including meter
manufacturers, communication equipment suppliers, and information and
communication service providers.</P>
      <P>Smart meters, which are already used in the U.S., Japan and western European
countries, measure energy consumption in greater detail, allowing utilities to
set different prices for electricity based on the time of day or season.</P>

      <P>The Taipei District Court has appointed three  temporary  managers  to take over
Taiwan  International Securities, marking the first ever government takeover in
the island's securities business.</P>
      <P>The district court said Tuesday it made the decision based on the Company Act as
the securities company has plunged into a power struggle after two factions of
its majority shareholders both claimed to have won elections for board members
and supervisors at the annual general meeting held last June.</P>
      <P>One faction was led by the Koo family, who run China Development Financial
Holding, and the other was supported by the chief executive of Taiwan
International Securities Group, Chang Ping-chao.</P>
      <P>Due to the election disputes, the Department of Commerce under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs declined to accept the list of newly elected board members and
supervisors presented by Chang's faction.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, China Development Financial filed a petition with the district court
asking it to hand down an injunction barring Chang's group from running the
securities firm.</P>
      <P>The district court said the management disputes have disrupted the securities
firm's day-to-day operations</P>
      <P>And even worse, as the firm is a listed company, the disputes have also affected
market order, it added.</P>
      <P>The takeover petition was initiated by a prosecutor at the Taipei District
Prosecutors' Office under the Company Act, which stipulates that if a company's
board members and supervisors fail or are unable to exercise power to an extent
to which they threaten company, the court may appoint one or more temporary
managers to take over operations.</P>
      <P>The three temporary managers include Chu Chao-chuan, a former chairman of the
Securities and Futures Investor Protection Center.</P>
      <P>Apart from the temporary manager appointments, the district has also issued an
injunction prohibiting Chang's son from exercising power as the company
chairman.</P>
      <P>Taiwan International Securities declined to comment on the ruling until
receiving a written decision, but said it will respect the court's ruling.</P>

      <P>Taiwan ranked as the sixth biggest net creditor country in the world in 2009
with record high net assets of US$620.7 billion, according to a report by
Taiwan's central bank.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's net assets, which grew by US$43.2 billion, or 7.5 percent, for the
year, trailed only those of Japan, China, Germany, Hong Kong and Switzerland,
said the central bank report, which was based on statistics from the
International Monetary Fund and other central banks.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's external assets rose 15.1 percent to US$995.7 billion, also setting a
record high, while liabilities totaled US$375.1 billion, an increase of 30.6
percent from 2008.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's central bank said the growth in external net assets represented
improving  foreign currency liquidity  and greater financial liberalization,
both positive indicators of the country's creditworthiness.</P>
      <P>Chen E-dawn, the deputy chief at the central bank's economic research
department, attributed the growth in Taiwan's external assets to increased

      <P>Tainan Magistrate Su Huang-jhih showed up Wednesday at the Beijing bonjour/Fabao
supermarket on the occasion of the Dragon Boat Festival, on a mission to promote
his county's Irwin mangoes to the residents there.</P>
      <P>Long lines were already waiting outside the upscale supermarket before 9: 30
a.m. in the hope of sampling and buying the mangoes from the southern Taiwan
county.</P>
      <P>At a special promotional session at the supermarket, Su said Tainan grown
mangoes are an "excellent delicacy" and he invited Chinese consumers to enjoy
the fruit from his county.</P>
      <P>During the special sales promotion, 3kg boxes of the fruit were being sold for
138 yuan each, while 5kg boxes were on sale at 399 yuan each.</P>
      <P>According to Su, he has been considering setting up distribution depots in
Beijing or Shanghai to make Tainan fruit and vegetables more easily available to
the Chinese people.</P>
      <P>Tainan County is the biggest mango producing area in Taiwan</P>
      <P>Su's plan is similar to a recent proposal by Yunlin Magistrate Su Chih-fen to
open boutiques in some of Shanghai's City Shop chain stores to distribute Yunlin
fruit and vegetables.</P>
      <P>However, Tainan County is reportedly targeting an upscale market in China and is
also assessing the feasibility of providing a home delivery service in major
Chinese cities for mango sales.</P>
      <P>In the last six years, Japan has been the major export market for Tainan's top
quality Irwin mangoes. Tainan County took the initiative to tap into the Chinese
market,  in collaboration  with the Uni-President Group, which already has a
distribution network there.</P>
      <P>Su is scheduled to return to Taiwan June 23 after wrapping up his first-ever
visit to China, which he described as an "ice-breaking" journey.</P>
      <P>Apart from promoting Irwin mangoes in Beijing and Shanghai, Su will attend
investment seminars with Taiwan businessmen operating in Shanghai and visit
their factories and the 2010 World Exposition there.</P>
      <P>The Tainan magistrate is the third county chief affiliated with the Democratic
Progressive Party to visit China, on the heels of Su Chih-fen in April and

    <DATELINE>06/16/10  16:55:09</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a classic case of East meets West, a French designer has joined forces with a
Taiwanese CEO to create objets d'art meant to open the eyes of the world to new
possibilities.</P>
      <P>About four years ago, French designer Jean Boggio's impression of china was
based on museum art works he had seen in his childhood, but when he met Francis
Chen, founder of Franz Collection Inc., his career took on a new dimension.</P>
      <P>Chen and his company hope to use Boggio's design talent to blend French taste
with Chinese design characteristics, creating delicately detailed tableware,
furniture and silk accessories featuring rich colors. When he first met the
designer, he knew he had found an ideal partner.</P>
      <P>"When I visited Boggio's studio in his hometown near Lyon in 2005, I immediately
fell in love with his works, " Chen told the Central News Agency at a press
conference in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Their cooperation began at once.</P>
      <P>The work of Boggio -- particularly his jewelry -- has gained unprecedented
popularity among porcelain collectors and designers, and his collection has been
exhibited in the National Museum of Adrien Dubouche in Limoges in France since
2007, according to the company.</P>
      <P>"Actually in the initial stage I was designing my works utilizing my imagination
about china, but when I met Chen about four years ago at the Maison &amp; Objet
in Paris, a French home-fashion trade show, I had a chance to see the real face
of Taiwan and China, and learn the technique of making Chinese porcelain," he
said.</P>
      <P>When he arrived in the East, he saw scenes that were totally different  from
his  imagination.  Taiwan  and Shanghai  were internationalizing, and were "even
more modern than most countries in Europe," he said.</P>
      <P>After he traveled to the company factory in Fujian Province's Xiamen in
southeastern China to work with craftsmen and embrace the skills of making
Chinese porcelain, his work started to change.</P>
      <P>"I have started to design three-dimensional works since I began to work with the
company, " he said.</P>
      <P>Originally trained as a goldsmith and silversmith, Boggio said he loves to use
his hands to make his works. "I design my work first on paper, then I make a
real one by hand," he said.</P>
      <P>The native of Lyon has also worked behind the scenes at respected tableware
companies such as Baccarat and Haviland, and also for luxury goods maker Les
Heritiers.</P>
      <P>From his workshop in the Beaujolais region, he now specializes in jewelry, a
passion of his since 1984, and has worked on the development of the "Jean Boggio
for Franz" brand since 2006.</P>
      <P>"So far I have made over 400 items for 'Jean Boggio for Franz' during this
period, and one of them -- "Extraordinary Garden" has opened the door for me to
the world design field, " Boggio said. The work has received rave acclaims and
many honors.</P>
      <P>Displaying his intense passion for design, the principal feature of Boggio's
works is the portrayal of the bright and colorful side of life, which is why
"collectors cannot resist his products, " the company said.</P>
      <P>"I expect to raise this traditional Chinese art to new heights, to show the
world the beauty a Taiwanese porcelain brand can reach through our cooperative
endeavors," Chen said. By Sunnie Chen, CNA staff reporter</P>

countries in the Asia Pacific region as their most desirable destination.</P>
      <P>The top two destinations for Taiwanese travelers are Japan, as indicated by 57
percent of the respondents, and China, selected by 27 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, Asia Pacific consumers are now more willing to spend
money on travel as the economy in the region has been rebounding, and one in
four consumers in the region is planning to take an overseas vacation in the
next six months.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was listed as the third most desirable destination among travelers from
Hong Kong, Singapore and China.</P>

      <P>Under the agreements, the U.S. partner will license and transfer its thin-film
technology to TSMC. In return, TSMC will provide a certain quantity of solar
modules to Stion using the technology, the statement said.</P>
      <P>"Working with Stion, TSMC gains a robust thin-film technology with inherent low
cost structure," Rick Tsai, president of TSMC's new businesses division, said in
the statement.</P>
      <P>"With  TSMC's  research  and development  capabilities  and manufacturing
expertise, we believe we can achieve long-term overall leadership in solar PV
solutions," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>TSMC is one of many Taiwanese high-tech companies that are eager to diversify by
entering the green energy sector in an attempt to cushion the possible impact in
the event of a foundry business slowdown.</P>
      <P>Last year, TSMC announced plans to acquire a 20 percent stake in Taiwan's Motech
Industries, a solar cell producer, and has also invested in the light-emitting
diode (LED) sector through a venture capitalist.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tickets for Agassi-Safin exhibitions to go on sale Monday</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A first group of around 8,000 tickets for two highly anticipated showdowns
between tennis greats Andre Agassi and Marat Safin in Taiwan in January will go
on sale Monday both online and at the promoter's offices in Taipei and Taichung.</P>
      <P>Agassi and Safin, both former grand slam winners and world No. 1s,  will play
best-of-three  matches  (with the third set a first-to-10-points super-
tiebreaker) at Taipei Arena on Jan. 6, 2011 and at Kaohsiung Arena on Jan. 8,
2011, in exhibitions being billed as the "Rise of Legends."</P>
      <P>Each exhibition will start with a warm-up set between two of Taiwan's top
players, Lu Yen-hsun and Jimmy Wang, and finish with a set of doubles between
Agassi, Safin and the two Taiwanese stars.</P>
      <P>The event's promoter, Integration Sports Inc., which is staging the matches for
an estimated NT$75 million, had originally planned to put on sale a first batch
of 3,000 tickets for each event.</P>
      <P>But strong demand compelled it to make 4,000 seats available from June 21 to
June 24 for each of the two exhibitions.</P>
      <P>"Most of the response we've been getting from people is that they're worried
they won't be able to buy tickets, " said Integration Sports CEO Jeff Hsu.</P>
      <P>He said the company has made a conscious effort to get tickets, priced from
NT$800 to NT$10,000, into the hands of true tennis fans, giving them an early
shot to buy tickets in person, online, or in groups.</P>
      <P>Some 1,500 tickets for each exhibition will be on sale June 21 at the company's
offices in Taipei and Taichung between 9: 30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m., and another
1,500 will be offered online on a first-come, first-served basis beginning at
9:30 a.m. the same morning.</P>
      <P>Though the first batch of tickets will remain on sale until June 24, Hsu
expected they would be gone before then. Each customer can buy up to 10 tickets
per purchase.</P>
      <P>The remaining 1,000 tickets will be reserved for groups buying more than 10
tickets at a time, which will also be handled online.</P>
      <P>"We've had a lot of interest from local tennis associations and schools wanting
to bring big groups to the events, and this way they'll be able to sit
together," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>When asked what would happen if one of the three categories of tickets did not
sell out, Hsu just laughed, saying he was more worried about disappointing
people who failed to get tickets.</P>
      <P>The balance of tickets for the exhibitions will go on sale through the ERA
ticketing system on Aug. 2. Taipei Arena will have a seating capacity of over
12,000 and Kaohsiung Arena of over 14,000 for the exhibitions.</P>
      <P>Hsu expects some tennis fans from around Asia will even fly in for the matches,
the first time two former No. 1s have ever played in Taiwan, and he said his
company plans to offer package deals (hotel and tickets) for that customer
segment.</P>
      <P>The order form for the online purchase of individual or group tickets, the
company's Taipei and Taichung addresses, and seating plans and ticket prices for
the two exhibitions can be found on the company's Chinese-language website,
http://www.integrationsports.com.</P>
      <P>Integration Sports had anticipated launching a dedicated website for the
exhibitions, but Hsu said it will not be ready until mid-July at the latest.</P>

      <P>A new theme park in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County that claims to be
Taiwan's largest is scheduled to begin a trial run on June 19.</P>
      <P>The park,  featuring themes from Greek mythology,  has 47 entertainment
facilities and is expected to attract more than 5 million visitors a year,
according to E-United Group, the owner of "E-Da" theme park and outlet mall.</P>
      <P>"We hope to build E-Da World into Taiwan's 'Disneyland, '" said Lin Yi-shou,
founder of the group, at a press conference on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin also expressed hope that the theme park's mascots, conceived by prominent
local designer Demos Chiang, will become as popular as Japan's famous mascot
"Hello Kitty" in the Chinese-speaking world.</P>
      <P>The amusement park, which cost about NT$30 billion (US$930 million) to build,
contains a big indoor park and some rides never seen before in Taiwan -- a
7-story freefall ride with seats angled at 45 degrees, a halfpipe-shaped "Big
Air" coaster, and an 18-story booster ride, according to the park's website.</P>
      <P>The theme park will be open from 9 a.m.to 9:30 p.m. Admission for adults during
the trial period -- which will run to the end of the year -- is NT$800, also the
highest of any theme park in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The adjoining E-Da World mall, which covers 190,000 square meters and consists
of 300 well-known worldwide brands, is expected to pose a threat to other
department stores in southern Taiwan, according to media reports.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Kaohsiung County government has approved an application by the
group's transportation subsidiary to operate bus lines between the Taiwan high-
speed rail station and E-Da World, which is located just north of Kaohsiung
City.</P>

      <P>Forty-six people who donated blood in the first six months of last year were
found to be HIV-positive, according to data compiled by the Centers of Disease
Control (CDC) under the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>After four of the donors were informed that they had HIV, which can lead to
AIDS, the blood donation centers lost contact with them, CDC Deputy Director-
General Lin Ting said in an interview with the Central News Agency Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fifteen of the remaining 42 HIV-positive donors later admitted to public health
staff in interviews that they knew they were at high risk for AIDS, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Three of the donors said they wanted to know whether they had contracted HIV by
means of blood donations, while the other 27 said they did not know before the
blood donation  that they were HIV-positive, Lin added.</P>
      <P>"It is deplorable that people at high risk for AIDS had knowingly made blood
donations, " said Lin. "In the interest of safe blood transfusions, this should
not be allowed to happen again."</P>
      <P>People at high risk for AIDS should seek anonymous screening, Lin suggested.</P>
      <P>An analysis of the data related to the 46 cases of HIV-positive blood donors
showed that 67.4 percent of them were between the ages of 20 and 29, and that
45.7 percent had contracted HIV through same-sex encounters, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Overall, the HIV-positive rate in screening tests carried out in the period
January to June 2009 was 4.48 per 100,000, as compared to 2.52 per 100,000 in
same period of 2008, Lin said.</P>
      <P>"Fortunately, all of the HIV-contaminated blood donations were intercepted after
the screening process and there were no HIV infections as a result of
transfusions from those sources, " Lin noted.</P>
      <P>The CDC has designated 22 public hospitals and three private institutions to
provide anonymous HIV tests, therefore, people at high-risk for the virus should
not try to get tested by offering to donate blood, Lin said.</P>

      <P>Despite calls to save Chinese white dolphins living in the water off Taiwan's
west coast, several lawmakers from the region asked environmental protection
activists Wednesday not to interfere with economic development.</P>
      <P>"Although environmental protection is crucial,  it is more important to carry
out a policy that helps local development, " Non-Partisan Solidarity Union
Legislator Yen Ching-piao said.</P>
      <P>Yen -- who doubles as president of Dajia Jenn Lann Temple in Taichung County,
one of the most important Matsu temples in Taiwan -- voiced support for the
construction of the Kuo Kuang Petrochemical Park on the mouth of the Jhuoshuei
River in Changhua County, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ignoring activists who say the over NT$400 billion (US$12.4 billion) project
will destroy the habitat of the white dolphins -- locally called "Matsu's fish,
" Yen criticized an Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) plan to build
a marine "ecological corridor" for the endangered species.</P>
      <P>Rather than spending NT$20 billion to NT$30 billion on the corridor, Yen said
the money should be used to help underprivileged people, he said.</P>
      <P>The dolphins, also known as Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, were listed by the
International Union for Conservation of Nature as "critically endangered" in
2008 after their number was estimated to have fallen below 100 off Taiwan's
western coast.</P>
      <P>Local fishermen call them "Matsu's fish" because they are seen most frequently
between March and April, when the birthday of Matsu -- the widely worshipped
goddess of the sea -- is celebrated.</P>
      <P>In addition to Yen, legislators from Changhua County, including Cheng Ru-fen,
Hsiao Ching-tien and Lin Tsang-min, have also said that local economic
development should be the priority.</P>
      <P>Knowing the project could create 20,000 to 30,000 jobs, 98 percent of residents
in coastal Dacheng Township support the construction of the industrial park,

    <HEADLINE>National envoys excited about World Cup, praise its power to unite</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/16/10  18:48:56</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa kicked off June 11, and diplomats posted
in Taiwan whose countries have qualified for the football bonanza praised the
event not just for being great sport but a unifying force in their countries.</P>
      <P>Honduras reached this year's World Cup for the first time in 28 years and only
the second time in history, and captured the imagination of the entire
population not long after a coup in June 2009 shook the Central American country
and created political upheaval.</P>
      <P>Marlene Villela-Talbott, Honduras' ambassador to Taiwan who has lived here for
eight years, told the Central News Agency that, "football in Honduras is more
than a national sport. It is a part of life."</P>
      <P>When Honduras punched its ticket to the World Cup in mid-October 2009, the shops
around the country shut down and the country's extremely excited citizens
celebrated for four days, Villela-Talbott said.</P>
      <P>Every time the national team plays, the 7 million people in Honduras pay
attention. "It is incredible how a sport, how our national team, a group of 11
players, can pull together a whole country," she said.</P>
      <P>The people's main form of support for the team is prayer, Villela-Talbott said,
and despite Honduras being a relatively small country, it is one department in
which it can compete with other nations around the world.</P>
      <P>"I think we make more noise than any of the bigger countries, " she said.</P>
      <P>Some may have felt that Honduras actually reached this year's World Cup through
divine intervention.</P>
      <P>On the final day of qualifying last October, Honduras defeated El Salvador 1-0,
but Costa Rica was leading the U.S. and was close to the victory it needed to
clinch a World Cup berth.</P>
      <P>But trailing 2-1 deep in injury time, the U.S. tied the game on a dramatic
header, sending Honduras to the World Cup and setting off celebrations in
Villela-Talbott's country.</P>
      <P>No less enthusiastic about football is Alfazazi A. Namairage, the director of
the Nigeria Trade Office in Taiwan. Namairage, who has been playing football as
a hobby for 18 years, said football is one factor that unites the whole country.</P>
      <P>When asked about why people in Nigeria are so fond of football, he said it dates
back to the country's colonial history, because football was introduced there
after Nigeria became a part of the British empire in 1901.</P>
      <P>"All the primary schools in Nigeria have at least one football playground now"
he said, and the government takes the sport very seriously.</P>
      <P>As a football fan and football player, he said there were no secrets to winning.
"Train hard and concentrate on the game" is the best approach, he said.</P>
      <P>Baba Masaki, director of the Cultural Section of the Interchange Association,
Japan, also holds a deep affection for football, having played the sport since
he was young, and he has seen the game evolve in his country and on a personal
level.</P>
      <P>Since Japan first made it to the World Cup in 1998, people have grown more
serious about training in the sport and becoming a football player has become a
dream for schoolchildren, Masaki said.</P>
      <P>For him personally, his greatest memory is not a goal by Japan's national team
or his country co-hosting the 2002 World Cup, but rather the evolution in his
thinking from treating football as a rigorous discipline to seeing it as a
source of enjoyment.</P>
      <P>When Masaki coached in Japan, he said, he adopted a strict approach and was
tough on young players when they did not play well. But after being posted in
Australia, he saw the power of positive reinforcement.</P>
      <P>At the first practice for young players, Australian coaches would place the ball
close to the goal and have children take shots and score goals.</P>
      <P>"Their smiles after scoring made Masaki realize that "football's happiest moment
is putting the ball in the net, " and from that point on, he saw the sport in a
different light.</P>
      <P>If a child's first experience in a sport is fun, Masaki said, they will enjoy it
for the rest of their lives. By Emmanuelle Tzeng and Maia Huang CNA Staff

      <P>Minister of Health Yaung Chih-liang gave an overview of Taiwan's national health
insurance system Tuesday to an audience of about 900 at a public health summit
in Chicago, Illinois, according to Taiwan's Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>Yaung explained Taiwan's mandatory health insurance system, under which the
government, employers and employees share the costs and he outlined the
government's role in helping the unemployed to obtain coverage.</P>
      <P>He also spoke of Taiwan's efforts to bring matters related to national
emergencies under the umbrella of the national health insurance mechanism.</P>
      <P>In his keynote speech, Yaung told the audience at the 2010 Illinois Public
Health Emergency Preparedness Summit that Taiwan has had two epidemics in recent
years -- severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and influenza A (H1N1)
in 2009.</P>
      <P>Because of the SARS experience, Taiwan was better able to handle the H1N1
outbreak, he said.</P>
      <P>He thanked the U.S. government for its assistance to Taiwan in the 1950s in
dealing with the threat of malaria and in setting up a valid public health
system.</P>
      <P>In particular, Taiwan is grateful to the U.S. for its help in the rescue efforts
after Typhoon Morakot devastated parts of the island last August, and for
sharing its knowledge in the development of an H1N1 vaccine, he said.</P>
      <P>In return, Taiwan is very willing to do its best to share its experiences with
the international community, Yuang said.</P>

      <P>A severed Chinese ink painting will be seen in its entirety at the National
Palace Museum next year after decades of being stored with one half in Taiwan
and the other in China, a visiting Chinese official announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"To boost cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges, the Zhejiang Provincial Museum agreed
to loan the piece of the 'Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains' that it keeps to
Taipei's National Palace Museum, allowing Taiwan's public to see the precious
treasure together,"  Lu Zushan, governor of China's Zhejiang Province, said at a
signing ceremony in Taipei.</P>
      <P>One piece of the famous Chinese painting by Huang Gongwang (1269-1354) of the
Yuan Dynasty is currently stored at the Zhejiang Provincial Museum in Hangzhou,
while a larger piece is kept at the Taipei museum after being brought to Taiwan
by the Kuomintang government when it fled the mainland in the mid-20th century.</P>
      <P>In 1347, Huang moved to the Fuchun Mountains southwest of Hangzhou, along the
northern bank of the Fuchun River, where he made a number of landscape
paintings, including "Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains."</P>
      <P>The entire painting combined would measure 691.3 cm in length. It was burnt into
two pieces during the reign of the Shunzhi Emperor (1644-1661) in the Qing
Dynasty. The two pieces became separated and passed through the hands of
numerous collectors and officials before landing at the museums in Taipei and
Zhejiang.</P>
      <P>"I hope some day soon in the future, the piece that Taiwan safeguards can be
lent to China for an exhibition of the entire piece," Lu said.</P>
      <P>National Palace Museum Director Chou Kung-shin, however, said her museum had not
set any timetable to lend out the work.</P>
      <P>In addition, she mentioned the need to sign a "guarantee accord" to safeguard
the return of cultural goods on loan to other countries, including China.</P>
      <P>Lu left Taiwan later the same day after presiding over the ceremony, in which
the two museums agreed to jointly hold an exhibition in Taipei from Oct. 8 to
Dec. 26 this year that will feature over 300 cultural treasures from China's
Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279).</P>

      <P>After a highly rated performance last year as the Phantom in The Phantom of the
Opera, Brad Little has returned to Taiwan with his latest show, Jekyll &amp;
Hyde, which will run from June 17 to July 12.</P>
      <P>According to the organizers of the new tour, what's exciting is that Little will
be working again with Ana Marina, the lead actress who played the role of
Christine Daae in The Phantom of the Opera.</P>
      <P>During a rehearsal Wednesday that was open to the media, Marina said she is
thrilled to play opposite Little again and to sing with him love duets such as
"Take me as I am."</P>
      <P>Marina explained that unlike the Phantom of the Opera, which focuses on the
monologue of the title role, there is stronger rivalry between hers and Little's
characters in the new musical.</P>
      <P>Taking a bite of a Chinese dumpling that was prepared by the organizers in
celebration of the Dragon Boat Festival, Little said Jekyll &amp; Hyde has
brought him more challenges because it is not only physically exhausting but
also vocally draining. as he has to distinctively interpret Jekyll/Hyde's life
and experiments with good and evil.</P>
      <P>However, Little said he is confident that the Taiwanese audiences will fall in
love with the show as they did with the Phantom of the Opera, not only because
of the music but also because of the plot, which he called intriguing.</P>
      <P>He said the show aims to reveal humanity and make people think more deeply.</P>
      <P>"It's all those dark secrets that everyone does not necessarily speak about,"
Little said, "I think the audience will love it."</P>
      <P>Little captivated audiences in Taiwan and elsewhere with his passionate
portrayal of the Phantom last year. During the 2009 tour of Taiwan, five extra
shows were added to the schedule because of the overwhelming demand for tickets.

      <P>A Taiwan magician has set up booking agency in Taipei, with an eye on
performance opportunities at a wide range of promotional events.</P>
      <P>Chou Tai-hsiang, the first Asian winner of the I.B.M World Champion of Magic in
its 73-year history, said that he decided to venture into the magic performance
market in view of the increasing popularity of magic shows.</P>
      <P>At present, the agency employs 10 magicians who will be assigned to perform at
about 1,000 promotional events in the near future, said Chou, who has reported a
personal income of NT$1 million per year.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, who is in his 30s, he also plans to visit universities to
scout for magician talent and aims to create a more magic-friendly environment
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>His long-term plans include setting up multi-national magician agencies, he
said, noting that there are some 200 agencies in South Korea where magic shows
are popular. Even South Korean heads of the state have attended the shows at the
Busan International Magic Festival in the past, he said.</P>
      <P>Chou holds a master's degree in arts management from the University of Greenwich
in London and has been called the best educated Taiwanese magician. He has won
numerous prizes in various world magic competitions since he entered the
business 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>He said he has been a fan of magic and has been practicing his skills for 10
hour a day since he was a student at Fu Jen Catholic University.</P>
      <P>After he graduated from Fu Jen, Chou said, he choose magic as his major at
Greenwich and was accepted as an intern in Britain's Magic Circle.</P>
      <P>When he returned to Taiwan in 2008, he turned down a job in sales and marketing
that offered a salary of NT$50,000 per month and continued to pursue a career in
magic, taking cues from South Korea's development of the industry, he said.</P>

      <P>Paper model guns created by an R.O.C. Military Academy cadet attracted
widespread attention Wednesday at an exhibition marking the 86th anniversary of
the institute in Kaohsiung County's Fongshan City.</P>
      <P>The exhibition featured vivid model guns made of paper by Kuo Chin-kai, a senior
student in the Department of Management Science at the academy, which dates its
roots back to the opening of the Whampoa Military Academy in Guangzhou, China on
June 16, 1924.</P>
      <P>The largest of Kuo's unique creations is a 20 cm model of the U.S. Special
Application Sniper Rifle, while the smallest is only 2.6 long.</P>
      <P>Kuo said his choice of materials plays an important role in making them
realistic. "I use a very special paint with a metallic shine to make them look
real, " he told Central News Agency by telephone Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"I started becoming interested in firearms at the age of 15 due to an enthusiasm
for shooting games on the Internet, " Kuo said. "My passion for light weapons
was further stirred after a model gun I made with paper and glue was highly
praised by a fine arts teacher, who gave me an almost full score for that
piece."</P>
      <P>Apart from the strikingly realistic appearance, Kuo's paper guns can be loaded
and even shoot. "It took me five years to develop a clip capable of loading
paper bullets, " he said.</P>
      <P>"My icon is Mikhail Kalashnikov, the Russian designer who devised the AK series,
" Kao said.</P>
      <P>He also said that someday he would like to see his model guns become models for

      <P>At a time when labor costs in China are rising, government officials in Taiwan
are calling on Taiwanese businesses there to relocate their production
operations back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In fact, Taiwan has been opening its arms to welcome the return of overseas
businesses for over a decade. Unless Taiwan becomes more attractive for them,
they will not necessarily come back.</P>
      <P>A possible solution is building a special economic zone in southern Taiwan that
duplicates the strengths of Singapore, including the city-state's convenient
living conditions and foreign worker policy.</P>
      <P>Overseas businesses would definitely scramble to move into this new oasis, which
would in turn boost domestic investment and create tons of job opportunities.</P>
      <P>In this special zone, where workers could live and work happily, no minimum wage
requirement would likely be needed. Because of intense competition among the
businesses in the zone, "blood and sweat factories" would also find it hard to
survive.</P>
      <P>Such a liberal economic zone would make Taiwan shine and open up a new epoch for
the country. (June 17, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Notebook prices likely to rise in Q4</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/17/10  11:08:59
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Steep wage hikes in China will eventually be passed on to end consumers as major
notebook original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have expressed their intention
to raise manufacturing prices and big notebook brands such as HP, Dell and Acer
are assessing retail prices for their new models to reflect rising costs.</P>
      <P>The notebook supply chain has faced three waves of price spikes since the
beginning of this year. In the first quarter, noted brand-name companies usually
absorbed increased costs as a result of soaring prices for DRAM and other
components as they were afraid that upward price adjustments could affect market
demand.</P>
      <P>Responding to a recent, dramatic depreciation of the euro, major notebook brands
have raised retail prices. Foreign market analysts said notebook prices may rise
further in the fourth quarter of this year due to the recent wave of wage surges
in China.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Major notebook OEM companies, such as Wistron and Inventec, have said recently
that it may be inevitable that OEM prices rise amid soaring wages in China.</P>
      <P>Several OEM heavyweights, including Quanta and Compal, are scheduled to hold
shareholders' meetings Friday,  during which production costs and price
adjustment issues are expected to be a major focus of discussion.</P>
      <P>Industry sources said OEM cost accounts for about 30 percent of notebook retail
prices, with wages making up about 10 percent of the overall cost. The effect of
wage hikes on the price of end products will be about 3 percent, they added.</P>
      <P>As major notebook brand companies are likely to raise prices in the fourth
quarter of this year when they market new models, OEM makers are scheduled to
negotiate cost adjustments with their brand-name customers in September,
according to the sources. (June 17, 2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Among notebook OEM makers, wage hikes in China will have a major impact on Hon
Hai Group -- the world's largest electronics contract maker -- whereas the
effect on other Taiwanese peers, such as Quanta, Compal and Wistron, will be
relatively limited, said Daniel Chang, Macquarie Taiwan's research division
head.</P>
      <P>According to his estimates, the impact of a 200 yuan increase in wages in China
on the four notebook OEM heavyweights' pre-tax profits would be 9.7 percent for
Hon Hai, 1.8 percent for Quanta, 1.6 percent for Compal and 2.8 percent for
Wistron.</P>
      <P>Chang further said that Hon Hai -- the parent of Foxconn Technology Group in
China -- no longer enjoys the benefit of low costs after its 122 percent spike
in basic wages for workers at its Chinese factories.</P>
      <P>As a result, Hon Hai is not expected to scramble to seize notebook OEM orders
with cut-throat prices, which will be good news for its major competitors, Chang
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, International Data Corp. (IDC) analysts predicted Wednesday that NB
prices will continue fall in Taiwan,  with mainstream prices ranging between
NT$20,000 and NT$25,000, down from the previous NT$25,000 to NT$30,000.</P>
      <P>Although standard notebook computers have reclaimed its leading place in the PC
market with the netbook fever fading away, the average NB price still saw a 3.2
percent drop in the first quarter of this year, the analysts said.</P>
      <P>According to the latest IDC quarterly report, the global PC sales posted a 27.1
percent year-on-year growth in Q1. It also forecast that the 2010 annual PC
sales growth rate will reach 19.8 percent, with a volume of 355 million units.</P>
      <P>The IDC further forecast a 3 percent increase in Taiwan's NB shipment in Q2.

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan-based Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Gou's recent decision to double the
wages of the company's Chinese workers is expected to lead to widespread pay
hikes in industrial zones along China's coastal region.</P>
      <P>Soon after the announcement, however, media have reported the group is planning
to downsize personnel at its coastal plants and move its production operations
to China's more rural areas. In this case, the pay hike trend started by Hon Hai
would have limited impact on the group itself and instead would make other
businesses suffer.</P>
      <P>Along with the accusation by more than 100 Taiwanese academics that Hon Hai is
operating "blood and sweat factories" in China, this is a sign that the group
lacks corporate responsibility.</P>
      <P>With the large size and huge profits of his business empire, Gou should be less
calculative and show more tolerance in order to reduce his conflicts with
society. A business owner who is only good at showing off his superiority and
pays no attention to others will definitely not be accepted by the public.</P>
      <P>We urge Gou to humbly accept the criticism by the academics. What Hon Hai is
lacking is not superiority, but empathy that a responsible business should
display. The problem faced by Gou today probably lies in himself, not society.

      <P>Taiwan International Securities said Thursday it will appeal a decision in which
the Taipei District Court appointed three temporary managers to take over the
company's operations amid management disputes.</P>
      <P>The district court handed down the ruling Tuesday, marking the first-ever
takeover in the local securities business after the company plunged into a power
struggle as two factions of its majority shareholders both claimed to have won
elections for board members and supervisors at a meeting last June.</P>
      <P>One faction was led by the Koo family, who run China Development Financial
Holding, and the other was supported by the chief executive of Taiwan
International Securities Group, Chang Ping-chao.</P>
      <P>Taiwan International  Securities  said in a statement  the appointments were
"illegal and unreasonable" and urged the court to cancel the decision.</P>
      <P>A company spokesman said that although last year's elections were in dispute,
its operations have not been affected, so it was unnecessary for the court to
step in.</P>
      <P>He said his company is currently run by the previous board of directors led by
Chang's son.</P>
      <P>The court said earlier that the decision was based on the Company Act and that
the election disputes failed to produce a valid management that could run the
company, undermining the securities house's day-to-day operations.</P>
      <P>The three temporary managers appointed by the district court included Chu Chao-
chuan, a former chairman of the Securities and Futures Investor Protection
Center.</P>
      <P>Following a request from China Development Financial, the court has also issued
an injunction barring Chang's son from acting as the company chairman.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan-based Hon Hai Group, traded as Foxconn overseas, recently decided to
double the wages and abolish survivors' benefits for its Chinese workers. The
measures may help prevent more worker suicides, but after Foxconn's  decision
it seems China-based  Taiwanese businesspeople will be more likely to want to
jump to their deaths.</P>
      <P>In the wake of Foxconn's announcement, Chinese employees of foreign businesses
have demanded pay hikes, leading to widespread strikes and labor-capital
disputes. Foxconn's measures have turned out to be a nightmare in which foreign
businesses are being forced to increase their labor costs.</P>
      <P>It is widely believed that large businesses such as Foxconn and Japan-based
Honda Motor will have the ability to transfer some of the increased labor costs
to their suppliers and move their production operations to more rural areas. As
for the many small and medium-size businesses, it is uncertain whether they can
do so.</P>
      <P>It is worth paying attention to whether a massive wave of business closures will
occur following the strike and pay hike campaign. (June 17, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Investors  usually  think  about  hardware  suppliers  and manufacturers when
speaking of Taiwanese companies that benefit from Apple's iPhone, but the
popular smartphone is also boosting the business of a recognition software
developer.</P>
      <P>Software company Penpower Technology saw its profit reach a record high in April
as most businesses still struggled to recover from the economic downturn in
2009. Even before profits spiked this year, the company's earnings had remained
steady regardless of the economic climate.</P>
      <P>"If there are five companies in the world that have remained focused on
recognition technology, we are definitely the most advanced among them, " said
Tsay Yih-tay, founder and CEO of Penpower Technology. "Even if major global
companies like Google or Microsoft want to set foot in the field, it's not
something achievable in one or two years."</P>
      <P>Tsay's Ph.D. thesis was on character and graphic recognition. He later founded
Penpower in 1991, focusing on handwriting recognition systems. The basics of the
technology are simple; the difficult part is collecting enough samples and
applying them to achieve a high accuracy rate.</P>
      <P>Penpower has a 96 percent accuracy rate with its Chinese handwriting recognition
software and a 95 percent rate for its optical recognition software. The optical
system is more technically advanced than the handwriting system and is capable
of reading information on business cards.</P>
      <P>In the past, Penpower's business was held back by the cost of developing and
selling hardware such as scanners and handwriting boards. With the touchscreen
smartphone trend following Apple's iPhone, Penpower gained a larger platform for
its core technology and can now focus on software.</P>
      <P>More than 100,000 downloads of Penpower's software have been made through Apple
online application shop App Store, which put the company on top of the download
charts in Japan, South Korea and North America. Licensing fees are another
source of income because handset makers such as Nokia, HTC and Acer all need the
technology to sell their smartphone in Chinese markets.</P>
      <P>As Penpower now has products featuring more than 20 east Asian and European
languages, Tsay said he is optimistic about expanding the company's markets even
further.</P>
      <P>"I want to prove that Taiwan can make it in the world with its software," Tsay
said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.82 percent Thursday as investors scrambled to
pick up large cap stocks amid improved sentiment after Wall Street's recent
strong gains, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 61.72 points to 7,515.78, after moving between 7,481.72
and 7,534.06, on turnover of NT$91.94 billion (US$2.85).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.66 percent on catch-up buying to chase Wall Street's jump
of more than 2 percent Tuesday, and while some profit taking emerged during the
trade, the early gains were sustained because of interest in buying low.</P>
      <P>The local bourse was closed Wednesday which was a public holiday.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,751 stocks closed higher and 1,102 lower, while 409 remained
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The plastics and chemical sector scored the biggest gains, up 2.0 percent and
the textile sector closed 0.9 percent higher. Cement, and the machinery and
electronics sectors both ended 0.8 percent higher, while the paper and pulp
sector gained 0.7 percent.</P>
      <P>The construction sector rose 0.6 percent, the foodstuff sector 0.4 percent and
financial shares 0.2 percent.</P>
      <P>"Market confidence is on the rise as the local bourse has posted consecutive
gains in the last few sessions, " said Grand Cathay Securities analyst Mars Hsu.</P>
      <P>Since June 9, the index has added 6.3 percent.</P>
      <P>"The expanded turnover indicated that more and more investors are willing to
trade instead of just staying on the sidelines, " Hsu said."A stable euro has
also helped to stabilize market movements on the receding effects of the debt
problems in Europe."</P>
      <P>Hsu said large cap stocks attracted buying as the industrial outlook for many of
them was positive.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, rose 1.14 percent to NT$62.10 and rival
United Microelectronics Corp gained 2.04 percent to reach NT$15.00 amid optimism
over sales growth in the global integrated circuit industry.</P>
      <P>Formosa Petrochemical rose 1.60 percent to NT$82.50 on high hopes that the
company will release a positive report at its annual general meeting scheduled
for Thursday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the market is likely to move in a narrow range over the next few
sessions ahead of the nearest resistance point of around 7,600.</P>
      <P>Bucking the upward trend on the broader market, China Airlines fell 0.95 percent
to NT$15.65 and EVA Airways finished 0.52 percent lower at NT$19.05 as investors
took profit from recent gains after new direct flight services between Taipei's

      <P>The office of former President Chen Shui-bian dismissed a report Thursday that
said he intended to vie for a legislative seat in a Tainan City by-election if
the incumbent lawmaker is elected Tainan mayor.</P>
      <P>"Whether it was well-intended or not, those who spread the rumor are unwise,"
said Chen Song-shan, director of the office.</P>
      <P>The Apple Daily reported earlier in the day that Chen Shui-bian was planning to
race in the by-elections if Legislator William Lai of the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) wins in the year-end special municipality elections on Nov. 27.</P>
      <P>The five municipalities in the polls will include Tainan City, Taipei City,
Xinbei City, Taichung City and Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Asked by reporters whether Chen's participation would hurt the DPP's chances in
the five special municipalities, DPP Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen said it was an
unconfirmed report and declined to comment.</P>
      <P>Tsai will represent the DPP in the mayoral race in Xinbei City.</P>
      <P>When asked whether she thinks Lai will try to gain support from local forces
through Chen Shui-bian, who is a native from Tainan County, Tsai said: "I would
respect Lai's decision if he did so and as long as doing so would help
consolidate grassroots factions."</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian has remained in custody at a Taipei detention center since
December 2008 after being indicted on charges of corruption,  forgery and money
laundering  during his two-term presidency. He was recently given a 20 year
prison sentence and a fine of NT$170 million (US$5.27 million) by the Taiwan
High Court -- alighter sentence compared with an earlier ruling from the Taipei
District Court, which sentenced him to life imprisonment a NT$200 million fine.</P>
      <P>The director for the former president's office said that some people may want
Chen Shui-bian to run for the legislature, but that "such unrealistic ideas
could hurt Chen's chance of being released on bail." "Chen Shui-bian was not so
foolish," he added.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said Thursday the party's central authorities have
not gained any information about whether Chen Shui-bian was planning to run in a
possible by-election.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Huang Wei-cher said that if Chen Shui-bian announced plans to run
it might hurt the party's election chances in northern Taiwan's Taipei City and
Xinbei City, but that the impact in southern Taiwan's Tainan City and Kaohsiung
City would be limited.</P>

flocking to see the "Five Wonders" -- the cloud sea, the sunrise, the sunset,
the mountain-climbing railway's unique "Z" switchbacks and spirals that are a
marvel of engineering, and the forests through which the railway line winds,
ranging from tropical to temperate and finally alpine.</P>
      <P>The Alishan Forest Railway, however, has faced a multitude of crises after
massive flooding and landslides caused by Typhoon Morakot last August damaged or
washed away tracks in more than 400 places, causing the closure of the line and
leading to a drastic fall in the number of visitors to the area.</P>
      <P>At Thursday's meeting, officials from the COA's Forest Bureau said the entire
71.4-km line is expected to reopen by the end of 2011 once all three phases of
railway repair are completed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu also exhorted the Forest Bureau to make greater efforts to ensure
that the Alishan Forest Recreation Park overhaul project, including the
construction of a tourist hotel in the park, will be completed by the time the
railway opens again.</P>
      <P>The Alishan scenic area is one of the top three "must sees" for tourists from
China, whose numbers are growing fast, making them one of the major sources of
Taiwan's tourists.</P>

      <P>Evergreen Marine Corp. said Thursday it expects to swing to a profit in 2010 as
the global economy is on the road to recovery.</P>
      <P>Evergreen Chairman Hsieh Chi-chien told reporters that the euro's decline
against the U.S. dollar has made European exporters more competitive but has
hurt demand from Europe.</P>
      <P>But the lower imports in Europe have been offset by demand for cheaper European
products and for cargo deliveries on European routes, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he is very upbeat about heavier shipping on European routes,
therefore, his company has shifted much of its delivery capacity to those
routes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, buyers in the United States have been building up inventory since the
fourth quarter of last year and demand from the U.S. has been on the rise, which
in turn has spurred demand for cargo delivery, he said. The strong shipping
demand on U.S. routes is expected to continue into the end of October as the
peak period for the high tech sector will start in July, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said his company is expected to post earnings in the first half of this
year and the outlook for the second half is even better.</P>
      <P>Last year, Evergreen Marine posted NT$9.86 billion (NT$306 million) in net
losses, as the world's external trade was seriously hurt by the global financial
meltdown.</P>
      <P>In the first quarter of this year, the company recorded NT$87 million in net
loss, which signaled an upward trend.</P>

      <P>Kinpo Group, one of the biggest electronics groups in Taiwan, will raise
salaries at its factories in China and is planning to establish new
manufacturing bases in central and western China, the group's chairman said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Rock Hsu, chairman of Kinpo and also honorary chairman of the Taiwan Electrical

manufacturing bases to be completed by the end of this year and to see the
results next year.</P>
      <P>The group, which includes the world's biggest contract notebook maker -- Compal
Electronics Inc. -- has four manufacturing bases in the Chinese cities of
Dongguan, Kunshan, Wujiang and Nanjing.</P>
      <P>Although the expected pay hikes will increase the company's costs, Hsu said
after a shareholder meeting of Vibo Telecom Inc., another of his group's
subsidiaries, that the group will be able to bear the additional pressure.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that in the face of increasing labor costs, his group will
continue  to put more effort  into developing semi-automation, which will mean
fewer jobs.</P>
      <P>Asked if the group will raise contract prices for its customers, Hsu replied
that this will not be easy to do, pointing out that in the past 30 years,
contract prices in the electronics industry have mostly dropped instead of
rising.</P>

      <P>This year's biennial Taiwan International Documentary Festival (TIDF) has
received more than twice the number of entries compared to the last festival in
2008, organizers said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The organizers said the festival is aimed at promoting dialogue between
international and local documentary filmmakers, as well as introducing the
"Taiwanese spirit" to the world.</P>
      <P>According to festival director Angelika Wang, there have been 1,468 pieces
submitted from 93 countries this year, compared to 618 pieces in 2008.</P>
      <P>She said the growth rate shows there is global recognition of Taiwan's efforts
to stimulate exchanges of perspectives and added that the event will help
broaden the horizons of Taiwanese audiences.</P>
      <P>"A nation without documentaries is like a family without photo albums," said
Wang.</P>
      <P>To promote media literacy among the public, the TIDF also works with the
Ministry of Education and Shih Hsin University to organize activities for
children.</P>
      <P>For example, the "My Doc" competition invites elementary and junior high school
students nationwide to shoot films about their lives and how they see the world.</P>
      <P>Chen  Ching-ho,  dean  of the College  of Journalism  and Communications at Shih
Hsin University, said it is this kind of "soft power" from the grassroots that
the organizers hope to promote.</P>
      <P>"We want the world to know that warm relationships among humans is what really
matters in our society," he said.</P>
      <P>Now in its seventh  edition,  TIDF  is the second-largest documentary festival
in Asia, showing about 120 works and attracting around 60,000 people each year.</P>
      <P>The 2010 TIDF will take place Oct. 22-31 at the National Taiwan Museum of Fine

      <P>Taiwan has pulled eight motion pictures from the Shanghai International Film
Festival 2010 after a Taiwanese TV series that was shown at the recent Shanghai
TV Festival was identified as originating in "Taiwan, China, " Taipei City
officials visiting Shanghai confirmed Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Hsiao-yun, director of Taipei City's Department of Cultural Affairs, said
the Taipei Film Commission decided last week to withdraw the eight Taiwanese
movies from the June 12-20 film festival over concerns a similar situation would
occur.</P>
      <P>A "Taipei Night" activity -- part of Taipei Cinema Week, originally slated for
June 14-19 in Shanghai -- was also canceled. Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin and
Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng had been scheduled to attend, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Deputy Mayor Lee Yong-ping said that Taipei expressed its concerns
over the issue as early as two years ago.</P>
      <P>She said that Taipei had demanded in negotiations with Shanghai that Taiwan-
originating video and multimedia products be identified as being from "Taipei"
and that Shanghai officials had agreed.</P>
      <P>Shanghai, however, reneged on its promise when the Taiwanese TV series was not
identified at the June 8-10 TV festival as originating in "Taipei" as requested.</P>
      <P>Responding to Taipei's questions about what happened at the TV festival,
Shanghai officials said the decision was not up to the event's organizers.
Rather, they said, it was the responsibility of the State Administration of
Radio, Film and Television in Beijing, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>Taipei has expressed its discontent over the issue to Beijing's Taiwan Affairs
Office of the State Council, but the complaint fell on deaf ears, she said.</P>
      <P>The eight feature films are "Monga," "Au Revoir Taipei," "Hear Me, More Than
Close," "Orz Boys," "Yang Yang," "Three Times" and "Tonight Nobody Goes Home."</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Thursday that the 2010 Shanghai  Taipei Cultural
and Creative Industry Exposition is the largest show of its kind and he is
pleased that it has brought together representatives from the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>At the formal opening of the expo, Hau said Taipei is a small city compared to
Shanghai or Beijing, but it is an exquisite city and has a vibrant cultural
industry.</P>
      <P>In particular, Taipei's pop music and fashion have become the standard for
Chinese communities around the world, Hau said.</P>
      <P>Hau noted that there have been some successful crossovers in the field,
especially in the areas of high technology and culture.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, Taiwan's Pili puppet show, which uses state-of-the-art
animation in its presentation of martial arts, has many fans in China.</P>
      <P>A total of 116 companies from Taipei are exhibiting their products at the
exposition that is being held at the Shanghaimart until June 20. They are
expected to attract over NT$200 million worth of business opportunities.</P>
      <P>The expo, which is also being attended by Taipei City Deputy Mayor Lee Yong-
ping, gives Taipei a chance to display its products, from artifacts to high-end
fashion.</P>
      <P>The major purpose of the exhibition is to provide a more effective platform for
small innovative cultural businesses from Taiwan to build an image and
distribute their products in China.</P>
      <P>Most Taiwanese companies of this kind in Shanghai usually promote their products

      <P>The chief executive of Formosa Plastics Group,  Taiwan's largest petrochemical
conglomerate,  expressed disappointment  Thursday that the petrochemical sector
was not included on the "early harvest" list under a proposed trade pact with
China.</P>
      <P>Wang Wen-yuan urged the government to pay more attention to the old economy
industries and continue efforts to support the sector by winning consensus with
China to include the petrochemical sector on Taiwan's list of items and services
that will enjoy tariff waivers or an easier market access upon the signing of
the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China wrapped up the third round of ECFA negotiations Sunday and
reached consensus on the context of the pact, including the "early harvest"
lists of each side.</P>
      <P>A government official who demanded anonymity had said earlier this week that
polyvinyl chloride and polypropylene have been excluded from the "early harvest"
list.</P>
      <P>Wang Wen-chao, chairman of Formosa Petrochemical Corp., said the government
cannot afford to ignore the petrochemical sector any longer, as Taiwan's rivals
such as South Korea and Japan are expanding their production capacities.</P>
      <P>He said South Korea has boosted its annual ethylene production to 7 million
tons, while Taiwan can produce just 4 million tons a year.</P>

      <P>Innovation and quality have made Taiwan's solar products world famous, the
Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"We might not beat China on pricing, but we definitely exceed other Asian
countries in innovation and quality, " said Terry Shao, a TAITRA project manager
who expressed confidence and optimism about Taiwan's solar industry.</P>
      <P>This year, TAITRA led 23 Taiwanese companies that participated in Intersolar
Europe, the world's largest exhibition for the solar industry, which took place
at the New Munich Trade Fair Center in Germany June 9-11.</P>
      <P>Shao said the local companies took advantage of the show to showcase their
latest solar products to the world. BIG SUN Energy Technology Inc., for example,
released a solar cell with an equivalent conversion efficiency of as much as
18.4 percent, which, according to the company, is the most efficient on the
market.</P>
      <P>According to Shao, the Taiwan Pavilion at the fair attracted some 1,769 visitors
and yielded on-site business of US$237 million, up from last year's US$135
million, and the companies expect this year's show to generate almost US$1.1
billion within a year.</P>
      <P>He added that market demand is not dropping, even though the German government
is likely to cut solar subsidies in July.</P>
      <P>The three-day expo attracted a record high of about 72,000 visitors from around
150 countries.</P>

      <P>Former Yuanta Financial Holding President Ma Wei-chien said at a court hearing
Thursday that he kept NT$740 million (US$ 23 million) for ex-President Chen
Shui-bian "out of sympathy" for Chen.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted Dec. 24, 2009 along with 22 others for helping Chen conceal
funds accumulated through corruption.</P>
      <P>The son of Yuanta Financial Holding's founder Rudy C.L. Ma told the Taipei
District Court that Chen's wife Wu Shu-jen asked her brother Wu Ching-mao and Tu
Li-ping, a former director of the board of Yuanta, to carry seven or eight
trunks to his Taipei residence one day in 2006 and asked him to keep the trunks
in his private vault in his basement.</P>
      <P>Ma said he asked Wu Ching-mao, whom he did not know, what was in the trunks, to
which the latter responded "cash."</P>
      <P>Ma said that when he hesitated about whether to grant the request, Wu Ching-mao
pleaded with him, saying that the money was to provide for Chen's living
expenses after retirement.</P>
      <P>Ma said he agreed to keep the trunks and confirmed with Wu Ching-mao that they
contained NT$740 million.</P>
      <P>Ma told the court that he asked Tu the next day "why she put me to such trouble,
" whereupon Tu told him that she thought the trunks contained documents about
forming an independent Taiwan because Wu Shu-jen told her there were secret
documents in them.</P>
      <P>"Tu was glad she thought she was doing something to help with the cause of
Taiwan independence," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors
Office announced that another US$1 million in funds stashed by the ex-first
family in banks in Switzerland had been wired back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The latest remittance brought to US$ 13.51 million the amount of funds Chen's
family had wired from Switzerland to Taiwan, with a further US$7 million left in
two Swiss bank accounts.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division, which is leading the probe into the ex-first
family's alleged corruption, believes the money was illegally obtained by Chen
and is seeking to confiscate it.</P>
      <P>The former president and his wife have already been sentenced to 20 years in
jail for corruption by the Taiwan High Court in another case.</P>

      <P>The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) under the Executive Yuan said Thursday that it
will investigate whether local air carriers have formed cartels to hike fares,
in response to controversy over what critics have described as excessively high
ticket prices on direct cross-Taiwan Strait routes.</P>
      <P>The commission's  comments came in the wake of passengers complained that ticket
prices for flights between Taipei's Songshan Airport and Shanghai's Hongqiao
Airport are too high.</P>
      <P>Carriers found guilty of price fixing or other cartel behavior in violation of
the Fair Trade Law will face fines of between NT$50,000 (US$1,500) and NT$25
million, according to the commission.</P>
      <P>The FTC said that as there are big price discrepancies between different ticket
types from different ticket distribution channels, consumers should take this
into account when purchasing tickets for direct flights to China.</P>
      <P>Deputy Minister  of Transportation  and Communications  Yeh Kuang-shih said
airline pricing is a complex problem and that at present, the high air fares on
the cross-strait routes are the result of market demand surpassing supply.</P>
      <P>He added that the ministry will communicate with carriers in an effort to
persuade them to cut prices, although he admitted that the ministry has no
authority to intervene.</P>
      <P>Lee  Long-wen,  director-general  of the  ministry's  Civil Aeronautics
Administration, said he will discuss the matter with airline companies within
the next two days.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, representatives of local carriers called on the government to allow
fares to be decided by market forces and said that as cross-strait direct
flights are considered international flights, there is no need for fares on the
routes to be scrutinized by the aviation regulator.</P>
      <P>Currently, three Taiwanese carriers operate direct flghts between Songshan
Airport and Hongqiao Airport, all of which are offering discount tickets until
the end of June.</P>
      <P>Round-trip fares charged June 14, when the direct flights were launched,  were
roughly NT$13,000-NT$17,000,  according to data provided by airline companies,
with prices expected to increase to NT$17,000-NT$20,000 over the next three
months.</P>

      <P>The planned economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China will, if
signed, enable Taiwan to "resume its status as a regional hub, " Vice Economics
Minister Francis Kuo-hsin Liang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>He did not elaborate on when in the past Taiwan was ever a regional hub.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting of the Importers and Exporters Association of Taipei,
Liang said Taiwan and China are now close to signing the long-anticipated pact
that the government hopes will open a new era in which many products will enjoy
preferential tariffs or greater market access.</P>
      <P>"Many businesses, whether they are Taiwanese operating in China, Americans,
Europeans or Japanese, share the feeling that Taiwan will soon play a more major
role on the world stage and will turn into a regional hub after the ECFA
signing," Liang said.</P>
      <P>An upcoming visit to Taiwan by a group of representatives of around 10 Japanese
small- and medium-sized enterprises seeking cooperative relations with their
local counterparts is "just one example" of the increasing interest in Taiwan,
according to Liang.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan advanced to eighth place in the latest world
competitiveness yearbook of the Switzerland-based IMD (International Institute
for Management Development) from 23rd a year ago, but it ranked 104th in the
"market access" sub-index of the World Economic Forum's (WEF's) 2009-2010 world
competitive report.</P>
      <P>"The reason Taiwan was given such a low WEF ranking is that the country has
forged only a limited number of free trade agreements (FTAs) with foreign
countries," Liang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has inked FTAs with only five Central American countries, which have a
combined 0.187 percent share of Taiwan's global exports.</P>
      <P>According to Liang,  the ECFA will help Taiwan break its bottleneck in signing
FTAs with major economic players worldwide.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese and Chinese negotiators concluded their latest formal round of ECFA
talks in Beijing last Sunday, and Taipei officials said the pact is likely to be
inked by early next month.</P>

      <P>Kinmen Magistrate Lee Wo-shih presided over a seminar on the former frontline
island Thursday to map out plans to turn the island into a low carbon county.</P>
      <P>Lee told participants at the seminar, including township chiefs and senior
county officials that Kinmen has been chosen by the Environmental Protection
Administration as one of six counties to be developed into low-carbon examples
by 2014.</P>
      <P>He said that cutting carbon emissions is a global trend and that the selection
of Kinmen as one of the country's first low carbon counties bears out the
importance the central government attaches to the island county.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Environmental Protection Administration will hold a public
contest to choose a comprehensive carbon development plan for the county, Lee
urged local officials to come up with their own suggestions about the
development instead of relying solely on the central government for planning.</P>
      <P>The seminar produced 36 suggestions in the fields of renewable energy, energy
efficiency, green transport, resource recycling, low-carbon building and
greening of the environment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Legislative Speaker Tseng Yung-chuan suggested Thursday in Hong Kong that
Taiwan and Hong Kong set up reciprocal representative  offices to promote
bilateral relations under the recent detente between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Tseng, who is also vice chairman of the ruling Kuomintang, broached the idea in
a speech at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University on the development of Taiwan-
Hong Kong ties amid new trends in cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>During the speech,  Tseng traced the dramatic  changes in cross-strait relations
in recent years, mentioning the resumption of talks between the KMT and the
Chinese Communist Party in 2005, the launch of weekend cross-strait passenger
charter services in July 2008 and Taiwan's opening to Chinese tourists in 2009.</P>
      <P>He also said Hong Kong, as an intermediary between Taiwan and China, has
contributed a lot to the promotion of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>However, the public will be interested to know whether Hong Kong's intermediary
role will change at a time when relations between Taiwan and China are improving
and a proposed cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement is about to
be signed, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>Tseng suggested that Taiwan transform its Mainland Affairs Council's Hong Kong
office, referred to as the Chung Hwa Travel Service, into an economic and
cultural office and agree to allow Hong Kong to set up a representative office
in Taiwan at the same level.</P>
      <P>He said both sides should also work to strengthen exchanges through the Hong
Kong-Taiwan Economic and Cultural Co-operation and Promotion Council and the
Taiwan-Hong Kong Economic and Cultural Co-operation Council-- the civic
organizations authorized by the two governments to hold dialogue and sign pacts.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Tseng proposed that Taiwan and Hong Kong negotiate agreements in the
areas of economics and trade, navigation rights, medicine and public health and
civilian engagements.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Growth of China's service sector will benefit Taiwan: expert</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China's economic growth will be driven by its service sector rather than its
manufacturing industry, and Taiwan will benefit hugely from this development, an
expert from a U.S. financial services firm said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The China of tomorrow is not going to be the China of today, " said Stephen
Roach, chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, at an economic forum in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"It's going to be a consumer-led China, a services-led China," he said.  "There
is enormous  opportunity  for a forward-looking, China-centered externally
oriented economy like Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been successful in developing its service expertise in the past
years, he said.</P>
      <P>However, San Gee, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) , said that there are obstacles to Taiwanese companies
entering China's service industry.</P>
      <P>"Nowadays,  China cherishes the development of its service industry very, very
much, " San said during a panel discussion at the forum. "China also protects
its service industry in some ways."</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's strength in the service industry is evident in operations such
as RT-Mart, which is owned by the Ruentex Group that has become the biggest
chain retailer in China, he said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he said, Taiwan needs to negotiate with China to remove the
existing barriers.</P>
      <P>"There are many issues that need to be negotiated with mainland China so that
our service industry can have a fair chance to develop there," he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to conclude a pact with China in the next few weeks to
further liberalize trade between the two sides.</P>
      <P>China has reportedly agreed to open to Taiwan's air cargo, computer, and
financial services, among others, during the first stage of liberalization. The
details of that aspect of the agreement have not yet been made public.</P>
      <P>At the forum, Victor Kung, president of Taiwan's Fubon Financial Holding Co.,
said that because of the competitive environment in Taiwan,  domestic financial
companies  are not afraid to face competition from China.</P>
      <P>"We have a highly competitive financial services industry in Taiwan," he said.
"Although Chinese financial companies are very big, they are actually in a very
well protected environment, therefore, we are not afraid of them."</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP wants ECFA be carefully screened in legislature</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Thursday that it
will not rule out the possibility of resorting to "radical protests" if the
government fails to have a proposed trade deal with China carefully screened by
the legislature.</P>
      <P>"If the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) is not screened clause
by clause on the legislative floor, then we will take whatever radical means
necessary to safeguard the rights of the people," DPP legislative caucus whip
Huang Wei-cher said.</P>
      <P>Huang however, did not elaborate on what means his party might take against what
it alleges will be a review of the pact by the legislature that will pay only
lip service to the idea of robust scrutiny.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are expected to sign the ECFA by early next month after the
negotiators for the two sides concluded a third formal round of talks in Beijing
last Sunday.</P>
      <P>The caucus of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , which dominates the 113-seat
Legislative Yuan, said that only law and budget bills are entitled to three
legislative reading processes under the law governing the operation of the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>As it is only a quasi-treaty, however, the ECFA only needs to go through two
readings, according to the KMT caucus.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers on the relevant committees can "generally discuss the pact on a 'yes-
or-no' basis, while at the whole legislative session can express approval or
disapproval of the pact as a single package, the caucus said.</P>
      <P>"It took half a year for the U.S. Congress to screen the content of the free
trade agreement that county signed with South Korea, and requiring the
Legislative Yuan to decide the fate of the ECFA in just seven days and by means
of saying simply 'yes' or `no' would be tantamount to willfully and
unscrupulously trampling on the rights of the people," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Reports have circulated that the Legislative Yuan will call for a seven-day
additional session to scrutinize the ECFA once it is signed.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Twu Shiing-jer said screening the ECFA as a single package would
be a "fake screening" that would undermine Taiwan' s democracy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Negotiations on the "early harvest" lists under the proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China have not finished and local
petrochemical products and machine tools are sure to be added, Minister of
Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>However, the minister refused to be nailed down on whether he was referring to
polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) which make up the bulk of the
country's petrochemical exports to China, saying that he would not talk about
specific items.</P>
      <P>The major part of the "early harvest" lists have already been sealed in the
third round of trade talks between Taipei and Beijing last Sunday. Taiwan has
500 items on its list, compared with 250 items on the Chinese side.</P>
      <P>However, local petrochemical and machine tool producers were disappointed to
learn that their products were excluded from the list after being rejected by
Beijing.</P>
      <P>They had been strenuously lobbying the government in the ensuing days for their
inclusion on the list, especially the producers of PP and PVC, as their
Singapore competitors already have tariff-free access to China under a free
trade agreement between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.</P>
      <P>Government officials have tried to calm them down by saying that the
negotiations on the "early harvest list" -- lists compiled by each side of
products that will enjoy preferential tariff treatment as soon as the pact is
sealed -- have not yet been completed and that more products could be added to
it.</P>
      <P>Shih reiterated that line in his response to questions about the anger in some
industries, saying that it is "an international practice" that products on each
list will account for no more than 5 percent of each country's exports.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has exceeded that level by far, so some products not included on the
list will be discussed in follow-up negotiations within six months," the
minister said.</P>
      <P>The agreement is expected to be inked later this month or early July.</P>

      <P>Three domestic carriers announced Thursday that they will cut prices on online
ticket sales for direct flights to and from Shanghai by between 10 percent and
30 percent from July.</P>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL) , TransAsia Airways and EVA Air, which operate direct
flights between Taipei's  Songshan  Airport and Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport,
made the decision after being persuaded by the Civil Aeronautic Administration
(CAA) during a meeting earlier that day, according to CAA Director-General Lee
Long-wen.</P>
      <P>The CAA convened the meeting in the wake of passenger complaints that ticket
prices for flights between the two airports are too high.</P>
      <P>Direct flights between Taiwan and Shanghai airports -- Hongqiao and Pudong --
are the most popular among all cross-Taiwan Strait flight routes, and tickets
with validity periods of 14 days and one month are in heaviest demand, according
to CAA data.</P>
      <P>Lee said that operators of all three carriers acknowledged that fares on the
Songshan-Pudong route and the route between Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
and Pudong Airport should not be higher than those on the Songshan-Hongqiao
route.</P>
      <P>CAL announced it will cut its ticket prices for flights between Songshan and
Hongqiao by 10 percent, with 14-day tickets to be cut to NT$11,700 (US$362.23)
from NT$13,000 and one-month tickets to be lowered to NT$12,780 from NT$14,200.
However, prices for direct flights between Kaohisung and Pudong will remain
unchanged.</P>
      <P>TranAsia Airways will cut its fares on the route by 20 percent, with 14-day
tickets down to NT$11,500 from NT$14,000, and one-month tickets at NT$12,500,
down from NT$15,500.</P>
      <P>EVA Air, meanwhile, will offer its tickets on the route at NT$12,500 online,
which represents about a 20 percent cut compared with the NT$16,150 for 14-day
tickets and the NT$17,650 currently charged through travel agencies.</P>
      <P>The three carriers said that passengers who have already booked tickets  will be
able to obtain refunds of the ticket price difference.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is a peacemaker and U.S. arms sales are designed to boost its national
defenses, President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with visiting Jim Cheng, secretary of commerce and trade of the

association with the United States.</P>
      <P>Ever since his administration took office, he said, Taipei and Washington have
come a long way in their ties, especially as regards the restoration of mutual
trust between their top leaders.</P>
      <P>In the last two years, former U.S. President George W. Bush and incumbent
President Barack Obama have given the nod to separate arms sale packages to
Taiwan, which Taipei had requested more than a decade ago but had never been
able to obtain.</P>
      <P>"The final green light from Washington goes a long way to strengthening Taiwan's
national defenses," Ma said.</P>
      <P>"We will make Washington feel that friendship with Taiwan is not a burden, " the

United States with an unprecedented opportunity to keep on good terms with both
Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>The president's remarks were seen as a veiled rebuttal of a recent statement by

      <P>Health insurance cards marked with notice that the holder does not want to
receive emergency treatment in the terminal stage of life will be legally
binding, a Department of Health (DOH) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shih Chung-liang, director of the DOH's Medical Affairs Bureau, made the remarks
following the passage of an amendment to the Hospice and Palliative Care Act by
the Executive Yuan earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>"The marking will be seen as a written statement by the patient that clearly
indicates his or her will," Shih said.</P>
      <P>"When the family members of the patient express different views during the
treatment process, medical personnel will make their decisions based on the
patient's will, " Shih said, adding that patients can still change their minds
and accept treatment.</P>
      <P>Shih noted that as of May, around 40,000 people had made prior statements on
hospice and palliative care and had marked their health insurance cards. The
number of those who have the desire but have not clearly expressed their wills
should exceed that number, he added.</P>
      <P>He cited cancer patients as an example, saying that more than 40,000 people die
from cancer in Taiwan every year.</P>
      <P>"The DOH has estimated that about 70 percent of terminally ill cancer patients
want to give up emergency treatment as they approach their final stage of life,"
he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that giving up emergency treatment such as invasive intubation and
defibrillation does not mean giving up treatment altogether and that palliative
treatment such as medicine will still be administered.</P>
      <P>Under the DOH's plan, patients can apply to have their cards marked at local

day. Are there no such things as gambling and games of skill? To do even one of
those things is better than to do nothing at all."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiayi Magistrate Chang Hwa-kuan of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
revealed recently that Volkswagen is prepared to set up a plant in her county.
Her predecessor, Chen Ming-wen, also of the DPP, said the investment
solicitation was launched during his term.</P>
      <P>Chang and Chen must be well aware that the business opportunities to be brought
by the signing of the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China
are what are attracting foreign investors to Taiwan. While protesting nosily
against the ECFA, the DPP local government chiefs are aggressively touting
foreign investment. What is the logic behind this?</P>
      <P>In another strange incident, Tainan Magistrate Su Huan-jhih, another DPP
politician who had opposed exporting Taiwanese fruit to China, was visiting
Beijing to promote Taiwan-grown mangoes.</P>
      <P>Chang and Su have no intention of cheating their voters. It is the DPP's
illogical theories and practices on cross-Taiwan Strait issues that are
deceitful.</P>
      <P>Politics might be the cleverest fraud ever, but it is a prerequisite for those
who play the trick to face their own political stances honestly, otherwise, they

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Arms sales and triangular Taiwan-U.S.-China ties</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/18/10  10:40:01
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Strained relations across the Taiwan Strait have largely eased since President
Ma Ying-jeou assumed office and adopted his modus vivendi policy toward China.</P>
      <P>The quiet, uneventful cross-strait relations in the past two years have caused
the United States to sigh with relief, whereas the unruffled seas in the strait
have, however, unwittingly fueled discussion in Washington, D.C. of the pros and
cons of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For its part, China seems to be attempting to cash in on this trend to weaken
the legitimacy or fundamental basis of U.S. arms dealings with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein said Wednesday
that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are hurting closer ties with China and asked
Defense Secretary Robert Gates what Beijing would have to do for the Pentagon to
reconsider such deals.</P>
      <P>Feinstein, who visited Beijing and Taipei earlier this month, told Gates in a
Senate hearing that China's leaders have offered to reposition at least some of
their military forces opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The senior Democratic senator said the redeployment offer was raised during
meetings she had with some of the Chinese leadership.</P>
      <P>Branding U.S. arms sales to Taiwan "a substantial irritant" in Washington-
Beijing  relations,  Feinstein  asked  Gates  what "substantial" steps China
could take to ease its military posture in the Taiwan Strait in a way that would
allow Washington to reconsider future arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I think there is an opportunity to consider where we go if this across-the-
strait situation is stable, " Gates said. After the Obama administration
notified Congress in January of plans to sell Taiwan up  to  US$6.4  billion-
worth  of  arms,  China  broke  off military-to-military contacts with the
United States. Earlier this month, China turned down a proposed fence-mending
visit by Gates.</P>
      <P>Gates cited Washington's justification for the sales, including what he called
an "extraordinary Chinese deployment of all manner of cruise and ballistic
missiles opposite Taiwan on the Chinese side of the strait."</P>
      <P>He further said it is up to Congress and the White House to decide whether to
change the way American arms are sold to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The bottom line is that the decision on Taiwan arms sales is fundamentally a
political decision," Gates said.</P>
      <P>Gates said the United States is "very concerned" about China's growing anti-ship
cruise and ballistic missile capabilities. (June 18, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>During a visit in October 2002 to then-U.S. President George W. Bush's private
ranch in Crawford, Texas, then-Chinese President Jiang Zemin came up with a
proposal that China could redeploy its missiles targeting Taiwan in exchange for
an end to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At the time, the U.S. government did not respond to the initiative because
continued advances in the range and mobility of China's missiles would render
any such redeployment meaningless.</P>
      <P>During Wednesday's Senate hearing, Gates said the U.S. is very concerned  about
China's  growing  missile,  information  and anti-satellite  combat
capabilities  and  hopes  to  increase military-to-military exchanges with
China. Regrettably, he said, China has often suspended such exchanges. (June 18,
2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>A diplomatic official said in private Thursday that Feinstein conveyed China's
missile redeployment offer to senior Taiwanese authorities during her recent
visit to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government is fully aware of Feinstein's lack of support for
U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, the official said this was why the government invited
her to visit Taipei following her trip to Beijing.</P>
      <P>"We were hoping she would come to better understand  the cross-strait situation
through first-hand contact with our senior officials," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, President Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Thursday during a meeting with
visiting Jim Cheng, secretary of commerce and trade of the U.S. state of
Virginia, that Taiwan is a peacemaker and U.S. arms sales are designed to boost
its national defenses. (June 18, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's 2010 bluefin tuna catch drops 60 percent</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 18 (CNA)
06/18/10  10:59:15
(By Yang Shu-min and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan reported Thursday a distinct drop of 60 percent in the bluefin tuna catch
in 2010 after a proposal to ban trade in the fish was rejected at a meeting of
the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and
Flora (CITES) in March.</P>
      <P>So far this year Taiwan has caught 1,141 bluefin, representing a 60 percent drop
compared with the catch of 2,821 in the same period of last year, Fisheries
Agency Director-General James Sah said.</P>
      <P>At the Donggang fish market in Pingtung County -- Taiwan's main port for tuna --
fishermen have only caught 795 bluefin so far, a drop from 2,132 in the same
period of 2009, he added.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the decline, the wholesale price of the fish tripled from the NT$200
to NT$300 (US$9.3) per kilo it fetched in 2009 to between NT$600 and NT$800 this
year in Taiwan, Sha noted.</P>
      <P>An alert on declining fish resources has sounded on one of the areas in which
Taiwan fishes for bluefin, an area ranging from Japan's Ishigaki Island to the
Bashi Channel and the eastern coast of the Philippines, warned Hsu Chien-chung,
a professor at National Taiwan University's Institute of Oceanography.</P>
      <P>His research results show that in this area, the bluefin catch density has
plummeted from 0.8-0.6 bluefin out of 1,000 fishing net hauls 10 years ago to
0.2 now.</P>
      <P>The average age of the fish caught has also been dropping -- from 9 years old on
average with an average length of 240 cm to around 7 years old with an average
length of 220 cm, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"The bluefin being caught are getting younger and younger, " he said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the volume of bluefin in every age group is dropping, Hsu pointed out,
adding that over the past decade, no mature female tuna bigger than 262 cm have
been seen among Taiwan's bluefin catch.</P>
      <P>The ratio of female to male fish is not at the perfect level for reproduction at
1 to 1, Hsu added, expressing fear that the fish, regarded as a sushi delicacy,
is approaching extinction.</P>
      <P>According to Sha, 511 Taiwanese fishing boats have been granted permission to
fish for bluefin this year, although fewer than 400 of them are currently
operating.</P>

      <P>Due to concessions from China, more than 500 Taiwanese products are expected to
be included in the "early harvest" program under the proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>While makers of those items that made the list feel as if they have just won the
lottery, those who failed to make it are disappointed. The most unfortunate are
those Taiwanese manufacturers that will soon have to face the competition from
cheap imports from China.</P>
      <P>The government needs to deal properly with the grievances held by those who have
been excluded from the ECFA benefits, since the arrangement is the result of the
government's judgment and choice.</P>
      <P>A possible solution would be for the government to collect some of the profits
from those who gain from the trade pact and use the funds to subsidize
manufacturers affected by Chinese imports. If there is any surplus in the fund,
it could be used to boost the competitiveness of other industries in preparation
for full opening of Taiwan's market in the future.</P>
      <P>This method would ensure that Taiwan's overall advantages from the ECFA are
greater than the disadvantages, and could also reduce the opposition to and fear
of the ECFA. (June 18, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Shares of Largan Precision Co., one of Nokia Corp.'s Taiwanese handset-component
suppliers and also the most expensive stock in Taiwan at present, have been
favored by most foreign institutional investors, because the company's revenue
is expected to benefit from strong smart phone markets, despite a profit warning
issued by Nokia Corp. earlier this week</P>
      <P>Largan Precision, the world's largest cell phone camera lens supplier, rose
NT$11, or 2.14 percent to NT$524 (US$16.22) in early trading, outperforming the
benchmark Taiex, which was down slightly by 0.11 percent. The stock has risen
more than 24 percent so far this year.</P>
      <P>Japan's Daiwa Institute of Research said it expects Largan Precision's revenue
in the second quarter to perform better than expected and therefore revised
upward the share's target price to NT$655.</P>
      <P>Merrill Lynch Securities said that although Nokia's profit warning caused
negative sentiment on Taiwan's cell phone component suppliers, Largan
Precision's revenue in Q2 is expected to see a strong growth on the back of the
new iPhone ramp, which is not tied as much to Nokia's supply chain.</P>
      <P>Merrill Lynch maintained its "buy" rating for Largan Precision's shares, with a
target price of NT$540.</P>
      <P>Nokia,  the world's largest cell phone manufacturer,  said Wednesday that it
expects second-quarter sales of devices and service units at the low end of its
previous forecast range of between 6.7 billion euros (US$8.2 billion) and 7.2
billion euros or even lower.</P>
      <P>Goldman Sachs, however, gave a target price for Largan Precision at NT$485,
while maintaining a "neutral" rating on the stock, according to a media report.</P>

Fushoushan Farm, which has cut down fruit orchards to aid land preservation,
turning a profit instead with tour packages; and many other similar stories.</P>
      <P>Contrary to the bureaucratic stereotype, these frontline public servants use
their professional skills to complete their tasks, even when they feel just as

      <P>In response to a complaint that temporary vendors at Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport have seriously tarnished the nation's image, the
government promised Friday to step up a clampdown on them.</P>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) under the Ministry of Transportation
ad Communications Communications (MOTC) made the pledge after Legislator Lo Su-
lei raised the complaint at a news conference in which she accused the
authorities of dereliction of duty that has hurt the country's image.</P>
      <P>Showing photos shot at Taiwan's main international gateway to support her
argument, Lo said that "illegal vendors are free to sell breakfasts, lunch boxes
and garments from day to night at the airport."</P>
      <P>Airport workers are the prime customers of these illegal vendors, who can be
seen in many corners of the facility, according to Lo.</P>
      <P>"This is also unfair to the restaurants within the airport, which are required
to pay high royalties for the right to operate there, " Lo said, demanding that
the CAA and MOTC punish the personnel responsible for allowing the vendors to
work there.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Taoyuan International  Airport Office Director Shiau Deng-ke said he had

      <P>China has never presented a concrete plan for redeployment of its missiles
targeting Taiwan, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State James B. Steinberg said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The remarks came after senior U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein told a Senate
hearing Wednesday that China has proposed to reposition at least some of its
military forces opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Steinberg said that theoretically, the United States welcomes any Chinese action
or effort to reduce its threat to Taiwan. He added, however, that to the best of
his knowledge, China has never tendered or spelled out any details about a
military redeployment plan.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, Feinstein, head of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, asked Defense Secretary Robert Gates what Beijing would
have to do for the Pentagon to reconsider U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, which she
described as a "substantial irritant" to Washington-Beijing ties.</P>
      <P>The reports quoted Feinstein as telling the hearing that during her recent
meetings in Beijing, Chinese leaders had said they were willing to relax China's
military posture in the Taiwan Strait in exchange for an end to U.S. arms sales
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response, Gates defended U.S. arms deals with Taiwan, saying that they were
based on the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) , a U.S. law enacted by Congress to
regulate engagements with Taiwan in the absence of official ties. For more than
30 years, successive U.S. administrations have upheld TRA provisions and
supported arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Gates  also  cited  as justification  what  he called  an "extraordinary Chinese
deployment of all manner of cruise and ballistic missiles opposite Taiwan on the
Chinese side of the strait."</P>
      <P>Feinstein responded: "In my meeting with some of the leadership, it was
mentioned that China had offered to redeploy back. Now I understand the word
'redeploy' isn't 'remove.' And I understand the nature of what's there and the
number of troops."</P>
      <P>The senior Democratic senator visited China and Taiwan earlier this month and
held talks with the countries' top leaders.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FTAs not sovereign agreements: U.S. expert</HEADLINE>

      <P>China should not try to block Taiwan's bids to forge free trade agreements
(FTAs) with other countries because the deals are not sovereign or official in
nature, a U.S. expert said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Charles Freeman, who holds the Freeman Chair in China Studies at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Beijing is well aware of the
serious consequences of barring Taiwan's FTA bids.</P>
      <P>Doing so not only damages President Ma Ying-jeou's credibility but also makes it
difficult for China's leaders to win the support of the Taiwanese people,
Freeman said in a seminar on the proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) held by Taiwan's representative office in the United States and
the Washington-based Center for National Policy.</P>
      <P>The issue has been a topic of hot discussion after Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said early this month that Beijing has no objection to
unofficial economic and trade relations between Taiwan and other countries, but
opposes any signing of official agreements.</P>
      <P>Some people have interpreted Ma's statement as meaning that Beijing will
continue to block Taiwan's efforts to establish FTAs with other countries even
after the signing of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's government, which plans to seal the deal with China in
late June or early July, the agreement will help clear the way for Taiwan's bids
to negotiate FTAs with its trade partners.</P>
      <P>Also at Thursday's seminar, Douglas Paal, vice president for studies at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the ECFA is obviously in
Taiwan's favor.</P>
      <P>Paal said the trade pact will help reduce trade barriers between Taiwan and
China, which will in turn boost Taiwan's competitive edge against Shanghai and
Hong Kong and attract more foreign investors to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Insurance clerk helps cancer victims</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tsai  Li-chu  (not her real  name)
06/18/10  15:01:57</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>recently went to the Taipei Office of the Labor Insurance Bureau to apply for
subsidy for injuries and handicaps under the Labor Insurance Program.</P>
      <P>Still reeling from the shock of having her womb and ovaries removed because of
cancer one month ago -- two years after having surgery on both breasts to remove
malignant tumors-- the 48-year-old feels she has had more than her share of
misfortune.</P>
      <P>The middle-aged woman clerk behind the counter looked at the woeful woman after
reviewing her application form and asked: "Do you still work?"</P>
      <P>"No, I lost my job because of my disease. It took me a long time to recover from
the surgery."</P>
      <P>"How do you live? " the clerk asked curiously, because according to the
application form Tsai is single and her next of kin is an older brother in her
hometown of Beipu in Hsinchu County.</P>
      <P>Tsai burst into tears, saying that she lives on compensation from an insurance
policy she bought several years ago, but might have to find another job after
she recovers a little more from her surgery.</P>
      <P>She said she lives alone in a rented room in Taipei and rarely contacts her
unmarried brother, who is not in a position to give her any help, either
mentally or financially.</P>
      <P>"Don't cry, I am sure you will come through the lows of your life. Look at me, I
have had both breasts removed because of cancer," the clerk said
sympathetically.</P>
      <P>Tsai looked with surprise at the clerk, Lu Li-ying. With her grace, kindness,
confidence and energy, no-one would believe she was a cancer victim.</P>
      <P>But she was. She was diagnosed with cancer in her right breast in 2001, and had
an operation to remove the tumor, only to find in 2008 that her other breast had
a tumor.</P>
      <P>In addition to surgery, Lu underwent six grueling courses of chemotherapy and 31
courses of radiation therapy. Today,  her suffering predisposes her to have an
affinity for people with the same problem, and she does her best to encourage
them by recounting her own experience fighting the disease when they apply for
labor insurance payments.</P>
      <P>Most people facing breast cancer are anxious to know about their chances of
survival. How long do I have to live? Will the whole breast be removed? Can I
still be considered a woman without a breast? How will my children, my family,
my husband manage without me?</P>
      <P>"I can see all this anxiety and depression in the faces of the patients, and it
is even more evident among those who don't have the support of their families,"
Lu said.</P>
      <P>Many of them break down in tears in front of her, but often feel better when Lu
offers them a shoulder to cry on and shows them, with herself as an example,
that they can overcome the disease and live a normal life.</P>
      <P>Despite having no training as a professional counselor, Lu provides them with
valuable tips on coping with the disease and the side effects of chemotherapy
and radiation therapy.</P>
      <P>For example,  for people plagued  with nausea  caused  by chemotherapy, Lu
suggests that they keep a slice of ginger in their mouths to reduce the
vomiting, while for those suffering from low white blood cell counts because of
chemotherapy, she recommends that they eat mushrooms.</P>
      <P>As a busy counter clerk, Lu cannot spend too much time talking to the customers,
so she often gives them her home number and urges them to call her after
business hours, to the surprise of her colleagues.</P>
      <P>Most of these people, many of whom are suffering from depression, feel great
relief after talking with Lu, and some have kept in contact with her and have
become her friends.</P>
      <P>One of them is woman who used to work as a cleaner at a local hotel but who lost
her job when a mastectomy meant that she could no longer lift heavy things such
as mattresses.</P>
      <P>Lu kept calling her and trying to find her a new job until the woman eventually
landed a job as a house cleaner and the woman is now one of more than 50 people
who have become friends with Lu through their shared experiences of the disease.
Chen Shun-cheh, director of the Breast Surgery Department of the Chang Geng
Memorial Hospital in Taipei, said the three steps to overcoming breast cancer
are to know it, to face it and to defeat it.</P>
      <P>Breast cancer has a five-year survival rate of about 85 percent, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"Therapy of course is very important, but support from the people around the
patients is also very important to help them through the whole process of
treatment," he said.</P>
      <P>One day last month, Lu drove south to visit her old folks in her hometown of
Jhudong in Hsinchu County, with Tsai Li-chu in the passenger seat -- the two
have become good friends since their first encounter.</P>
      <P>Lu was glad to see Tsai emerging from the shadow of cancer and wanting to see
her older brother in Beipu, which is a township near Jhudong.</P>
      <P>On the way, Tsai, who is a devoted Christian told Lu: "When I found I was
suffering from cancer, I hated that God had forsaken me. But He didn't,
actually. Instead, He led me into my acquaintance with you, and gave me care
through you."</P>
      <P>For Lu, her new friend's praise is the greatest honor she can imagine. By Maubo

      <P>Parents will soon be able to download free software that can block inappropriate
websites from their children, an education official said at a press briefing
Friday.</P>
      <P>Education Minister Wu Ching-ji said the offer to be valid from June 21 is part
of the government's efforts to protect youngsters from online pornography,
violence or other unsuitable content.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has a good environment for e-learning, " said Wu, who warned, however,
that the Internet can also be a source of trouble for some children.</P>
      <P>Wu said that misuse of the Internet can cause poor eyesight, poor friend
choices, and even lawbreaking, and he encouraged parents to watch their children
when they are using the computer.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Education (MOE) among some
56,773 students ranging from fourth grade to high school, high school students
spend almost twice as much time surfing the Internet in the winter and summer
vacations as they do during the school semester.</P>
      <P>With more and more people worried about whether it is safe for children to use
the Internet on their own, Dr. Chao Han-chieh, director of the MOE's Computer
Center, said busy parents who cannot accompany their children all the time can
take advantage of the free software, called Network Guarding Angel (NGA).</P>
      <P>With NGA, parents can monitor their children's browsing history, block
unsuitable websites, and set the amount of time their children can remain
online, Chao said.</P>
      <P>Saying that she will definitely use the free software, one mother of two told
CNA after the briefing that she had already arranged some summer camps and
outdoor activities for her children so that they will spend less time at home on
the computer during the summer.</P>
      <P>"I'll be glad to have this software because it can help me keep an eye on what
kind of websites they are surfing. And it's free! " she said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 0.30 percent Friday, with the market in
consolidation mode. Traders said the shrinking volume means the market is likely
to keep moving within a narrow range in the early part of next week.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 22.67 points to 7,493.11, after moving between 7,459.93
and 7,538.55 during the day's trading. Turnover decreased to NT$66.84 billion
(US$2.08 billion) -- the lowest turnover of the week -- compared to NT$$91.94
billion recorded the previous day.</P>
      <P>"The turnover was just too low to drive the market higher, " said Benson Huang,
an analyst at Taiwan International Securities, adding that the broader market
index faced strong resistance at around 7,530.</P>
      <P>"The index might need to build a solid base at around 7,400 in the next three to
four days before moving higher again," Huang said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,009 stocks closed higher and 1,686 ended the day lower, while 413
remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>Of the eight major stock categories, only cement shares gained ground, advancing
0.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Plastics and chemicals, as well as the paper and pulp sector, dropped the most
at 1.1 percent. Foodstuff shares lost 0.5 percent, while construction shares
fell 0.4 percent.</P>
      <P>Banking and financial shares were down 0.3 percent, textile stocks fell 0.2
percent and the machinery and electronics sector remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>Shares of machine tools were mostly up as machine tools were expected to be
added to Taiwan's "early harvest" list under the proposed economic cooperation

    <HEADLINE>Ministry warns public about Nigerian fraud scams</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>As many as 12 Taiwanese have fallen victim to Nigerian fraudsters in the past
year, including one woman who ended up being gang raped in Malaysia two months
ago by her scammers, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Friday, warning the
public to be on their guard.</P>
      <P>Dubbed "419" (the listing number of this type of crime in the Nigerian criminal
code), the scams have been around for decades. The usual format is where the
fraudster sends out massive numbers of "phishing" emails in the hope that
someone will take the bait. The method has also extended to online auctions and
shopping websites, as well as personal ads.</P>
      <P>The most common form of phishing email purports to come from a person claiming
to need help from a holder of a bank account overseas who is willing to accept a
massive sum of money into his account on the scammer's behalf, with the promise
of a sizeable "handling fee" for the transaction. If the victim can be persuaded
to provide personal and banking details, the fraudsters immediately use the
information to clean out the victim's account.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, said the ministry, most of the scams involve online transactions in
which a Taiwanese seller has listed items on a website such as eBay, and a
buyer, usually based in Nigeria, places an enticingly high bid.</P>
      <P>"The buyer then claims that according to Nigerian regulations, their citizens
are not allowed to wire money internationally until the item has been received.
In the past year, 12 people have been cheated out of cell phones, cameras and
laptops," said Charles Chou, a section chief of the Department of African
Affairs.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said most of the victims in Taiwan are considered highly educated
because the communications are conducted in English. The age of the most recent
victims range from the mid-50s to the early 20s.</P>
      <P>Chou said the department has suggested to the Executive Yuan's Office of
Homeland Security that the various shopping websites popular in Taiwan should
include a running headline across the page to caution sellers about online
scams.</P>
      <P>Another cybercrime case is that of a Taiwanese woman aged over 50 who fell for a
man whom she met online. Upon finally traveling to Malaysia to meet with him in
real life, however, he and his accomplices gang-raped her before robbing her of
her money and belongings.</P>
      <P>A MOFA official said he could not confirm the nationality of her attackers, but
added that they were "probably from Nigeria."</P>
      <P>"We are asking the public to think twice before disclosing personal information
to strangers online. One small mistake can cause irreparable damage," Chou said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese parents usually try everything to get their children enrolled in
"good" elementary schools so that they can get a "good start." However, three
remote schools might be providing a better learning environment with their
natural surroundings and organic farms.</P>
      <P>Taipei County's Cianhua Elementary School sits near the northern coast in a tea-
farming area. Twelve years ago, the principal cleared just over 900 square
meters of unused land behind the school and began growing Tie Guan Yin oolong
tea, producing some 800 grams of tea each spring and winter.</P>
      <P>The school's 44 students participate in every step of the tea-producing process,
from plucking the leaves and watching how factories process them, to picking out
the unwanted stalks. They are also given assignments to learn about every aspect
of tea, such as history, local industry and how to brew and taste tea.</P>
      <P>The children say they enjoy the harvesting the most and look forward to it each
semester, even though they have to deal with insects, as no pesticides are used
on the plants.</P>
      <P>Siang Tian Elementary School in central Taiwan's Changhua County has included
rice-growing in its curriculum since 2006, as it owns a rice paddy and most of
the students come from farming families. The school gets assistance from the
Taichung District Agricultural Research and Extension Station to teach classes
and give advice, such as using the technique of keeping ducks to deal with
snails instead of using pesticides.</P>
      <P>Each of the two harvests each year produce 500-600 kgs of rice from its 1,260
square meters of land. The school uses half of the rice for school lunches for
its 44 students and sells the other half for school funds or for charity. A trip
to visit another rice-growing school in Japan in 2008 was funded by the rice
sales.</P>
      <P>One sixth grader said she now helps her grandparents in their own rice paddy
after learning about it at school. She has also learned to make several rice
dishes, such as sushi, popped rice and her favourite -- "mochi," a sticky rice
cake.</P>
      <P>The teachers of Jia Zuo Elementary School in southern Taiwan's Pingtung County
set up a coffee shop in 2008 with the aim of teaching students manners and how
to interact with people. A local coffee grower found out and donated 250 coffea
arabica trees to the school so that the students could also grow their own
coffee.</P>
      <P>The school uses the trees to teach the students about the plants and how coffee
is produced. However, the beans they produce are not used because they are of
low quality and of insufficient quantity for the weekly course.</P>
      <P>Another unexpected outcome of the coffee shop is that the shop has become a
gathering place for parents, two of whom donated ovens so they can bake cookies
to go with the coffee.</P>
      <P>This method of letting students experience nature and life is teaching the
children valuable lessons, as well as providing an environment in which they can
enjoy the learning process.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Acer believes it will feel little impact from Chinese wage hikes</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Acer Inc., the world's second largest personal computer maker, said
Friday that its pricing flexibility would shield it from being adversely
impacted by Chinese wage hikes.</P>
      <P>"We have been seeking a dynamic balance in dealing with rising component prices,
fluctuating exchange rates and wage hikes, and we have been doing that for the
past 10 years, " Acer Chairman J.T. Wang said after the company's shareholders'
meeting Friday.</P>
      <P>He stressed that recent wage hikes in China would not put substantial pressure
on Acer's costs because wages account for only a small percentage of the total
notebook computer cost.</P>
      <P>Acer buys most of its notebooks and personal computers from OEM factories in
China, such as those belonging to Taiwan's Hon Hai Group, rather than producing
them itself.</P>
      <P>Wang's comments came amid speculation that notebook computer prices would rise
further in the fourth quarter of 2010, after the Hon Hai Group,  the world's
largest contract manufacturer  of electronics, and other OEMs made commitments
to raise wages in their Chinese plants.</P>
      <P>But Wang said Hon Hai's pay raises were conditional and noted that it was not
yet clear how many Hon Hai employees will be entitled to receive higher wages.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Wang said, Acer had already raised its prices marginally over
the past two months and that the increases had not yet affected demand.</P>
      <P>Several notebook computer companies have also raised their prices in response to
the falling euro in the second quarter, industry insiders have said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang forecast that Acer will see better-than-expected results in the
third quarter of this year, with revenue likely growing 10 percent to 15 percent
sequentially because of continuing strong growth in the personal computer
market.</P>
      <P>Though the second quarter has yet to conclude, Acer's chairman believed sales
for the quarter could be on a par with the company's NT$162.1 billion (US$5
billion) in revenues in the first quarter of the year, despite the impact of
Europe's debt crisis.</P>
      <P>Wang expressed optimism that Acer will overtake HP as the word's No. 1 personal
computer maker based on Acer's growth momentum, after jumping past HP in the
notebook market in Q1 2010.</P>
      <P>He also said that Acer is targeting a 10 percent share of China's notebook
computer market and that he expects Acer's revenue to double there this year and
account for 7 percent to 8 percent of the group's total sales.</P>
      <P>Acer signed a memorandum of understanding in May with Founder Group, a Chinese
high-tech and electronics distributor, considered to be a major step in
developing a deeper presence in China's market.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's 10 service sector industries are expected to operate in China after a
proposed trade pact is signed, an official familiar with the negotiations said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Negotiators between Taiwan and China reached an agreement during the third round
of talks on a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) to
include the industries on Taiwan's "early harvest" list to be granted market
access by China, the official said. The third round of talks concluded June 13.</P>
      <P>The industries include the conference sector, computer services, medical
services, architecture and fashion design services, and the civil aviation
equipment maintenance and repair industry.</P>
      <P>China agreed to allow Taiwan's air cargo firms to set up solely owned companies
in China, exempting them from China's regulations that foreign investment cannot
exceed 50 percent of an enterprise's total investment, the official said.</P>
      <P>China's opening of its market to Taiwan's civil aviation sector will  allow  air
cargo  companies  to capitalize  on business opportunities related to direct
cross-strait flights, he said.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan's higher standard of medical care, China also promised to let Taiwan
medical institutions set up hospitals in areas with high concentrations of
Taiwanese businesses, such as Guangdong Province in southeast China, to allow
them to expand operations in China and to care for China-based Taiwanese
businesspeople seeking medical attention.</P>
      <P>China, however, did not agree with Taiwan's proposal to expand the number of
Taiwanese films to be released in China. China only permits 10 Taiwanese films
each year for cinematic viewing, the official added.</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) reiterated Friday the government's goal of
signing an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China in June or
early July.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said it remains uncertain how many items will be
covered by the agreement's "early harvest" program because related discussions
are still going on between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The details will be made public as soon as they are finalized, Lai said.</P>
      <P>In the third formal round of ECFA talks that ended in Beijing last Sunday, China
agreed to Taiwan's list of 500 items that will be entitled to preferential
tariff treatment as soon as the ECFA is signed, in comparison to the 200-odd
Chinese items accepted by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday that the number of products on Taiwan's list
will be increased to around 510, while the number on China's will be boosted to
260 or 270.</P>
      <P>According to MAC officials, the two sides are currently reviewing the
conclusions reached during the third round of ECFA talks, and it remains unclear
if they will need to hold a fourth round before signing the agreement.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers urged health authorities Friday to reconsider their plan to impose a
"health surcharge" on alcoholic beverages, suggesting that the issue be more
carefully researched and debated.</P>
      <P>"It needs to be reconsidered, " said opposition Democratic Progressive Party
Legislator Huang Sue-ying.</P>
      <P>Chiou Shu-ti, director-general of the Bureau of Health Promotion under the
Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) , disclosed on Thursday that the DOH
plans to propose a draft act on the prevention of alcohol hazards in July.</P>
      <P>The proposal would levy a 40 percent health surcharge on alcoholic beverages in
addition to excise taxes already imposed, Chiou said.</P>
      <P>To actually take effect, the bill would have to be approved by the Legislative
Yuan, and many lawmakers said Thursday its chances of passage were slim if the
"surcharge" clause was not changed or eliminated.</P>
      <P>Lin Hung-chih, secretary-general of the ruling Kuomintang's (KMT) legislative
caucus, said that because of the diversity of opinions on the impact of
alcoholic drinks, he felt it was necessary for people from all walks of life to
discuss the issue and produce a consensus.</P>
      <P>The government has argued that the proposed "alcohol surcharge" is similar to
the NT$10 health surcharge tacked onto each pack of cigarettes in 2001. The
tobacco surcharge was later doubled to NT$20 in 2009.</P>
      <P>But both Huang and Lin argued that unlike tobacco products, alcoholic beverages
are not necessarily harmful to human health. Some scientific reports even
suggest moderate drinking can be a healthy habit, they said.</P>
      <P>"Alcohol is not inevitably harmful, " Huang said. She suggested that if the DOH
intends to use the surcharge as a strategy to curb alcohol abuse, it should
first study what beverages alcoholics consume and impose the proposed surcharge
only on those beverages.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chiang Lin-chun, who initiated her own version of the draft
alcohol hazard prevention act, also spelled out her opposition to the DOH's plan
to include the alcohol surcharge in the draft bill.</P>
      <P>"There should be a national consensus on the issue," Chiang said, warning that
otherwise there would be too much opposition against the bill to push it
through.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the state-run Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp. (TTL) described the
alcohol surcharge plan as "absurd" and "unreasonable, " contending that no other
countries around the world require their consumers to pay a health surcharge on
alcohol.</P>
      <P>"Of course excessive drinking is not good, but it is also bad to eat other foods
excessively, such as instant noodles, salt and sugar. Should we levy a health
surcharge on those products? " asked TTL Senior Vice President Lin Tzann-feng.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Global smartphone maker HTC said Friday that it is upbeat about its outlook in
the second half of this year, expecting sound growth in revenue, profit and
shipment figures.</P>
      <P>Peter Chou, chief executive officer of HTC, said at a shareholder meeting that
the company will maintain the momentum it built up with its strong growth in the
first half of the year.</P>
      <P>"If we hadn't encountered a component shortage, we would have had an even better
performance in April and May," he said.</P>
      <P>HTC registered a record monthly revenue for two consecutive months in April and
May, which the company attributed to strong market demand for its high-end
mobile phones.</P>
      <P>In the first five months of the year, the company registered a revenue of
NT$74.37 billion (US$2.31 billion), up 34 percent from the same period last
year.</P>
      <P>Despite the large global smartphone market, Chou said HTC was just like a
regional football team that "accidentally" entered the top four in a world
tournament.</P>
      <P>Chou said, however, that HTC remains confident about the company's ability to
keep up with its strongest competitors.</P>
      <P>According to Canalys, a global research institute that focuses on smartphones,
Nokia retained its worldwide smartphone lead during the first quarter this year,
with a market share of 38.8 percent. RIM held onto second place at 19.2 percent,
while Apple reached 15.9 percent, HTC was at 5.1 percent and Motorola at 4.7
percent.</P>
      <P>Chou also pointed out that HTC made significant progress in branding. According
to the company's internal evaluation index, HTC's brand awareness was only 10
percent at the end of last year and rose to about 40 percent at present. It is
expected to reach 60 percent by the end of this year, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, at the shareholders' meeting, HTC distributed a dividend of NT$26.5
per share for this year -- the highest among all listed companies on the Taiwan
Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>The company earned net profits of NT$22.6 billion in 2009, or NT$28.71 per
share.</P>
      <P>Its consolidated revenue for 2009 was NT$144.5 billion, with total cell phone
shipments of 11.71 million units and an average price of NT$11,661.</P>
      <P>The company also said that 3G wireless products accounted for over 95 percent of
its total shipments last year, with a gross profit rate of 31.9 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Local carrier fined for discrimination</HEADLINE>

      <P>China Airlines (CAL) , Taiwan's biggest carrier,  was fined NT$300,000
(US$9,336)  by the Taipei city government for discrimination based on physical
appearance when recruiting cabin crew.</P>
      <P>Chen Yeh-shin, chief of the Department of Labor of the Taipei city government,
said Friday that the airline took out advertisements April 22 in local
newspapers and on its website to recruit cabin crew.</P>
      <P>In the advertisements, CAL restricted the prospective female flight attendants
to a minimum 160 cm in height and males to a minimum of 170 cm.</P>
      <P>The advertisements came to the attention of the Department of Labor, which
launched an investigation the following day out of concern that the
advertisements constituted discrimination based on appearance, which is banned
under the law.</P>
      <P>The airline argued that the height requirement is in line with International
Civil Aviation Organization rules, which says cabin crew should  be tall enough
to open and close the overhead compartments and to reach the security equipment.</P>
      <P>However, CAL altered the requirement, stipulating instead that candidates should
simply be able to reach the overhead compartment while standing in bare feet.</P>
      <P>There was no mention, however, of the discrepancy in the height requirements for
men and women.</P>
      <P>The Employment Discrimination Appraisal Commission determined Thursday that the
company should be fined on the grounds that the restriction constitutes
discrimination based on appearance.</P>
      <P>"Instead of laying down the height requirement, the airline should simply have
explained what height is preferable for cabin crew work, and the airline did not
withdraw its advertisement, " Chen said in explanation of the reasons behind the
decision.</P>
      <P>Noting that the fine is the minimum for such an offense, he said this is because
it was the airline's first offense, adding that the fine is subject to appeal
within 30 days to the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs.</P>
      <P>Cabin crew positions are one of the most sought-after jobs among local college
graduates, with more than 8,000 applicants competing for 92 jobs at CAL in its
April recruitment drive, which represented a success rate of 1.15 percent.</P>

      <P>China's lack of military transparency and its suspension of military-to-military
exchanges with the United States will only make it less trustworthy to other
countries, a senior U.S. defense official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a seminar dubbed "2010 Asia Policy Assembly, " Michael Schiffer,
deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia, said the international
community remains in the dark about China's actual military expenditure, the
structure of its armed forces and its rules of engagement.</P>
      <P>Although major countries around the world have repeatedly urged China to enhance
military transparency, Schiffer said, China has failed to respond to the call
effectively.</P>
      <P>With its military spending increasing rapidly, China needs to assure the U.S.
and its neighboring countries that its military forces will be used in a way
conducive to regional development, Schiffer said.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, he said, China suspended its military-to-military exchanges with
the U.S. in January, a move that will not only impact mutual trust between the
two countries but will also make it harder for China to win trust from its major
neighbors.</P>
      <P>If China is willing to resume military cooperation with the U.S., Schiffer said
the U.S. government will not hesitate to fulfill President Barack Obama's
promise to Chinese President Hu Jintao that the two countries establish a
positive and cooperative relationship involving mutual engagement.</P>

      <P>Quanta Chairman Barry Lam said at a shareholder meeting that pay hikes in China

      <P>He said that his company has raised wages for its China workers every year and

      <P>Lam also said the company will continue to put efforts in developing cloud

      <P>He expressed hope that shipments of cloud computing laptops will see big growth

      <P>Lam also said Quanta is going to produce products with higher value,  such as

      <P>Taiwanese legislators on Friday visited the Beijing office of the Taiwan Strait
Tourism  Association, promising support for the office's efforts in China to
develop interest in traveling to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai, who is also
chairwoman  of the association,  several members  of the Legislative Yuan's
Transportation Committee made a tour of the office's 24-hour service center
before being briefed on the office's operations.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chen Ken-te suggested that to attract more
Chinese tourists to Taiwan, the Tourism Bureau should more appropriately
allocate its resources and establish offices in not only Beijing but the
eastern, southern and central parts of China, and also chart a comprehensive
development plan.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chu Fong-chi noted the trip was aimed at allowing the legislators
to gain an understanding of the Beijing office's operations.</P>
      <P>Although the office has been only open for a month, Chu said, it has achieved
its potential on a limited budget by boosting Taiwan's profile as a tourist
destination for Chinese travelers.</P>
      <P>But Chu also felt the Tourism Bureau should consider shifting more resources to
China. She said that some of the Tourism Bureau's 11 overseas offices are
located in areas with small populations but manned with large staffs.</P>
      <P>In contrast,  given China's  large land area and its big population,  the
manpower  in the Beijing office is obviously insufficient, Chu said, and she
suggested that the Tourism Bureau expand its staff at the office.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lai said the tourism association is considering setting up another
branch office in Shanghai.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Right of priority and plant variety rights are expected to be included in a
cross-strait cooperation agreement on intellectual property right (IPR)
protection, a Ministry of Economic Affairs official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wang Mei-hua, director-general of the ministry's Intellectual Property Office,
made the remarks while she and officials from the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
and the Council of Agriculture (COA) held a background presentation on a cross-
strait meeting.</P>
      <P>The meeting between Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation,  and Chen Yunlin,  president  of China's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits, is scheduled for late June or early July, and the IPR
protection pact is expected to be signed during the meeting.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the right of priority, which she said the electric and high-tech
industries have long hoped for, will be included in the pact.</P>
      <P>The right of priority means that when Taiwan manufacturers file for patent or
trademark applications in Taiwan,  although the manufacturers have yet to file
for patent or trademark applications in China, they will be given priority
patent or trademark protection in China for one year or six months.</P>
      <P>Wang noted the rampant copyright infringement practices in China, such as
Taiwan's well-known trademarks or names of production sites being registered in
China, Chinese fruits being sold as Taiwanese fruits, and Taiwan's music, film
and TV programs being illegally posted on Chinese websites.</P>
      <P>"The two sides will help prevent such practices and step up the crackdown after
the signing of the IPR protection agreement," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ying, deputy director-general of the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine, said the pact will not only help deal with the
trademark problems, but will also include plant variety rights.</P>
      <P>Plant breeders  --  owners of the variety --  will enjoy cross-strait plant
variety rights once it is certified in Taiwan that an applicant has developed a
new variety.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the cross-strait IPR agreement will be similar to the ones that
China signs with other countries, but will be more substantive because of the
right of priority and variety rights.</P>
      <P>Wu Mei-hung, director of MAC's Department of Legal Affairs, said she expected
that after the signing of the pact, an agency-to-agency cross-strait  platform
will be established  to crack down on counterfeiting and forgery, especially on
websites that provide illegally downloaded music or films.</P>
      <P>According  to  the  ministry's  IPO  statistics,  Taiwanese applications for
patents or trademarks in China over the past five years have totaled more than
20,000 and 9,000 annually, respectively.</P>
      <P>Chinese people coming to Taiwan to apply for patents  or trademarks have also
been on the rise, averaging several hundred patent applications per year, the
office said.</P>

      <P>The pro-independence Taiwan Rescue Action Alliance is mobilizing supporters to
attend a parade organized by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
on June 26 to call for a national referendum on a proposed trade pact with
China.</P>
      <P>The alliance, joined by nearly 160 civil organizations advocating Taiwan's
independence and the idea of "one country on each side" of the Taiwan Strait, is
making its appeal to join the parade via Internet and through social networking
such as Facebook, twitter and blogs.</P>
      <P>The alliance called on its website for Taiwan's people to take to the streets
to voice their  opposition  to the Ma Ying-jeou government's tactics to block
the referendum from being held.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's Referendum Review Committee rejected a referendum
initiative proposed by the Taiwan Solidarity Union on June 3 that would have
asked voters if they agree with the government signing an ECFA with China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DPP published the results of a survey Friday showing that 45.6
percent of respondents would prefer the economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) to be signed "after the government prepares a set of measures" to handle
the pact's possible impact on the country.</P>
      <P>Nearly a quarter (23.3 percent) of those polled felt "the ECFA should not be
signed, " while 21.1 percent expressing support for the pact to be signed as
soon as possible, said Chen Chun-lin, head of the DPP's polling center.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP poll, 51.1 percent also said the decision by the Referendum
Review Committee to block the referendum was not appropriate, while 32.6 percent
said it was.</P>
      <P>The survey results indicate that the government's most urgent tasks related  to
the ECFA's  implementation  are establishing complementary measures for
industries considered vulnerable to more liberalized trade with China and
persuading people that the pact benefits Taiwan, Chen contended.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP polling center, the survey was conducted by telephone among
adults 20 years of age or over on June 14. A total of 1,093 valid samples were
collected.</P>
      <P>The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.02 percentage points.</P>

      <P>The company's plans to slash its capital by NT$47.23 billion (US$1.47 billion) ,
or 65 percent, and increase its capital comes after DRAM prices plunged last
year amid the global financial meltdown and pushed the company into serious
financial difficulties, said chairman M.L. Chen.</P>
      <P>The company posted an after-tax loss in 2009 of NT$23.22 billion, or NT$3.2 per
share.</P>
      <P>Chen apologized to the shareholders and said the company's main challenge in
recent years has been overcome the termination of its relationship with its main
technology partner.</P>
      <P>But Chen said the company has adjusted its direction and moved forward. To
improve its finances and bring in new capital, the chairman won shareholders'
support to first decrease ProMOS' capital to NT$25.43 billion.</P>
      <P>The shareholders also approved the company's plans to raise funds by selling up
to 1 billion new common shares, arranging a private placement of no more than
700 million preferred shares, and issuing US$50 million in securities, also
through a private placement.</P>
      <P>The company's major shareholder Mosel Vitelic Inc. would rather concentrate on

      <P>Despite pressure from potential investors who may want to re-establish plants in
Taiwan, the government will maintain the minimum wage requirement for foreign
laborers, a Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Liao Wei-jen, deputy director of the CLA's Employment and Vocational Training
Administration,  told a group of Taiwanese businessmen with operations in China
that the wage issue would not be changed but that other measures, such as
flexible hiring quotas, would be used to help them if they relocated back to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Some of the businessmen, who returned home for the Dragon Boat Festival
celebrations, had suggested that the government delink foreign workers from the
minimum wage to enhance the appeal of moving some production facilities back to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response, Liao said Taiwan had become less attractive for migrant workers
because its wage level lags behind that of South Korea and Hong Kong, with South
Korea's minimum wage twice that of Taiwan's.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Liao said, if Taiwan compromised on the minimum wage, it would face
criticism from international media and labor rights activists, which could
eventually have a substantial impact on major domestic companies and OEM
vendors.</P>
      <P>Liao noted that, in fact, Taiwan's real wage has not increased significantly in
recent years and the minimum wage has also shown no distinct rise. In the past,
wages in Taiwan were 20 times higher than in Thailand, but that gap has narrowed
to two to three times, he said.</P>
      <P>To help sharpen local companies' competitiveness, Liao said the government is
promoting a direct hiring system for foreign laborers to cut brokerage fees.</P>
      <P>Before the end of September, the CLA will also introduce a package of new
measures that will allow for greater flexibility in assigning foreign worker
quotas based on the principle that those hiring more local workers will be given
higher quotas to hire migrant workers.</P>

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) plans to allow all foreign workers to be
hired directly by their local employers rather than through brokers, a council
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>The council will expand the current direct employment system, which applies only
to the re-employment of workers who have already worked in Taiwan, to include
newly recruited foreign workers, the official said on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>The council has long planned to introduce the direct employment system in three
phases, the official said.</P>
      <P>First,  the re-employment exemption was applied to foreign caregivers for
private patients in 2008. Then, workers in the manufacturing, construction, and
fishing industries, caregivers at institutions and housemaids were made eligible
to apply for direct re-employment in 2009.</P>
      <P>In the third stage, the council hopes to allow all foreign laborers to be newly
hired or re-employed without the use of brokers, the official said.</P>
      <P>The direct employment system will save foreign workers and local employers from
having to pay brokerage fees, but if the plan to recruit new workers is to
succeed, complementary measures have to be in place, the official said.</P>
      <P>The official said that it was essential for laborer-supplying countries to set
up information banks on potential laborers, and for Taiwan to create a platform
for Taiwanese employers to select suitable workers.</P>
      <P>The official said major home countries of foreign workers in Taiwan -- including
the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam -- have agreed to press ahead with the
program, while negotiations with Indonesia are ongoing.@@</P>
      <P>The official said the complementary measures are expected to be hammered out
before the end of this year to pave the way for full direct hiring early next
year.@</P>
      <P>The number of direct re-employed workers increased from 4,700 in 2008 to 7,300
in 2009 and 4,000 in the first five months of this year, according to CLA
statistics.</P>
      <P>It is expected to surge when all workers can be hired directly, the official
said.</P>

      <P>Taipei and Shanghai will set up a cooperation platform for the two sides to
jointly invest in and produce musicals and develop other creative industries,
Taipei Deputy Mayor Lee Yong-ping said Friday in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>The project  will  be carried  out  by the  Taipei  City government-affiliated
Taipei Culture Foundation and the Shanghai Cultural Development Foundation under
the Shanghai City government, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>The two sides will also collaborate to help cultural and innovative businesses
and performing groups promote their works through the platform, said Lee during
a seminar on creative cities at an exposition on cultural and creative
industries.</P>
      <P>Lee said that judging by the NT$300 million in orders Taiwan's cultural
businesses received at this year's expo, China could be a promising market with
major opportunities for Taiwanese companies.</P>
      <P>An indigenous workshop in Taiwan, for example, received more than 300 orders
from China after it took part in the annual Beijing Cultural and Creative
Industry Expo last year, Lee added.</P>
      <P>Since 2007, the city government has led delegations of local enterprises to the
annual Beijing cultural fair and that the number of Taiwanese firms
participating had risen sharply, from 13 in 2007, to 60 in 2008, and to more
than 100 in 2009.</P>
      <P>Sales generated by the fair had grown to NT$200 million in 2009, from several
million Taiwan dollars in 2007, according to the deputy mayor.</P>
      <P>With the even closer relations between Taipei and Shanghai, Shanghai is now home
to many artists, performers and celebrities from Taipei's cultural circles, Lee
said, creating even more opportunities for cooperation between the two cities.</P>
      <P>One of those resulting from the collaboration of the two cities, she said, was a
recent performance by Taiwanese opera troupe Ming Hua Yuan Arts and Cultural
Group during the 2010 Shanghai World Expo.</P>
      <P>The increasing opportunities created an immediate need for the cultural
cooperation platform envisioned at Friday's seminar, Lee said.</P>
      <P>She said the two foundations will also form a joint venture for the production
of musicals and undertake other projects, such as co-organizing pop music
concerts and co-producing Taiwanese operas, soap operas and movies.</P>

      <P>A joint environmental monitoring program run by Taiwan and other countries on
the Pratas Islands has found that air pollution is spreading farther south than
had previously been believed, according to results of the program unveiled
Friday.</P>
      <P>Chu Yu-chi, director of the Environmental Protection Agency's department in
charge of environmental monitoring and Information, said Friday in the Pratas
Islands that air pollution could spread wide, especially in March when Taiwan
was under the influence of China's sandstorms.</P>
      <P>Not only was the air quality in Taiwan poor, even in the Pratas Islands -- also
known as Dongsha Islands -- located 450 kilometers south of Taiwan, the
monitoring indexes also showed a marked increase in pollution, he said.</P>
      <P>"We didn't know that the sandstorm could spread so far south. This was a rare
chance for us to get hold of the path of the storm, " Chu said.</P>
      <P>"It recorded over 500 micrograms per cubic meter of particulates, compared with
only 30 micrograms at any usual time. The figures will be of great benefit to
future scientific research."</P>
      <P>The effort  is a collaborative  project  between  Taiwan's Environmental
Protection Administration, NASA from the United States, and several Southeast
Asian countries to monitor the environmental quality in the Pratas Islands.</P>
      <P>EPA Minister Stephen Shu-hung Shen, National Science Council Chairman Lee Lou-
chuang, and NASA official Hal Maring all attended the announcement of the
results in the Dongsha Islands.</P>
      <P>"The program was the first time that the EPA has cooperated with the NASA," Shen
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also worked with research teams from Vietnam, Thailand and the
Philippines to use high-tech air monitoring equipment to conduct a three-month
air quality monitoring.</P>
      <P>Shen said that a Navy vessel transported related equipment in February. U.S.
equipment will be removed by the end of the month and the monitoring vehicle
will also be transported back to Taiwan then.</P>
      <P>He also mentioned that to monitor the long-term changes of environmental quality
in Dongsha Islands, the EPA has worked with Kaohsiung's Marine Bureau to set up
a working station on the island, which is solar-powered and the first green
monitoring station in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Ex-president Chen Shui-bian, who has been detained since Dec. 30, 2008 in
connection with corruption, forgery and money laundering charges, has to stay
behind bars for another two months, according to a ruling by the Taiwan High
Court Friday.</P>
      <P>The same panel of three judges who commuted Chen and his wife Wu Shu-jen's
sentences from life imprisonment to 20-year jail terms on June 11 said in their
ruling that the ex-first family has not yet wired all their foreign bank
deposits back to Taiwan, and there is a possibility that he could flee once
released.</P>
      <P>The court said the ex-first family is estimated to have stashed US$22.42 million
in illegal gains in Swiss banks, and has only wired US$11.52 million of it back
to a Taiwan bank account designated by the prosecutors.</P>
      <P>The court said Chen might drag his feet on transferring the money in the hope
that he could use it someday when he goes abroad.</P>
      <P>Chen, who did not show up at the court to listen to the ruling, reportedly
taking the decision in stride in his cell at the Taipei Detention Center.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the detention center said Chen, who had pleaded with the court
for his release on bail after his current detention expires on June 23, learned
the latest ruling from TV news reports, but carried on his daily routine without
showing any emotion.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife were indicted for accumulating about NT$1 billion (US$31.07
million) in embezzled public funds and bribes during Chen's terms as president
from 2000-2008.</P>
      <P>The ex-president and his wife denied the charges, arguing that the funds are

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Be selective in accepting 'returning salmon'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/20/10  13:51:20
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An increasing number of Taiwanese businessmen operating in China, known locally
as "taishang, " have been heading home like schools of salmon to launch new
investment projects.</P>
      <P>The "salmon" have opted to return to Taiwan because of rising labor costs and
the drastically changing labor market situation in China, better Taiwan-China
relations, and much more convenient cross-strait transportation links.</P>
      <P>To cope with this trend, the government has come up with an overall strategy
aimed at attracting taishang investment of NT$40 billion a year, compared to the
NT$34 billion posted in 2009.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs has also announced that it will offer
customized assistance to Taiwanese companies that intend to return and invest at
home.</P>
      <P>In addition to creating a friendly and efficient environment for investment, the
government should set goals and strategies of its own in its efforts to lure the
"returning salmon."</P>
      <P>The government should also be choosy about whom it accepts, rather than allow
all comers.</P>
      <P>Priority should be given to those industries that would provide benefits to
Taiwan society,  that would help upgrade Taiwan's industrial structures and that
would generate higher added value. Green industries and emerging high-tech
industries, for example, would fall under this category.</P>
      <P>High-polluting, low-tech and low added value industries that moved out of Taiwan
some 20 years ago should not be allowed in again.</P>
      <P>The government should not consider setting up "special zones" to facilitate the
taishang's relocation or allow them to use Chinese or other imported labor.

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- China finally will allow RMB appreciation</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/20/10  14:21:41
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On the eve of the G-20 summit in the Canadian city of Toronto, China's central
bank announced Saturday that it will allow a more flexible exchange rate for its
currency, saying this will lead to more balanced and sustainable global economic
growth.</P>
      <P>U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner immediately responded to China's move.
"We welcome China's decision to increase the flexibility of its exchange rate, "
Geithner said in a statement issued in Washington.</P>
      <P>Beijing has kept the Chinese yuan, also known as the renminbi or RMB, frozen
against the U.S. dollar since mid-2008 to support its manufacturers and preserve
jobs. But China has been under pressure from the U.S. and other trading partners
to allow the yuan to appreciate.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's central bank refrained from making any comment on Beijing's
announcement, saying only that it will closely monitor the developments in the
global financial market as China begins its reform of its exchange rate
mechanism.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The People's Bank of China noted in a statement Saturday evening that the yuan
has been pegged at about 6.83 to the greenback since July 2008 after the Chinese
government  allowed a 21 percent appreciation over the prior three years.</P>
      <P>In view of the recent economic situation and financial market developments at
home and abroad and the balance of payments (BOP) situation in China, the bank
said, it has decided to proceed further with reform of its exchange rate
mechanism and to allow more flexibility in the exchange rate of the yuan.</P>
      <P>Since July 21, 2005, the bank said, China has been managing a floating exchange
rate mechanism based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of
currencies.</P>
      <P>The bank said that after a two-year halt of such reform amid a global financial
crisis that began in mid-2008, it will "proceed further with reform of the RMB
exchange rate regime" in the hope that it will produce the anticipated results
and play a positive role.</P>
      <P>According  to foreign wire service reports,  the statement symbolizes that China
will let its currency appreciate gradually.</P>
      <P>U.S. President Barack Obama welcomed China's decision to increase the
flexibility of its exchange rate, describing it as a "constructive step that can
help safeguard the recovery and contribute to a more balanced global economy."</P>
      <P>But local scholars said China's vague statement of its intentions was mainly a
response to international pressure ahead of the G-20 summit.</P>
      <P>National Chengchi University professor Chu Hao-min said the RMB exchange rate
may become more flexible from this week but the currency is more likely to
appreciate marginally rather than sharply.</P>
      <P>Liang Kuo-yuan, president of the Polaris Research Institute, echoed Chu's view,
predicting that Chinese authorities are unlikely to adopt ahands-off  policy  to
allow the yuan to appreciate significantly in the near future because China
still needs foreign demand to help sustain its economic growth. (June 20, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Senior executives of major Taiwanese banks said the Chinese central bank's
latest statement is a prelude to RMB appreciation. The currency range will
become clear when China's foreign exchange market opens Monday, they predicted.</P>
      <P>Some foreign bankers forecast that the RMB will appreciate at least 2 percent to
3 percent, whereas other bankers predicted an even stronger rise of 6-to-7
percent.</P>
      <P>The RMB appreciation will have an impact on China's stock markets and will also
affect the profitability of Taiwan-owned companies in China, particularly those
in the export-oriented industries.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the RMB appreciation will definitely increase pressure on other Asian
currencies to rise. Market analysts predicted that the Taiwan currency will
inevitably to go up in the wake of the RMB appreciation. (June 20, 2010).</P>

      <P>The Changhua County Government held a forum Saturday in Taipei to introduce the
attractions of the central Taiwan county and its potential to develop cultural
and creative industries.</P>
      <P>According to Changhua Magistrate Cho Po-yuan, the county not only supplies about
half of the eggs and grapes on the Taiwan market, but is also a major rice
producer, a manufacturing hub for footwear and traditional bicycles, and home to
five heritage sites that were once colleges.</P>
      <P>In addition, a museum that will display products from the top 10 industries in
the county has been partially opened to the public, he said.</P>
      <P>In the county's 26 townships, there are unique attractions such as the Baguashan
Great Buddha Scenic area in Changhua City that features a giant statue of
Buddha, he said.</P>
      <P>The Tien-Wei Highway Flower Garden and the Ershui Train Station, which serves as
a transfer station to the Jiji Branch Line to the adjoining Nantou County, are
also special attractions in Changhua County, he said.</P>
      <P>One of the main speakers at the forum, ezTravel president Jack Wu, said that
tourism nowadays is not only just about leisure and should be treated as a
combination  of cultural and creative industries, history and ecology.</P>
      <P>He said that although Changhua is not a modern county with five-star hotels, it
has a sound foundation for the development of cultural and creative industries.</P>
      <P>For example, Yu said, the industrial museum could give the county a tourism
edge, as it would not only display the progress the industries have made through
hard work but also show the link among industries, the economy and culture.</P>
      <P>Jackson Lin, general manager of the Taiwan Glass Gallery, the county's most
popular museum, said that innovative thinking could be the key to success in the
cultural and creative industries in the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: What is Taiwan's FTA strategy?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/20/10  15:11:16
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is ready to sign an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China, probably at the end of this month, but this will only be the beginning of
a series of challenges.</P>
      <P>The government has said repeatedly that the ECFA will pave the way for Taiwan to
sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries, but we wonder if it has
any strategic plans for Taiwan after the ECFA is concluded?</P>
      <P>It is worrisome that the government has only a vague economic plan for the
country after the ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>What are Taiwan's guidelines for selecting countries with which to sign FTAs? Is
Taiwan ready for the FTA give and take? And most important, do we have any
answers to these questions?</P>
      <P>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been Taiwan's main target
with regard to FTAs, but are we ready to open our labor market to blue-collar
workers from Indonesia,  the Philippines and Vietnam? How will the government
tell farmers that Taiwan may allow imports of ASEAN rice and tropical fruits?</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also face similar challenges in the long term after it concludes the
ECFA with China, although initially, it may appear that Taiwan stands to benefit
more than China from the pact.</P>
      <P>To ensure a better future, Taiwan should begin with the "basics." The government
should first devise and publicize a blueprint for the country's economic
development after the ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>Next year, Taiwan will celebrate the 10th anniversary of its entry to the World
Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>In order to speed up the process of achieving FTAs with other major economies
and to sharpen its international competitiveness, Taiwan should strive to
expedite economic liberalization and reforms with the same determination that it
demonstrated when it was seeking accession to the WTO. (June 20, 2010)</P>

      <P>A local ophthalmology group called on the government Sunday not to open Taiwan's
medical service sector to Chinese medical professionals because the market is
saturated.</P>
      <P>The group made the statement in response to China's request that its medical
service industry be included on the "early harvest list" for favorable market
access treatment under an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) that
is expected to be signed soon between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>At an ophthalmology seminar, Chang Chao-kai, secretary-general of the Taiwan
Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery, said the government should not allow
Chinese physicians or other medical experts to work in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's medical market is saturated, while demand for medical service is high
in the huge China, therefore, Chinese physicians should focus on their home
market, Chang suggested.</P>
      <P>Perhaps in five to 10 years, Chinese medical professionals could be allowed to
practice in Taiwan, if they could demonstrate their ability to provide quality
care to patients in China, he said.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, academic exchanges in the medical field could be conducted
between the two sides, he suggested.</P>
      <P>Regarding China's plan to allow Taiwan medical institutions to operate in China,
Chang said that about 10 major players in Taiwan's medical industry have agreed
to jointly set up a hospital in a biotech park in Pudong, Shanghai in the next
two to three years.</P>
      <P>They are aiming to raise 100 million Chinese yuan (US$14.65 million) for the
project, which will initially include ophthalmology and cosmetic and plastic
surgery services for private pay patients, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Interior ministry to act as match-maker</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said recently that it will organize match-
making activities for its unmarried workers as part of its efforts to improve
the country's birth rate.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah said he has asked his Personnel Office to
organize the match-making activities at least once per year for single staff
members in every agency under the MOI.</P>
      <P>"As the agency in charge of the country's population policy, the Interior
Ministry should serve as an example in boosting the birth rate." Jiang said.</P>
      <P>Jiang's proposal came under heavy discussion at a meeting of senior officials of
the ministry, with some suggesting that match- making activities could be held
between MOI departments staffed by many unmarried women and the National Police
Administration which has many single male police officers.</P>
      <P>But some people  at the meeting  expressed  concern  that high-profile match-
making activities could impose undue pressure on unmarried MOI workers.</P>
      <P>However,  there were some lighter moments, as one of the participants related.
National Police Chief Wang Cho-chiun, who has been beleaguered by a series of
scandals in the police force, showed rare signs of being amused during the
discussions, the participant said.</P>
      <P>In another instance, a senior official joked with a single subordinate  who
often  works  overtime,  saying  "you are my responsibility now, " and offering
the worker time off to take part in the match-making activities once they begin.</P>
      <P>The minister's directive has put Huang Li-hsin, the chief of Civil Affairs
Department at the ministry, in a hot spot as 18 of the 48 workers in her
department are single.</P>
      <P>Huang promised to make it part of her job to keep an eye out for partners for
her colleagues, saying that she will contact her friends outside the ministry to
see if there are chances to enrich the private lives of her co-workers.</P>
      <P>However, she assured the workers in her department that she will not be a
nagging match-maker on the job.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to boost the country's birth rate, the MOI is offering a
prize of NT$1 million (US$31,121) to anyone who comes up with a slogan that will
help convince people to have more children.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's birth rate declined from 12 in every 1,000 population in 1999 to 8.29
in every 1,000 population in 2009, which was one of the lowest in the world that
year.</P>
      <P>The country's leaders have become alarmed at the trend, seeing it as a threat to
economic growth, and have assigned the Ministry of the Interior the task of
dealing with the issue.</P>

      <P>The Government Information Office (GIO) declined to confirm Sunday whether the
progress of a cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China had slowed because of differences between the two sides over the list of
items that would qualify for tariff removal or reduction.</P>
      <P>GIO head Johnny Chi-chen Chiang said the discussions between the two sides are
still in progress and the Taiwan government will continue to strive for the best
possible "early harvest list" to meet the people's expectations.</P>
      <P>According to the United Daily News, President Ma Ying-jeou invited Vice
President Vincent Siew, Premier Wu Den-yih and Mainland Affairs Council
Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan to meet Saturday evening to discuss the ECFA issue.</P>
      <P>The Ma administration is seeking to obtain "not just a good but a better" early
harvest list and wants to add more items soon after the pact is signed, the
paper said, adding that this has created a variable in the ECFA process.</P>
      <P>In response, Chiang reiterated that the discussions are still ongoing and the
government is determined to achieve a better "early harvest list."</P>
      <P>"The government is working toward that goal so as to maximize the pact's
benefits and minimize its negative effects on the people, " Chiang said.</P>
      <P>In the third formal round of ECFA talks that ended in Beijing June 13, China
agreed to Taiwan's list of 500 items that will be entitled to preferential
tariff treatment under the ECFA, while China listed some 200-odd items that were
accepted by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday that the number of products on
Taiwan's list will be increased to around 510, while China will bump up its
number to about 260 or 270.</P>
      <P>The two sides are currently reviewing the conclusions reached in the third round
of ECFA talks. It's not clear whether they will need to hold a fourth round of
negotiations before the agreement could be signed.</P>

      <P>The price of tickets on Chinese carriers operating between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait will be reduced by 10-15 percent as part of Beijing's efforts to
promote exchanges with Taiwan, Chinese aviation authorities announced Sunday.</P>
      <P>Li Jiaxiang, director of the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) of China, made
the announcement at a meeting of the seven-day 2010 "cross-strait forum" that
opened here earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>However, he did not say when the price cut will take effect.</P>
      <P>In the future, an additional 40 flights per week will operate on the route, in
accordance with an agreement between Taiwan and China, he said.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan and China air carriers are operating a total of 380 cross-
strait flights per week.</P>
      <P>But even with an increase to 420 flights per week, Li said, the carriers will
not be able to meet demand and more flights will have to be added in the future.</P>
      <P>In addition to its efforts to increase the number of cross-strait flights and
lower airfares, China's CAA plans to build four more airports in the Haixi area
-- the western coastal area of the Taiwan Strait -- in four years, mainly to
serve the routes between southeastern China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In 2009, China designated Fujian province and parts of the neighboring provinces
of Guangxi, Zejiang, Jiangxi and Guangdong as a "Haixi Special Economic Zone "
to develop economic links with Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is seeking joint ventures with U.S. entrepreneurs, as part of its efforts
to become a test center for electric vehicles, the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts in this direction, the MOEA said, it will host an
automobile industry forum and exhibition June 21-22 in the U.S. port city of
Detroit, which is known as the automotive center of the world.</P>
      <P>The main aim of the event is to foster collaboration between U.S. and Taiwan
automakers to develop electric vehicles, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>A delegation of Taiwanese business executives, led by Vice Minister of Economic
Affairs Huang Chung-chiou, headed for Detroit Saturday to attend the forum and
provide information on potential investment opportunities in Taiwan's electric
car industry.</P>
      <P>Huang told the Central News Agency prior to his departure that Taiwan is eyeing
long-term development goals in its search for collaboration or joint-venture
partnerships with major U.S. automakers.</P>
      <P>Huang said that when he visits the U.S. auto giants GM and Ford, he will brief
them on the business opportunities that will open up in Taiwan after the cross-
Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) is signed this
year.</P>
      <P>At the forum, some 49 innovative products developed in Taiwan for assembled
electric vehicles and key vehicle modules will be put on display to show
potential U.S. investors Taiwan's R&amp;D achievements in the field, he said.</P>
      <P>"The two-day exhibition is expected to attract more than 100 North American auto
executives," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Lin Chuan-neng,  deputy director of the MOEA's Department of
Industrial Technology, said Taiwan has sets its sight on the Chinese and U.S.
electric vehicle markets.</P>
      <P>"We will focus on the fields in which we have a competitive edge, such  as
vehicle  testing  and examination  and  technological innovation," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also hopes to become an electric vehicle testing and examination center
for the China and U.S. electric car markets, he added.</P>
      <P>Twenty-eight  Taiwan companies  in the electric motorcycle, electric vehicle and
battery industries have sent representatives to the forum, Lin said.</P>
      <P>After the Detroit stop, the delegation will also visit Indiana and Los Angeles

      <P>The Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) said Sunday it will lead
a delegation to Cambodia and Myanmar June 27 to promote sales of machinery and
equipment used in the production of footwear, plastic and rubber products.</P>
      <P>The delegation will be headed by Wayne W. Wu, vice chairman of the semi-official
TAITRA, on the mission to seek Taiwan's expansion into the two emerging markets.</P>
      <P>In Myanmar, the delegation will visit raincoat manufacturer Tah Hsin Industrial
Corp., one of the largest Taiwanese businesses in the country, to gain a better
understanding of how to expand sales there, a TAITRA spokesman said.</P>
      <P>In the absence of official trade relations between Taiwan and Cambodia,  almost
all Taiwanese  entrepreneurs  who have made investments there have done so
through a third party, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Because of the unstable political situation in both Cambodia and Myanmar, there
are fewer Taiwanese businesses operating there than in many other Southeast
Asian countries, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>However, the TAITRA is optimistic about the business potential in the two
countries, particularly at a time when the governments are seeking to develop
their consumer products industry.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Taiwan's machinery equipment and parts suppliers stand a
good chance of making inroads into the two emerging economies, the spokesman
added.</P>
      <P>According to a TAITRA report, there has been increasing demand in the two
countries for equipment used in the packaging of food and agricultural products,
and in the plastics, rubber, textile, footwear and woodworking industries.</P>
      <P>Demand is also expected to grow in the areas of raw materials, auto parts,
information and communication products and other consumer goods in the two
countries, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the TAITRA decided to assist Taiwan factories to venture into the two
markets, he added.</P>
      <P>In Cambodia, the delegation will visit the Cambodian Investment Board and the
Ministry of Commerce to promote bilateral trade and economic exchanges,
according to the spokesman.</P>

      <P>The key to better palliative care for persons with dementia and other terminal
illnesses is to enhance public awareness of the importance of advance
directives, medical experts said Sunday at the 2010 Taiwan Dementia Conference.</P>
      <P>According to some scholars at the conference, including those from Taiwan
Alzheimer's Disease Association (TADA) , family members tend to disregard the
wishes of dementia patients and to take aggressive action when such patients are
in the terminal stage of their illness.</P>
      <P>The preferable solution would be for terminally ill patients to write a
statement of advance directives, but because the subject of death is still a
cultural taboo in Taiwan, there is a lack of public awareness about such
situations, the scholars said.</P>
      <P>As of 2009, Taiwan had a recorded number of 170,000 dementia patients.</P>
      <P>Carol Long, CEO of Capstone Healthcare Solutions in Phoenix, Arizona, said that
family members and health care providers should communicate with patients early
on in their disease to ensure the patients' right to person-directed care.</P>
      <P>"We must focus on the quality, not quantity of life at the end of life, " said
Long.</P>
      <P>Person-directed care, or personalization, is the concept of offering very
different care services from the traditional type and legally enpowering
citizens to shape their own lives and the services they receive.</P>
      <P>Noting  that the United  States  passed  a Patient  Self- Determination Act in
1990, the TADA said Taiwan does not have such a comprehensive mechanism to
protect the rights of patients with fatal illnesses.</P>
      <P>For example, the organization said, Taiwan patients do not have the legal option
to specify on their National Health Insurance card whether they will want tube
feedings, restraints, or life support.</P>
      <P>This prevents patients from exercising their rights during an emergency when a
previously written statement or a medical power of attorney may not be within
reach, the TADA said.</P>
      <P>The organization urged that the Legislature pass the amended palliative care
act, which was revised by the Department of Health on June 17.</P>
      <P>The new act would allow for medical care choices to be listed on the National
Health Insurance card, it said.</P>
      <P>"We have seen too many family members trying to prolong the lives of their loved
ones by any means, " said Wang Ying-Wei, a doctor from the Buddhist Tzu Chi
General Hospital.</P>
      <P>He suggested that people try to think from the perspective of the patients and
understand what the patients really want and need.</P>
      <P>"After all, we should add life to days rather than add days to life," Wang said.</P>

      <P>China is facing a serious inflation crisis that will not be defused by a
currency appreciation of less than 5 percent, a former chief economic planner of
Taiwan said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Commenting on speculations that the Chinese yuan may be allowed to appreciate by
3-5 percent, Chen Tain-jy, former chief of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, said a 5 percent rise will not have much impact, and will certainly
not be enough to head off China's inflation crisis.</P>
      <P>Although a 5 percent appreciation of the yuan will drive up the value of other
currencies in Asia, it will not dampen Taiwan exports, said Chen who is now a
professor at National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>He played down the significance of a statement by a spokesman for the People's
Bank of China the previous day that China will allow more flexibility of its
currency based on the economic and financial situations at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>That statement was considered a signal that China was about to end its policy of
pegging the yuan to the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>"That bank announced in 2005 and 2006 that the value of the yuan will be
determined by a basket of currencies rather than by the U.S. dollar alone, but
that did not translate into policy," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that China saw a 3 percent rise in consumer prices in May, Chen said
China is under enormous inflation pressure due to its huge trade surplus and the
inflow of foreign hot money.</P>
      <P>"Raising the value of the yuan while its exports are still booming seems to be
the only option for China to quell inflation," he said.</P>
      <P>However, the economist said, there are lots of contradictions between China's
policies and its practices.</P>
      <P>Beijing has not retired any of its economic stimulus measures, such as the
subsidies for the purchase of new vehicles and electrical appliances, which were
designed to tide the country over the global financial crisis, and this will
stoke rather dampen inflation, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In addition, its practice of increasing liquidity on the market will undo its
efforts to rein in inflation, he said.</P>
      <P>China's monetary policy results from its mistaken belief that the sharp surge in
the value of the Japanese yen was responsible for the that country's descent
into the economic doldrums for a decade, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>"The truth is, it's the other way around. Japan's economic bubble burst because
it did not take action when inflation loomed large and it raised the value of
the yen sharply and abruptly only when the situation out of control," he said.</P>
      <P>China should to take a page from Taiwan's book, he suggested, noting that Taiwan
succeeded in warding off inflation in 1987 and 1988 by letting its currency
surge from NT$38 to NT$25 against the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, several stock market analysts predicted that the appreciation of the
yuan will boost Taiwan stock market.</P>
      <P>It will push up the value of the New Taiwan dollar and encourage foreign
investors to funnel more capital into the local bourse, they said.</P>
      <P>According to local securities dealers, it is only a matter of time before China
bows to international pressure and raises the value of its currency.</P>
      <P>An analyst with the Taiwan International  Securities Corp. predicted that the
yuan will not rise in one stroke, but rather will increase slowly, gauging the
reaction of the domestic and global market.</P>
      <P>A higher yuan will push up the value of other Asian currencies, including the
won of South Korea which is Taiwan's leading competitor on the global market. In
such a senario, Taiwan will not necessarily be at a disadvantage if its currency
appreciates, according to the analyst.</P>

      <P>Chairwoman of the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Tsai Ing-
wen vowed Sunday to do her best to nip possible election "mutinies" in the bud
in two southern Taiwan municipalities.</P>
      <P>It has been reported that two DPP-affiliated local government heads, Kaohsiung
Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing and Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair, might quit the party
to run as independents in the year-end municipality elections in defiance of the
party primary results.</P>
      <P>The elections, scheduled to take place on Nov. 27 in five municipalities, are
widely seen a crucial indicator of the 2012 presidential elections.</P>
      <P>They will be held in Taipei City, Xinbei City (an upgrade of Taipei County),
greater Taichung City (an merger of Taichung City and county), greater Tainan
City (a merger of Tainan City and county) and greater Kaohsiung City (an merger
of Kaohsiung City and county).</P>
      <P>Party sources said that the DPP will ask two of its mayoral candidates,
incumbent Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu and Legislator Lai Ching-de who will run in
Tainan, to demonstrate their sincerity in seeking the support of Yang and Hsu.</P>
      <P>Several DPP heavyweights have rushed to southern Taiwan in a bid to forge party
"solidarity, " which in effect means persuading Yang and Hsu not to compete in
the elections, according to Tsai, who is carrying the DPP flag in the Xinbei
race.</P>
      <P>Southern Taiwan has long been a stronghold of the DPP.</P>
      <P>On media reports that the DPP is accusing the ruling Kuomintang of trying to
"drive a wedge" between the DPP candidates and Yang and Hsu, Tsai said that as a
ruling party, the KMT "should desist from such actions and mind its own business
instead."</P>
      <P>Former DPP legislator Kuo Cheng-liang has accused KMT Secretary- General King
Pu-tsung of stirring up trouble in the DPP.</P>
      <P>"I have never contacted any DPP figures and the DPP should not try to blame
others for its problems, " King said in response to the accusation.</P>
      <P>"The KMT will do its utmost to win the elections on its own, rather than by
relying on infighting among DPP members," he added.</P>
      <P>King also said he is very confident that incumbent Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin,
who has been picked by the KMT to run for a second term, will emerge as the
winner in that race, though he is facing a tough challenge from former Premier
Su Tseng-chang of the DPP.</P>
      <P>Recent polls show that Hau and Su are neck and neck in the race.</P>

      <P>The government is making last-ditch efforts to have three key petrochemical

      <P>To the best of his knowledge, the possibility of China agreeing to the inclusion

    <TEXT>
      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching arrived in Rome Sunday evening in her capacity as
honorary director of Taiwan's world-renowned Cloud Gate Dance Theatre.</P>
      <P>Instead of going to her hotel for a rest after a long-haul flight from Taipei,
Chow insisted on traveling to Tivoli on the outskirts of Rome to meet Cloud Gate
dancers who arrived a few days before in preparation for performances later this
week.</P>
      <P>Chow brought with her hand warmers from Taiwan to present to Cloud Gate dancers
as gifts to boost their morale.</P>
      <P>Cloud Gate members were quoted as saying that Chow's appearance came as a
surprise because they did not expect the first lady would see them directly
after her arrival in Italy. "Many of us were very excited and exclaimed out in
joy," one dancer said.</P>
      <P>Chow was greeted by Taiwan's Representative  to Italy Yih Jung-tzung, Ambassador
to the Vatican Larry Wang and China Airlines executives in Rome upon her arrival
at Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport.</P>
      <P>Camillo  Zuccoli,  secretary-general  of  the  Italy-Taiwan Parliamentary
Friendship Group, presented a bouquet at the airport to welcome Chow on behalf
of the Italian Parliament.</P>
      <P>Yih said he was grateful for the Italian government's granting of special
courtesies to Chow, who was ferried directly from apron to a VIP room by
limousine without passing through immigration inspection.</P>
      <P>This is Chow's first trip to Italy since President Ma Ying-jeou began his term
in May 2008. She appeared happy and in good spirits while exchanging greetings
with well-wishers.</P>
      <P>The first lady assumed the role of Cloud Gate's honorary director for the first
time early this year, accompanying the ensemble on a tour of the United States
and Canada in late January and early February.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, she led Cloud Gate dancers on a tour of Russia, where they
performed "Whisper of Flowers" at the 2010 Chekhov International Theatre
Festival from June 10-13.</P>
      <P>This time around, Chow will accompany the ensemble in Italy and Spain.</P>

      <P>On his historic tour of Shanghai by the maiden direct flight from Taipei
Songshan Airport to Shanghai Hongqiao Airport June 14, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin
told the media that he wants to move the world with "soft power."</P>
      <P>What is Taiwan's soft power? How can it "touch the heart of the world?"</P>
      <P>The lyrics for "Heartbeat of Taiwan, " -- the theme song of the Taiwan Pavilion
at the Shanghai World Exposition -- mention Cloud Gate Dance Theatre, Yenshui
fireworks, goddess Matsu, Taroko Gorge, Longshan Temple, Meinong paper umbrellas
and Sanyi woodcarvings.</P>
      <P>Over the past years,  Taiwanese people have appeared more comfortable
appreciating the beauty of the homeland, and therefore developed unique artwork
and cultural characters. Today, Taiwan is no longer the country that sells cheap
umbrellas and plastic shoes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also isn't just the country that exports brandnames like Acer and Giant,
with the bicycle company creating a "culture of bicycles" domestically and
starting a trend of "discovering Taiwan" on the island.</P>
      <P>Eslite Bookstore,  meanwhile,  has developed a high-quality bookshop culture in
the Taiwan Strait region.</P>
      <P>Through the song, Taiwan sings out loud its wish for "less injuries, more
applause; less battles, more simplicity." Taiwan wants to make contact with
other countries in the world in a peaceful way.</P>
      <P>As the song says, "there are many surprises on the island" with which Taiwan
wants to create a 10-year Golden Age. (June 21, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Taiwan bracing for RMB impact</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/21/10  12:00:31
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's central bank reiterated Sunday that the exchange rate between the New
Taiwan dollar and the U.S. greenback should continue to be determined by market
demand in the wake of China's weekend announcement that it will allow a more
flexible exchange rate for its currency.</P>
      <P>A senior official of the Central Bank of the Republic of China said the NT
dollar exchange rate may not necessarily move in "the widely anticipated
direction, " which was seen as a warning against "hot money" speculation in
Taiwan's currency exchange rate.</P>
      <P>However, most market analysts believe that China's decision to allow greater
flexibility for the Chinese yuan, or renminbi (RMB) , will make it harder for
the central bank to control the NT dollar's exchange rate.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>According to market analysts, Taiwan's central bank is fully aware that RMB
appreciation could fuel a rise in the NT dollar's value  that  could  eventually
undermine  Taiwan's  export competitiveness.</P>
      <P>To prevent the NT dollar from fluctuating too drastically, market sources said
the central bank will intervene in exchange market trading to maintain financial
stability.</P>
      <P>At the same time,  the central bank will monitor foreign institutional
investors' capital flows to discourage them from speculating on the NT dollar's
exchange rate while welcoming them to invest in Taiwan's stock market.</P>
      <P>As the central bank will call a board meeting Thursday to set the tone of the
country's monetary policy for the second half of the year, the Commercial Times
unveiled the results of a survey of local financial business executives about
their views on trends of currency exchange rates and domestic interest rates in
coming months.</P>
      <P>More than 60 percent of respondents forecast that the NT dollar's average
exchange rate in Q3 will range between NT$32 and NT$33, and 75 percent predicted
that the fluctuation could exceed NT$0.5.</P>
      <P>A senior banker said that as worries about euro zone debt crisis linger, the
U.S. dollar will remain strong.</P>
      <P>On the interest rates, none of the respondents forecast any adjustment of the
central bank's benchmark discount rate, but some respondents said two key
interest rates -- for one-year time deposits and negotiable certificates of
deposit (NCD) -- should be raised.</P>
      <P>Following China's decision to resume reform of its currency exchange rate
mechanism, the central bank's meeting on Thursday should shift from interest
rates to currency exchange rates, market analysts predicted. (June 21, 2010).</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Most local bankers believe that the possibility of the central bank raising
domestic interest rates in the near future has become even slimmer after China
announced plans to allow greater flexibility in its currency's exchange rate.</P>
      <P>Following China's announcement, the RMB may appreciate and thus affect the speed
of global economic recovery. Against this backdrop, local bankers said the
central bank is not likely to announce a hike of its discount rate at Thursday's
board meeting.</P>
      <P>Only when the domestic unemployment rate drops well below 5 percent will there
be room for the central bank to raise key interest rates, they added.</P>
      <P>Local bankers also predicted that the NT dollar will rise graudally against the
greenback while the currency of Taiwan's key competitor South Korea will rise
even more significantly amid rising RMB. (June 21, 2010).</P>

    <DATELINE>06/21/10  12:14:15
(June 21, 2010)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's announcement over the weekend of plans to make its exchange rate more
flexible is completely different from the renminbi reform story posted in 2005,
but it is predicted that the new course of the currency will kick off a global
rebalancing.</P>
      <P>The Chinese central bank said Sunday that it will improve foreign exchange
management and keep the renminbi exchange rate at a reasonable and balanced
level of basic stability, as well as safeguard macroeconomic and financial
market stability.</P>
      <P>China adopted its previous exchange rate reform in 2005 when global economies
including China began to pick up steam after the Asian financial crisis. At that
time, China was the fifth-largest economic entity in the world.</P>
      <P>This time around, the exchange rate reform has been announced in the wake of a
global financial meltdown, and China is likely to replace Germany to become the
world's second-largest economy after the U.S. this year.</P>
      <P>China's central bank said the new move will benefit consumers and ease strains
with other nations caused by its long reliance on exports.</P>
      <P>The central bank said the yuan will fluctuate both ways -- it could appreciate
and depreciate and its peg to the U.S. dollar will be changed into a
multilateral peg.</P>
      <P>China's move came just ahead of a summit of the Group of 20 major economies in
Toronto next weekend, where China was set to face pressure to do more to aid the
global recovery.</P>
      <P>The move was just what the world needs now to help safeguard long-term recovery
and contribute to a more balanced global economy.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After the Cold War ended two decades ago, the three nations -- Germany, Korea
and China -- that were divided by the Communist iron curtain after World War II,
evolved on different paths.</P>
      <P>Today, Germany, in its third decade after unification, plays a crucial role in
the eurozone; South and North Korea are on the verge of war; and the
Nationalists in Taiwan are about to sign an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with their Communist rivals in China to boost trade and
economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a distinguished politician from the collapsed
East German regime, sees her current challenge as cleaning up the mess made by
eurozone troublemakers like Greece without angering the German people with over-
generous financial aid to the debtors.</P>
      <P>On the Korean peninsula, Seoul's "sunshine" and "conciliation" policies have
proven a failure after the Communists in the north sank a South Korean frigate
in March and launched nuclear tests. After South Korean President Lee Myung-bak
announced an end to all exchanges with the north, Seoul-Pyongyang relations have
regressed to the Cold War era.</P>
      <P>In contrast  to the increasingly  hostile Korean standoff, interaction between
the two side of the Taiwan Strait are seen to be getting more and more close.
With the approach of the ECFA signing, however, it is regrettable to see pro-
independence opposition parties blocking Taiwan from forging free trade links
with other economies. (June 21, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Nearly 14,000 goats culled in pox virus outbreak</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The spread of goat pox virus (GPV) on ranches in Taiwan has yet to subside, with
some 14,000 infected goats culled since the first case this year was confirmed
on April 9, the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>A total of 13,976 pox-infected goats from 127 goat farms in 11 cities and
counties -- Chiayi, Tainan and Kaohsiung cities and Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung,
Changhua, Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung counties -- have been
slaughtered as of June 19 to prevent the spread of the virus, said Hsu Tien-lai,
director of the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and
Quarantine.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the bureau has so far purchased 230,000 doses of vaccine and is ready
to vaccinate all 220,000 goats currently raised in the country.</P>
      <P>Hsu does not think the GPV outbreak will drive up goat meat prices, saying that
domestically raised goats contribute only about 12 percent of the country's
demand, with nearly 90 percent of the demand being met by imports from New
Zealand and Australia.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung County, 2,300 GPV-infected goats from 12 goat farms have been
culled, the Kaohsiung County Animal Disease Control Center said.</P>
      <P>The culled number constituted about 10 percent of all goats raised in Kaohsiung
County. The goats were raised either for meat or milk, according to the center.</P>
      <P>Officials from the center said that GPV -- a highly contagious disease of small
ruminants that is characterized by fever, ocular and nasal discharges -- is
spread via contact among the animals. GPV cannot infect humans and can be
destroyed at high temperatures, they added.</P>
      <P>Since many farmers in Kaohsiung County who are not regular goat raisers keep a
few goats in their neighborhoods, the center urged these people to report to
their local county offices and apply to vaccinate their goats.</P>
      <P>The COA said it is still investigating the source of the infection.</P>
      <P>This was the second time that the disease has been reported in Taiwan. The first
outbreak was in July 2008 in northern Taoyuan County and was believed to be
started by an animal smuggled into Taiwan from a GPV-affected area, such as
Vietnam, China, Mongolia, Africa or the Middle East, but the exact source
remained unclear, according to the COA.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A modern artist has made a career out of Taiwan's traditional floral patterned
cloth and has brought this hidden treasure of the old market to the world
through his work.</P>
      <P>"I've seen that floral pattern in my grandmother's home! " artist Michael Lin
recalled of a visitor's reaction to his painting of two pillows during his first
exhibition in 1996. The large number of similar responses led Lin to focus on
the cloth and he has now exhibited in more than 15 countries overseas, including
the Cultural Olympiad held alongside the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.</P>
      <P>With his use of the patterned cloth, Lin demonstrates a common issue of modern
artists -- the conflict between traditions and modern society.</P>
      <P>"I'm not selling Taiwanese culture, I'm presenting modern art from Taiwan," he
said.</P>
      <P>Lin gets his material from Taiwan's biggest fabric wholesale market, Taipei's
Yongle Market, where first lady Chow Mei-ching and former Vice President Annette
Lu have both shopped for similar fabrics for their formal outfits.</P>
      <P>Even though the floral pattern is catching attention once again, sales are no
match to those of the past. "People used to buy 10 or 20 bolts of fabrics that
would require delivery by a freight company. Now, five or six bolts are
considered a big purchase, " said Hsu Wan-fu, owner of the leading fabric shop
in the market.</P>
      <P>"Drawing the floral pattern is more than hard work, it takes a long time to
perfect, " said Yang Wen-ju, who has 30 years of drawing experience and now owns
a shop in the market that focuses on patchwork.</P>
      <P>Fashions and trends come and go, and with Lin's modern art, the traditional
cloth has found a new possibility and a chance to make a comeback.</P>

      <P>Some 280 hectares of toxic congress weed (Parthenium hysterophorus), an invasive

campaign was launched last year, the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The four-year eradication campaign is continuing, with its progress closely
monitored by the COA, the Taiwan Forestry Bureau under the COA said.</P>
      <P>Parthenium is a flowering plant in the aster family that is native to the

weed that thrives on any disturbed land, including farms, pastures and
roadsides, a bureau official said.</P>
      <P>Contact with the plant causes dermatitis and breathing problems in humans, as
well as dermatitis in cattle and domestic animals, due to the presence of the
toxin parthenin, the official said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 1.90 percent Monday, in line with neighboring
markets, as buying was ignited by hopes that a higher Chinese yuan will lift
Asian currencies and lead to more foreign fund inflows into the region, dealers
said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 142.45 points to 7,635.56, after moving between 7,562.25
and 7,645.71, on turnover of NT$108.31 billion (US$3.37 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened 1.37 percent higher on ample liquidity, and the momentum
extended throughout the session as investors expected a stronger New Taiwan
dollar would attract more foreign investment and further boost liquidity in the
bourse, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,487 stocks closed up and 711 down, with 269 stocks unchanged.</P>
      <P>The construction sector scored the highest gains, up 4.1 percent. The financial
sector closed up 2.6 percent, the foodstuff sector rose 2.4 percent, the paper
and pulp sector gained 2.2 percent and the cement sector was 2.1 percent higher.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector rose 1.8 percent, while the textile and
plastics and chemical sectors gained 1.4 percent each.</P>
      <P>"It was a liquidity driven market today. The gains in expanded turnover have
made the local bourse technically healthier, " First Capital Management analyst
Edward Chen said.</P>
      <P>"Today's movement upward is expected to prompt many institutional investors who
had been cautious about the local bourse to buy and catch up with the gains.
There is still room for the index to go higher," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen said construction shares are expected to become the most obvious
beneficiary of a rising local currency as higher liquidity will further boost
property prices.</P>
      <P>"Foreign institutional investors are expected to continue to add their holdings
in the sector after recent portfolio adjustments, " he said.</P>
      <P>Kuo Yang Construction rose 6.90 percent to NT$20.15, Goldsun Development added
6.08 percent to NT$13.95 and Cathay Real Estate gained 4.41 percent to NT$11.85.</P>
      <P>Domestic  demand-oriented  stocks  closed  mostly higher on expectations a
rising Chinese yuan will boost consumption in China as they have invested
heavily on the mainland, dealers said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew predicted Monday that Taiwan's economy will undergo
a transformation thanks to its signing of a proposed economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China to boost bilateral trade exchanges.</P>
      <P>Once the ECFA is implemented, Taiwan's economy will "become mature," he said in
an interview with a local cable TV channel.</P>
      <P>Saying that talks on the trade pact are in their final stages, Siew also
disclosed that the text of the agreement will be close to that of China's free
trade agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that
took effect Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>The ECFA is the Ma Ying-jeou administration's key weapon in its efforts to
prevent export-dependent Taiwan from being marginalized in regional and global
markets.</P>
      <P>The pact, however, is opposed by the pro-independence opposition "pan-green"
camp headed by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , which has accused the
government of tilting toward China and refusing to announce details of the ECFA
negotiations.</P>
      <P>Amid opposition calls for a referendum on the ECFA, Siew reiterated that the
government will address the public about the challenges Taiwan will face and the
opportunities the country will have after the ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Siew said that Taiwan won several deals during the most recent
ECFA negotiations, including that Taiwanese hospitals will be allowed to open
facilities in China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also gained Beijing's agreement to an additional 18 out of 27 new tariff
exemptions for Taiwanese agricultural products, he added.</P>
      <P>In the negotiations on agricultural products -- amid local farmers' concerns
over the dumping of cheap Chinese products -- Siew said that "we have not just
defended ourselves, but have also launched an offensive, " referring to Taiwan's
refusal to open further to Chinese agricultural products.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, Taiwan has also succeeded in protecting 17 local
manufacturing sectors that are less competitive, including those that produce
ready-to-wear garments, household electronic appliances, quarried stone
cladding, farming pesticides, bedlinen, shoes and socks, as well as animal
drugs.</P>
      <P>Asked about disappointment among petrochemical business leaders after Taiwan
failed to have all its petrochemical products included in the "early harvest"
list of items that will be subject to immediate preferential tariff treatment
upon the ECFA signing, Siew explained that it is just an initial list.</P>
      <P>More items will be added in the future, he noted, underlining that the ECFA is a
framework agreement, the construction of which will need to be carried out in
gradual steps.</P>

      <P>Minister of Justice Tseng Yung-fu on Monday urged Taiwan's prosecutors to clean
up their images.</P>
      <P>At a seminar with prosecutors of the Tainan District Prosecutors Office in
Tainan City, southern Taiwan, the minister said the public has a negative
opinion of prosecutors because it lacks knowledge of what the job requires.</P>
      <P>This feeling is especially strong among lawmakers, who rarely praise prosecutors
for their work, the minister said, citing his experience in fielding lawmakers'
questions at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>"Prosecutors  are most often accused of indicting suspects recklessly, " the
minister said, urging prosecutors to be prudent in carrying out their jobs and
to only prosecute suspects when there is iron-clad evidence against them.</P>
      <P>The minister noted that the country's prosecutors launched a three-month
campaign in June to weed out those crimes that most concern the public. The
campaign is now focused on gangs and will later target loan sharks, phone
fraudsters and drug dealers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world's largest contract chip
maker, said Monday that it will operate its plants in the Southern Taiwan
Science Park in Tainan County on solar power with the objective of reducing
carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>Ricky Tsai, president of TSMC's new business division, said that while the
amount of power generated from solar panels will not meet all the demand from
the company's wafer plants, the use of solar energy in the Tainan facilities
will be a good and critical start in cutting carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>TSMC currently operates one 8-inch wafer fab and one 12-inch fab in the Southern
Taiwan Science Park.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who is also chairman of the Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association
(TSIA) , said that globally speaking, the semiconductor sector has done a good
job in reducing carbon emissions to preserve the environment.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the sidelines of a seminar held by the TSIA, Tsai told reporters
that the electricity consumption for the production of each wafer unit has
fallen 30 percent since 2001.</P>
      <P>He also said TSMC is targeting the huge green energy market in China and will
try to seize business opportunities arising from the clean energy business
there.</P>
      <P>Asked whether TSMC will set up solar energy-related facilities in China, Tsai
said the feasibility requires further evaluation.</P>
      <P>He said labor costs will not be the only factor to be taken into account when
determining whether to build solar energy-related business in China and that the
company will also consider production efficiency and cost structure on the other
side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Last week, TSMC announced that it had acquired a 21 percent stake in the
U.S.-based solar cell firm Stion Corp. through its affiliate, VentureTech
Alliance, for US$50 million.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the acquisition is expected to help TSMC obtain the necessary
production technology and speed up the pace at which it enters the market.</P>
      <P>TSMC is one of many Taiwanese high tech companies that are eager to diversify by
entering the green energy sector.</P>
      <P>Last year, the company announced plans to buy a 20 percent stake in Taiwan's
Motech Industries, another solar cell producer, and has also invested in the
light-emitting diode (LED) business through a venture capitalist.</P>

      <P>A local medical volunteer who spent a month in AIDS-ravaged Swaziland last year,
is holding a photo exhibition in Taipei to showcase images she took of the
African country.</P>
      <P>As the world turns its focus on South Africa for the ongoing 2010 World Cup,
neighboring Swaziland -- just a two-hour drive from Cape Town -- is struggling
to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS, said Chang Juei-tsi, adding that the disease,
which affects 26.1 percent of all adults there, had reduced life expectancy to
just 32 years as of 2009.</P>
      <P>Despite the dire situation, the country is filled with love, according to 25
-year-old Chang, who spent her time there with cameraman Yen Liang-an recording
video clips and capturing images in hospitals, orphanages, elementary schools
and rural areas of the country.</P>
      <P>Her exhibition, scheduled to run until July 25, is taking place at the Museum of
Contemporary Art Taipei Plaza and the Zhongshan Metro underground mall.</P>
      <P>Chang began her volunteer work four years ago when she joined a medical mission
to Malawi organized by the Taipei Medical University.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, remarks by Taiwanese doctor Cheng Chien-yu that "we are not
Dr. Albert Schweitzer and cannot make an immediate change" in the country made
her realize that even though volunteers like her cannot significantly improve
local disease control, they can spread a little joy, happiness and fun to local
children, patients and orphans.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Local apathy to BP spill may reflect isolation, media indifference</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)
06/21/10  18:29:35
(By Jenny W. Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While the world has come together in a concerted outcry against British
Petroleum over a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, environmental groups
in Taiwan have been conspicuously quiet and absent from the global campaign.</P>
      <P>From a bare-it-all bike ride in Miami to a Madrid protest in the pouring rain,
tens of thousands of people in over 50 cities on five continents -- but not in
Taiwan -- stood in solidarity on June 12 to demonstrate against BP's handling of
the spill caused by an explosion at its Deepwater Horizon oil rig on April 20.</P>
      <P>"As far as the Taiwanese public is concerned, the World Cup is the only
important thing that's happening in the international community right now, "
Wang Chun-shou, the head of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union, said
cynically.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's silence on the BP explosion has not surprised Hsieh Ying-shih,
chairman  of the Environmental  Quality  Protection Foundation and an
environmental activist for 30 years, because major global environmental
accidents have rarely drawn shows of protest here.</P>
      <P>He said one reason for Taiwan's seemingly apathetic attitude is the country's
long-term isolation from the international community.</P>
      <P>Due to Taiwan's unique political situation and its historical tension with
Beijing, it has received little access for decades to international groups, such
as the United Nations, and therefore often lacks first-hand information on
happenings in other parts of the world, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is not a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol, and it was not until two years
ago that the government started to push for observer status at the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.</P>
      <P>"The long-term effect of the isolation is that our focus became more inward than
outward. It's not because we are complacent or ignorant of what's going on, it's
because sometimes we simply don't have enough direct access to the issue," Hsieh
said.</P>
      <P>He believes that groups in Taiwan are outraged by the major eco-crisis but just
not as outspoken as their foreign counterparts.</P>
      <P>Wu Hung, executive director of the Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan,
agreed with Hsieh, saying that until recently Taiwan was an "international
orphan." This prevented local NGOs from being sufficiently or promptly informed
on global issues, he suggested.</P>
      <P>Both men acknowledged, however, that the country's political quagmire was only
one factor in the public's indifference to global environmental issues and could
not be used as an excuse. They accused local media of also failing to properly
inform the public.</P>
      <P>"Since the explosion, the news channels in Taiwan have not done any in-depth
reporting on the situation. People have little reason to think the spill has
anything to do with them or Taiwan," Wu said.</P>
      <P>A Google search using the keywords "British Petroleum oil leak" and "Taiwan" in
Chinese generated 244 results from media outlets, while keywords looking for the
latest gossip on the romance between two pop stars yielded 3,318 results.</P>
      <P>So far, no local reporters or U.S.-based Taiwanese correspondents have visited
the U.S. Gulf Coast to do any eyewitness reporting.</P>
      <P>"It is pitiful that Taiwan's media is not interested  in environmental news. We
are not just citizens of Taiwan but citizens of the world, and we should regard
eco-crises in other countries as our business," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Many green groups in Taiwan are aware and even indignant about BP's "nonchalant
and self-serving" attitude in dealing with the crisis, he said.</P>
      <P>But since there is still a lack of precise information on the crisis,  including
on the cause of explosion,  "we are still brainstorming about what we can do and
how to contribute to the solution while living in Taiwan," he explained.</P>
      <P>Wang said his group has joined a petition initiated by a foreign organization to
decry BP's actions.</P>
      <P>Environmental lawyer Robin Winkler, who serves as an official of the Green Party
Taiwan, said he believes some actions are being organized for the next couple of
weeks.</P>
      <P>"However the (Taiwanese) groups may just be staying low key -- BP is a powerful
corporation -- for now," he wrote in an e-mail.</P>
      <P>Hsieh and Wu said another reason for their organizations' reticence is that
Taiwan is not experienced in dealing with such situations because it does not
engage in deep-water drilling or exploration projects, and they want to be sure
that their criticism is soundly based.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of Foreign affairs, Taiwan has offered to help the
U.S. with cleanup efforts.</P>
      <P>Looking to the future, Hsieh is not sure if Taiwan's next generation will play a
more active and progressive role in global matters,  saying  the  deep-rooted
tradition  of  an  insular "domestic-centric education" will have a lingering
effect.</P>
      <P>"There is still a long road ahead of us, but we are making small steps in the
right direction," he said.</P>

      <P>The National Youth Commission said on Monday that when Canada begins accepting
work-holiday applications on July 1, young Taiwanese traveling to Canada will be
allowed to apply for loans of up to NT$120,000 (US$3,780) to help finance their
trips.</P>
      <P>"So far we only accept applicants going to New Zealand, Australia and Japan, but
we will change the regulation to include Canada in the near future, " Alice
Chang, section chief of the commission under the Executive Yuan, told the
Central News Agency by telephone.</P>
      <P>In April, Canada signed a working-holiday agreement with Taiwan, permitting
young people to travel and work in the two countries, she said. Taiwanese and
Canadians aged 18 to 35 who meet the requirements will be allowed to work while
traveling in each other's countries on multi-entry visas valid for up to one
year.</P>
      <P>"Canada became the fourth country to sign a working-holiday agreement with
Taiwan, after Japan, New Zealand and Australia," Chang said.</P>
      <P>One unique  aspect of the Taiwan-Canada  deal is the age requirement,  Chang
noted. The other three countries stipulate applicants be between 18 and 30.</P>
      <P>In the early stages, however, Canada will only provide 200 such visas a year.
Japan currently accepts up to 2,000 applications annually, and New Zealand's
quota is 600. Australia accepted more than 10,000 last year.</P>
      <P>The commission held a seminar last week to inform young people of their options,
inviting a Canadian Trade office in Taipei official to explain the procedure.</P>
      <P>"Many young people attended the seminar and were happy to have an opportunity to

      <P>In the seminar, the official reminded applicants to present applications
starting July 1, 2010.</P>

      <P>Two of Taiwan's leading chip manufacturers and packagers signed an agreement
Monday with Japanese memory chip maker Elpida Memory Inc. to jointly develop
integrated circuit (IC) packaging technology.</P>
      <P>United Microelectronics Corp (UMC) , the world's second largest contract chip
maker, and Powertech Technology Inc. (PTI), one of the world's biggest memory
chip packager, allied with Elpida to develop chips that can transfer data faster
than ever.</P>
      <P>"The three companies  will join forces to develop  3D IC integration technology
in which we can stack chips vertically with cutting edge 'through silicon via'
(TSV) technology, " a Powertech executive close to the case told the Central
News Agency.</P>
      <P>The executive said the three companies are a perfect match because  of their
complementary  expertise.  Elpida,  he said, specializes in dynamic random
access memory (DRAM) chip production technology, while UMC's strength is logic
chip manufacturing, and Powertech is an IC packaging and testing service
specialist.</P>
      <P>He said the cooperative arrangement is expected to develop a total 3D IC logic
and DRAM integration solution, including the use of the 28 nanometer production
process.</P>
      <P>"We hope we will be able to present the first result of the deal to the market
in 2012," the executive said.</P>
      <P>In a joint statement, Takao Adachi, Elpida's chief technology officer, said the
joint development of TSV integration "means we need less expensive product
technology and a manufacturing process that can handle large-volume production
on neutral ground.</P>
      <P>"We can accomplish this by working with PTI," Adachi said.</P>
      <P>UMC unveiled its 40nm production process in October 2009 and is expected to
introduce its 20nm process to customers by the end of 2010.</P>
      <P>"As a foundry provider of integrated 3D IC solutions, we are excited to partner
with Elpida and PTI to develop a fully integrated TSV solution suitable for a
wide range of applications, " said S.C. Chien, vice president and head of
advanced technology development at UMC, in the statement.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese  and Chinese police are cooperating in efforts to fight fraudsters and
have launched the biggest-ever coordinated operation on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait, the Criminal Investigation Bureau said Monday.</P>
      <P>The bureau said Taiwanese police cracked down on 57 locations in 12 counties
that day, arresting 66 suspects and seizing NT$60 million (US$1.87 million) ,
while police in China simultaneously struck thousands of locations in more than
20 provinces. Stopping scams has been named as the top priority this year for
China's police.</P>

      <P>The bureau said that compared to the more-than 24,000 cases of scam and fraud
involving some NT$7 billion in the first half of 2009, about 20,000 cases
involving NT$4 billion were reported in the same period of this year, which

      <P>A local performance group will present the romantic comedy "Apartment 3A, "
written by Hollywood actor Jeff Daniels, for the first time in Taiwan on July 3
and 4 at Crown Theater in Taipei, the group said Monday.</P>
      <P>Don Tung, the head of the Tungco Performance Group and the play's director, said
Apartment 3A, to be staged in English with Chinese subtitles,  will give
audiences a new definition of love and relationships,</P>
      <P>Apartment 3A was written in 1996 -- two years after Daniels starred in Dumb and
Dumber with Jim Carrey. The play premiered in New York at the ArcLight Theater
and has toured around America since then, Tung said.</P>
      <P>The play, described as " written with wit, conviction and a real affection for
its characters" by the New York Times in 2006, tells the story of a modern
career woman who decides to start a new life after seeing her boyfriend commit
an act of infidelity, but whose life becomes more chaotic after moving into
Apartment 3A.</P>
      <P>According  to  Tung,  Daniels  expresses  the  anger  and dissatisfaction people
in modern society feel and shows how even though they never stop complaining
about life, they still insist on doing what they feel is right.</P>
      <P>"Daniels captures this sense of 'being disappointed because they care too much'
incisively and sympathetically," Tung said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lawmakers divided on whether to withdraw troops from Dongyin</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators of different political persuasions expressed divided views Monday on
whether Taiwan should consider withdrawing troops from the outlying island of
Dongyin to maintain peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers were responding to a report in the Liberty Times in which an
unidentified army general predicted that China may push the United States to
force Taiwan to withdraw troops from Dongyin in exchange for its removal of the
1,000-plus ballistic missiles targeted at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>China is likely to make the demand after it failed in its attempt to dissuade
the United States from selling defensive weapons to Taiwan in exchange  for its
missile redeployment,  the report speculated.</P>
      <P>The paper quoted the general as saying China realizes it is unlikely to succeed
in having the U.S. end arms sales to Taiwan because such deals are an obligation
under the Taiwan Relations Act -- the U.S. law that regulates relations with
Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>According to the general, China's real target is to have the U.S. force Taiwan
to withdraw troops from Dongyin, a strategically important small islet in the
Taiwan Strait off the coast of China's Fujian Province and the northernmost tip
of Taiwan's territory.</P>
      <P>Because Dongyin sits on the northern opening of the Taiwan Strait, the general
said, it can serve as a surveillance and reconnaissance base in peacetime and
could help impose a blockade during wartime.</P>
      <P>Given its special strategic location, Dongyin has been built into a strong
fortress to help safeguard Taiwan, the paper said. It noted that Taiwan has
never tried to cut its troops stationed there even as it reduced its military
forces in two other outlying islands under its control -- Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lin Yu-fang said he has never heard of any
U.S. intentions to force Taiwan to withdraw troops from Dongyin in exchange for
China's missile redeployment.</P>
      <P>"I receive more than 10 delegations of senior U.S. congressional aides in Taipei
and meet with scores of U.S. Pentagon and State Department officials a year in
my capacity as head of a Taiwan-U.S. parliamentary friendship group, but I have
never heard of anything like what the paper has reported," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has dramatically  lowered the number of its troops stationed in Kinmen
and Matsu to a few thousand, Lin said, and it is time for China to reciprocate
by removing its missiles targeted at Taiwan or trim the number of its servicemen
stationed opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"There is absolutely no reason to justify any request at the moment for Taiwan
to further withdraw its troops from outlying islands, including Dongyin," Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Huang Wei-cher
contended, however, that withdrawing some troops from Dongyin was a proposal
worthy of consideration.</P>
      <P>"Such a move can serve as an olive branch to signify peace in the Taiwan Strait,
" Huang argued, adding that President Ma Ying-jeou himself once mentioned that
Kinmen and Matsu should eventually be de-militarized.</P>
      <P>The issue about China's possible military redeployment drew media attention
after senior U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein said during a recent Senate hearing
that Chinese leaders mentioned during her Beijing trip earlier this month the
proposal of redeploying its missiles in exchange for an end to U.S. arms sales
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response, senior U.S. officials said China has never presented any concrete
plan about such an overture.</P>
      <P>According to the Liberty Times, Taiwan has invariably maintained a military
force of more than 3,000 servicemen on Dongyin, which covers an area of less
than 5 square kilometers.</P>
      <P>It further said a CM12 armored vehicle unit has been deployed on Dongyin since
2007 and land-based anti-ship missiles with a range of 150 km have also been
deployed there.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the paper said, Dongyin also boasts a Sky Bow (Tien Kung) missile
battery equipped with Sky Bow IIB surface-to-surface missiles that have a range
of 600 km, long enough to reach Shanghai.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that Taiwan and the United States are in
negotiations on signing an extradition  agreement and resuming talks under the
Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) to promote bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>During a meeting  with Texas Governor  Rick Perry at the Presidential Office, Ma
noted that Taiwan is also in the process of talks with Washington on granting
visa-free status to ROC citizens for travel to the U.S.</P>
      <P>He said he hoped the negotiations would have positive outcomes as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>This is Perry's first visit to Taiwan since he took office in December 2000, the
president said, adding that Taiwan has maintained sisterhood ties with Texas
since 1988 and both sides have conducted closer exchanges in the areas of
technology, culture, education and agriculture.</P>
      <P>Ma said that Taiwan is Texas' 12th largest export market and that many Taiwanese
businesses are operating in the U.S. state, including petrochemical giant
Formosa Plastics Group and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd., with investment
exceeding US$5 billion.</P>
      <P>The president also noted that Taiwan has signed a memorandum of understanding

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's export orders posted their third highest monthly total on record in
May, unaffected by Europe's debt crisis or the weakening euro, government
figures showed Monday.</P>
      <P>Export orders in May totaled US$33.73 billion, up 34.03 percent from a year
earlier, but they were down slightly from the US$33.96 billion in orders
received in April.</P>
      <P>Huang Ji-shih, the statistics department head of the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, forecast at a press briefing that Taiwan's export order value in June
was also expected to rise slightly from a year earlier as Europe's debt crisis
eases and demand from emerging markets grows.</P>
      <P>He said that in May, the European debt crisis had little impact on Taiwanese
companies, including Acer Inc., the world's second largest personal computer
maker exports 60 percent of its products to Europe.</P>
      <P>"Acer was not affected by the European debt crisis and the plunging euro in May
as its revenues rose significantly from April, " he said, referring to Acer's
36-percent sequential revenue growth.</P>
      <P>Overall, Taiwan's export orders from Europe totaled US$5.57 billion in May, up
42.17 percent from last year. But Huang said that despite the high annual
growth, the value was not high, indicating slow economic recovery in Europe.</P>
      <P>In terms of specific product categories, Huang said Acer's performance reflected
the strong general environment for information and communications products,
orders for which grew 39.25 percent in May from last year, the third biggest
increase on record.</P>
      <P>Huang attributed the growth to stable demand for notebook computers, rising
sales of smartphones and last year's relatively low baseline for export orders.</P>
      <P>The growing demand for information and communications products helped spur
export orders for electronics products -- including semiconductors and memory
chips -- to rise 32.75 percent in May from a year earlier, the second highest
single month growth ever for the category, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, export orders for precision instruments, including flat panels,
jumped 46.61 percent in May, setting a single-month all time high, as flat panel
demand in China remained strong, the official noted.</P>
      <P>Information and communications products, electronics products and precision
instruments together account for more than 50 percent of the total export orders
Taiwan receives.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on speculation that the Chinese yuan could appreciate 3 to 5
percent by the end of this year, Huang predicted that it would have little
impact on Taiwan's exports as Taiwanese companies have coped well with the
falling euro.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's export orders from China in May totaled US$9.51 billion, slightly down
from March's US$9.81 billion and April's US$9.82 billion.</P>
      <P>Huang blamed the decrease on falling automobile sales in China, which he said
affected Taiwan's exports of plastics and rubber to China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is going to invite former
President Lee Teng-hui to join them in its June 26 parade in Taipei to protest
the country's proposed trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Chih-chang said his party has also invited former Vice
President Annette Lu, and former Premiers Yu Shyi-kun and Frank Hsieh to join
the protests that day.</P>
      <P>As the spiritual leader of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (DPP), Lee is
an outspoken critic of President Ma Ying-jeou's policy of reconciling with
China, and the TSU had tried in vain to push a national referendum on the
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Lu, Yu and Hsieh will serve as the co-leaders of the protest, and will be joined
by the party's candidates for chiefs of the country's five special
municipalities -- Su Tseng-chang, who is running for mayor of Taipei, Tsai Ing-
wen in Xinbei City, Su Jia-chyuan in Taichung, Lai Ching-te in Tainan, and Chen
Chu in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chih-chang said more than 100,000 participants from around Taiwan are
expected to gather in Taipei to call for a referendum on the pact, and to
protest the integration of the market of Taiwan with that of China under the
"one-China" mantra.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the participants will be divided into two groups, with one gathering
at Wanhua Railway Station and the other at Dinghao Square in eastern part of
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Both of them will rally at 3 p.m., and begin marching toward Ketagalan Boulevard
in front of the Presidential Office at 4 p.m., arriving there at 5 p.m., and
breaking up at 7 p.m.</P>
      <P>Claiming that President Ma Ying-jeou has broken his promise of allowing people
to decide the country's future by rejecting the opposition's requests for a
referendum on the pact, the spokesman invited people who are concerned about
Taiwan's future to take to the street.</P>
      <P>The DPP's Kaohsiung chapter which began to receive people's applications to
attend the protest Monday estimated that it could mobilize about 2,000
participants for the protest.</P>
      <P>The chapter said each participant has to pay NT$600 (US$18.9) for bus fare to
Taipei and meals.</P>
      <P>Several DPP lawmakers and city councilors in Kaohsiung have already begun
lobbying their supporters to join the protest.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) took the DPP's protest plan in
stride Monday, with its spokesman Su Jun-pin saying that his party respects the
opposition's  right to air their dissenting opinion.</P>
      <P>However, the spokesman said the DPP protest lacks a clear appeal, focusing
solely on advocating a referendum on the issue, and he wondered if such a stance
was worth the social costs the protest would entail.</P>
      <P>As to DPP's invitation to Lee Teng-hui, the spokesman said everyone has the
right to express his opinion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Parliamentary diplomacy' offers Taiwan alternative path: speaker</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>"Parliament diplomacy" can help Taiwan pave an alternative path in carving out
its role in the international arena and deserves more credit, attention and
resources, Taiwan's legislative speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking to dozens of future diplomats in a training class, Wang said this type
of diplomacy will help Taiwan develop its "smart power" to gain mutual benefit
for Taiwan and other countries.</P>
      <P>He defined parliamentary diplomacy as the speaker or deputy speaker  of the
parliament  visiting  and  receiving  foreign parliamentarians, attending
international meetings and organizations or establishing "Friends of Taiwan"
groups to increase Taiwan's international exposure and visibility.</P>
      <P>"The Legislative Yuan is the official branch of Taiwan's government, but at the
same time it also plays a role as a democratic body in representing the people,"
Wang said.</P>
      <P>"That is why the parliament  is not that 'sensitive'  an institution in the
arena of diplomacy, where China has been blocking Taiwan's 'traditional
diplomacy' for years."</P>
      <P>Taiwan is able to take advantage of parliamentary diplomacy as an unconventional
path in developing relations with foreign countries, especially those that do
not establish official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, said Wang, 69.</P>
      <P>The Legislative  Yuan has been very active  in developing relationships with
foreign parliaments, especially in the U.S., Japan and Europe, he said.</P>
      <P>During the current legislature that began in February 2008, the Legislature has
received 34 presidential or congressional delegations, 764 foreign delegations
and 13,958 foreign parliamentarians.</P>
      <P>Wang told his audience that his friendship with former Japanese Prime Minister
Taro Aso dates back 30 years and the relationship between Taiwanese and Japanese
parliamentarians has always been strong.</P>
      <P>That relationship, he said, explains why Taiwan was able to maintain solid
relations with Japan after a Taiwanese fishing vessel sank in Japanese-
controlled Tiaoyutai waters following a collision with a Japanese ship, sparking
diplomatic tensions between the two countries in June 2008.</P>
      <P>Similarly  solid relations between Taiwan and the European Parliament,  Wang
suggested,  prevented the European body from condemning Taiwan after the
government executed four death row inmates in April, the first executions in
Taiwan in almost five years.</P>
      <P>The body's aggressive approach in participating in international organizations,
including the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) , Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum
(APPF)  and Parliament of the Americas (COPA) , drew China's intervention
despite the diplomatic truce which Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou has been
advocating, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Parliamentary diplomacy deserves more attention and resources because
parliaments in all countries have an impact on their countries foreign policies,
he contended.</P>

      <P>A Hong Kong-based consortium will extend the deadline for its purchase of Nan
Shan Life Insurance Co., the Taiwan arm of American International Group Inc.,
from July 12 to Oct. 12, the group and AIG jointly announced Monday.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong group comprised of Primus Financial Holdings and China Strategic
Holdings reached an agreement with AIG on Oct. 13, 2009 to acquire the debt-
ridden company's 97.57 percent stake in Nan Shan, Taiwan's biggest life insurer,
for US$2.15 billion.</P>
      <P>The deal was supposed to be completed July 12, or nine months after signing the
deal, according to the agreement.</P>
      <P>But the consortium's application to complete the purchase is still being
reviewed by Taiwan's Investment Commission, and there was speculation the
proposed sale would be canceled if the acquisition was not approved by the July
12 contractual deadline.</P>
      <P>The sale has been particularly  sensitive  because Chinese companies are
prohibited from owning Taiwanese insurance companies. Any overseas company in
which Chinese investors have more than a 30 percent stake is considered a
Chinese company.</P>
      <P>The deal has come under close scrutiny because of concerns among Taiwan's
financial regulators that the consortium is backed by Chinese capital and has no
experience running a life insurer.</P>
      <P>The two companies said their decision to extend the deadline demonstrated their
resolution to complete the deal.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after the consortium issued a joint statement June 11 that
it would put US$325 million of the purchase price in an escrow account for a
four-year period to strengthen the Taiwanese insurer's capital.</P>

      <P>The coastline of the Taiwan-held outlying island of Kinmen has been awash in
garbage from China in recent days after several southern Chinese provinces were
pounded by torrential rains, a county government official said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Our coastal waters and beaches  from Liaoluo Bay in the southeastern corner of
the island to Tsuhu Beach on the northwestern tip have all been under attack
from garbage from China, " the official said.</P>
      <P>He said the large amount of trash, bamboo poles, driftwood and pigweed have
seriously affected Kinmen's coastal environment and landscape.</P>
      <P>More than 120 environmental protection volunteers, township garbage cleaners and
Kinmen National Park Administration staff have been cleaning up the coastal
regions since June 17, the official said.</P>
      <P>"As of Sunday, more than 60 tons of waste had been cleared up, " the official
said, adding that the amount was a new record for the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>According to the official, many southern Chinese provinces, Jiangxi and Fujian
in particular, were battered by rainstorms in recent weeks, leading to flooding
in mountainous regions.</P>
      <P>The floodwaters washed down driftwood, pigweed and household garbage along with
poultry and livestock carcasses which eventually flowed into oceans along with
riverwater and drifted to Kinmen, which is as close as 3 kilometers to China's
coast.</P>
      <P>Garbage and driftwood have gravely impaired Kinmen's scenic beaches and
coastlines. At the county government's request, Kinmen military authorities
dispatched 90 servicemen to help the cleanup work Monday.</P>
      <P>Noting that garbage from China has long been a headache, the official said the
county government has discussed the issue with Chinese authorities in Xiamen,
the city that lies opposite Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Although the Xiamen government has launched a project to manage and clean up
floating garbage, the official said, the recent phenomenon indicates that there
is still ample room for Xiamen to improve its management measures.</P>
      <P>"We will continue pushing Xiamen to take more effective steps to maintain clean
a environment and protect marine lives and ecology, " he added.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan dollar rose by 0.6 percent against the U.S. dollar Monday, following
the path of China's yuan, which gained 0.4 percent against the greenback after
China indicated it would allow some appreciation of its currency.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan dollar closed at NT$31.999 to the U.S. dollar Monday, while the yuan
ended the day at 6.7976 yuan to the greenback.</P>
      <P>Lin Sun-yuan, director general of the Foreign Exchange Department under the
Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) said the surge in the Taiwan
dollar is very "healthy."</P>
      <P>But he warned speculators against pouring hot money into the Taiwan dollar,
vowing that the central bank would see to it that incoming foreign capital would
be put into the stock market rather than in currency trading.</P>
      <P>One local analyst predicted that the New Taiwan dollar will fluctuate between
NT$31.5 and NT$32.1 in the middle- to long-term against the U.S. currency.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile local businessmen were mixed in their reaction to the 0.4 percent one-
day surge in the value of China's yuan, which was the largest appreciation in
five years.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yi-sheng, an executive with the RT-MART's Shanghai branch, said Monday that
the appreciation of the yuan, the hike in China's minimum wage and the
conclusion of the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan
and China will combine to create a strong opportunity for Taiwanese businessmen
to sell to China's market.</P>
      <P>In a seminar with local businessmen, Hsu said the appreciation of the yuan will
strengthen the competitiveness of Taiwan's products in China.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the ECFA will provide Taiwan products with tariff-free access
to the Chinese market, and the rising wages of Chinese workers will increase
their buying power.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's products are being sold to Europe and America, Hsu said
there is no reason Taiwan products cannot break into China.</P>
      <P>However,  a Taiwanese businessman who produces textiles in Zhejiang Province
complained to the Central News Agency that he would have trouble surviving if
the value of the yuan rose by more than 3 percent.</P>

      <P>The government has launched a campaign encouraging workers at various government
agencies and schools to take action during the summer to help cut carbon dioxide
emissions and conserve energy.</P>
      <P>Among the actions under the campaign, men in the public sector are being asked
to take the lead in not wearing suits and ties to save on air conditioning.</P>
      <P>According to data compiled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, between 2007 and
2009, electricity consumption at various government agencies and schools
decreased by 124.74 million kilowatt hours (kWh) , which translates into a
reduction of 77,700 tons of carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>Setting air conditioners one degree Celsius higher than usual will help save 6
percent in power consumption, the MOEA said in citing related reports, which
would save 1 billion kilowatts in energy annually nationwide.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has also organized a competition encouraging central and
local government  agencies and public colleges or universities to move to cut
carbon emissions and save energy as part of the country's efforts to curb global

    <TEXT>
      <P>The coastline of the Taiwan-held outlying island of Kinmen has been awash in
garbage from China in recent days after several southern Chinese provinces were
pounded by torrential rains, a county government official said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Our coastal waters and beaches  from Liaoluo Bay in the southeastern corner of
the island to Tsuhu Beach on the northwestern tip have all been under attack
from garbage from China, " the official said.</P>
      <P>He said the large amount of trash, bamboo poles, driftwood and pigweed have
seriously affected Kinmen's coastal environment and landscape.</P>
      <P>More than 120 environmental protection volunteers, township garbage cleaners and
Kinmen National Park Administration staff have been cleaning up the coastal
regions since June 17, the official said.</P>
      <P>"As of Sunday, more than 60 tons of waste had been cleared up, " the official
said, adding that the amount was a new record for the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>According to the official, many southern Chinese provinces, Jiangxi and Fujian
in particular, were battered by rainstorms in recent weeks, leading to flooding
in mountainous regions.</P>
      <P>The floodwaters washed down driftwood, pigweed and household garbage along with
poultry and livestock carcasses which eventually flowed into oceans along with
riverwater and drifted to Kinmen, which is as close as 3 kilometers to China's
coast.</P>
      <P>Garbage and driftwood have gravely impaired Kinmen's scenic beaches and
coastlines. At the county government's request, Kinmen military authorities
dispatched 90 servicemen to help the cleanup work Monday.</P>
      <P>Noting that garbage from China has long been a headache, the official said the
county government has discussed the issue with Chinese authorities in Xiamen,
the city that lies opposite Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Although the Xiamen government has launched a project to manage and clean up
floating garbage, the official said, the recent phenomenon indicates that there
is still ample room for Xiamen to improve its management measures.</P>
      <P>"We will continue pushing Xiamen to take more effective steps to maintain clean
a environment and protect marine lives and ecology, " he added.</P>

      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Monday that it is
planning one or two model projects this year to help create green jobs.</P>
      <P>The nation's top economic planning agency said its initiative is based on 2010
being the year of energy conservation and carbon dioxide emission cuts, and the
year of creating more jobs.</P>
      <P>"To combine the two major policies, the council is mulling one or two model
projects in a bid to create many job opportunities, " the CEPD said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>The council said it is studying the approaches of European countries  and the
United  States  to turn the jobless  into "green-collar workers."</P>
      <P>Green-collar  workers are workers who are employed in the environmental sectors
of the economy. They generally are involved in implementing  environmentally
conscious design,  policies,  and technologies to improve conservation and
sustainability.</P>
      <P>The CEPD will work out substantive measures on developing green energy, green
transportation, and green building and make a plan for one or two model projects
that will allow the participation of the private sector, the statement said.</P>
      <P>CEPD official Cheng Chia-chin cited such examples as government buildings
installing solar power equipment on rooftops, or developing batteries for
electric cars locally.</P>
      <P>"We hope to prioritize the promotion of those projects that will lure the

      <P>The Taiwan dollar rose by 0.6 percent against the U.S. dollar Monday, following
the path of China's yuan, which gained 0.4 percent against the greenback after
China indicated it would allow some appreciation of its currency.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan dollar closed at NT$31.999 to the U.S. dollar Monday, while the yuan
ended the day at 6.7976 yuan to the greenback.</P>
      <P>Lin Sun-yuan, director general of the Foreign Exchange Department under the
Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) said the surge in the Taiwan
dollar is very "healthy."</P>
      <P>But he warned speculators against pouring hot money into the Taiwan dollar,
vowing that the central bank would see to it that incoming foreign capital would
be put into the stock market rather than in currency trading.</P>
      <P>One local analyst predicted that the New Taiwan dollar will fluctuate between
NT$31.5 and NT$32.1 in the middle- to long-term against the U.S. currency.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile local businessmen were mixed in their reaction to the 0.4 percent one-
day surge in the value of China's yuan, which was the largest appreciation in
five years.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yi-sheng, an executive with the RT-MART's Shanghai branch, said Monday that
the appreciation of the yuan, the hike in China's minimum wage and the
conclusion of the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan
and China will combine to create a strong opportunity for Taiwanese businessmen
to sell to China's market.</P>
      <P>In a seminar with local businessmen, Hsu said the appreciation of the yuan will
strengthen the competitiveness of Taiwan's products in China.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the ECFA will provide Taiwan products with tariff-free access
to the Chinese market, and the rising wages of Chinese workers will increase
their buying power.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's products are being sold to Europe and America, Hsu said
there is no reason Taiwan products cannot break into China.</P>
      <P>However,  a Taiwanese businessman who produces textiles in Zhejiang Province
complained to the Central News Agency that he would have trouble surviving if
the value of the yuan rose by more than 3 percent.</P>
      <P>Another Taiwanese businessman working in Kunshan predicted that the yuan would
not surge by more than 3 percent and would not pose a threat to his business.</P>

service.  For if it is wrong to ignore the duties arising out of  the  relations
between  the members of a man's family, how is it right  for  a  man  to ignore
the duties he owes to his sovereign and country?"</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: A challenge for export-oriented businesses</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/22/10  10:52:47
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's central bank announced June 19 that it will allow greater flexibility in
the yuan's exchange rate, which fueled anticipation of a gradual rise in the
value of the Chinese currency.</P>
      <P>Although the extent of the appreciation may be limited, the policy nonetheless
signifies that China is adjusting its industrial structure and is paying more
attention to sectors that target the domestic market. This will pose a major
challenge for export-oriented Taiwanese businesses in China.</P>
      <P>To overcome the challenge, these businesses will need to increase their added-
value by developing their own brands. This might be a difficult path, but there
have been numerous successful examples, such as computer vendors Acer and Asus.</P>
      <P>Only by building their own brands will the businesses have the ability to
integrate  their industrial  value chain resources. Otherwise,  they will be
forced to relocate  their production operations to other places that offer
cheaper labor. (June 22, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese pitcher Chien-Ming Wang may return to the Major Leagues in early
August if his recovery from shoulder surgery continues to proceed smoothly,
executives from the Washington Nationals said Monday.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with Jason Yuan, Taiwan's representative to the United States,
Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo told the media that it was hard to pinpoint
a date for Wang's return, but he hoped it would be by early August.</P>
      <P>After winning 38 games for the New York Yankees in 2006 and 2007, Wang was beset
by injuries the next two years, missing much of the second half of 2008 with a
serious foot injury and pitching only 12 games for the Yankees in 2009 before
having shoulder surgery in July.</P>
      <P>The Nationals signed Wang in the off-season after the Yankees did not offer him
a tender, hoping he would be available for part of the 2010 season.</P>
      <P>Rizzo acknowledged that the surgery to repair a torn shoulder capsule has kept
other players out at least 18 months, so Wang's long recovery period has not
been unusual.</P>
      <P>But he said Wang has been a model patient at a rehab center in Florida and has
already started to throw from the mound. If the practice sessions go well, Rizzo
added, Wang could start throwing batting practice in the next few days.</P>
      <P>If that goes well, he could eventually be inserted into the Nationals' five-man
starting rotation, Rizzo said.</P>
      <P>Nationals President Stan Kasten stressed, however, that the most important issue
now is whether Wang can make a full recovery.</P>
      <P>He said the club would not use the 30-year-old Tainan native until his shoulder
had completely healed because it does not see Wang as simply a short-term
stopgap but as somebody who can pitch this year, next year, and in future years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Price cuts or franchise tax</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/22/10  11:44:53
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing recently announced that fares for cross-Taiwan Strait flights will be
decreased by 10-15 percent. This is a reasonable development.</P>
      <P>The fares that have drawn the most attention are for the newly launched  direct
flights between Taipei's Songshan Airport and Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport, which
take only 80 minutes one way but cost NT$18,000 round trip due to high demand
and limited supply. A Taipei-Shanghai flight via Hong Kong costs only around
NT$8,600 although it involves a longer flight distance.</P>
      <P>The high air fares are the result of a "joint monopoly" by air carriers of the
two sides. While the profits obtained by the Chinese air carriers will go to
China's national coffers because they are all state-owned, Taiwanese air
carriers are making lucrative profits from the route because they are privately
run.</P>
      <P>If the monopoly situation does not change, Taiwan can consider imposing a
franchise tax on its air carriers to offset the distortion of the price
mechanism.</P>
      <P>Of course, cutting air fares to give back to customers should still be the first
choice. (June 22, 2010)</P>

an attempt to stave off a "hot money" attack on the Taiwan dollar.</P>
      <P>The move came in response to volatility in currency markets caused  by China's
announcement  that it would allow greater flexibility for the Chinese yuan, also
known as renminbi (RMB).</P>
      <P>The new "bans" reportedly include no overnight U.S. dollar short selling, no
concentration of trading late in sessions, and no NDF (non-deliverable-forward)
trading.</P>
      <P>The central bank reportedly has also barred major banks from offering currency
forwards to exporters who do not have documented deals for which currency
hedging would be necessary.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Commercial Bank:</P>
      <P>The NT dollar gained NT$0.47 at one point in Monday's trading, but finished only
NT$0.19, or 0.6 percent, higher than Friday's close at NT$31.999 to the
greenback, due largely to the central bank's intervention late in the session.</P>
      <P>In comparison with other Asian currencies, the NT dollar was relatively stable,
said Lin Sun-yuan, director-general of the central bank's Department of Foreign
Exchange. The Malaysian ringgit spiked 7 percent and the Korean won rose 2.61
percent, he said.</P>
      <P>On huge "hot money" inflows into Asian markets, Lin said the central bank will
closely watch whether money remitted into Taiwan for the stated purpose of
investing in the stock market was genuinely being used for that goal.</P>
      <P>"We do not want to see such money being used for currency speculation," Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Although Chinese authorities and state media warned against expectations of a
rapid rise for the renminbi, the currency ended at its strongest level against
the U.S. dollar since mid-2005.</P>
      <P>The yuan closed at 6.7976 to the U.S. greenback, up 0.4 percent from Friday's
close. Market analysts said the hike reflected strong demand for the currency
that underlies near-universal expectations it will appreciate.</P>
      <P>Christina Liu, chairwoman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development,
predicted Monday, however, that the yuan will not repeat the strong rise it
showed in 2005.</P>
      <P>She also suggested that if Asian currencies fluctuated too dramatically, the
central banks of major Asian countries would jointly intervene to fight against
"hot money" attacks on their currencies to maintain regional financial
stability.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Andy Xie, an economist and board member of Hong Kong-based Rosetta
Stone Capital Co., said Monday the renminbi will appreciate by more than 5
percent a year. (June 22, 2010)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Oliver Williamson, last year's Nobel Prize winner in economics, said in Taipei
Monday that China's move to break the renminbi's two-year peg to the greenback
could lead Taiwan to adjust its monetary policy, including policies on interest
rates and exchange rates.</P>
      <P>Williamson, who is in Taiwan to attend a forum on economic and financial
regulations during the global economic recovery, also said that a more flexible
renminbi will contribute to Taiwan's long-term economic development.</P>
      <P>He did not elaborate when asked whether Taiwan's central bank should raise
interest rates at its board meeting Thursday. (June 22, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>China's abrupt announcement of its intentions to allow greater flexibility for
renminbi has created a headache for Taiwan's central bank governor, Perng Fai-
nan, ahead of the bank's board meeting on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The central bank originally planned to discuss whether to increase domestic
interest rates at the meeting. But with pressure on the NT dollar to appreciate
increasing, the focus of the meeting has shifted from interest rates to exchange
rates.</P>
      <P>Banking sources said the possibility  of the central bank adjusting its key
interest rates in the near future has dropped from "zero to below zero" because
any interest rate hike would only further fuel appreciation of the NT dollar.
Some of them even predicted that chances for interest rate hikes this year are
slim, if not nil. (June 22, 2010).</P>

      <P>AVY Precision Technology  Inc,  a Taiwan-based producer of metal casings for
digital cameras, said Tuesday it plans to take one of its subsidiaries in China
public on Taiwan's mainboard or the over-the-counter market.</P>
      <P>AVY said the listing  of the Suzhou unit,  AVY Precision Electroplating (Suzhou)
Co. Ltd., is expected in one or two years, and it pledged to try its best to
push the plan.</P>
      <P>The Suzhou unit, capitalized at US$34 million (NT$1.08 billion), was founded in
April 2001. AVY Precision Technology owns a 49 percent stake in the unit, with
the remaining 51 percent held by Pegatron Corp., a Taiwanese contract maker of
electronic components.</P>
      <P>The Suzhou unit began producing metal casings for notebook computers at the end
of last year, and rising demand for these components has boosted its bottom
line, AVY said. The company broke even in March and was profitable in April.</P>
      <P>In May, it posted a net profit of about NT$40 million (US$1.26 million) as it
benefited from orders for metal casings placed by Apple for use in the tablet
computer iPad, the parent company added.</P>
      <P>Dell and Hewlett-Packard have also became major customers of the Suzhou unit
since notebook casing production began, AVY said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taichung County-based AVY will also push to list another subsidiary,
Ashine Precision Co. Ltd, a supplier of plastic casings for digital cameras and
multifunctional office machines in Taiwan, AVY said.</P>
      <P>Ashine, capitalized at NT$250 million, had a net profit of NT$11.65 million in
the first quarter of this year, said AVY, which owns a 66.84 percent stake in
the company.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Chan Yung-jan had not won a singles match in the main draw of Wimbledon
in four tries, seemingly cursed by draws that put her up against top-10 stars
Maria Sharapova (2007), Dinara Safina (2008) and Marion Bartoli (2009) in past
first rounds.</P>
      <P>So when this year she drew Swiss veteran Patty Schnyder, a perennial top 20
player now ranked 58th and clearly on the decline, her opportunity for a
breakthrough had finally arrived, even if she had only gone 2-8 in singles in
main WTA Tour events this year.</P>
      <P>Long touted as the next big star in Taiwanese tennis, Chan took advantage of
Schnyder's 33 unforced errors to whip her opponent 6-0, 6-2 in only 49 minutes
for her maiden singles victory at Wimbledon and only her third in 16 matches in
grand slam events.</P>
      <P>Chan will face a much tougher challenger in the second round against 12th seed
Nadia Petrova of Russia, but she told the Central News Agency after trouncing
Schnyder that the match had boosted her confidence for future encounters.</P>
      <P>Playing at Wimbledon has also given her a chance to observe the best, she said.</P>
      <P>The 20-year-old expressed her admiration for another Swiss player, Roger
Federer, the six-time Wimbledon champion who came back after being two sets down
to defeat Alejandro Falla on Monday.</P>
      <P>"Watching Federer playing is a pleasure. He is truly a king on the court," she
said.</P>
      <P>Chan also praised Federer for his ability to balance his career and family while
also treating the fans well, saying that he signs autographs patiently for each
of his fans.</P>
      <P>"He is a role model to look up to, whether on or off court," she said.</P>
      <P>Chan is also entered in the doubles and paired with Zheng Jie from China, she
could actually make some noise in the draw. They are seeded ninth at the event
and would not face another seeded pairing until the third round.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAA opposes upgrading wetland near airport</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) on Tuesday expressed strong
opposition to a plan to further conserve and upgrade a wetland located near the
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, fearing it will endanger aviation safety.</P>
      <P>CAA officials said the Hsutsuo Port Wetland in Taoyuan County's Dayuan township
is only 1.5 kilometers away from the airport, Taiwan's main international
gateway, making a potential source of danger.</P>
      <P>Once the wetland is upgraded, the officials feared, more birds will nest there
and the growing bird population will consequently create a greater threat to
flight safety.</P>
      <P>After Taoyuan Airport's third terminal is built, its new runway area will be
only about 1 kilometer away from the wetland, CAA officials said.</P>
      <P>"Greater numbers of wild birds visiting or staying in the wetland will
potentially pose greater hazards to aircraft taking off or landing," CAA
officials contended.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials from the Flight Safety Foundation, Taiwan, said it has
assisted the CAA and the military in solving bird aircraft strike hazards (BASH)
over the past decade.</P>
      <P>According to the foundation's tallies, of the 119 BASH incidents that occurred
in 2009, 100 occurred between April and September during the wild birds'
breeding season.</P>
      <P>Of the 100, 16 were serious BASH incidents, involving damage to engine blades
and dents to the aircraft's outer surfaces, according to the foundation.</P>
      <P>In 2009, Taiwanese aircraft experienced three BASH incidents while flying
abroad, all of which caused damage.</P>
      <P>Undeterred by the CAA's concerns, the Wildbird Society of Taoyuan is continuing
to push for the inclusion of the Hsutsuo Port Wetland as a national wetland
area.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chia-yang, an ornithologist and member of the society, said the wetland, a
sprawling area of some 680 hectares, is the first stop for migratory wild birds
flying south to Taiwan to winter each year.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the government is wrong to oppose the upgrading of the Hsutsuo Port
Wetland into a national wetland area simply because there are industrial
districts or airports in its proximity.</P>
      <P>He argued that there are examples in the United Kingdom of industrial complexes
co-existing harmoniously with wetlands, and that birds from wetland are not the
culprits in Taoyuan Airport's BASH incidents since most birds there fly no
higher than 150 meters in the air and fly outside the airport area.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China's central bank announced June 19 its decision to increase the yuan's
flexibility. The news was widely interpreted as a signal that the Chinese
currency  is poised  for a fresh round of appreciation.</P>
      <P>Judging from China's internal and external economic environment, however, it is
not likely that the "straight-line rise" that was experienced between mid-2005
and mid-2008 will be seen again.</P>
      <P>It is believed that the yuan's appreciation will not reach 5 percent, and may
even stay below 3 percent, in the coming year. The pattern of the rise will very
likely be "two steps forward, one step backward."</P>
      <P>We suggest that Taiwan's central bank, financial sector and investors deal
calmly with the expected increase in the yuan's value and should not base their
expectations on the experience of those three years.</P>
      <P>At the same time, we want to advise China to reform its foreign exchange market
immediately to set up a highly market-based exchange rate mechanism. (June 22,

    <HEADLINE>Pushing for sustainability, Taiwan renews national land plan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has embarked on the country's third comprehensive national land
development plan in history, aimed at "creating an innovative environment" and
"building a sustainable society" by 2030, according to the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>CEPD Vice Chairman Hwang Wang-hsiang said Tuesday that the "Strategic Plan for
National Spatial Development, " which the Executive Yuan approved in February,
covers complete national land planning in the fields of industry, resources and
manpower.</P>
      <P>It hopes to achieve  prosperous  development  in "ecology, production and
living" simultaneously to further the country's sustainable development, Hwang
said.</P>
      <P>A summary of the strategic plan will be released in book form Wednesday  to
promote  the government's  concepts  of homeland development, but the CEPD
previewed the release with a brief overview of the project Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Asserting that sustainable development of national land is vital for the
nation's long-term peace and stability and its people's well-being, the CEPD
said the plan will serve as a guideline for long-term development planning by
the central government, local governments and all government agencies.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD, the plan presents strategies to accomplish a series of
goals, including developing a safe natural ecology, creating "prime and healthy
living" conditions, " establishing a knowledge-based economy and international
logistics capability, and saving energy, reducing carbon emissions and
conserving water."</P>
      <P>Under the plan, national lands are divided into international, domestic,
regional and local hierarchies  to promote specific geographic goals and
balanced development.</P>
      <P>Under the international hierarchy, efforts will be taken to leverage  Taiwan's
key position within various global R&amp;D and manufacturing networks.</P>
      <P>The domestic hierarchy consists of three main axes (the Central Mountain Range
conservation axis, the innovation development axis in western Taiwan; and the
prime living and industrial axis in eastern Taiwan), a sea belt, and the
country's outlying islands.</P>
      <P>The regional hierarchy is divided into three major city regions in northern,
central and southern Taiwan, and an eastern region, while the local hierarchy
consists of seven regional living circles and city-county cooperation regions.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  initiated  and implemented  general  national  land development plans in
1979 and 1996, respectively.</P>
      <P>Since then,  there have been changes in the domestic and international
environments, and in Taiwan's economic and social development, which have
substantially altered the direction of national spatial development, the CEPD
said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 0.29 percent Tuesday on mild profit taking after
a strong showing in the previous session, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 22.88 points to 7,612.68, after moving between 7,610.62
and 7,639.66, on turnover of NT$76.55 billion (US$2.41 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened down 0.06 percent and continued to move lower as investors
took hints from a lackluster performance on Wall Street overnight, dealers said.</P>
      <P>While selling focused on select large cap high-tech stocks, support for domestic
demand-oriented shares, such as food processors and property developers, offset
the pressure on the broader market, they said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,427 stocks closed down, 1,364 rose and 441 stocks remained
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector fell the most of any sector, losing 0.5
percent. The cement sector closed down 0.3 percent, while the financial,
textile, and plastics and chemical sectors lost 0.2 percent each.</P>
      <P>The foodstuff sector rose 0.6 percent, the construction sector gained 0.3
percent, and paper and pulp shares closed up 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>"Yesterday's significant gains came from hopes of foreign fund inflows into the
region on a higher Chinese yuan, " Mega Securities analyst Alex Huang said.</P>
      <P>"But, the yuan is weakening today after Monday's rise, making many investors
cautious about China's foreign exchange policy: To what extent will China allow
its currency to appreciate?" Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang said it was no surprise to see some investors pocket profits Tuesday after
seeing Wall Street fall back from an early rally overnight.</P>
      <P>Among high-tech heavyweights, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fell 1.11
percent to NT$62.60 and United Microelectronics Corp. closed down 0.66 percent
at NT$14.95.</P>
      <P>Flat panel maker AU Optronics lost 1.12 percent to NT$30.85 and light emitting
diode (LED) firm EPISTAR fell 0.65 percent to NT$91.50.</P>
      <P>"However, the upward trend remains intact. Investors are upbeat that a proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China will be signed in the
middle of this year as scheduled, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>Dealers said stocks which depend on domestic demand bucked the downward trend as
investors expected those companies would benefit from improving consumption amid
increasing cross-strait economic exchanges after the signing of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>Food maker Ve Wong gained 6.90 percent to NT$25.55 and rival Taisun Enterprise
rose 6.80 percent to NT$16.50.</P>
      <P>In the property sector, Kuo Yang Construction added 2.98 percent to NT$20.75 and
Goldsun Development rose 2.51 percent to NT$14.30.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Polaris Research Institute said Tuesday it has upgraded its forecast for
Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) growth this year from 4.65 percent to 6.82
percent largely based on strong exports and a recovery in domestic consumption
and investment.</P>
      <P>The higher estimate also reflected a low comparison base in 2009 after Taiwan
suffered the worst first quarter economic contraction in its history last year,
at 9.06 percent.</P>
      <P>Liang Kuo-yuan, president of the institute, said the island posted "better than
expected" GDP growth of 13.27 percent in the past quarter on the back of strong
global demand.</P>
      <P>Liang said export data in April and May were also very positive, in a sign that
export performance in the second quarter will continue to be rosy.</P>
      <P>In the first five months of this year, Taiwan's exports totaled US$109.26
billion, up 52.7 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>Unless the economy at home and abroad suddenly turns sour in the second half,
Liang said, the 6.82 percent growth forecast is "reasonable."</P>
      <P>The scholar said his institute has taken into account improving relations
between Taiwan and China and the planned signing of the proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , which the government says will help the
local economy.</P>
      <P>However, Liang said the economic growth will be moderated in the second half of
this year as the local economy started a rebound in the fourth quarter of last
year that will boost the comparison base.</P>
      <P>According to the institute, Taiwan's economy is expected to grow 9.51 percent in
the second quarter of this year, 5.80 percent in the third quarter and 0.24
percent in the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>Liang said Taiwan should remain cautious about debt problems in Europe that
could hurt the pace of a global economic recovery, but added that the global
economy is unlikely to suffer a double dip recession due to the European
financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Liang said his institute has also raised this year's consumer price index (CPI)
forecast to 1.38 percent from the previous 1.23 percent largely on higher prices
of imported goods due to recovering global demand.</P>
      <P>He said that there is little worry over inflation as the CPI growth remains tame
and that the central bank is unlikely to raise interest rates anytime soon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the institute left its forecast for the 2010 average New Taiwan
dollar exchange rate at NT$31.6 against the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>Liang said that before China promised to allow more flexibility for the Chinese
yuan over the weekend, the institute had expected the New Taiwan dollar would go
softer in the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>But a higher Chinese yuan is expected to lend support to the New Taiwan dollar
and the development prompted the institute to leave the exchange rate forecast
unchanged, Liang said.</P>
      <P>He said the local currency could trade at NT$31.45 against the greenback on
average in the second half of this year.</P>

      <P>It's impossible to disentwine the United States'policy with China from its
policy toward Taiwan, but Taiwan has to make itself an "indispensible" country
in the post-Cold War international arena, visiting U.S. scholars said Tuesday in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>"In my judgement, the bilateral relations between the United States  and Taiwan
are one of the most important  bilateral relationships in the world between two
governments...and  it's difficult to think about China and U.S.relationship with
China without thinking about our relationship with Taiwan, " said Scott Lilly, a
senior research fellow at Center for American Progress (CAP), a Washington-based
think tank founded in 2003.</P>
      <P>Lilly was among a group of scholars from the CAP who attended a forum to discuss
the Obama administrations foreign policies and priorities, organized by the
American Cultural Center under the American Institute in Taiwan, the institution
representing U.S. interests in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the triangular relations between the U.S., China and Taiwan, Lilly
said that the U.S. and Taiwan both "have the front row seats" to watch the drama
of a rising China unfold as to whether China will play a responsible  and
constructive  role in the international community or refuses to change with
time.</P>
      <P>Lilly, who served for 31 years in the U.S. Congress, said that both sides of the
Taiwan Strait should avoid provocation but Taiwan should not signal weakness in
its dealing with China. The military balance across the Strait should not move
significantly in either direction, he said, which means Taiwan should not seek
and the U.S. should not provide weapons that would do more than preserving the
balance.</P>
      <P>"I think Taiwan presents a serious test to China -- is China about peaceful
development and improving the lives of its own people? Or does it have a

      <P>Michael Werz, a CAP research fellow, pointed out that while West Berlin and
Taiwan were two of the most important spots in the 1960's and the 1970's, the
importance of geographic location has been decreasing after the Cold War era.</P>
      <P>Nowadays small powers can make huge impact as elements such as " soft power,  "
participation in new organizations have become important, he said, adding that
it's time to redefine the national interests that no longer tied to geographic
locations and military power.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, as well as any country, needs to make itself an indispensible part of
the world by ways of developing into an information technology (IT) hub or a
research and development hub to everything made in China, Werz said.</P>
      <P>"You have to take care of your own business," he said.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan has been a strong U.S. ally, it does not affect the overall China
policy of the U.S. government, said Lawrence Korb, another CAP senior fellow.</P>
      <P>Citing China's cooperation in voting for the United Nations sanction on Iran,
Korb said that "the fact that they did it shows that our policy toward Taiwan
does not undermine our relations with the Chinese."</P>

      <P>The Consumers' Foundation has accused Chunghwa Post Co., the state-run postal
service, of overcharging customers by nearly NT$200 million (US$6.25 million) a
year for substandard expedited services.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Post charges NT$7 more for special delivery service than ordinary mail,
but consumers are not getting their money's worth for the expedited service,
based on a test of 160 pieces of mail it sent on June 7 and June 9, the
foundation charged at a press conference Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In the first test on June 7, in which the foundation sent the same number of
letters by special delivery and ordinary mail to its branch offices islandwide,
nearly one-third (31 percent) sent by special delivery did not arrive at their
destinations on the same day as promised.</P>
      <P>Also, one-fourth of the special delivery mailings, costing NT$12 each, did not
arrive earlier than the mailings sent by ordinary mail, which costs only NT$5, a
foundation researcher said.</P>
      <P>In the test run on June 9, the foundation sent a similar number of letters by
registered mail (NT$25) as by registered special delivery (NT$32).</P>
      <P>It found that 45 percent of the expedited letters arrived at their destination
at the same time as ordinary registered mail did, according to the researcher.</P>
      <P>Based on Chunghwa Post's statistics for 2008, during which 102 million pieces of
mail were sent by special delivery and 11.3 percent of those were sent by
registered special delivery, the foundation calculated that the post office had
collected NT$190 million in fees for expedited service that was not delivered.</P>
      <P>The foundation urged Chunghwa Post to improve its "special delivery" services.</P>
      <P>It even cited a doorman at an office building who told them that all pieces of
mail, regardless of how they were sent, were delivered at the same time each
day.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid the global recovery, more companies in Taiwan expect to increase their
business operations in the third quarter of this year, while more than 60
percent of businesses said they will recruit in that period, according to the
results of a survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the online survey by the 1111 Job Bank, 53.98 percent of polled
companies anticipate an average 15.11 percent growth in business operations in
Q3 compared with the same period of the previous year, while 32.61 percent
expect their operations to remain unchanged in the same three-month period and
13.41 percent foresee a business decline.</P>
      <P>However, 61.96 percent of the surveyed businesses said their current operations
are still worse than before the global financial storm that began in 2008, while
14 percent reported improvements, the survey shows.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted June 16-18, also found that the number of enterprises
preparing to hire in Q3 posted a growth of 26.72 percentage points compared with
the level in a similar survey conducted in the same month of 2009.</P>
      <P>Most of the companies preparing to recruit are in the industrial and commercial
services sectors, followed by businesses in the information technology sector
and those in the consumer staples sector.</P>
      <P>1111 Job Bank director of public relations Henry Ho attributed the anticipated
manpower demand growth to the steady economic recovery, both in Taiwan and
overseas.</P>
      <P>He also said that travel operators, restaurants, hotels and leisure activity
planners and providers will need new crews in the upcoming summer vacation.</P>
      <P>The survey collected a total of 414 valid samples.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a survey conducted by the Yes 123 online job network June 1-15 found
that although the government organized a total of 857 career fairs in the first
six months of the year, only 7.6 percent of the people who visited the fairs
were able to find a job.</P>
      <P>Visitors to these job expositions  were also found to be dissatisfied with the
fairs, with 25.4 percent of the respondents complaining that the actual number
of jobs on offer was far less that the figures touted by the media, while 24.2
percent were also dismissive about the small number of "good" jobs available.</P>

      <P>The president of the Taipei-based China Pictures Company and the president of

to set up an academic- industrial cooperation center to make quality movies.</P>
      <P>TNUA President Ju Tzong-ching said Tuesday that the goal is to produce cinematic

      <P>"We will gather and teach the best talent at this center to make movies every

      <P>China Pictures plans to invest NT$50 million (US$1.57 million) over the next
five years to educate prospective film makers, according to the university.</P>
      <P>Ju said the idea started when he met China Pictures President T.C. Gou at a
friend's wedding and invited him to visit the school.</P>
      <P>"Gou came to the school and after learning more about it, felt there was a
possibility of combining the school's resources with those of his company to
create a better environment and gather talented people to make good movies," Ju
said.</P>
      <P>A school of film and new media was set up last year at TNUA, Ju went on, adding
that "we will have undergraduate students for the first time this coming

      <P>There is no chance that the United States would terminate its arms sales to
Taiwan in exchange for China's removal of its missiles that are aimed at Taiwan,
a Taiwanese diplomat based in Washington said Monday.</P>
      <P>The official, who asked not to be named, was commenting on media reports that
U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein had asked Defense
Secretary Robert Gates at a Senate hearing whether the U.S. would consider the
possibility of stopping its arms sales to Taiwan if China removed its missiles
opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Gates, who did not respond directly to Feinstein's question, had said earlier
that arm sales to Taiwan are a political issue to be decided on the basis of the
Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) and the judgment of the U.S. president.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan official said that the Feinstein, who recently visited China, has
been consistently opposed to U.S. arm sales to other countries, not just to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The diplomat said the U.S. government has made it clear that it would not link
its arms sales to Taiwan with the removal of China's missiles, and that it has
never responded to similar suggestions by Beijing in the past.</P>
      <P>Under the TRA, the U.S. is obliged to provide defensive arms to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>China has not given any indications that it intends to remove the estimated
1,300 missiles it has deployed along its southeastern coast opposite Taiwan,
despite warming cross-strait  relations since President Ma Ying-jeou took office
in May 2008.</P>

      <P>It's impossible to untangle the United States' China policy from its Taiwan
policy, but in the post-Cold War international arena, Taiwan must make itself
"indispensable, " visiting U.S. scholars said in Taipei Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"In my judgment, the bilateral relations between the United States  and Taiwan
are one of the most important  bilateral relationships in the world between two
governments... and it's difficult to think about China and the U.S.'s
relationship with China without thinking about our relationship with Taiwan, "
said Scott Lilly, a senior research fellow at the Center for American Progress
(CAP), a Washington-based think tank founded in 2003.</P>
      <P>Lilly was among a group of scholars from the center who attended a forum to
discuss the U.S. President Barack Obama administration's foreign policies and
priorities, organized by the American Cultural Center under the American
Institute in Taiwan, the institution representing U.S. interests in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking on relations between the U.S., China and Taiwan, Lilly said that the
U.S. and Taiwan both "have the front row seats" to watch the drama of a rising
China unfold and observe whether China will play a responsible and constructive
role in the international community or refuse to change with the times.</P>
      <P>Lilly, who served for 31 years in the U.S. Congress, said that both sides of the
Taiwan Strait should avoid provocation, but that Taiwan should not show weakness
when dealing with China. The military balance across the Taiwan Strait should
not move significantly in either direction, he said, which means Taiwan should
not seek and the U.S. should not provide weapons that go beyond preserving the
balance.</P>
      <P>"I think Taiwan presents a serious test to China -- is China about peaceful
development and improving the lives of its own people? Or does it have a
regional and global ambition which would trample 'other countries' along the
way?" Lilly said.</P>
      <P>Michael Werz, a research fellow at CAP, said that while West Berlin and Taiwan
were two of the most important spots in the 1960s and 1970s, the importance of
geographic location has been decreasing after the Cold War era.</P>

      <P>Petrochemical and textile firm Far Eastern New Century Corp. said Tuesday that
it will expand its green energy business by developing more recyclable and
biodegradable materials.</P>
      <P>The green energy business investment will be included in the company's five year
development project, which is expected to cost NT$100 billion (US$3.15 billion),
the company said.</P>
      <P>At an annual sharehoders' general meeting Tuesday, Chairman Douglus Hsu unveiled
the five-year project and said the company will invest NT$50 billion in the
first three years to develop its green energy business, expand its production
capacity and target the huge China market.</P>
      <P>Vice Chairman Hsi Chia-yi later told reporters  that with international
standards for environmental protection on the rise, Far Eastern needs to spend
more on research and development to meet the challenges and added that the new
investment could help the company to boost its R&amp;D strength.</P>
      <P>Under the five-year development plan, Far Eastern will set up an R&amp;D
division specifically for the green energy business, His said.</P>
      <P>Currently, green energy accounts for just 5 percent of the company's total
R&amp;D spending and the new investment project is expected to boost the ratio
to 20 percent, Hsi said.</P>
      <P>He said the company has worked with Coca Cola, one of its clients, by providing
recyclable PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles, as well as providing sports
shirts made of recycled materials to Nike for the 2010 World Cup.</P>
      <P>Far Eastern is also planning to raise the annual production capacity of
polyethylene products to 2.6 million tons from the current 1.6 million tons
under the five-year development project.</P>
      <P>The production capacity in Taiwan is expected to rise by 300,000 tons, while the
capacity of the company's China plants is expected to increase by 700,000 tons.</P>
      <P>Hsi said that eyeing the huge Chinese market, the company will step up its
marketing efforts there and expects to increase sales in value-added textile and

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's rezoning of its counties and cities is a major part of the government's
regional and overall development plan, but its success hinges on the roles of
the local governments.</P>
      <P>Under the rezoning plan, the number of municipalities will increase from two to
five and will comprise nearly 60 percent of Taiwan's population. The five
municipalities are expected to be the engines for growth and development in
their respective regions, but this has also heightened tensions between the
central and regional governments.</P>
      <P>The law governing the distribution of tax revenues and expenses is in the
process of being amended and all the regional governments, whether municipal or
county, are fighting to obtain more money. Alongside this is the issue of more
responsibilities for the municipal governments, in areas such as road
maintenance and high school teacher pensions.</P>
      <P>Another issue facing the three municipalities that are being formed by merging
the respective cities and counties of Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung is the
integration of local administrations that have different regulations and
government structure.</P>
      <P>The incumbent mayors and mayoral candidates  in the three municipalities have
reiterated that they will help the neighboring counties to develop, while the
incumbent magistrates in the mainly agricultural counties believe that the
future lies in differentiating themselves from other areas to avoid being
marginalized.</P>
      <P>With the rezoning set to take effect at the end of this year, the focus is on
whether the five municipalities can carry out the plan to lead regional
development or whether the gap between municipalities and counties will increase
because of an imbalance of resources.</P>

consultancy firm predicted Tuesday that this will be a boom year for Taiwan's
real estate market.</P>
      <P>Billy Yen, general manager of DTZ, also said that after the inking of the
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, the firm will set up
a real estate transaction platform that will publish information on real estate
transactions.</P>
      <P>He cited statistics from the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the National Property
Administration to show that as of the second quarter  of this year,  business
and industrial  real estate transactions totaled NT$49.7 billion, nearly half of
the NT$100.3 billion recorded for 2009.</P>
      <P>Public and private land transactions meanwhile totaled NT$56.9 billion, nearly
up to the level of NT$57.5 billion for the whole of 2009.</P>
      <P>Yen said that after China signed a closer economic partnership arrangement
(CEPA) with Hong Kong, its housing market surged.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan signs the ECFA with China this year, a large amount of capital will
enter in pursuit of the limited commodities in Taiwan's real estate market,
especially because Taiwan's real estate has risen only moderately compared with
other Asian markets, " Yen said.</P>
      <P>"I see no signs of pessimism in Taiwan's housing market in the latter half of
the year unless China raises its key interest rates or Taiwan adopts a policy to
cool the housing market," Yen said.</P>
      <P>He said that raising key interest rates by 0.25 percent or 0.5 percent will have
little impact on Taiwan's housing market.</P>

pact with China would be a "vitamin" for Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Kenichi Ohmae told senior Taiwan government officials that the next year will be
vital to the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) if it is going to

predicted Taiwan wouldn't be able to achieve very desirable results, but China
had shown significant patience toward Taiwan and "the talks are going
marvelously, and 'the pact' will enable Taiwan to play a pivotal role in the
greater China area, " Ohmae said.</P>
      <P>Noting that there are 370 round-trip flights between Taiwan and China weekly,
and that Taiwan levies a 17 percent business income tax on local companies,
Ohmae said that "this coupled with the trade pact with China will give Taiwan an
advantage" and make the island a regional business hub, if not an aeronautic
hub.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should go ahead with its negotiations with China, not only sealing the
ECFA but also developing it into a full free trade agreement, which will put the
country on a level playing ground, Ohmae said.</P>
      <P>In addition to exploring the Chinese market, the country should also explore
other emerging economies, he said.</P>
      <P>He said the improved ties between Taiwan and China have caused concern in South
Korea, which is competing with Taiwan for the Chinese market. Taiwan's booming
exports to China helped the island recover more quickly than other states from
the impact of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, Ohmae said.</P>
      <P>"I can't understand why some people in the country would complain about it," he
said. "Why would some journalists complain?"</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office said that during a private meeting with Ohmae before his
speech, President Ma asked the business guru whether he thought Taiwan's economy
was overly reliant on China.</P>
      <P>"No, compared with other states in Asia, Taiwan is not overly reliant on China,
" the office quoted him as saying.</P>
      <P>All of Asia is increasingly dependent on China economically, and Taiwan is
playing the role of pathfinder by putting its cultural affinity with China to
good use, he said.</P>
      <P>In response to an audience question, Ohmae suggested Taiwan lobby the Beijing-
based China Mobile, one of China's largest telecom companies, to list its stock
on the Taipei exchange to solve the problem of the local bourse being
overwhelmed with individual investors, who make up 70 percent of all investors
in the bourse.</P>
      <P>"With assets of more than that of 700 listed companies put together, China
Mobile would attract more foreign institutional investors to deal on the local
bourse, boosting the trade volume significantly," he said.</P>
      <P>According to its 2009 annual report, China Mobile's assets stood at 490 billion
yuan (US$72 billion).</P>
      <P>"It would be relatively easy for China Mobile to list on the Taipei Exchange, as
its prospectus is written in Chinese, which is familiar to local investors,"
Ohmae said.</P>
      <P>In response to another question, Ohmae dismissed worries that Taiwanese could
scramble to change their bank deposits into Chinese yuan in light of the fact
that interest rates on the yuan are much higher than those for the New Taiwan
dollar.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the Chinese yuan, which appreciated by 0.4 percent the
previous day, could not continue its upward trend for long. Instead, he said it
would dip in value after a while, deterring people from keeping it too long.</P>

      <P>A 62-year-old doctor has died of swine flu, bringing to 43 the country's death
toll from the disease, a Department of Health (DOH) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The victim is the only doctor among the fatalities and had neither  been
vaccinated  nor had he taken anti -virus drugs immediately after falling ill,
said Lin Ting, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under
the DOH.</P>
      <P>The doctor, who practiced in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung-Pingtung region was in
a high risk group, as he suffered from several chronic conditions, including
cardiac disease, hypertension and diabetes, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Lin said the man was hospitalized June. 13 after developing a cough and was
confirmed to be infected with the influenza A(H1N1) virus June 15. However, he
refused to take tamiflu -- the most effective medication for swine flu -- for
personal reasons, and died two weeks later, Lin added.</P>
      <P>According to data released by the CDC, the summer months see far more of the
less serious B form of the virus then the A (H1N1) form. Around 23 percent of
the suspected cases have been confirmed, of which 92 percent were identified as
influenza B, while swine flu only accounted for 4 percent.</P>

      <P>The "early harvest"  lists will contain items subject  to preferential tariff

negotiators.</P>
      <P>At the head of a Chinese delegation, Vice President Zheng Lizhong of the

      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate continued to fall in May, reaching 5.14 percent, or
0.25 percentage points lower than the previous month, according to figures
released by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The number of jobless people totaled 567,000, or 26,000 less than in April, the
statistics showed.</P>
      <P>After seasonal adjustment, the May jobless rate was 5.22 percent, down 0.21
percentage points from April and representing a ninth consecutive monthly fall.</P>
      <P>The number of workers reached 10.459 million, almost back to its level during
the initial stage of the global financial crisis in September 2008, Liu Tien-
tse, a deputy department chief with DGBAS, said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>Liu attributed the decline to recovery from the economic meltdown and stimulus
measures taken by the government to increase employment.</P>
      <P>"The jobless rate would have climbed to 5.55 percent without the short- and
long-term government measures," Liu said.</P>
      <P>But Liu cautioned that unemployment might surge again for the next two or three
months as new graduates seek jobs. According to 2007 statistics released by the
Ministry of Education, 44 percent of new graduates entered the job market,
compared with 25 percent who sought further education and 23 percent who began
compulsory military service.</P>
      <P>"Unemployment went up by an average 0.22 percentage points to 0.31 percentage
points between June and August over the past three years," Liu added, citing the
statistics.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih has vowed to step down if his administration fails to bring
the unemployment rate below 5 percent by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Liu said that to achieve the goal, the number of unemployed people needs to be
cut by an additional 11,000 and 131,000 more people need to be hired.</P>
      <P>In spite of the improving employment situation, Taiwan's jobless rate is still
the highest among the "four Asian tigers, " compared with Hong Kong's 4.6
percent,  South Korea's 3.2 percent and Singapore's 2.2 percent.</P>

      <P>A preparatory meeting for the fifth cross-strait talks between Taiwan's top

      <P>After the June 24 meeting, SEF and ARATS will reveal the details of the Chiang-

      <P>Liu refused to disclose where Zheng will meet Kao other than to say it is likely

Chen would meet in Chongqing, western China.</P>
      <P>However, Liu said the Chiang-Chen talks will be very short as no courtesy calls
or trips are planned for the two top negotiators.</P>
      <P>During the preparatory meeting, both sides will also confirm for the last time
the text of the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) and
another pact on the protection of intellectual property, making them ready for
signing by Chiang and Chen.</P>
      <P>"Zheng will not hold talks with Taiwan officials on the substance of the
bilateral trade pact, " although "early harvest" lists to be included in the
ECFA will be verified during the preparatory meeting, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Liu said Taiwan and China are still engaged in negotiations on the lists, which
will be made public when its loose ends are tied up.</P>
      <P>Before plans for the fifth round of talks are revealed, Minister of Economic
Affairs Shih Yen-shiang and Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan
will give a briefing about the ECFA to Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and the
legislative caucuses of the ruling and opposition parties, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>Government sources said that the pact is expected to be signed on July 4 and to
be approved by the Executive Yuan on July 8, while the Legislative Yuan is
expected to debate it in a one-day extraordinary session between July 12 and
July 15, given the fact Wang is slated to leave for a visit to the Gambia in
western Africa on July 16.</P>
      <P>The legislative session will be followed by one month of negotiations among the
legislative caucuses of different parties and then the pact will be ratified at
another extraordinary session in August, according to the sources.</P>
      <P>The full text of the pact will be made public after it is ratified by the
legislature and the Executive Yuan will have to revise certain laws in order to
bring it into force, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>The revision of the law will of course need to be approved by the legislature,
Liu said.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union --
which are wary about China's territorial claims to Taiwan -- have vowed to pull

    <HEADLINE>Goats to be vaccinated to stem spread of GPV: COA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) decided Tuesday to vaccinate all goats in
Taiwan amid fears of a massive outbreak of goat pox virus (GPV).</P>
      <P>Hsu Tien-lai, director-general of the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine, made the announcement after a meeting on ways to stem
the spread of the virus.</P>
      <P>As of the previous day, goats on 140 farms in 11 cities and counties were feared
to have been infected, with 14,783 head to be culled, Hsu said, adding that
13,984 goats on 130 farms had already been destroyed.</P>
      <P>"The most serious outbreak was reported in Yunlin County, with 50 farms
affected, followed by 27 in Tainan County and 26 in Changhua County," he said.</P>
      <P>Hsu said experts at the meeting reached a consensus that the 210,000 goats in
Taiwan's 2,500 goat farms should be vaccinated. Owners who fail to get their
stock vaccinated will face fines of between NT$10,000 (US$313) and NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>He estimated that the vaccinations could be completed by mid-July and that the
effects would be seen by the end of July.</P>
      <P>After the vaccinations, there will be a three-week observation period and
restrictions on the movement, buying and selling of stock "will not be lifted
until the GPV situation has stabilized."</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan has produced 200,000 doses, as well as purchasing 50,000 doses of
vaccines from Jordan June 1. It will purchase another 180,000 doses June 26.</P>
      <P>GPV -- a highly contagious disease of small ruminants that is characterized by
fever, ocular and nasal discharges -- is spread via contact among the animals.
GPV cannot infect humans and can be destroyed by high temperatures, they added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first reported GPV in July 2008 in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County, an
outbreak that is believed to have been related to animals smuggled in from GPV-
affected countries.</P>
      <P>The COA said that only two goat farms reported GPV infections at that time and
that the disease was brought under control in a week after exterminating the
goats on the two farms.</P>
      <P>This year's infections first gave rise for serious concern in April after nearly
800 goats had to be culled on two farms in Yunlin County's Siluo Township in
south-central Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan needs to focus on logistics and other professional services in China as
the country will soon lose its advantage in capitalizing on cheap Chinese labor
due to wage hikes and a stronger Chinese yuan, a visiting Japanese corporate
strategist said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>After Foxconn,  the world's  largest  electronics  contract manufacturer,
sharply increased its Chinese workers' wages to cope with a series of suicides
and suicide attempts, Chinese workers realized that "wages are negotiable, "
Kenichi Ohmae said in a public speech in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"The Foxconn problem...  is spreading  through  China like wildfire," he said.</P>
      <P>Ohmae said that Chinese workers are negotiating with management from "about
every company " -- and particularly foreign companies -- to try to have their
wages doubled.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government recently announced that it will work to double Chinese
workers' income, he noted.</P>
      <P>Other challenges for Taiwanese companies in China include the appreciation of
the Chinese yuan and China's labor shortage, Ohmae said.</P>
      <P>He urged Taiwan to enter a new phase by focusing on developing logistics, legal
and property services in China, especially after Taiwan signs a planned pact
with China to further liberalize trade.</P>
      <P>The strategist also called on Taiwan to look beyond China and focus on other
emerging markets.</P>
      <P>Describing the trade pact, or economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) ,
as a "vitamin" for Taiwan's continued economic success, Ohmae said that he had
previously not been optimistic about trade talks between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>"I thought this would break up," he said.</P>
      <P>But China has shown "amazing patience" in negotiating with Taiwan over the trade
pact, Ohmae said.</P>
      <P>After the pact is inked, Taiwan will be in a better position to attract overseas
companies, including Japanese ones, as Taiwan already has 370 direct flights
every week with China and its corporate tax has recently been cut to as low as
17 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>"There is no other place better than Taiwan to operate from... to expand your
business into the mainland," Ohmae said.</P>

      <P>During the preparatory meeting, both sides will also confirm for the last time
the text of the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) and
another pact on the protection of intellectual property, making them ready for
signing by Chiang and Chen.</P>
      <P>"Zheng will not hold talks with Taiwan officials on the substance of the
bilateral trade pact, " although "early harvest" lists to be included in the
ECFA will be verified during the preparatory meeting, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Liu said Taiwan and China are still engaged in negotiations on the lists, which
will be made public when its loose ends are tied up.</P>
      <P>Before plans for the fifth round of talks are revealed, Minister of Economic
Affairs Shih Yen-shiang and Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan
will give a briefing about the ECFA to Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and the
legislative caucuses of the ruling and opposition parties, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>Government sources said that the pact is expected to be signed on July 4 and to
be approved by the Executive Yuan on July 8, while the Legislative Yuan is
expected to debate it in a one-day extraordinary session between July 12 and
July 15, given the fact Wang is slated to leave for a visit to the Gambia in
western Africa on July 16.</P>
      <P>The legislative session will be followed by one month of negotiations among the
legislative caucuses of different parties and then the pact will be ratified at
another extraordinary session in August, according to the sources.</P>
      <P>The full text of the pact will be made public after it is ratified by the
legislature and the Executive Yuan will have to revise certain laws in order to
bring it into force, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>The revision of the law will of course need to be approved by the legislature,
Liu said.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union --
which are wary about China's territorial claims to Taiwan -- have vowed to pull
out all the stops to block the pact.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Goats to be vaccinated to stem spread of GPV: COA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
06/22/10  22:42:09

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) decided Tuesday to vaccinate all goats in
Taiwan amid fears of a massive outbreak of goat pox virus (GPV).</P>
      <P>Hsu Tien-lai, director-general of the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine, made the announcement after a meeting on ways to stem
the spread of the virus.</P>
      <P>As of the previous day, goats on 140 farms in 11 cities and counties were feared
to have been infected, with 14,783 head to be culled, Hsu said, adding that
13,984 goats on 130 farms had already been destroyed.</P>
      <P>"The most serious outbreak was reported in Yunlin County, with 50 farms
affected, followed by 27 in Tainan County and 26 in Changhua County," he said.</P>
      <P>Hsu said experts at the meeting reached a consensus that the 210,000 goats in
Taiwan's 2,500 goat farms should be vaccinated. Owners who fail to get their
stock vaccinated will face fines of between NT$10,000 (US$313) and NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>He estimated that the vaccinations could be completed by mid-July and that the
effects would be seen by the end of July.</P>
      <P>After the vaccinations, there will be a three-week observation period and
restrictions on the movement, buying and selling of stock "will not be lifted
until the GPV situation has stabilized."</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan has produced 200,000 doses, as well as purchasing 50,000 doses of
vaccines from Jordan June 1. It will purchase another 180,000 doses June 26.</P>
      <P>GPV -- a highly contagious disease of small ruminants that is characterized by
fever, ocular and nasal discharges -- is spread via contact among the animals.
GPV cannot infect humans and can be destroyed by high temperatures, they added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first reported GPV in July 2008 in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County, an
outbreak that is believed to have been related to animals smuggled in from GPV-
affected countries.</P>
      <P>The COA said that only two goat farms reported GPV infections at that time and
that the disease was brought under control in a week after exterminating the
goats on the two farms.</P>
      <P>This year's infections first gave rise for serious concern in April after nearly
800 goats had to be culled on two farms in Yunlin County's Siluo Township in
south-central Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan needs to focus on logistics and other professional services in China as
the country will soon lose its advantage in capitalizing on cheap Chinese labor
due to wage hikes and a stronger Chinese yuan, a visiting Japanese corporate
strategist said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>After Foxconn,  the world's  largest  electronics  contract manufacturer,
sharply increased its Chinese workers' wages to cope with a series of suicides
and suicide attempts, Chinese workers realized that "wages are negotiable, "
Kenichi Ohmae said in a public speech in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"The Foxconn problem...  is spreading  through  China like wildfire," he said.</P>
      <P>Ohmae said that Chinese workers are negotiating with management from "about
every company " -- and particularly foreign companies -- to try to have their
wages doubled.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government recently announced that it will work to double Chinese
workers' income, he noted.</P>
      <P>Other challenges for Taiwanese companies in China include the appreciation of
the Chinese yuan and China's labor shortage, Ohmae said.</P>
      <P>He urged Taiwan to enter a new phase by focusing on developing logistics, legal
and property services in China, especially after Taiwan signs a planned pact
with China to further liberalize trade.</P>
      <P>The strategist also called on Taiwan to look beyond China and focus on other
emerging markets.</P>
      <P>Describing the trade pact, or economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) ,
as a "vitamin" for Taiwan's continued economic success, Ohmae said that he had
previously not been optimistic about trade talks between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>"I thought this would break up," he said.</P>
      <P>But China has shown "amazing patience" in negotiating with Taiwan over the trade
pact, Ohmae said.</P>
      <P>After the pact is inked, Taiwan will be in a better position to attract overseas
companies, including Japanese ones, as Taiwan already has 370 direct flights
every week with China and its corporate tax has recently been cut to as low as
17 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>"There is no other place better than Taiwan to operate from... to expand your
business into the mainland," Ohmae said.</P>

      <P>Three "fishing boats" moored in the ocean between Green Island and Orchid Island
off the coast of eastern Taiwan were reported to have been hit by missiles
Tuesday, but coast guard officers who rushed to the scene found instead that the
vessels were targets for missile tests.</P>
      <P>Residents of Orchid Island who spotted the boats trailing smoke after several
explosions that afternoon alerted the coast guard authorities on the island.</P>
      <P>However, when a coast guard patrol boat reached the scene, the crew found a Navy

that the boats are targets that had been hit successfully by missiles developed
by the Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (CIST) under the Ministry
of National Defense.</P>
      <P>The missiles were launched from the CIST's Jioupeng base in southern Taiwan's

other reason than to show his personal purity of motive is one who breaks up one
of the greatest ties in the foundation of society. A good and wise man, on the
other hand, who enters the public service, tries to carry out what he thinks to
be right. As to the failure of right principles to make progress, he is well
aware of that."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China will soon hold the final round of formal negotiations prior to
signing an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) and will finalize the
items to be included in the agreement's "early harvest" tariff reduction
program.</P>
      <P>Those sectors that have been fully or partially excluded from the early harvest
program, such as the petrochemical and machine tool industries,  are deeply
concerned  about the outcome  of the negotiations.</P>
      <P>Politically, if the final "early harvest" list fails to meet the expectations of
the concerned sectors, it will further justify the pro-independence camp's
opposition to the agreement.</P>
      <P>As Japanese business strategist Kenichi Ohmae has said, the ECFA will be a
"vitamin" formulated especially for Taiwan's economy. The administration of
President Ma Ying-jeou must negotiate an outcome that would satisfy the majority
of the people. Otherwise, the ECFA issue would become the most destructive land
mine in the year-end special municipality elections. (June 23, 2010)</P>

      <P>In a speech at the Presidential Office Tuesday, Japanese business strategist
Kenich Ohmae said the proposed cross-Taiwan  Strait economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) will be a "vitamin" formulated especially for
Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>It seems that Ohmae does not understand either Taiwan or China. Beijing's
strategy precisely  is to lure Taiwan into greater dependence on China by
offering economic benefits and thus eventually take full control of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chinese economist Hu Angang once likened Taiwan to a diabetic patient who must
rely on trade with China for insulin in order to survive. Hu also said that if
China should launch a trade war on Taiwan through the imposition of economic
sanctions, Taiwan would collapse within seven days.</P>
      <P>Now that Ohmae is in Taiwan, we suggest that he examine closely why the majority
of people in Taiwan still have doubts about the ECFA even though the Kuomintang
and the Chinese Communist Party have been trumpeting its benefits.</P>
      <P>The "anti-one China, pro-referendum" demonstration scheduled for June 26 will
provide answers to this question. If Taiwan's economy is locked into the "one
China" market, industries and jobs in Taiwan will be hollowed out. If Taiwan's
sovereignty is locked into the "one China" principle, the people of Taiwan will
be deprived of their right to determine their own fate. (June 23, 2010)</P>

    <DATELINE>06/23/10  11:54:56
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japanese management guru Kenichi Ohmae said Tuesday in Taipei that the imminent
cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) will be a
"vitamin" for Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>The agreement, coupled with Taiwan's newly lowered corporate income tax and the
opening of direct cross-strait transportation links, will enable Taiwan to
emerge as a business hub for the greater Chinese economic sphere,  Ohmae
forecast  in a speech at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>However,  former  opposition  Democratic  Progressive  Party Legislator Parris
Chang revealed the same day that a delegation of the Legislative Yuan staff
found during a recent visit to Hong Kong that a similar pact signed between Hong
Kong and China in 2003 known as the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement
(CEFA) has affected Hong Kong negatively in many ways. For instance, wages have
dropped in Hong Kong and the gap between rich and poor has widened, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, Legislative Yuan authorities have decided not to publish a
report presented by its staff members on their findings, for fear of hindering
the signing of ECFA.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Ohmae was invited to speak Tuesday at a monthly meeting at Taiwan's Presidential
Office, which was attended by senior government officials, from President Ma
Ying-jeou down.</P>
      <P>Japanese corporate strategist expressed optimism over Taiwan's economic
prospects  and said he does not know why Taiwanese journalists are often so
critical of the government's policy and operations.</P>
      <P>In his view, Ohmae said, President Ma's administration should be credited for
greatly improving cross-strait relations, which led to robust cross-strait trade
that contributed to Taiwan's fast recovery from the 2008-2009 global economic
recession.</P>
      <P>The word "Chaiwan" (China + Taiwan) , coined by South Koreans, reflects their
worry about losing their competitive edge to Taiwan in the vast Chinese market
amid growing cross-strait amity, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan would become even more competitive after the conclusion of the ECFA which
will grant tariff waivers and easier access terms to a number of Taiwanese
products and services entering the Chinese market, Ohmae said.</P>
      <P>But he also cautioned that Foxconn's wage hikes signal an end to the successful
"OEM and ODM" models for China-based Taiwanese companies.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese businessmen operating in China, known locally as "taishang, " should
search for a new operation model in the wake of the recent labor unrest and wage
spikes in China, Ohmae suggested. (June 23, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>A delegation of officials from the Legislative Yuan's Budget Center and Bureau
of Statutes visited Hong Kong earlier this year to study the impact of the CEPA
on Hong Kong society.</P>
      <P>Former DPP Legislator Chang said that on June 11 the delegation briefed the
Legislature on its findings. To the best of his knowledge, Chang said, the
delegation found that the number of Hong Kong residents  living  under the
poverty  line has increased significantly since the CEPA took effect seven years
ago.</P>
      <P>Under the CEPA, Chang said, an average of 150 Chinese people per day are allowed
to enter Hong Kong for work. The influx of Chinese workers has led to a drop in
Hong Kong's wage levels and a consequent increase in the number of poor people
in Hong Kong, he said.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan and China are scheduled soon to sign a similar pact, known as an ECFA,
the Legislative Yuan leadership has decided not to publish the delegation's
report, Chang said.</P>
      <P>However,  Legislative  Yuan  Secretary-General  Lin Hsi-shan dismissed Chang's
statement, saying that the delegation is still preparing the report.</P>
      <P>Once the report is finalized, Lin said, it will be unveiled.</P>
      <P>"The signing of the ECFA will not be a factor in the decision to publicize the
report," he added. (June 23, 2010).</P>

      <P>During Thursday's talks, the two sides will exchange "early harvest" lists of
items to be subject to tariff concessions or easy market access under ECFA.</P>
      <P>Government sources said that after Taiwan's strong lobby, China has finally
agreed to inclusion of PP and some machine tool items into the "early harvest"
lists.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's Assocition for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) have also tentatively agreed that
their top chiefs -- SEF Chairman Chaing Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen Yunlin
-- will meet in the southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing June 28-30 to
formally sign ECFA and an intellectual property rights protection agreement.

    <TEXT>
      <P>While Taiwan has made significant progress in terms of its competitiveness in
the past two years, the country's legal and regulatory framework has remained
backward. This leaves the most important piece of Taiwan's soft power puzzle
missing.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, law school graduates are required to pass licensing exams before they
could be allowed to enter related professions. But the format of these exams is
rigid and the success rate is extremely low.</P>
      <P>This has two serious consequences. First, university education cannot be
innovative or pluralistic because it is subject to the influence of licensing
exams. Second, the supply of talent focuses solely on the litigation sector,
leaving a gap in social demand.</P>
      <P>The situation has not only distorted university education but also led to a
serious waste of resources.</P>
      <P>An economic means of boosting Taiwan's competitiveness would be to raise the
success rates of such exams so that they serve as a minimum threshold. This
would allow law school graduates to serve not only as litigation attorneys, but
also in other posts such as government lawyers and legal consultants for
businesses. (June 23, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nine of the soccer teams in the 2010 World  Cup are wearing  uniforms  made of
recycled  materials manufactured by Taiwanese textile companies, the European
Parliament magazine reported recently.</P>
      <P>Wang Chen-tai,  head of the news division  at the Taipei Representative Office
in the EU and Belgium, was quoted in the magazine as saying that while Taiwan
does not have a team in the World Cup, it has supplied uniforms for the
international sports event.</P>
      <P>Wang said the uniforms are evidence of Taiwan's cutting-edge technology in the
textile sector and its commitment to reducing carbon emissions and protecting
the global environment.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan sportswear supplied to the nine teams and retailers were made from 13
million recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, with each sports
shirt requiring eight recycled PET bottles on average, he said.</P>
      <P>The World Cup teams wearing the Taiwan-made sports uniforms are Brazil, the
Netherlands, Portugal, the United States, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand,
Serbia and Slovakia.</P>
      <P>The manufacturing process involved breaking down the PET bottles which were then
extruded into polyester fiber and spun into fabric, according to the Taiwan
Textile Research Institute (TTRI).</P>
      <P>To color the shirts, the Taiwan manufacturers employed a dyeing technology that
meets global green standards, which is an indication that Taiwan has become a
world leader in that particular production area, the institute said.</P>
      <P>It took years of research by the Taiwan textile sector and the TTRI to develop
that manufacturing technology, it added.</P>
      <P>Apart from its entry into the world's premier soccer competition, Wang said,
Taiwan-made environmentally friendly sportswear has also become popular among
multinational sports goods brands.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 0.40 percent Wednesday in thin trading after
investors took their cues from a Wall Street fall overnight on disappointing
U.S. existing home sales data, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted  index fell 30.53 points to 7,582.15,  after fluctuating between
7,549.98 and 7,615.44, on turnover of NT$77.26 billion (US$2.41 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened 0.48 percent lower amid renewed worries over the pace of the
global economic recovery, and pressure persisted throughout the trading session
ahead of the nearest technical resistance at around the 7,600-point mark,
according to the dealers.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,729 stocks closed down and 1,166 were up, with 335 stocks remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The paper and pulp sector suffered the heaviest pressure, down 0.9 percent.
Financial shares closed down 0.7 percent, cement shares were 0.6 percent lower,
plastics and chemicals were down 0.5 percent lower and the machinery and
electronics sector ended the day down 0.4 percent.</P>
      <P>Textile stocks gained 1.3 percent and foodstuff shares rose 0.9 percent, while
the construction sector closed unchanged.</P>
      <P>Tom Tang, an analyst with MasterLink Securities, said the Wall Street losses
provided investors with an excuse to pocket profits from recent significant
gains on the local bourse.</P>
      <P>"Investors are watching closely how U.S. markets perform after Tuesday's
pullback," Tang said.</P>
      <P>"If Wall Street continues  to fall,  foreign institutional investors might move
their funds out of Asia to meet redemption demand at home," Tang said.</P>
      <P>Judging from reduced turnover in the past two sessions, Tang said, many
investors preferred to stay on the sidelines amid fears of possible heavy
pressure ahead of 7,600 points.</P>
      <P>United Microelectronics Corp. dropped 1.00 percent to NT$14.80 and Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fell 0.80 percent to NT$62.10.</P>
      <P>Flat panel maker Chimei Innolux dropped 1.51 percent to NT$35.90 and Hon Hai
Precision, the world's largest contract producer of electronic goods, dropped
0.81 percent to NT$122.50.</P>
      <P>"A good strategy for now is to keep cash. If the market stages a rebound,
investors had better lower their holdings," Tang said.</P>
      <P>However, he said that as optimism over the possible signing of an economic
cooperation framework agreement with China in the middle of this year remains in
place, firms that have close business ties with China might outperform the
broader market.</P>
      <P>Among the retailers that have built distribution networks in China, Ruentex
added 3.02 percent to close at NT$88.70 and Synnex rose 1.52 percent to end the
day at NT$73.60.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tests of donated blood show that the incidence of HIV among Taiwanese students
is on the rise, a trend that needs to be monitored in the coming years, an anti-
AIDS foundation said at a news conference Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Blood Services Foundation official Lin Min-chang said that according to
statistics provided by blood donation centers, 80 blood donors -- a ratio of 4.3
per 100,000 -- were found to be HIV-positive in 2009, with nearly one-third, or
26 of them, students.</P>
      <P>That ratio was the highest for any demographic group, far exceeding military
servicemen, who accounted for 22.5 percent of HIV-positive donors.</P>
      <P>The military has generally accounted for the most HIV-positive donors in the
post, averaging 18 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>The trend worsened in the first three months of 2010, Lin said. Blood donation
centers have reported 22 HIV cases, with students accounting for nine of them,
or 40.9 percent. Nineteen of the 22 HIV-positive donors were in the 17-29 age
bracket.</P>
      <P>"This shows that the number of young Taiwanese who have been infected with the
AIDS virus may be on the rise, and it is worthy of society's attention," Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Appearing at the same news conference, Taiwan AIDS Foundation Secretary-General
Lin Chiung-chao revealed the results of a survey conducted by the group on the
attitudes of Taiwan's people toward AIDS.</P>
      <P>The poll, which surveyed 303 parents who had children aged between 7 and 25,
found that nearly half of the respondents (48.9 percent) were indifferent to
AIDS-related information, she said.</P>
      <P>At the same time, 33 percent thought only those "lacking morals" or "leading a
fast life" were HIV-AIDS prone.</P>
      <P>Although 78 percent said they were willing to live with their family members if
they contracted the virus, only 56.3 percent would be willing to work alongside
colleagues who had the disease, the survey found.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Chiung-chao noted that using condoms is an effective way to
prevent AIDS, but that according to the survey, 95.8 percent of the parents
questioned had not taught their children how to use them.</P>
      <P>In addition, 60 percent said they did not have condoms in their houses.</P>

      <P>Taiwan-based TECO Electric and Machinery Co. (TECO) inked a cooperation contract
with Japan's SIM-Drive Corp. Wednesday under which TECO will produce high-
horsepower electric in-wheel motors using technology supplied by the electric
vehicle developer.</P>
      <P>The deal was sealed in Taipei by TECO Chairman C.K. Liu and SIM-Drive President
Hiroshi Shimizu.</P>
      <P>Production will begin next year, with capacity expected to reach 100,000 units
by 2013, TECO said.</P>
      <P>Liu explained  that in-wheel  motors  are designed  to be incorporated into the
hub of a wheel, driving it directly. Tests conducted in Japan have shown that
electric vehicles equipped with eight in-wheel motors can be faster than a
Porsche sports car, he said.</P>
      <P>Liu predicted that in-wheel motors will become a trend in the future because of
their flexibility and energy-saving features.</P>
      <P>He said the market for in-wheel motors for electric vehicles is estimated to be
around NT$7 billion (US$218.5 million) per year, and that his company and SIM-
Drive are targeting electric vehicle manufacturers in China and Japan as their
potential buyers.</P>
      <P>According to SIM-Drive Chairman Soichiro Fukutake, major Japanese automakers
Isuzu and Mitsubishi have joined a cooperation pact with his company, indicating
a promising outlook for the product.</P>

      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching was the focus of attention among members of the
audience for a performance by Taiwan's world-renowned Cloud Gate Dance Theatre
at Villa Adriana in Tivoli, outside Rome, on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chow was accompanied by her eldest daughter Ma Wei-chung, who traveled from the
United States to Italy to watch the Cloud Gate show along with her mother.</P>
      <P>The ensemble performed its signature "Songs of the Wanderers" and received a
standing ovation at the end of the show from an appreciative audience, to Cloud
Gate founder Lin Hwai-min's delight.</P>
      <P>Chow and her daughter also attended a post-performance party, and when Taiwan's
representative to Italy, Yih Jung-tzung, introduced Chow to the parliamentarians
and other dignitaries at the reception, she drew their applause by greeting them
in Italian.</P>
      <P>Italian Senator Valter Zanetta, who heads the Italy-Taiwan Parliamentary
Friendship Group, said he felt honored to be invited to enjoy the show and meet
Taiwan's first lady.</P>
      <P>Zanetta also conveyed to Chow the Italian people's well wishes and friendship to
the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Before the Cloud Gate performance, Chow and her daughter went on a guided tour
of the ruins of Villa Adriana (Hadrian's Villa in English) , a complex of
classical buildings build in the 2nd century A.D. by the Roman emperor Hadrian.</P>
      <P>Chow, who has assumed the role of honorary director of the world-renowned
troupe, arrived in Italy Sunday evening to meet the Cloud Gate dancers, who had
already been in Tivoli for a few days to rehearse their show.</P>
      <P>Following two performances at Villa Adriana, the troupe will perform at the
Ravenna Festival in northeastern Italy June 27-29 before flying to the Spanish
city of Barcelona on June 30.</P>
      <P>In Barcelona, the ensemble will present its widely acclaimed "Wild Cursive" at
the Grec Festival from July 1-4. "Wild Cursive" is a lyrical dance with its
title and movements inspired by Chinese calligraphy.</P>
      <P>Chow was serving as Cloud Gate's honorary director on its overseas engagements.
She assumed such a role for the first time early this year when she accompanied
the group on a tour of the United States and Canada in late January and early
February.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, she led Cloud Gate dancers on a tour of Russia, where they
performed "Whisper of Flowers" at the 2010 Chekhov International Theatre
Festival from June 10-13.</P>

      <P>The central bank is likely to leave interest rates unchanged in the upcoming
quarterly policy-making meeting despite strong economic growth in the first
quarter because the global economy remains haunted by debt problems in Europe,
analysts said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The central bank is scheduled to hold its quarterly director and supervisor
meeting Thursday, when it will set its monetary policy and comment on the state
of the economy at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>With the local economy battered by a global financial meltdown, the central bank
has cut its discount rate seven times since September 2008, slashing 2.375
percentage points to a new low of 1.25 percent.</P>
      <P>Cheng Cheng-mount, chief economist at Citibank in Taiwan, said that while the
improving local economy provides the central bank with a chance to hike interest
rates, debt problems in Europe have added uncertainty to the global economy and
are expected to prompt the central bank to give rate hikes a second thought.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that as local consumer prices remain tame with low inflation risk, it
is unlikely the central bank will raise interest rates anytime soon.</P>
      <P>In the first quarter of this year, Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) grew
13.27 percent, marking the strongest performance since the third quarter of
1978.</P>
      <P>The government has raised its forecast for 2010 GDP growth to 6.14 percent from
the previous 4.72 percent.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he expects that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by
0.25 percentage points in the first quarter of next year at the earliest, and
that Taiwan will follow suit.</P>
      <P>Previously, Cheng had predicted the earliest possible central bank interest rate
hike in the third quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>Tony Phoo, an economist with Standard Chartered Bank in Taiwan, agreed, saying
the central bank fears that any immediate interest rate hikes will interrupt the
pace of local economic recovery.</P>
      <P>Phoo said that although Taiwan scored double digit GDP growth in the first
quarter of this year, the local jobless rate remains high, adding that because
the economic growth for the second half of this year will be moderate, it is
unlikely the central bank will boost interest rates now.</P>
      <P>Qu Hongbin, chief China economist with HSBC, said that with inflation not a
concern, the central bank is expected to keep key interest rates the same in
Thursday's meeting.</P>
      <P>Qu said that because Taiwan has enjoyed strong export growth on rising global
demand, HSBC is likely to raise its forecast for the island's 2010 GDP growth.</P>
      <P>In April, HSBC forecast Taiwan's economy would grow 6.4 percent in 2010.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Magazine digest -- Private equity firms' investment in Taiwan banks</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/23/10  17:20:48
(CommonWealth 449)(translated by Kay Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two of the three Taiwanese banks that brought in funds from foreign private
equity firms at the end of 2007 have since turned a profit. However, it requires
further study to see whether private equity could be the savior of small banks
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>EnTie Commercial Bank made NT$1 billion (US$3.13 million) in the first quarter
of 2010, the highest profit among the three banks. The bank's strength lies in
its flexibility and its focus on medium sized businesses with annual revenue of
between NT$1 billion and NT$8 billion and which have lower risks than small
companies. EnTie approves loans without going through its board of directors and
approval can take as little as three weeks compared to 10 weeks at most major
banks.</P>
      <P>Apart from sticking to a profitable loan policy, EnTie's president Jesse Ding
prefers to "spend on things that actually make money." The bank is the only one
of the three that has not changed its logo or refurbished its branches, even
after the Longreach Group invested in it. Instead, EnTie has established a
trading room and spent on computer systems.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the world's biggest private equity firm the Carlyle Group has
invested in Ta Chong Bank and is using a long term strategy to expand its
business from retail banking to corporate banking and trading so it can spread
the risk. The bank launched a promotional campaign fronted by pop singer A-Mei
and has redone the decor at its branches to refresh its image.</P>
      <P>Ta Chong also plans to set up a "drive-through" bank later to attract more
customers, as its president Edmund Koh believes "to stand out in retail banking
requires innovation and quick service."</P>
      <P>Cosmos Bank is facing the most difficulties as it is still recovering from a
NT$40 billion loss from cash card lending and does not expect to make a profit
until 2012. The hedge fund nature of the bank's investor SAC Capital Advisors is
not of much help. SAC was betting on buying the bank cheap and selling it once
the economy recovered, but the recovery was delayed.</P>
      <P>While Cosmos's president Paul Lo is seeking new investment to increase the
bank's capital by NT$6 billion, SAC will not put in more money and may even sell
the shares it holds. Lo's plan is to broaden Cosmos's business from cash cards
to other banking fields such as loans for small and medium enterprises and
mortgage loans, so that it can become a full service bank.</P>
      <P>The three banks are proof that private equity firms are not necessarily the
perfect solution for struggling banks. Rather, it depends on the firm's
strategy, the bank's condition and the new management brought in by the private
equity. In the meantime, the government should come up with relevant regulations
as more overseas funds are heading to Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister Tseng Yung-fu vowed Wednesday to crack down on the reported
sale of human organs by death row prisoners that have been disguised as organ
donations.</P>
      <P>"Human organ donations  should be made without  any price involved," Tseng said
in response to a report in the Chinese-language Apple Daily that an individual
had ordered an "organ" from a death row prisoner and was paying for it with a
NT$300,000 (US$9,400) "funeral subsidy."</P>
      <P>The report also said that several other death row inmates, after being lobbied
by brokers, have signed agreements to have their organs removed and transplanted
to needy patients after they are executed.</P>
      <P>In return, the families of the prisoners will get around NT$200,000 to
NT$400,000 per organ.</P>
      <P>Tseng said any voluntary donation of their organs by death row inmates was a
good thing, but he said buying and selling organs would be strictly prohibited.</P>
      <P>He asked ministry officials to investigate the issue and said any wrongdoing
would be dealt with accordingly.</P>
      <P>Taiwan carried out its first executions in five years in April after former
Justice Minister Wang Ching-feng came out publicly in early March in favor of a
ban on the death penalty, stirring up complaints from victims' families that the
government was not acting in accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>The Constitutional Court's rejection late last month of a petition by the Taiwan
Alliance to End the Death Penalty to commute executions has also made it more
likely that the remaining 40 inmates on death row will be put to death in the
future.</P>

      <P>Yuan-tsong Chen, the scientist who invented a cure for Pompe disease, a rare
fatal neuromuscular disorder, was facing investigation Tuesday after being
accused of breaking the law regulating government procurement.</P>
      <P>Chen was released on bail of NT$600,000 (US$18,764) after being questioned by
prosecutors. His research assistant, Lee Ming-ta, was bailed on NT$200,000.</P>
      <P>After learning about the probe, Academia Sinica spokesman Y.H. Yeh said the
institute "respects and will cooperate with the prosecution's investigation."</P>
      <P>Chen, 62, is the director of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences and a
distinguished research fellow of Academia Sinica. He is best-known for his cure,
named Myozyme, for Pompe disease.</P>
      <P>The story of the development of the live-saving medicine made it to the big
screen in the 2010 Hollywood  film "Extraordinary Measures."</P>
      <P>According to the prosecutors in charge of the case, Chen is suspected of
illegally committing profits to the Taipei County-based Phamigene Inc., a
private bio-medicine company whose founders include Chen's wife Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen was accused of transferring his patented technologies for producing
genetic-based diagnostic tests to Phamigene before allowing the company, in
which he serves as honorary founder, to sell two test products to Academia
Sinica through two government procurement bids for a total value of NT$15
million.</P>
      <P>Under the Government Procurement Act, procurement personnel and procurement
supervision personnel are obliged to withdraw themselves from a procurement and
all related matters if they themselves or their spouses, relatives by blood or
by marriage within three degrees, or other relatives who live with and share the
property with them, have vested interests in the procurement.</P>
      <P>According to a team tasked by the Shihlin District Prosecutors Office to take
charge of the investigation, both Chen and Lee are suspects.</P>
      <P>The local Chinese-language United Daily News reported Chen as saying he has
never paid attention to matters such as procurement and money, and concentrates
only on his research work.</P>
      <P>He offered the argument that as the person who invented the patented genetic
tests, he should be the person in charge of their development and manufacturing
to ensure their efficiency. With that in mind,  he authorized Phamigene to
commercialize the tests, according to the Wednesday news report.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday during a ride on the Maokong Gondola that
he is glad Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin has outshone both him and his predecessors
in municipal governance, which has allowed the city to continue to develop.</P>
      <P>It was Ma's first ride on the gondola system in Muzha since it resumed service
in late March, and was seen as a show of the president's support for Hau.</P>
      <P>The system, which was built during Ma's term as Taipei mayor and began operating
in July 2007, was closed in October 2008 after the foundations of a support
pillar were eroded following a typhoon. The city government later relocated the
dangerous pillar to a safer location.</P>
      <P>Ma, who was accompanied by several city councilors, said it was his second ride
on the gondola and added that compared with three years ago, he felt the system
has become more stable, comfortable and safe.</P>
      <P>He noted that the revised design of the cable car system has helped reduce noise
and that newly added facilities in the gondola area, including a dancing water
attraction and a walking trail, have made the area even more attractive.</P>
      <P>The president also expressed hope that Hau will turn the Maokong Gondola area
into a major scenic spot.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the city government's decision to suspend the system for 17
months was not due to actual safety problems but only because of public concern
about the safety of the gondola.</P>
      <P>Touting the cost of the gondola rides, Ma noted that it costs only NT$50 to ride
on the system and said this is much cheaper than the prices for a similar
service in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hau announced a free ride program for Taipei school children during
the summer break.</P>
      <P>According to the mayor, from July 1 to Aug. 31, students at elementary schools
in the city can ride the gondola free by showing their student ID cards, while
up to two accompanying teachers can also travel free and additional teachers or
parents can have a 30 percent discount.</P>
      <P>Students at the city's junior and senior high schools will get 50 percent
discounts, Hau added.</P>
      <P>Hau also said a recent  survey  shows that the level of satisfaction with the
service among those who have ridden on the system has reached 81 percent,
compared with only 18 percent among those who have not used it.</P>
      <P>This, he said, signals that people might have a stereotyped impression of the
service, which, according to Hau, is because it has been highly "stigmatized" in
the past.</P>

      <P>China Steel Corp., Taiwan's largest steel maker, said Wednesday that if steel
products are included on an "early harvest" list under a proposed trade pact
with China, the company will have a better chance to enter the Chinese auto-
making supply chain.</P>
      <P>China Steel President J.C. Chou said China Steel will take advantage of the
preferential status that the list will offer to seek Chinese partners.</P>
      <P>The early harvest list from Taiwan will contain items subject to tariff waivers
and easier market access in China under the planned economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government has said the ECFA will lift the local economy by boosting
economic exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are expected to exchange early harvest lists Thursday as
representatives of both sides meet in Taipei to discuss details of a fifth round
of semi-official cross strait talks.</P>
      <P>After the company's annual general meeting, Chou told reporters he expects
Taiwan's steel products for car use will be very competitive in China.</P>
      <P>Still,  Chou said,  Taiwanese  steel firms  need to build partnerships with
Chinese counterparts if they aim to penetrate the huge Chinese market.</P>
      <P>China Steel will lay down marketing strategies for the Chinese market once it is
assured what steel products will be included on the early harvest list.</P>
      <P>He said that to his knowledge, plate and coil steel products such as stainless
steel and carbon steel could be included into the list, while bar steel, H-beam
steel and steel billets could be excluded.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, China Steel Chairman Chang Chia-juch said steel prices in the region
are expected to stabilize in the fourth quarter of this year after months of
declines as China has canceled tax refunds on steel product exports to boost
prices.</P>
      <P>Chang said rising demand for steel products also serves as a factor to stabilize
pricing.</P>
      <P>He said he is "optimistic" about China Steel's earnings outlook this year.</P>
      <P>However, Chang announced at the meeting that he would step down amid criticism
about his policy to reform the company. He said he has done his best to protect
shareholders' rights and ensure fairness in operating the company.</P>
      <P>A board meeting has approved a proposal for Chou to succeed Chang, according to
a company spokesman.</P>

      <P>A Japanese electronics manufacturer is expected to issue Taiwan depositary
receipts (TDR) on the local bourse this year, Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp. (TWSE)
Chairman Schive Chi said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the Japanese company, which Schive would not identify,
recently visited the stock exchange to explore the feasibility of listing in
Taiwan by issuing TDRs.</P>
      <P>The bourse has set a goal of having 20 overseas companies list in Taiwan this
year, but to date, only four enterprises have completed their listings and
another three -- Hong Kong-based Lerado Group and Heng Tai Consumable Group Ltd.
and Singapore-based Super Group Ltd. -- have applied to issue TDRs, the stock
exchange chairman said.</P>
      <P>Schive expects interest to pick up in the second half of the year, as in
addition to the Japanese electronics company, several Singaporean enterprises
have also expressed interest in applying to list on Taiwan's bourse.</P>
      <P>The stock exchange is also considering relaxing its rules to allow red-chip
companies -- Chinese companies incorporated outside of China -- to list TDRs,
and Schive said several such companies have shown interest in the idea, but he
did not disclose their names.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that applicable regulations for the move have yet to be
finalized.</P>
      <P>Schive also proposed for the first time that in the future, Taiwan and China
could include the actual guidelines on companies listing in each other's market
as part of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), which is still
under negotiation.</P>
      <P>Schive believes the move would stimulate capital markets on both sides of the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office called on Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Wednesday to be tolerant of different voices
on Taiwan's proposed trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>"Chairwoman Tsai should try to persuade others through reason rather than by
besmirching their names even if she does not accept their positions, "
Presidential spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Tsai described President Ma Ying-jeou as being "paranoiac" in
listening only to the opinions of those who share his views on issues.</P>
      <P>She also took issue with Kenichi Ohmae, the famous Japanese corporate
strategist, who said in a speech delivered earlier Tuesday at the Presidential
Office that the cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
would be a "vitamin" for Taiwan's economy,</P>
      <P>Tsai, who opposes the ECFA, said Ohmae would not be of help to Taiwan in dealing
with major problems such as unemployment, the widening gap between rich and
poor, and Taiwan's survival, problems she argued the president should be
thinking about but has not.</P>
      <P>Lo responded, however, that the Japanese expert, based on his professional
judgment, has a positive outlook on Taiwan's future, in sharp contrast to Tsai,
who prefers to "talk down" the country by deliberately running roughshod over
expert opinion.</P>
      <P>As a world-renowned strategist from Japan, Ohmae doesn't have any partisan
position, Lo said, and if Tsai did not approve of his view, she should have
tried to rebut based on reasoning.</P>
      <P>Harvard University Professor Michael Porter has also said the ECFA is Taiwan's
only choice for its future development, Lo said, a point of view shared by the
American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei, the European Chamber of Commerce Taipei
and the Japanese Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, Taipei.</P>
      <P>"By turning a deaf ear to the voices of the experts and powerful foreign
business groups, Tsai herself has been extremely 'paranoid' but instead blames
others for suffering from paranoia,  " Lo contended.</P>
      <P>The DPP-led opposition "green camp" is strongly opposed to the ECFA -- a
possible step toward a wider ranging free trade agreement in the future -- on
the grounds that it might undermine Taiwan's sovereignty and leave Taiwan too
dependent on China economically.</P>
      <P>The pact is expected to be officially forged by the end of this month.</P>

      <P>An 11-year-old girl born to a Taiwanese father and a mother from Trinidad and
Tobago acquired her permanent resident certificate Wednesday after appealing to
President Ma Ying-jeou for help.</P>
      <P>"President Ma, thank you! I finally can stay and receive an education in
Taiwan," said Lin Yi-nung, who lives in Miaoli County.</P>
      <P>After notifying her family, the National Immigration Agency (NIA) delivered the
certificate to her at a school in Miaoli County, where family members and
officials joined her for the event. Lin bowed to the agency personnel, Miaoli
Deputy Magistrate Lin Chiu-hsiang and others who had helped her. "Thank you
all," she said.</P>
      <P>Lin can now apply for an identification card at her local household registration
office.</P>
      <P>According to Lin's 85-year-old grandmother, the girl was brought back to Taiwan
from Trinidad and Tobago by her sailor father when she was eight months old.
Since then, she has been raised by her grandmother.</P>
      <P>Lin never obtained  household  registration  or a resident certificate because
her father could not acquire his marriage certificate or the girl's birth
certificate, both of which are crucial for Taiwanese citizenship.</P>
      <P>Until recently, the family did not dare to disclose Lin's situation, said Chang
Po-sheng, the brother of Lin's father.</P>
      <P>As a result, Lin could not register in local public schools. She attended
classes at a local church and took lessons as a guest student at Wen Shuei
Elementary School in Taian Township, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Last year, Lin's father applied to the NIA for his daughter's resident
certificate with DNA test results and a court document confirming the results
were accurate, but the agency rejected the application  because  the father
failed to supply Lin's birth certificate.</P>
      <P>Lin's family was informed that the girl would be repatriated to Trinidad and
Tobago in June.</P>
      <P>The news caused Lin's grandmother to cry every day and pray for Lin to be able
to stay, Chang said, adding that the grandmother's grief spurred Lin to write to
the president.</P>
      <P>"I take Taian Township as my hometown. President Ma, please help me, save me.
Let me be a Taiwanese. I want to stay with my grandmother and she wants me to
stay too, " Lin wrote in a letter to the Presidential Office in late May.</P>
      <P>Lin's grandmother said her 11-year-old wish finally came true.</P>
      <P>"If Yi-nung were repatriated, I could never see her again in my lifetime. I
wouldn't want to live any longer, " she said in tears.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Eighteen agricultural and fishery items from Taiwan will be given preferential
tariff treatment under a trade pact between Taiwan and China that is expected to
be signed soon, Council of Agriculture Minister Chen Wu-hsiung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The 18 items are now subject to average duties of 13.3 percent when entering
China, Chen said, but after being included in the trade pact's "early harvest"
list, the items should benefit from declining tariffs over the next three years
until they are cut to zero.</P>
      <P>If that happens, Chen said, Taiwanese exporters can save an estimated US$2
million in duties in three years under the pact, known as the economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Speaking on the sidelines of the opening of the 2010 Taipei International Food
Show, Chen said the exports to China of five of the items -- tea, dancing-lady
orchids, golden needle mushrooms, grouper and milkfish -- may rise to a combined
US$110 million in three years, thanks to the tariff reductions.</P>
      <P>Of the 18 listed items, 13 are farm produce and five are fishery products, Chen
said. No livestock products have been included on the list in the first stage
because of epidemic concerns, as Taiwan has yet to be removed from the list of
foot-and-mouth disease-stricken areas.</P>
      <P>Other agricultural products on the list include five kinds of fruit, including
bananas and oranges, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Tuna, squid, Malabar chestnuts, and Prairie Gentian, a type of flower, were not
included on the list.</P>
      <P>Chen also reaffirmed that China-bound Taiwanese agricultural and fishery
products can be identified as originating in Taiwan rather than "Taiwan, China"
or "Taipei, China" as ECFA opponents have speculated.</P>
      <P>The COA minister is scheduled to brief the Legislative Yuan Thursday on the 18
items included in the "early harvest" list.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwanese and Chinese ECFA negotiators will meet in Taipei Thursday
for a fourth round of formal talks on the content of the agreement, during which
the two sides are expected to exchange their "early harvest" lists.</P>
      <P>Negotiators from both sides will also hammer out technical details Thursday for
a fifth meeting between Chiang Pin-kung, the chairman of Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president
of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen are expected to formally ink the much-anticipated ECFA during
that meeting, to take place in China either later this month or in early July.</P>

      <P>Skype, the online phone provider, aims to be available on every device connected
to the Internet at some point in the future, Skype CEO Josh Silverman said
Wednesday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"Our vision is ubiquity in which communications flow like water from device to
device, from mode to mode, to meet the needs of the customers wherever and
however they are," he said at a press meeting.</P>
      <P>"All computing devices tied to the Internet become communication devices with
the simple addition of our software," he noted.</P>
      <P>Silverman also unveiled a new software development kit called SkypeKit, which
will help consumer electronic and desktop software innovators to embed Skype
into their products.</P>
      <P>SkypeKit  will  initially  be available  as a beta on an invitation-only basis,
according to the company's website.</P>
      <P>Skype is now making good progress in becoming a personal computer necessity,
Silverman said.</P>
      <P>At present, eight of the 10 leading PC original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)
ship the Internet voice call software already installed, the chief executive
said.</P>
      <P>"We aspire to have 100 million PCs shipped with Skype preloaded in 2011,"
Silverman noted.</P>
      <P>Globally, there were 560 million registered Skype users at the end of 2009, with
300,000 new users added every day.</P>
      <P>At the press meet, Silverman also showed no fear of challengers, such as search
engine giant Google.</P>
      <P>He said that when eBay acquired Skype in 2005, Google had just launched Google
Talk, which was widely regarded as a "Skype killer."</P>
      <P>"Today, we are about 10 times bigger than we were in 2005, " Silverman said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's "early harvest" list under a planned trade pact with China will be
"satisfactory" as it includes 530 items with a total export value of about
US$13.6 billion, Chiang Pin-kung, Taiwan's top negotiator with China, said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Categories of goods not listed for preferential tariff treatment will continue
to be discussed  after the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) is
signed, said Chiang, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>The SEF is a semi-official body commissioned by the government to handle cross-
strait exchanges with its Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Chiang said at a meeting of the SEF board of directors and supervisors that
China's list includes 270 categories of goods valued at US$3 billion to be
accepted by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A Chinese delegation led by ARATS Vice President Zheng Lizhong will hold a
preparatory meeting Thursday in Taipei with SEF Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian to
hammer out the details for the fifth round of talks between Chiang and ARATS
President Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen are scheduled to sign the ECFA and another pact on the
protection of intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>Chiang confirmed media reports saying that the latest SEF-ARATS talks will begin
June 28 in Chongqing, western China and that the ECFA and the intellectual
property rights pact will be inked the following day, but "the schedule has yet
to be finalized at the preparatory meeting."</P>
      <P>The one-day preparatory meeting will also finalize the text of the ECFA and the
pact related to intellectual rights.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that the ECFA will serve as a turning point for Taiwan in "totally
refreshing" the country's economy and winning it a "golden decade."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's high-speed rail system operator, Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) ,
posted its first ever net operating profit in 2009 but net income was still in
the red, weighed down by high interest costs and depreciation.</P>
      <P>At its annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday, the company reported operating
revenues of NT$23.32 billion (US$728.76 million) and net operating income of
NT$5.56 billion, its first positive result since beginning commercial operations
in 2007.</P>
      <P>THSRC said operating revenues rose by NT$270 million, or 1.2 percent, in 2009
while operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, fell by NT$770
million, or 7.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The company said its bottom line was helped by higher passenger traffic, lower
interest costs after its syndicated loans were renegotiated, and the change from
a straight line depreciation method to one based on transport volume.</P>
      <P>But high interest costs and depreciation and amortization still left THSRC with
a net loss of NT$4.79 billion, or a loss per share of NT$1.03.</P>
      <P>THSRC Chairman Ou Chin-der was upbeat about the rail line's performance, saying
that more than 3 million passengers rode the high-speed rail in February, the
first time the railway surpassed the 3 million-passenger mark in a single month.</P>
      <P>Ou said passenger volume continued to rise in May, reaching 3.2 million in May,
Ou added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen called on
the government Wednesday to make public the process and the outcome of
negotiations over a proposed trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>Tsai also said that the Legislative Yuan should hold hearings to gather public
opinion on the issue now that the items on the planned cross-strait economic
cooperation framework agreement's (ECFA's) "early harvest" list are nearly
finalized.</P>
      <P>The early harvest list refers to goods and services that will be eligible for
tariff concessions  or exemptions  or be granted preferential market access
treatment.</P>
      <P>At a press conference to promote a DPP-planned mass protest against the ECFA on
June 26, Tsai said that during talks on the trade accord, Taiwan's negotiators
paid the most attention to whether Taiwan's petrochemical and machine tool
industries will be included on the list.</P>
      <P>Not enough attention is paid to what Chinese items are on the list for import
into Taiwan and what types of Taiwanese industries will be hurt by the pact,
Tsai added.</P>
      <P>She accused the government of rushing to sign the ECFA by setting a timetable.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the most unacceptable part of the deal was the Executive  Yuan
Referendum  Review  Commission's  "strange  and incomprehensible" denial of a
proposal by the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union to put the ECFA to a
referendum, despite the fact the proposal was endorsed by more than 100,000
people.</P>
      <P>Tsai and members of the DPP Central Standing Committee will take the lead at a
march on June 26 to show their resolution to protect Taiwan's democracy and the
people's right to referendum, a DPP spokesman said at the press conference,
which was also attended by 20 pro-Taiwan independence groups.</P>

      <P>A Shanghai resident became the 200,000th visitor to the Taiwan Pavilion at the
2010 Shanghai World Expo Wednesday, 53 days after the pavilion's formal opening.</P>
      <P>Gu Sunli received an 11.6-inch Acer notebook worth NT$29,800 (US$932) as a gift.</P>
      <P>The 23-year-old received the award from Wang Chih-kang, chairman of the Taiwan
External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) , which sponsored the pavilion.</P>
      <P>"It really, really came as a surprise to me...I did not expect it...This was
incredible for me, " a jubilant Gu said after receiving the gift.</P>
      <P>The 199,999th and 200,001st visitors were each presented 24-inch LCD monitors
worth NT$15,000.</P>
      <P>The trio were all from a 37-member tour group that registered to visit the
pavilion Wednesday. Other group members were given a variety of gifts including
flash drives, food products and model Taipei 101 towers.</P>
      <P>The 23.8 meter-tall Taiwan Pavilion was designed by C.Y. Lee, the architect who
designed Taipei 101. A 12-meter-diameter LED ball called "The Heart of Taiwan"
is the centerpiece of the pavilion and shows multi-layered  multimedia
performances showcasing Taiwan's culture and scenery.</P>
      <P>The pavilion not only shows Taiwan's cutting-edge high technology but also leads
visitors through some of Taiwan's natural and cultural attractions, including
Sun Moon Lake, ceramics from Yingge, rocks from Jade Mountain and an "infinity
pool" that gives viewers the illusion the water extends to the horizon and is
said to symbolize the Pacific Ocean.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
06/23/10  23:07:55</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun has advanced further at a Wimbledon singles event than any
other Taiwanese tennis player in history by reaching the third round of the
men's singles at the venerable grand slam on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In defeating Michal Przysiezny of Poland 6-4, 7-6 (7), 6-3 in the tournament's
second round, Lu also finally achieved a breakthrough that had been long
overdue. He had lost in two previous second round appearances in 2004 and 2005,
but had not won at Wimbledon since.</P>
      <P>The 82nd-ranked Lu, who has only reached the third round of one other grand slam
event in his career -- the Australian Open in 2009 -- escaped danger repeatedly
to hold off the pesky Pole, who did Lu a favor by beating 17th seed Ivan
Ljubicic of Croatia in the first round.</P>
      <P>The way Lu is playing right now, however, he may have been able to overcome the
unpredictable Croat. His serve has been solid, blowing 21 aces past his Polish
opponent and he has showed more aggression than usual, hitting 60 winners to
Przysiezny's 25.</P>
      <P>After a first set in which Lu broke his opponent early and then held serve to
close it out, the match appeared destined to be evened at a set apiece. But Lu
saved a set point when serving at 5-6, and two more in a wild tiebreaker that he
eventually won 9-7.</P>
      <P>Lu quickly fell behind 3-1 in the third, but rolled off the last five games,
including breaking a dispirited Przysiezny at love in the decisive eighth game,
to pull out the match in 2 hours and 25 minutes.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese player may have made history, but he will now certainly be more
worried about advancing deeper into the draw than setting records.</P>
      <P>His third round foe will be the unseeded but dangerous Florian Mayer of Germany,
who may be only ranked 59th in the world but is in top form, having dismantled
11th seed Marin Cilic of Croatia in the opening round in straight sets.</P>
      <P>Lu gave little indication prior to Wimbledon that he was ready to make a charge
in London. His career grand slam record before the tournament was an
unimpressive 6-18, and he had not threatened in any main ATP Tour events this
year.</P>
      <P>But after his first round victory over No. 42 Horacio Zeballos of Argentina 7-5,
6-4, 6-3, Lu, who can be his own worst critic, was uncharacteristically upbeat
his performance.</P>
      <P>He said he played a complete match, serving extremely well and played
consistently from the baseline, and the numbers -- 18 aces and 70 winners --
backed him up.</P>
      <P>Those numbers are sure to leave him full of confidence heading into his match
against Mayer.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Chan Yung-jan was also in action Wednesday, trying to become the first
Taiwanese woman to reach the third round of a Wimbledon singles event against
12th seed Nadia Petrova of Russia.</P>

      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian has filed an appeal with Taiwan's Supreme Court,
challenging his conviction on corruption, forgery and money laundering charges
and a 20-year jail sentence handed down by a lower court, Chen's attorney said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court in a ruling on June 11 reduced the sentences of Chen and
his wife Wu Shu-jen on graft charges from life to 20 years, saying the amount
that Chen was accused of embezzling was less than that recognized by the Taipei
District Court in the initial trial.</P>
      <P>The court also cut the fines for Chen to NT$170 million (US$5.2 million) from
NT$200 million and for Wu to NT$200 million from NT$300 million.</P>
      <P>In the June 11 ruling, the former president's son, Chen Chih- chung, and his
wife Huang Jui-ching, both charged with money laundering,  received  sentences
of 14 months  and one year, respectively, a reduction from 30 months and 20
months.</P>
      <P>The former president filed the appeal on the grounds that the state affairs
funds that he was charged with embezzling were used in accordance with past
practice.</P>
      <P>He also argued that there was no evidence  to prove his involvement in the
Longtan land acquisition case, and that other payments received from business
people, allegedly for favors, were political contributions.</P>
      <P>Chen also appealed against the extension of his detention for two months handed
down by the Taiwan High Court on June 18.</P>
      <P>The High Court said Chen's detention, which was set to end June 23, would be
extended until August 23 because Chen might flee Taiwan and he has yet to return
all the money he was convicted of laundering abroad.</P>

30 years and older.</P>
      <P>We hereby want to analyze the policy's benefits and disadvantages as well as its
feasibility.</P>
      <P>The scarcity of land, especially in prime areas, has been one of the factors
keeping housing prices high in Taipei City. At the same time, we have seen many
old residential buildings that provide poor living conditions. Under these
circumstances, it is necessary and meaningful to push for urban renewal.</P>
      <P>Urban renewal efforts were unsuccessful in the past partly because many of these
old buildings were constructed before floor area ratio requirements were
imposed. In the event of reconstruction, homeowners will see a decrease in the
floor area of their homes. Therefore, many residents are reluctant to
participate in urban renewal projects. Allowing them a floor area ratio that is
double that of normal projects will boost their interest.</P>
      <P>Although we are in favor of this policy, we are deeply concerned about the city
government's efficiency in execution. The city government should speed up its
pace and make public all the technical details with regard to the plan before it
is implemented Aug. 1.</P>

      <P>Preparatory talks for a fifth meeting between the top negotiators from the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, known locally as the "Chiang-Chen Meeting," opened
in Taipei Thursday to pave the way for the signing of a landmark trade
agreement.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and his
Chinese counterpart Zheng Lizhong, vice president of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) , led the Taiwanese and Chinese
delegations,  respectively,  for the preparatory talks.</P>
      <P>In the morning session, the two sides will focus on putting final touches on the
text of the cross-strait  economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , the
content of each other's "early harvest" lists of products to be eligible for
tariff waivers under the ECFA, appendices to the pact and the text of a cross-
strait intellectual property rights (IPR) protection agreement.</P>
      <P>The afternoon session will focus on the time, venue and itinerary of the fifth
meeting between SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen Yunlin
next week.</P>
      <P>Chiang said Wednesday that he planned to meet Chen next week in the southwestern
Chinese city of Chongqing, but he added that the dates and venue are still up
for final confirmation at Thursday's talks.</P>
      <P>The primary agenda for the fifth Chiang-Chen meeting is the signing of two key
agreements -- the ECFA, which is largely concerned with tariff exemptions for
bilateral trade, and the IPR protection pact.</P>
      <P>Government sources said the fifth Chiang-Chen meeting will be held June 28-30.
The Taiwan delegation will travel to Chongqing via a chartered plane, according
to the sources.</P>

      <P>In a court session held Wednesday on his corruption  and money-laundering case,
former President Chen Shui-bian expressed displeasure with former Chinatrust
Financial Holding Co.  Vice Chairman Jeffrey Koo Jr.,  who allegedly  made huge
political contributions to him.</P>
      <P>Chen was unhappy that Koo always donated the money through his wife, former
first lady Wu Shu-jen. Chen also complained that his wife often did not tell him
where the money came from or who the donors were.</P>
      <P>Chen's statement tells us many things. Businesspeople liked to make their
contributions through Wu because they knew she was a money-grubber and was the
true master of the family.</P>
      <P>Also, one of the possible reasons why Wu did not tell Chen about the origin of
the money was because portions of the money were not political contributions,
but bribery.</P>
      <P>The question is: As the president, how could Chen have condoned his wife's
behavior? This was a show of fraud and greed that was jointly put up by our two-
term president, his family, and their corporate accomplices. (June 24, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- ECFA and central bank board meeting</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Preparatory talks for a fifth cross-Taiwan Strait high-level meeting, known
locally as a "Chiang-Chen" meeting, open in Taipei Thursday to pave the way for
the signing of a landmark trade agreement later this month.</P>
      <P>The two sides have reached consensus on key points of the cross-strait economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , which is largely concerned with tariff
reductions for bilateral trade.</P>
      <P>Approximately 540 Taiwanese items and 270 products from China will immediately
benefit from the pact's "early harvest" program.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, the Central Bank of the Republic of China (CBC) will hold a board
meeting to set the tone for Taiwan's monetary policy for the second half of the
year.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the meeting, market researchers said they most look forward to
getting answers on three issues: the impact of the Chinese currency's greater
flexibility on the New Taiwan dollar; feasible solutions to local insurers' huge
interest losses as a result of longstanding low interest rates in Taiwan; and
the central bank's forecast on economic prospects amid the lingering eurozone
debt crisis.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issues:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>According to senior Taiwanese officials, China has shown great sincerity toward
the "early harvest" program in ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>Under China's free trade agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, the combined amount of items eligible for tariff waivers accounts for
only 1.8 percent of bilateral trade volume and the list does not include any
industrial products.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the combined amount of Taiwanese products to receive tariff
concessions  will account  for 15 percent  of overall cross-strait trade volume
and the "early harvest" list includes key industrial items, such as
polypropylene (PP).</P>
      <P>Moreover, 11 of Taiwan's service industries will be allowed to invest in China
on terms better than the World Trade Organization (WTO) has stipulated,
including independently operating hospitals in China's coastal provinces where
large numbers of Taiwanese business people live.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan will open its market to nine service industries from China
under the new agreement. (June 24, 2010).</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>On the eve of the unveiling of the "early harvest" list, an influential Chinese
official who requested anonymity said China has conceded whatever it can in ECFA
talks with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>His remarks were seen as a strategy to gain an upper hand to help weaken anti-
ECFA voices in Taiwan, where pro-independence groups are scheduled to take to
the streets this weekend to push for a national referendum on the new cross-
strait pact.</P>
      <P>Local political analysts have said the Taiwanese  public's reaction to the
"early harvest" list will determine not only the ECFA's  value  but also
President  Ma Ying-jeou's  first-term credentials.</P>
      <P>Some analysts said Beijing was forced to make more concessions in ECFA talks
because it is afraid that any ECFA backlash may give the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) an advantage against the ruling Kuomintang in Taiwan's
pivotal five municipality mayoral elections slated for Nov. 27. (June 24, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said President Ma's administration is far more
concerned about whether major business groups' call for the inclusion of
petrochemicals and machine tools in the "early harvest" list is met than about
which industries will be hurt as a result of the market opening to Chinese
products or services.</P>
      <P>Tsai said she believes the Ma administration's rush to strike the ECFA deal with
China is primarily aimed at straightening the road to Ma's bid for a second term
rather than at benefiting Taiwanese people. (June 24, 2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Nobel Prize Laureate Robert A. Mundell, also known as the father of the euro,
said earlier this week that China's decision to restart reform of its currency's
exchange rate regime at this moment may affect the stability of the Chinese
economy and hinder global economic recovery.</P>
      <P>Local bankers said they would like to see CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan comment on
Mundell's forecast at Thursday's CBC board meeting.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Premier Sean Chen said recently that interest rates could be
Taiwan's biggest financial risk. Due to low interest rates in recent years,
local insurers have been burdened with losses from interest rate gaps. Market
researchers said they hope to know whether the central bank has any strategies
to tackle the issue. (June 24, 2010).</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Chuang Chia-jung and her Belarusian partner Olga Govortsova defeated a
Belarusian-Russian pair 3-6, 7-6, 6-2 Wednesday to progress to the second round
of the women's doubles at the 2010 Wimbledon Tennis Championships in London.</P>
      <P>It was the first time Chuang and Govortsova cooperated in a Wimbledon doubles
match, and the pair was seeded 17th.</P>
      <P>Chuang told the Central News Agency that the pair's chemistry has been improving
after first playing together in Dubai early this year and later in Rome.</P>
      <P>"I'm positive we will reach the third round if we play as well as we did today,"
she said.</P>
      <P>This is Chuang's fourth doubles appearance at Wimbledon. Her best result came in
2007 when she reached the third round with compatriot Chan Yung-jan.</P>
      <P>Her performance at Wimbledon last year suffered because of a back injury, but
she said she was in better shape this time around.</P>
      <P>"Everything's OK this year," Chuang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chan -- long touted as the next big star in Taiwanese tennis -- was
knocked out 3-6, 4-6 by 12th seeded Nadia Petrova of Russia in the second round
of women's singles Wednesday. The 20-year-old was trying to become the first
Taiwanese woman to make it to the third round at a Wimbledon singles event.</P>
      <P>Chan broke her Wimbledon curse in her fourth try the day before to reach the
second round by whipping Swiss veteran Patty Schnyder, a perennial top 20 player
now ranked 58th, 6-0, 6-2 for her maiden singles victory at Wimbledon.</P>
      <P>Chan is also entered in the doubles and paired with Zheng Jie from China. They
are seeded ninth at the event and are not slated to face another seeded pairing
until the third round.</P>

      <P>will hold a demonstration this weekend against the proposed cross-strait
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), which the party has described
as a deal that will be beneficial to business groups but unfavorable to "weak

      <P>This is not the first time the DPP has manipulated an issue to make it appear to
be a class struggle between the rich and the poor. Past examples  include  the
party's  opposition  to a freeway construction project more than 30 years ago
and its objection to a proposal to transform Taipei's Songshan Airport into an
airport serving business travelers.</P>
      <P>The DPP is neither a class-based party nor a leftist party. Its rich-poor
struggle argument is simply a supplement for political struggle. This is evident
from the fact that the DPP-backed social movements came to a halt during the
eight years when the party was in power, but are returning now that it is again
in the opposition.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, who is from a wealthy family, has become the most "leftist" leader
in the DPP's history. She is against the ECFA and calls for Taiwan to abandon
its export-oriented economic policy. Is this "true leftist" or "pseudo leftist"?

      <P>Taiwan's competitive electronics sector has laid a good foundation for
developing electric cars because local high-tech firms are able to serve as
major component suppliers, a Taiwanese official said here Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Our electronics sector has earned a reputation for its high quality products
and has become as a major supplier of a wide variety of products, such as
navigation systems, controlling systems, systems to drive cars in reverse and
motors for electric car use, " said Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Hwang
Jung-chiou.</P>
      <P>Hwang made the comments as he transited in Los Angeles on the way to Taipei
after leading a delegation to a Taiwan auto industry forum and exhibition in
Detroit to seek opportunities for electric car development partnerships with
U.S. firms.</P>
      <P>According to Hwang, many foreign firms were excited about Taiwan's ability to
integrate its electronics sector with car manufacturing to churn out competitive
electric car components.</P>
      <P>He said the forum and exhibition, which were held June 21-22, opened many
potential foreign partners' eyes and boosted confidence in Taiwan's electric car
manufacturing technology.</P>
      <P>He added that some foreign firms asked Taiwanese exhibitors to send samples to
their labs to study the possibility of cooperation.</P>
      <P>Hwang said that the U.S. auto industry has raised the awareness of the strength
of Asian car and component makers after Japanese car makers grabbed a large
share of its car market, adding that Taiwan should take advantage of the
progress to penetrate the U.S. market.</P>
      <P>In April,  the Ministry of Economic  Affairs announced  a development project to
build 10 electric car production parks by the end of 2013.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Magazine digest -- Demand for 7-11 salads spurs farmers to 'upgrade'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/24/10  15:10:31
(Business Weekly 1178)(translated by Kay Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A farm cooperative in south-central Taiwan's Yunlin County has undergone huge
reform in the past decade, as it has taken on the task of supplying fresh
produce to Taiwan's biggest convenience store chain, and in the process has
equipped its farmers with the professional skills to handle modern day
challenges.</P>
      <P>President Chain Store Corp., the operator of Taiwan's 4,000 7-Eleven stores,
recorded its second highest monthly sales of NT$9.6 billion (US$30 million) in
May, more than 16 percent of which was from the sale of its fresh food products
such as sandwiches, lunch boxes, and salads. An important factor in the growth
of this product line is the supply of high quality vegetables and fruits.</P>
      <P>When 7-Eleven began to sell salads, it approached the Xinhu farm cooperative
directly because of the large quantity of high-quality fresh vegetables that
were required, said the chain's project manager Wu Ching-fu. The farm now
supplies half of the vegetables and fruits in 7-Eleven stores, with the
participation of more than 30 contracted farmers.</P>
      <P>The key to the cooperative's success were the changes made in the production
process and in the attitude of farmers. In the past, farmers grew whatever they
liked and sold whatever they produced. Now, they need to learn to manage their
farms in order to grow produce of a consistent quality. The participation of a
younger generation of farmers has helped in the process because they tend to be
more open to change.</P>
      <P>"We now manage the whole process, from growing to production, from the farms to
the factories, " said head of the farm cooperative Chen Ching-shan. The 7-Eleven
chain has introduced a Japanese concept of integrating the supply chain to react
faster to market demands, as shown by its point of sales system. The farm
cooperative is also allowed to take part in research and development. For
example, it added yellow carrots to the fresh salads to give them more variety.</P>
      <P>The cooperative's output has increased 10 fold in the past 10 years, and the
contracted farmers now make a steady income and can expand further. Chen said
two new production lines were added earlier this year to the three that were
already in place, in an effort to meet growing demand. As the operation
continues to grow, chances are that it could develop into a big farm enterprise.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.10 percent in thin trade Thursday, just below
the nearest technical resistance level of 7,600 points, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 7.74 points to 7,589.89 after moving between 7,567.96
and 7,607.63 on turnover of NT$74.96 billion (US$2.34 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.26 percent, led by small and medium cap stocks. It
briefly breached the 7,600 mark before profit-taking emerged to erode some of
the earlier gains, with many investors sidelined by a lack of incentives
following a lackluster overnight performance on Wall Street, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,505 stocks closed up and 1,340 down, with 427 stocks unchanged.</P>
      <P>The foodstuff sector enjoyed the highest gains, up 0.9 percent. The paper and
pulp sector closed up 0.8 percent, the textile sector was 0.7 percent higher,
while the cement and financial sectors rose 0.4 percent each.</P>
      <P>Both the plastics and chemical sector and the machinery and electronics sector
closed unchanged, while construction shares fell 0.2 percent.</P>
      <P>"The market was very quiet today, " TLG Asset Management's Arch Shih said. "With
such low turnover, it was hard for the bourse to overcome the technical hurdles
to moving significantly above 7,600 points."</P>
      <P>Shih said that as many institutional investors retreated from the trading floor,
funds from retail investors merely boosted small and medium cap shares.</P>
      <P>"The market  needed active heavyweight  stocks  to make a breakthrough, but
large cap stocks remained stagnant," Shih said.</P>
      <P>"Today's market performance showed many foreign institutional investors were not
willing to trade at the moment amid fears of a major pullback after recent
significant gains," he added.</P>
      <P>United Microelectronics Corp. fell 1.35 percent to NT$14.60 and Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. closed down 0.16 percent to NT$62.00.</P>
      <P>Personal computer vendor Acer lost 1.22 percent to NT$81.10 and rival Quanta
Computer closed unchanged at NT$60.10.</P>
      <P>Shih said that because concerns over the pace of a global economic recovery
remain in place, the market is expected to trade in a narrow range in the short
term.</P>
      <P>Among small and medium cap stocks, Standard Foods rose 4.64 percent to NT$83.40
and cooking oil firm Fwusow gained 1.59 percent to NT$12.80.</P>
      <P>Personal computer firm Asustek gained 6.89 percent to NT$240.50 on the first day
of trade resumption after spinning off its manufacturing arm earlier this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THSRC 'fat cats' willing to work for free</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two independent directors of Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) who have been
called "government fat cats" said Thursday that they would not only be willing
to work for half their salaries, but would do their jobs for free.</P>
      <P>Liu Wei-chi and Chen Shih-chi, two of three independent directors at the
corporation, have been criticized by local media for earning pay from more than
one public agency at the same time.</P>
      <P>Liu told the Central News Agency that he would not mind working as an unpaid
volunteer at THSRC, let alone receiving half the normal salary.</P>
      <P>Chen also said he is willing to work with THSRC as a volunteer, but added that
it is resentful to be called a "fat cat."</P>
      <P>"'Fat cat' is a humiliation to a board director who has work experience and
expertise," Chen said.</P>
      <P>THSRC recently followed regulations put forth by the Ministry of Finance that
capped the monthly salaries for vice presidents, board directors  and
independent  directors after Premier Wu Den-yih instructed several government
agencies to solve the "fat cat" problem. The corporation's new salaries for
independent directors will be half of what they are currently earning.</P>
      <P>Criticism of THSRC "fat cats" arose last September when Ou Chin-der was chosen
by the corporation's board of directors to replace Nita Ing as company chair in
an effort to streamline company operations. At the time, THSRC's annual reports
showed the company paid each of its 22 vice presidents over NT$2 million
(US$62,500) per year, while each of its three foreign consultants earned NT$10
million annually.</P>
      <P>Ing's annual salary reached as high as NT$13 million before she offered to
forego her wages earlier in 2009 when THSRC initiated a 10 percent to 20 percent
cut in the salaries of its high-ranking executives.</P>
      <P>As of this month, 10 THSRC vice presidents have resigned, but the three
independent directors remain. Each of them still makes over NT$2 million per
year from the corporation.</P>
      <P>THSRC, a private company that built the 345-kilometer high-speed railway and
operates the line under a build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract with the
government, has lost money since the railway began operating in January 2007.</P>
      <P>In the two and a half years since the end of June 2009, it has accumulated
losses of over NT$70 billion -- about 66 percent of its paid-in capital of
NT$105.3 billion -- and total debts of NT$400 billion.</P>

      <P>Taiwan needs to focus on enhancing its industrial competitiveness, as a soon-to-
be-concluded trade pact with China will produce effects "within a certain
timeframe, " a local think thank predicted Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will again have difficulty in competing (with other countries) if it
fails to sign a free trade agreement with other countries or to upgrade its
industrial competitive edge within two years of signing the economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA), " Taiwan Institute for Economic Research President
David Hong said at a press briefing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are expected to sign the trade pact within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>The two sides were set later in the day to unveil their respective "early
harvest" lists of items that will see their tariffs gradually reduced to zero
within two years from next year under the planned trade pact.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, the effects of the ECFA will last within a certain timeframe. Taiwan
still needs to continue to upgrade its industrial competitiveness afterwards,"
according to Hong.</P>
      <P>Hung Tsai-lung, an assistant professor at National Tsing Hua University,
recently told the Chinese-language Liberty Times that South Korea's strong
performance in many export markets in recent years is mainly the result of South
Korea's efforts to upgrade its industries and is not necessarily related to its
signing of free trade agreements (FTAs).</P>
      <P>He pointed out, for example, that there is no FTA between Taiwan and South
Korea, yet the market share of South Korean products in Taiwan is on the
increase.</P>
      <P>The government hopes to use the ECFA to cope with the impact of the future trade
collaboration among Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries,
China, South Korea and Japan.</P>
      <P>The opposition parties and critics, however, are concerned that the ECFA will
result in an influx of cheap laborers and goods from China into Taiwan and will
endanger the country's sovereignty.</P>

      <P>Shares of the notebook computer firm Asustek Computer Inc. closed sharply higher
Thursday on the first day of its trade resumption, as investors were upbeat
about its earnings outlook  after the spinoff of its manufacturing  arm Pegatron
Technology Corp., dealers said.</P>
      <P>Asustek rose 6.89 percent to NT$240.50, with 3.09 million shares changing, while
Pegatron gained 8.19 percent to reach NT$38.95 in its debut on the main board.</P>
      <P>The weighted index closed up 0.10 percent at 7,589.89.</P>
      <P>"Investors are in favor of the spinoff idea, as the gross margin for contract
notebook computer production is on the decline amid fierce competition, " Taiwan
International Securities analyst Michael Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"With the spinoff, Asustek will now be able to put more into promoting its brand
worldwide, as Acer is doing," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Trade of Asustek shares was suspended in mid-May after it announced that it will
list Pegatron on the local bourse following the spinoff.</P>
      <P>An analyst with a regional brokerage firm said the gains posted by Pegatron
reflected a low listing price of NT$36.</P>
      <P>"There are concerns about the falling gross margin. Investors want to see
Pegatron come up with business diversification strategies to offset its
disadvantages," the analyst said.</P>
      <P>He forecast that Pegatron's gross margin will be about 5 percent, adding that he
was cautious about Pegatron's earnings outlook.</P>
      <P>Pegatron President Cheng Chien-chung said that with the fading impact of the
debt problems in Europe, his company has seen an increase in orders based on
recovering demand in Europe.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he expects Pegatron's sales in the second half to grow about 20
percent from the first half.</P>
      <P>Calvin Huang, an analyst with Daiwa-Cathay Capital Markets, said he has set a
target price of NT$300 for Asustek and expects the stock to outperform the
broader market.</P>
      <P>The spinoff leaves Asustek without the financial burden of rising labor costs in
China, and its operations are unlikely to be affected by a stronger Chinese yen,
Huang said.</P>
      <P>Asustek has built itself as a strong PC brand in China and is likely to use its
strength to expand there, he said.</P>
      <P>He forecast that China will absorb more than 25 percent of Asustek's sales by
the end of 2010, compared with the current 20 percent.</P>

      <P>Twenty percent of the 539 Taiwanese goods to be included in the "early harvest"
tariff waiver program under the upcoming trade pact with China will be granted
immediate tariff-free treatment, officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Under the program, China will remove its tariffs for all the Taiwanese "early
harvest" products in three phases over two years, according to officials at a
meeting in Taipei to prepare for the signing of the economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Twenty percent, or 108 kinds of goods, will see their tariffs removed
immediately after the agreement takes effect, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The main purpose  of the preparatory  meeting,  headed by Taipei-based Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian and his Chinese
counterpart,  Zheng Lizhong of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS) , was to finalize the text of the ECFA and its "early harvest"
items, as well as the text of another agreement on protecting intellectual
property rights (IPR).</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen Yunlin will hold their
fifth biannual meeting in Chongqing, China on June 29 to sign the two
agreements, officials said.</P>
      <P>The ECFA will prevent Taiwan from being marginalized amid the global trend
toward free trade, Kao said, adding that the tariff reduction for Taiwan
businesses will help boost the country's exports, employment and economic
growth.</P>
      <P>Zheng, meanwhile, said the outcome of the ECFA negotiations demonstrates that
China has honored its promise of making concessions to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For example, Zheng said, China has agreed not to expand its agricultural exports
and not to export labor to Taiwan. Instead, China has agreed to remove tariffs
for some Taiwanese agricultural products,  reduce the tariff for some of
Taiwan's competitive products, facilitate the access of weak Taiwanese
businesses to the Chinese market, and open China's market to some of Taiwan's
services, he said.</P>
      <P>According to an itinerary released by the SEF, Kao will arrive in Chongqing June
28 to make final preparations for the Chiang-Chen talks.</P>
      <P>During the talks, Chiang and Chen will also set the agenda for their next
meeting six months later, Kao said.</P>
      <P>Before returning to Taiwan June 30, Chiang and his delegation will meet with Bo
Xilai, secretary of the Chinese Communist Party's Chongqing Committee, who is
believed to be one of the emerging leaders of China's fifth generation of
leadership.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday that by offering international medical
services, Taiwan could improve its global image on one hand and upgrade the
country's overall medical industry on the other.</P>
      <P>He made the remark following the Executive Yuan's approval that day of a plan to
establish an "international medical district" in the planned "Taoyuan
Aerotropolis" in northern Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>The district is expected to generate investment worth NT$4.1 billion (US$128
million) and to provide medical services for 45,000 person-visits in the first
four years after the plan is launched, according to the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>It is also expected to generate business worth NT$10.99 billion and to create
3,860 new jobs in the first four years, Executive Yuan officials said.</P>
      <P>Wu instructed the Department of Health to plan various support programs to cope
with the development of the international medical district.</P>
      <P>Plans for the district include the construction of several clinics geared toward
providing high quality services, treatment and care for what is hoped to be
increasing numbers of foreigners coming to Taiwan on medical tourism visits. It
will also offer fast-track physical checkups and treatment, including various
types of minor cosmetic surgery for passengers transiting through the airport.</P>
      <P>The high-profile "Taoyuan Aerotropolis" plan is one of the government's major
development plans in recent years, with a price tag of NT$10.7 billion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's first international medical district is planned to be developed in
Taoyuan to take advantage of the main international gateway -- the Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport -- the convenient transport network, a well-
founded network for medical care, and booming business and industry with more
than 10,000 factories, including some 40 in the biotech sector.</P>
      <P>The premier also said similar international medical districts can be established
near the international airports in central and southern Taiwan when conditions
allow.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's reduction of corporate income tax and the signing of a trade pact with
China will significantly enhance the incentive for foreign businesses to invest
in Taiwan, a scholar said Thursday.</P>
      <P>National Chengchi University professor Yin Nai-ping said Taiwan has reduced its
corporate income tax from 20 percent to 17 percent, thereby cutting the costs of
foreign businesses investing in the country.</P>
      <P>Yin also noted that wages in China have recently been increased, but said they
are still low compared with those in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Even so, after the signing of the economic cooperation framework agreement,
many of Taiwan's exports to China will enjoy tariff waivers and Taiwan's
competitiveness will be enhanced, which will be a big incentive for foreign
businesses," he said.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's wages are higher, foreign businesses will take into
consideration Taiwan's lower corporate income tax and other issues, and will set
up plants in Taiwan, he predicted.</P>
      <P>"High-tech, automobile and computer industries could very well inspect the
investment environment in Taiwan," he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also has done better in protecting intellectual property rights, he

      <P>A total of 539 categories of Taiwanese goods and services are on the "early
harvest" list subject to preferential tariff or market access treatment under
the cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , Premier Wu
Den-yih said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwanese goods and services more than doubles China's 267, Wu

      <P>In terms of export value, the Taiwan goods and services amount to US$13.83

      <P>Wu said that the government has done its best in safeguarding the interests of
less-privileged sectors by insisting on a ban against importing Chinese
laborers, no increase in the number of Chinese farm exports to Taiwan, and no
lower tariffs for Chinese agricultural and industrial goods already allowed into
Taiwan, including garments, towels, shoes and bedding.</P>
      <P>Chinese products on the list are mostly raw materials needed by Taiwan,
downstream  industrial  products that Taiwan does not mass-produce, or those for
which Taiwan enjoys a competitive edge, such as petrochemicals, machinery and
transportation gears, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu stressed that not only the number of Taiwanese goods and services surpasses
that of China's, but that the treatments that Beijing promises Taiwan is better

      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest contract chipmaker,
said Thursday the expected signing of a proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China will not have any impact on the local integrated
circuit (IC) industry.</P>
      <P>Earlier that day, Taiwan and China had exchanged their respective "early
harvest" lists for items that will subject to immediate preferential tariff
status and easier market access upon the ECFA signing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  list includes  539 items  in the categories  of petrochemicals,
textiles, auto parts, machinery tools, agricultural products and financial
services, but no IC products.</P>
      <P>TSMC Chairman Morris Chang said that as Taiwan's IC business has become very
internationalized and its operations have gone global, the ECFA is not expected
to have any effect on the industry.</P>
      <P>The company operates one 8-inch wafer plant in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said, TSMC's 2010 capital expenditure is likely to top the
US$4.8 billion target it set in January in order to boost its capacity to meet
rising global demand.</P>
      <P>Last year, the company's capital expenditure totaled US$2.7 billion.</P>
      <P>Chang said the global IC business is rebounding very fast from a downturn caused
by the global financial crisis that began in late 2008.</P>
      <P>He said he prefers to have a production capacity 10-15 percent higher than
market demand so that the company can handle any abrupt increase in demand as
the market continues to boom.</P>
      <P>Earlier, Chang said the global semiconductor should see sales growth rise by 30
percent in 2010, outpacing his previous estimate of 22 percent made in April.</P>
      <P>He also raised his forecast for average annual sales growth for the world's IC
sector over the next five years to 7 percent from an earlier estimate of 5
percent.</P>

      <P>The tariff rates for the 539 items and services included on Taiwan's "early
harvest" list will be lowered to zero in three stages within two years following
the signing of the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China, economics officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese and Chinese delegates at a meeting in Taipei earlier in the day

Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) President Chen Yunlin -- when they meet in the
western Chinese city of Chongqing June 29.</P>
      <P>Of the Taiwanese items on its list, 108 will enjoy non-tariff treatment as soon
as the ECFA is signed and takes effect, with the remaining given zero-tariff
treatment within the following two years, said the officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese list consists of 18 agricultural items,  88 petrochemical items,
107 machinery items, 136 textile items, 50 transport equipment items and 140
items in various other categories.</P>
      <P>The annual export value of these products totals US$13.83 billion, accounting

      <P>The Chinese list of goods comprises 42 petrochemical items, 69 machinery
products, 22 textile items, 17 transport equipment items and 117 items in other
categories.</P>

      <P>The Changhua county government has received 5,600 doses of vaccines against the
goat pox virus (GPV) and will soon begin to immunize goats raised on farms
throughout the county, the national Animal Disease Control Center said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Priority will be given to goats located within one kilometer of farms where GPV
outbreaks have been reported recently, said Kuo Chou-che, director of the
center.</P>
      <P>More than 3,000 goats on 28 farms in the central Taiwan county were slaughtered
after the first cases of pox were confirmed, but this has not stopped the spread
of the virus, according to Tung Meng-chih, secretary-general of the center.</P>
      <P>After a recent meeting convened by Council of Agriculture, the center and
experts in the field agreed that all goats in Taiwan should be vaccinated
against the virus, Tung said.</P>
      <P>The vaccination program is expected to be completed by mid-July and hopefully
the outbreak will be brought under control by the end of the month, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Activists urge public to invest in fund to save humpback dolphins</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese environmental activists urged the public Thursday to buy more shares
in a trust fund that has been set up to help save the endangered humpback
dolphins on the western coast of Taiwan from extinction.</P>
      <P>The goal is to raise enough money to buy a 4,000-hectare coastal property from
the government and thus prevent Kuokuang Petrochemical Company from procuring it
to a build naphtha cracking plant, the activists said.</P>
      <P>The construction of a petrochemical plant on the land, which is located at the
mouth of the Jhoshuei River in the central county of Changhua, will wipe out the
dolphin population in the coastal waters and destroy the entire ecosystem in the
area, the activists argued.</P>
      <P>The shares are being sold at NT$119 (US$3.70) each, the activists said, noting
that the government's proposed price for the sale of the land to the
petrochemical company is NT$100 per square meter.</P>
      <P>Since the group started its nationwide campaign in April, it has sold more than
760,000 shares to 18,000 people.</P>
      <P>Changhua Environmental Protection Union Executive Director Tsai Chia-yang said
the group's procurement plan will be reviewed by the government on June 30 and
he hopes by then, at least 30,000 people would have purchased shares in the
trust fund.</P>
      <P>"This is a democratic country, therefore, the government must respect the will
of the people, " said Tsai. "If the government rejects our proposal, then it
will have to explain why it is denying the will of its citizens."</P>
      <P>The group plans to purchase the property in three phases, starting with 200
hectares of wetlands.</P>
      <P>But Kuokuang Petrochemical Technology Company claims the plant, scheduled for
completion in 2025, will generate an annual profit of NT$50 billion (US$1.6
billion) , create 20,000 to 30,000 jobs and boost the national GDP by 4 percent.</P>
      <P>The latest estimates by scientists put the population of the Indo-Pacific
humpback dolphin at below 70, said Robin Winkler, founder of the Wild at Heart,
blaming poorly managed fishing system, industrial discharge, noise pollution,
contaminated water supplies, and land reclamation projects as the biggest
threats to the mammal's livelihood.</P>
      <P>In 2008 when the population of the dolphin species was less then 100, the
International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) listed it "critically
endangered."</P>
      <P>The chair of the IUCN's Cetacean Red List Authority William Perrin was quoted as
saying that the dolphin population is already dangerously small, faces multiple
serious threats, and "will likely be driven to extinction if effective
conservation measures are not taken quickly."</P>
      <P>The dolphins, he explained, live about three to five kilometers from the shore
and breathe the air 10 to 20 centimeters above the water, which is "often the
most polluted area."</P>
      <P>The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, locally known as "Matsu's fish," prefers to
live in transition areas close to shore, particular estuarine waters. The
dolphins inhabit the coast of Taiwan from Miaoli to Tainan County.</P>
      <P>The Environmental  Protection Agency's Environmental  Impact Assessment
Committee  has  proposed  the  construction  of an eco-corridor, 5m to 10m deep
and 800m wide, between the proposed petrochemical plant and the harbor to
accommodate the dolphins</P>
      <P>But Kuokuang chairman Chen Bao-lang, rejected the idea, saying it would cost
NT$24.5 million (US$765 million) and shareholders may not be willingness to
shell out money to save the dolphins.</P>
      <P>A National Taiwan University professor Chou Lian-hsiang, who is affiliated with
Kuokuang, has suggested employing a food-induced behavioral modification method
to train the dolphins to swim only in an area designated by the company, an idea
that has been scoffed at by the activists.</P>
      <P>"President Ma Ying-jeou has said one of his major platforms is environmental
protection and conversation," Tsai noted." This project of saving the dolphins
fits perfectly with his agenda and we will see if the government really means
what it says or if will side with the corporate world."</P>
      <P>While the activists are maintaining their efforts to rally public support for
the trust fund, Tsai said, he thinks that the government will reject the group's
proposal to buy the land.</P>
      <P>In such a senario, Tsai said, he would be prepared to sue the administration for
malfeasance.</P>
      <P>"The wetlands in central Taiwan are extremely vital to the country's long term
well-being, " he said. "Destroying the area will be a crime for which there can
be no adequate punishment."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday Taiwan has grown from an aid recipient to
an aid donor that has been providing farming expertise, vocational training,
technological and health care assistance to other countries.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the sixth East Asia NGO Forum, Ma noted that Taiwan's
Ministry of Foreign Affairs last year published its first white paper on the
country's international aid operations.</P>
      <P>The white paper stated that Taiwan has upheld three principles in extending aid
to other countries -- the purpose must be legitimate, the process must be legal
and the implementation must be effective, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the president said that since he assumed office more than two years
ago, he has spared no efforts to improve relations with China and convince
Beijing to end the diplomatic tug-of-war in which the two sides were trying to
woo each other's diplomatic allies with exorbitant aid offers.</P>
      <P>"Thanks to our modus vivendi approach, we have successfully stemmed the
'checkbook diplomacy' criticism leveled at us by foreign observers," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's international aid projects, Ma said he was impressed by a
project launched by Taipei's Wanfeng Hospital to help the South Pacific ally of
the Marshall Islands deal with rampant cataract disease among its people.</P>
      <P>Equally  impressive  was  a program  launched  by Taiwan's agricultural mission
in Nauru to help the Pacific island nation achieve food self-sufficiency in
three years by producing six agricultural and husbandry products and achieving
zero food imports.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Ma said, the Taiwan government has been helping its allies in
the South Pacific, Central and South America, and Africa develop solar-powered
LED lighting systems.</P>
      <P>For instance, a project to "electrify Africa - one LED system at a time" has
been launched in the West African ally of Burkina Faso, he noted. Displaying a
yellow solar-powered LED lamp, Ma said, the US$10 device can allow many children
in that country to read and to study.</P>
      <P>Whenever there are major natural disasters, Taiwanese charities and non-
governmental organizations, such as the Red Cross Society and the Taiwan Root
Medical Peace Corps, usually to mobilize volunteers for rescue and relief work,
the president said.</P>
      <P>"I am often deeply moved by their altruistic  spirit and dedication," he said.</P>
      <P>The 2010 East Asia NGO Forum is being sponsored by Taiwan Overseas Aid (TOAID) ,
which is a grouping of major Taiwanese NGOs dedicated to helping foreign
countries in need of humanitarian aid in various fields.</P>
      <P>Scholars and NGO representatives from 14 countries are attending the two-day
seminar being held at the Taipei county government's conference hall.  The
agenda focuses on building a collective mechanism for humanitarian aid and
development cooperation.</P>

      <P>A Chinese company applied to the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) Thursday for the
offering and listing of Taiwan Depository Receipts (TDRs) of up to 240 million
units.</P>
      <P>If  approved,  Yangzijiang  Shipbuilding,  China's  leading shipbuilder, and
which is listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) Main Board, will become the
first Chinese private company to be listed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yangzijiang Shipbuilding was listed on the SGX in April 2007 and its market
value and profits have been top of the dragon stocks -- which refers to stocks
of Chinese companies listed on Singapore's stock exchange.</P>
      <P>The company has appointed Taiwan's SinoPac Securities Corp. as its underwriter.</P>
      <P>Market sources said it is worth watching if Yangzijiang's issuance of TDRs will
trigger a rush of Chinese companies seeking TDR offering and listing on the
Taiwan stock exchange.</P>
      <P>TWSE has optimistically estimated that the red-chip stocks will come to Taiwan
in the latter half of the year to issue TDRs, and that its goal of "issuance of
20 TDRs for the whole year will be achieved."  Red-chip  stocks  are those  of
Chinese  companies incorporated outside China and listed on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange.</P>
      <P>Yangzijiang recorded a net after-tax profit of 2.29 billion yuan (US$33.65
million) , and its revenues in the first quarter totaled 2.676 billion yuan, up
28 percent year-on-year. The net after-tax profit in the first quarter was 586
million yuan, an increase of 20 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings)  Limited is the largest non-state-owned
publicly  listed  shipbuilder  by  virtue  of manufacturing capability in China.
The core business is shipbuilding of commercial vessels ranging from container
ships and bulk cargo carriers to multi-purpose cargo vessels.</P>
      <P>The group owns two shipbuilding bases in the cities of Jiangyin and Jingjiang,

      <P>Taiwanese teenagers have again shone in an international robot competition, with
three teams taking the top awards Thursday in various categories of the 2010
RoboCup.</P>
      <P>Kuo Chung-chou, the coach who led one of the Taiwanese teams participating in

the 15-18 age group and the open group in the event being held June 19-25 in
Singapore.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo, the elementary and junior and senior high school students are
from the Taipei and Nantou areas.</P>
      <P>Their excellent performance in RoboCup indicates that Taiwan's youth plays a
leading role in this field, according to Kuo.</P>
      <P>"The competition has helped inspire Taiwan youth to pursue scientific research
and Taiwan has performed well in previous events, " he said, pointing out that
Taiwanese teams also seized top awards in RoboCup 2005 and RoboCup 2006.</P>
      <P>Vanessa Shih, Taiwan's envoy to Singapore, immediately sent her congratulations

      <P>RoboCup is an international robotics competition founded in 1997. The aim is to
develop autonomous soccer robots with the intention of promoting  research and
education  in the field of artificial intelligence. The name RoboCup is a
contraction of the competition's full name, the Robot Soccer World Cup.</P>

      <P>As some of the tariffs on goods moving between Taiwan and China are set to be
removed in the coming years under a planned trade pact, Minister of Economic
Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Thursday that foreign companies are increasingly
interested in investing in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Foreign companies'  interest (in investing in Taiwan)  is increasing, " Shih
said at a press briefing, adding that "of course, it is our hope that tariff
reductions between Taiwan and China will give some of Taiwan's important
industries greater appeal" to foreign investors.</P>
      <P>The government will explain to foreign companies how the tariff structure
between Taiwan and China will change, in a bid to attract them to Taiwan, the
minister noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government recently cut its corporate income tax to as low as
17 percent, putting it on a par with that of Singapore, in order to build a more
business-friendly environment.</P>
      <P>Shih's remarks came hours after Taiwanese officials met their Chinese
counterparts in Taipei to finalize their respective "early harvest" lists for
the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) that is expected to be inked
between the two sides next week.</P>
      <P>The lists consist of hundreds of items in the petrochemical, textile, machinery,
automobile and other industries that will see their tariffs gradually reduced to
zero within two years upon the signing of the pact.</P>
      <P>The lists also include a number of conference, financial and other services that
will soon open to each other.</P>
      <P>But Shih declined to explain why air cargo services -- which had been expected
to be included -- are not covered.</P>
      <P>The government has promised not to open Taiwan to Chinese workers or farm

    <TEXT>
      <P>A leading Taiwanese negotiator for a proposed cross-Taiwan Strait trade pact
said Thursday that if one party wants to terminate the agreement because of
specific problems, the two sides should engage in prior consultations.</P>
      <P>"Both sides should follow the principle of consultation first, and the party
that wants to terminate it must accept this point, " said Huang Chih-peng,
director general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade.</P>
      <P>But he also said that after the signing of the cross-strait economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA), mutual trust will be consolidated.</P>
      <P>He said that after the inking, China is not expected to cite the termination
article in response to political developments such as Taiwan tilting toward
independence or deviating from the "1992 consensus, " which refers to the mutual
recognition that there is only one China, with each side free to interpret the
meaning of one China as they see fit.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks in a news conference convened by the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) to announce the "early harvest" lists of items and services
that will be granted preferential tariff treatment upon the signing of the ECFA.
The lists form the backbone of the ECFA, which is similar to a free trade
agreement (FTA).</P>
      <P>Huang said that any economic bodies signing FTAs will include implementation and
termination articles, adding that when Taiwan and China drew up the termination
article of the ECFA, the principle of "prior consultation" was set.</P>
      <P>Huang said the article states clearly that either party that thinks the
execution of the ECFA has problems must first seek consultations with the other
side.</P>
      <P>If the problem is really serious, then other preventive measures will be
explored, such as the imposition of a dumping tax, an equalization tax and even
the suspension of tariff waivers and a return to the tax level prior to that of
the ECFA signing.</P>
      <P>Huang said the two sides have negotiated the ECFA in good faith, because each
side thinks that if they can cooperate more closely in economic terms, it will
be mutually beneficial.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that with both sides expecting better trade results after the
signing of the ECFA, the termination article is designed to be kept in reserve
and will hopefully never have to be used.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has been seeking more meaningful participation in international
organizations, targeting observer status in the annual assembly of the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in September, a Ministry of
Foreign Affairs official (MOFA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooeration forum (APEC) also serves as a good
platform to engage in regional and trans-Pacific affairs and launch initiatives
for Taiwan, so we should take advantage of it, " said Lily Hsu, deputy director-
general of the MOFA's Department of International Organization, in a press
briefing.</P>
      <P>The flexible diplomacy and the diplomatic truce President Ma Ying-jeou advocates
have helped Taiwan gain international space, evidenced by its landmark
participation as an observer in the World Health Assembly (WHA) in 2009 and
2010, she said, adding that the eased tension across the Taiwan Strait has also
reduced other countries' concerns about the cross-strait situation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is an official member of 21 international organizations and an observer
in 30 others, a far cry from the situation in the early 1970s, when Taiwan was
able to participate in fewer than 10 international organizations after it was
expelled from the United Nations in 1971, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>While the eased tension does not mean Taiwan can participate in any organization
in which it wants to, the rapprochement atmosphere has resulted in more
comfortable interaction between Taiwan and China under APEC -- a forum of 21
Pacific Rim member economies that collaborate on regional trade liberalization
-- she said.</P>
      <P>Since the WHA breakthrough, Hsu said, the government has targeted participation
in the ICAO and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) as its next goals and has received positive responses.</P>
      <P>The European  Parliament,  the U.S.  Senate  and House of Representatives, as
well as 17 U.S. State Congresses, have all passed resolutions  in the past few
months  in support  of Taiwan's participation in the ICAO assembly that will
take place in Montreal, Canada, while Taiwan's diplomatic allies Nicaragua, St.
Vincent and the Grenadines, and Panama have all publicly voiced their support,
Hsu said.</P>
      <P>She declined to elaborate in detail about Taiwan's efforts to secure the ICAO
observer status.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been also working on the mission in the APEC Economic Leadership
Meeting that will take place in Japan's Yokohama in November, Hsu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Chinese negotiator with Taiwan said Thursday  that Beijing will resolve
appropriately  issues regarding Taiwan's desire to sign free trade agreements
(FTAs) with its major trade partners.</P>
      <P>Zheng  Lizhong,  vice president  of China's  quasi-official Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), made the remarks at a news
conference held after the end of preparatory talks with Taiwanese negotiators
for a fifth meeting between ARATS President Chen Yunlin and his Taiwanese
counterpart, Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung.</P>
      <P>The main agenda of the June 28-30 meeting in Chongqing, China is the signing of
an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , which mainly deals with
tariff concessions for bilateral trade.</P>
      <P>In promoting the ECFA initiative, Taiwan hopes the deal with China will help
convince its other major trade partners, such as the United States, Japan, the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the European Union, to sign full-
fledged FTAs or FTA-like agreements with it to facilitate its inclusion in
mounting regional economic integration, particularly in the wake of the
inauguration of the "ASEAN plus China" free trade bloc early this year.</P>
      <P>Asked about China's attitude or position on the issue, Zheng appeared reluctant
to go into detail and merely repeated previous statements made by other Chinese
officials, saying that as far China is concerned, the ECFA initiative is aimed
at forging a closer cross-strait economic cooperative mechanism and exploring a
feasible channel to connect the cross-strait interactive mechanism with existing
Asia-Pacific regional trade blocs.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Zheng said, China will properly address the issue to help
create an environment in which Taiwan can tackle opportunities  and challenges
arising from growing cross-strait economic integration.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu was asked a
similar question at a regular press news conference. At the time, Ma said China

    <HEADLINE>President to address Taiwan's post-ECFA global economic strategy</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will deliver "in due time" Taiwan's global economic
strategy in the post cross-Taiwan Strait trade pact era, the Presidential Office
spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-chiang said the president was glad to see both sides complete their
talks on the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) by late June as
scheduled and to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.</P>
      <P>But he also thinks the text of the ECFA, the "early harvest" lists and an
agreement on intellectual property rights protection are only the "appetizer" of
the pact and not the "main course."</P>
      <P>In addition, the ECFA will only be part of Taiwan's global economic strategy
involving cross-strait economy, Lo cited Ma as saying.</P>
      <P>The completion of the "early harvest" lists, which form the backbone of the ECFA
and which were unveiled that day, only shows that both sides have entered the
post-ECFA era, so the president wants to present the nation's global economic
strategy to the public in the post-ECFA era, Lo said.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with Oliver Williamson, the Nobel laureate in economics in 2009, at
the Presidential Office earlier that day, Ma said the signing of the ECFA is
only a first step.</P>
      <P>The ECFA, that will allow tariffs on certain Taiwanese exports to China to be
reduced to zero within two years after it takes effect, will make more Taiwanese
businessmen willing to return to Taiwan and will make more foreign investors
willing to invest in Taiwan, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also seek to forge free trade agreements with its major trading
parrners, President Ma said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that day, Vice President Vincent Siew said the ECFA will be similar to
a pact China signed with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ,
but will not be like the closer economic partnership arrangement signed between
Hong Kong and China.</P>
      <P>"This is because Taiwan has insisted on the principle of parity," Siew said,
adding that "Taiwan's economy will be transformed after the inking of the ECFA."</P>
      <P>Siew said the items on the "early harvest" lists are not the result of China
making concessions,  but the result of China considering the principle of
"division of labor."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's list contains 539 items -- double the number of China's items -- with
total exports worth around US$13.83 billion, nearly 4.8 times that of China's.</P>
      <P>The ECFA is expected to be signed during the fifth round of cross-strait talks
between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and
China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits President Chen
Yunlin that will be held in Chongqing June 29.</P>

      <P>A Chinese company applied to the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) Thursday for the
offering and listing of Taiwan Depository Receipts (TDRs) of up to 240 million
units.</P>
      <P>If  approved,  Yangzijiang  Shipbuilding,  China's  leading shipbuilder, and
which is listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) Main Board, will become the
first Chinese private company to be listed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yangzijiang Shipbuilding was listed on the SGX in April 2007 and its market
value and profits have been top of the dragon stocks -- which refers to stocks
of Chinese companies listed on Singapore's stock exchange.</P>
      <P>The company has appointed Taiwan's SinoPac Securities Corp. as its underwriter.</P>
      <P>Market sources said it is worth watching if Yangzijiang's issuance of TDRs will
trigger a rush of Chinese companies seeking TDR offering and listing on the
Taiwan stock exchange.</P>
      <P>TWSE has optimistically estimated that the red-chip stocks will come to Taiwan
in the latter half of the year to issue TDRs, and that its goal of "issuance of
20 TDRs for the whole year will be achieved."  Red-chip  stocks  are those  of
Chinese  companies incorporated outside China and listed on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange.</P>
      <P>Yangzijiang recorded a net after-tax profit of 2.29 billion yuan (US$33.65
million) , and its revenues in the first quarter totaled 2.676 billion yuan, up
28 percent year-on-year. The net after-tax profit in the first quarter was 586
million yuan, an increase of 20 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings)  Limited is the largest non-state-owned
publicly  listed  shipbuilder  by  virtue  of manufacturing capability in China.
The core business is shipbuilding of commercial vessels ranging from container
ships and bulk cargo carriers to multi-purpose cargo vessels.</P>
      <P>The group owns two shipbuilding bases in the cities of Jiangyin and Jingjiang,
which face each other across the Yangtze River.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese teenagers have again shone in an international robot competition, with
three teams taking the top awards Thursday in various categories of the 2010
RoboCup.</P>
      <P>Kuo Chung-chou, the coach who led one of the Taiwanese teams participating in
the event, told CNA that the three teams took first place in the 7-14 age group,
the 15-18 age group and the open group in the event being held June 19-25 in
Singapore.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo, the elementary and junior and senior high school students are
from the Taipei and Nantou areas.</P>
      <P>Their excellent performance in RoboCup indicates that Taiwan's youth plays a
leading role in this field, according to Kuo.</P>
      <P>"The competition has helped inspire Taiwan youth to pursue scientific research
and Taiwan has performed well in previous events, " he said, pointing out that
Taiwanese teams also seized top awards in RoboCup 2005 and RoboCup 2006.</P>
      <P>Vanessa Shih, Taiwan's envoy to Singapore, immediately sent her congratulations
to the teams after hearing about their success.</P>
      <P>RoboCup is an international robotics competition founded in 1997. The aim is to
develop autonomous soccer robots with the intention of promoting  research and
education  in the field of artificial intelligence. The name RoboCup is a
contraction of the competition's full name, the Robot Soccer World Cup.</P>
      <P>Although RoboCup chooses to use soccer as a central topic of research, the
innovations developed can be equally applied to socially significant problems
and to industry.</P>

      <P>The Government Information Office (GIO) has earmarked NT$2.1 billion (US$65.3
million) as funding for a five-year project to promote Taiwan's pop music
industry, a GIO official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a report to Premier Wu Den-yih on the project, the GIO said that between 2010
and 2014, it will help nurture three individual singers or groups and help 15
local singers or groups to take part in international events, as well as
granting astimulus fund to three record companies on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>The project is expected to help boost the production value of the industry to
over NT$50 billion and to double the number of people in the industry to 2,800.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that pop music is one of Taiwan's most important creative cultural
industries and represents the country's soft power, and he instructed relevant
government agencies to ensure that it develops and prospers.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research,
the total production value of the local music industry was around NT$7.06

      <P>As some of the tariffs on goods moving between Taiwan and China are set to be
removed in the coming years under a planned trade pact, Minister of Economic
Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Thursday that foreign companies are increasingly
interested in investing in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Foreign companies'  interest (in investing in Taiwan)  is increasing, " Shih
said at a press briefing, adding that "of course, it is our hope that tariff
reductions between Taiwan and China will give some of Taiwan's important
industries greater appeal" to foreign investors.</P>
      <P>The government will explain to foreign companies how the tariff structure
between Taiwan and China will change, in a bid to attract them to Taiwan, the
minister noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government recently cut its corporate income tax to as low as
17 percent, putting it on a par with that of Singapore, in order to build a more
business-friendly environment.</P>
      <P>Shih's remarks came hours after Taiwanese officials met their Chinese
counterparts in Taipei to finalize their respective "early harvest" lists for
the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) that is expected to be inked
between the two sides next week.</P>
      <P>The lists consist of hundreds of items in the petrochemical, textile, machinery,
automobile and other industries that will see their tariffs gradually reduced to
zero within two years upon the signing of the pact.</P>
      <P>The lists also include a number of conference, financial and other services that
will soon open to each other.</P>
      <P>But Shih declined to explain why air cargo services -- which had been expected
to be included -- are not covered.</P>
      <P>The government has promised not to open Taiwan to Chinese workers or farm
produce under the ECFA.</P>
      <P>Opposition parties and critics of the ECFA,  however, are concerned that the
pact will result in an influx of cheap laborers and goods from China into Taiwan
and will endanger the country's sovereignty.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China must consult Taiwan if it wants to terminate trade pact</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A leading Taiwanese negotiator for a proposed cross-Taiwan Strait trade pact
said Thursday that if one party wants to terminate the agreement because of
specific problems, the two sides should engage in prior consultations.</P>
      <P>"Both sides should follow the principle of consultation first, and the party
that wants to terminate it must accept this point, " said Huang Chih-peng,
director general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade.</P>
      <P>But he also said that after the signing of the cross-strait economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA), mutual trust will be consolidated.</P>
      <P>He said that after the inking, China is not expected to cite the termination
article in response to political developments such as Taiwan tilting toward
independence or deviating from the "1992 consensus, " which refers to the mutual
recognition that there is only one China, with each side free to interpret the
meaning of one China as they see fit.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks in a news conference convened by the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) to announce the "early harvest" lists of items and services
that will be granted preferential tariff treatment upon the signing of the ECFA.
The lists form the backbone of the ECFA, which is similar to a free trade
agreement (FTA).</P>
      <P>Huang said that any economic bodies signing FTAs will include implementation and
termination articles, adding that when Taiwan and China drew up the termination
article of the ECFA, the principle of "prior consultation" was set.</P>
      <P>Huang said the article states clearly that either party that thinks the
execution of the ECFA has problems must first seek consultations with the other
side.</P>
      <P>If the problem is really serious, then other preventive measures will be
explored, such as the imposition of a dumping tax, an equalization tax and even
the suspension of tariff waivers and a return to the tax level prior to that of
the ECFA signing.</P>
      <P>Huang said the two sides have negotiated the ECFA in good faith, because each
side thinks that if they can cooperate more closely in economic terms, it will
be mutually beneficial.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that with both sides expecting better trade results after the
signing of the ECFA, the termination article is designed to be kept in reserve
and will hopefully never have to be used.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has been seeking more meaningful participation in international
organizations, targeting observer status in the annual assembly of the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in September, a Ministry of
Foreign Affairs official (MOFA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooeration forum (APEC) also serves as a good
platform to engage in regional and trans-Pacific affairs and launch initiatives
for Taiwan, so we should take advantage of it, " said Lily Hsu, deputy director-
general of the MOFA's Department of International Organization, in a press
briefing.</P>
      <P>The flexible diplomacy and the diplomatic truce President Ma Ying-jeou advocates
have helped Taiwan gain international space, evidenced by its landmark
participation as an observer in the World Health Assembly (WHA) in 2009 and
2010, she said, adding that the eased tension across the Taiwan Strait has also
reduced other countries' concerns about the cross-strait situation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is an official member of 21 international organizations and an observer
in 30 others, a far cry from the situation in the early 1970s, when Taiwan was
able to participate in fewer than 10 international organizations after it was
expelled from the United Nations in 1971, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>While the eased tension does not mean Taiwan can participate in any organization
in which it wants to, the rapprochement atmosphere has resulted in more
comfortable interaction between Taiwan and China under APEC -- a forum of 21
Pacific Rim member economies that collaborate on regional trade liberalization
-- she said.</P>
      <P>Since the WHA breakthrough, Hsu said, the government has targeted participation
in the ICAO and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) as its next goals and has received positive responses.</P>
      <P>The European  Parliament,  the U.S.  Senate  and House of Representatives, as
well as 17 U.S. State Congresses, have all passed resolutions  in the past few
months  in support  of Taiwan's participation in the ICAO assembly that will
take place in Montreal, Canada, while Taiwan's diplomatic allies Nicaragua, St.
Vincent and the Grenadines, and Panama have all publicly voiced their support,
Hsu said.</P>
      <P>She declined to elaborate in detail about Taiwan's efforts to secure the ICAO
observer status.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been also working on the mission in the APEC Economic Leadership
Meeting that will take place in Japan's Yokohama in November, Hsu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China to resolve Taiwan's FTA bids appropriately: negotiator</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Chinese negotiator with Taiwan said Thursday  that Beijing will resolve
appropriately  issues regarding Taiwan's desire to sign free trade agreements
(FTAs) with its major trade partners.</P>
      <P>Zheng  Lizhong,  vice president  of China's  quasi-official Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), made the remarks at a news
conference held after the end of preparatory talks with Taiwanese negotiators
for a fifth meeting between ARATS President Chen Yunlin and his Taiwanese
counterpart, Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung.</P>
      <P>The main agenda of the June 28-30 meeting in Chongqing, China is the signing of
an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , which mainly deals with
tariff concessions for bilateral trade.</P>
      <P>In promoting the ECFA initiative, Taiwan hopes the deal with China will help
convince its other major trade partners, such as the United States, Japan, the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the European Union, to sign full-
fledged FTAs or FTA-like agreements with it to facilitate its inclusion in
mounting regional economic integration, particularly in the wake of the
inauguration of the "ASEAN plus China" free trade bloc early this year.</P>
      <P>Asked about China's attitude or position on the issue, Zheng appeared reluctant
to go into detail and merely repeated previous statements made by other Chinese
officials, saying that as far China is concerned, the ECFA initiative is aimed
at forging a closer cross-strait economic cooperative mechanism and exploring a
feasible channel to connect the cross-strait interactive mechanism with existing
Asia-Pacific regional trade blocs.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Zheng said, China will properly address the issue to help
create an environment in which Taiwan can tackle opportunities  and challenges
arising from growing cross-strait economic integration.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu was asked a
similar question at a regular press news conference. At the time, Ma said China
does not object to Taiwan developing non-official trade ties, but objects to
Taiwan signing official agreements with other countries.</P>
      <P>His remarks drew a strong backlash in Taiwan. Another Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman, Jiang Yu, later urged the media not to "overinterpret" Ma's remarks,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China are expected to sign an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA)  next week after finalizing  their respective "early harvest"
lists Thursday.</P>
      <P>The signing of the ECFA is not a panacea that will automatically reactivate
Taiwan's economic engine and create a "golden decade." The government needs to
continue to work to improve Taiwan's investment environment,  enhance  its
economic  fundamentals  and  reduce unemployment.</P>
      <P>Although the ECFA will benefit 539 Taiwanese export items, it will also open
Taiwan's market to 267 Chinese products. Finding ways to expand Taiwan's gains
and reduce its losses is an immediate problem that the government needs to face.</P>
      <P>The government should also take into account the possible political
repercussions, because any negative impact of the ECFA will be scrutinized under
a magnifying glass by its opponents. Another challenge facing the government is
whether it can conclude free trade agreements with other countries after the
ECFA takes effect.</P>
      <P>Following the signing of the ECFA, Taiwan will certainly benefit more from
closer economic and trade ties with China. The biggest challenge facing the
anti-ECFA Democratic Progressive Party is whether it can present a new and
convincing argument with regard to Taiwan's ties with China. (June 25, 2010)</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun added another record to his tennis career by defeating a
U.S.-French pair together with his Serbian partner Janko Tipsarevic to advance
to the second round of the male doubles at Wimbledon Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lu and Tipsarevic beat James Cerretani of the United States and his French
colleague Jeremy Cardy 6-4, 6-4, 7-6.</P>
      <P>After achieving a career high by reaching the third round of the male singles at
the venerable grand slam for the first time, 27-year-old Lu, touted as Taiwan's
best male singles tennis player, compounded his success in the doubles
competition.</P>
      <P>Lu told CNA that it was the first time he had been teamed with Tipsarevic at
Wimbledon, although the two played together at the Australian Open in January
but failed to get through the first round.</P>
      <P>He said he was very satisfied with their performance Thursday. "Except for the
third set, we controlled almost the whole game, " he said.</P>
      <P>"We bolstered each other on court, " Lu went on, adding that he did not feel
great stress while playing. "We both concentrated on playing and did not spent
much thought on winning or losing, " he said.</P>
      <P>Lu was scheduled to play against the unseeded but dangerous Florian Mayor of
Germany the following day in the third round of the male singles. He said the
doubles match had helped him stay in fighting form.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on the women's singles battlefield, Taiwan's Chang Kai-chen lost 4-6,
3-6 to third-seeded Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark in the second round.</P>
      <P>It was Chang's first time playing at Wimbledon and despite her defeat, the 19
-year-old said she was satisfied with her performance.</P>
      <P>"I enjoyed the feeling of playing on Centre Court. I fell, but I am astonished
at how well I performed today," she said.</P>
      <P>Playing on Centre Court was "a good chance to learn and is something I'll never

      <P>In a surprise move, Taiwan's central bank announced a 0.125 percentage point
increase in its discount rate Thursday.</P>
      <P>The decision will inevitably put pressure on financial markets, but it is a
necessary step for economic adjustment. If managed properly, it can kill many
birds with one stone.</P>
      <P>In fact, the interest rate hike is the realization of the central bank's
previous announcement in March that the quantitative easing policy was over. It
displays the consistency and credibility of the country's monetary policy.</P>
      <P>Another goal of the hike is to cool the red-hot housing market and deflate asset
bubbles. The central bank is finally resorting to this means because the various
measures adopted for this purpose since last November have produced few results.</P>
      <P>The most immediate effect of the interest rate hike is a reversal of the
negative real interest rate that has continued in Taiwan for a quarter. The hike
will also help improve the difficult business environment faced by the banking
and insurance sector as a result of low interest rates. (June 25, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Is rate hikes signaling crisis policy exit?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>The Central  Bank  of the Republic  of China  (CBC)
06/25/10  11:44:25
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>unexpectedly announced a 0.125 percentage point hike in its benchmark interest
rates Thursday, the first tightening since June 2008, with effect from Friday.</P>
      <P>The central bank said in a statement that the rate hikes were taken amid signs
that the domestic economy has surged back from the worst of the recession.</P>
      <P>Market analysts said the surprise move could signal that the central bank has
begun an exit from the stimulative policy adopted during the 2008-2009 global
financial crisis.</P>
      <P>The adjustment brought the CBC discount rate to 1.375 percent from a record low
of 1.25 percent, a figure that had been kept unchanged for more than five
consecutive quarters.</P>
      <P>Two other CBC benchmark  interest  rates  --  the secured accommodation rate and
the unsecured loan rate -- have also been raised to 1.75 percent and 3.625
percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Besides raising interest rates, the central bank also announced mortgage-lending
curbs for the greater Taipei area, out of concern about a possible real estate
bubble.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Skyrocketing housing prices in the Taipei area have become a nightmare for
residents. Starting Friday, loans extended by local banks to applicants to buy
second houses in metropolitan Taipei and 10 cities in neighboring Taipei County
will not be allowed to exceed 70 percent of the apprised house value.</P>
      <P>Under this policy, those who purchase more than one house in Taipei City or
Taipei County's Banciao, Sanchong, Jhonghe, Lujhou, Shulin, Sijhih, Sindian,
Sinjhuang, Tucheng and Yonghe will be subject to the selective credit control
and will not be allowed to enjoy any grace period for repayment or apply for
housing repair loans.</P>
      <P>It marks the first time since 1989 that the central bank has adopted selective
credit controls on mortgage lending. Last time, the curb remained valid for 18
months. The duration of this round of selective controls will depend on market
reaction, CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan said.</P>
      <P>According to Perng, a large amount of mortgage loans are concentrated in the
greater Taipei area, an indication that property investors tend to borrow money
from banks to buy houses in the region, driving up prices.</P>
      <P>As housing prices in the 10 satellite cities are still far lower than those in
Taipei City, they are very likely to become a new target for property
speculators, Perng said. Therefore, those cities have also been included on the
list and are subject to the new credit control measures. (June 25, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Perng said the central bank has repeatedly asked local banks to enhance their
risk controls since last October and even asked them in March this year to lower
mortgage lending ratios and raise interest rates for major property buyers.</P>
      <P>This moral advice, however, has fallen on deaf ears in some cases, leading to a
continued rise in local housing prices, Perng said.</P>
      <P>To nip a possible property bubble in the bud, Perng went on, the central bank
has been forced to adopt the selective credit control move.</P>
      <P>By issuing clear-cut restrictions on loans to non-first-time home buyers, Perng
said, the housing market should become less volatile. He also promised that the
central bank will keep a close watch on local banks' mortgage loans to land
developers and construction companies to prevent abnormal lending and maintain
market stability. (June 25, 2010).</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Perng stressed that the interest rate hikes and selective credit control
measures are not aimed at real estate speculators but rather at regulating risky
lending activities.</P>
      <P>The CBC's latest interest rate adjustments have drawn mixed reactions from local
economists. Christina Liu, chairwoman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development,  said the move indicates that the central bank is optimistic about
the country's economic prospects.</P>
      <P>However, Yin Nai-ping, a National Chengchi University professor, said it appears
that the adjustments have come a bit too early because Taiwan's economic
situation has not yet been fully stabilized and the global economy is still
shrouded in uncertainty, including the eurozone debt crisis and the U.S. job
market woes.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Yin said, Taiwan's current recovery is mainly bolstered by exports to
China, which will make the local economy more vulnerable to outside changes.

      <P>Evergreen Marine Corp. and Wan Hai Lines Ltd. will join forces to launch
shipping services between northern China and Southeast Asia in July, in light of
strong demand caused by booming trade in the area, a spokeswoman for Evergreen
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Evergreen Marine, Taiwan's largest shipper, and Wan Hai will take turns serving
the new 28-day round trip route that will operate out of the Chinese port of
Dalian.</P>
      <P>"After China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) launched a
free trade agreement (FTA) at the beginning of this year, trade in the bloc has
increased significantly, " the spokeswoman said.</P>
      <P>She said that with the FTA operational, ASEAN has replaced Japan as China's
third-largest trading partner, and added that the economic integration in the
area has paved the way for growing purchasing power and rising consumption.</P>
      <P>"Booming trade in the area is an irreversible trend and we are witnessing rising
demand for cargo deliveries in the bloc," she said.</P>
      <P>Wan Hai will start the first service July 3 and Evergreen Marine will start its
service July 17, she added.</P>
      <P>The new route will start from China's Dalian, with stops in China's Tianjin,
Qingdao, Hong Kong and Shekou, Indonesia's Jakarta, Port Kelang in Malaysia,
Singapore, Tanjung Pelepas in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Shanghai before returning
to Dalian, the spokeswoman said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's housing prices have continued to rise despite the various measures
adopted by the government since late last year to try to cool the red-hot real
estate market. The central bank on Thursday announced a 0.125 percentage point
increase in its key interest rates and more control measures to further its
efforts to curb property speculation.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, land-hoarding by owners is the main reason behind the
skyrocketing housing prices. The Ministry of Finance should impose an expensive
"idle land tax" to force owners to release their land for construction. This
method would resolve the shortage of land and eliminate speculation on higher
land prices.</P>
      <P>In addition, the MOF could levy an "empty home tax" to reduce housing
speculation.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior, meanwhile, should strictly require housing
developers that have obtained construction licenses to begin their construction
work within six months. Fines should be imposed on developers who fail to
complete their work by the target dates. This would prevent the developers from
deliberately  delaying their projects, which causes supply shortages and pushes
housing prices even higher. (June 25, 2010)</P>

      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Friday that President Ma Ying-jeou hopes
Taiwanese businesses will change their operational structures from contract to
own-brand manufacturing in the post-economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) era.</P>
      <P>To achieve this goal, the government and private enterprises should "be prepared
mentally and should work out implementation measures, " Siew said at a
conference in which he addressed Taiwan's moves to promote the signing of the
ECFA with China.</P>
      <P>He also reminded businessmen to be clearly aware that China is undergoing policy
changes amid changes in its domestic market, in which wages are being hiked and
calls are mounting for environmental protection measures.</P>
      <P>Siew  explained  that  economic  development  undergoes  a transformation every
20 years and that China is at present going through its transformation,
attaching importance to the development of new energy, new materials,
biotechnology and cloud computing.</P>
      <P>China appears to want to catch up with the developed countries while placing
importance on domestic demand. As a result, it is attempting to get rid of its
full dependence on exports and is hoping to narrow the economic development gap
between its inland and coastal regions and between urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>Amid the changes in China, Siew suggested, Taiwanese businesses operating there
should adjust their operational structures and perspectives.</P>
      <P>ECFA, he said, comes "at the right time" because it will push companies to
redefine the China market and initiate new business strategies.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China finalized details of a key trade pact Thursday to cut export
tariffs and allow more market access to each other, but Taiwan's opposition is
planning a massive rally Saturday to protest the deal.</P>
      <P>According to President Ma Ying-jeou, the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) -- expected to be signed in the Chinese city of Chongqing June
29 -- will prevent Taiwan's economy from being marginalized in the process of
East Asian economic integration and will help reduce Taiwan's jobless rate.</P>
      <P>The Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research has said the ECFA could create
more than 260,000 jobs in Taiwan and increase the gross domestic product by
around 1.7 percent per year.</P>
      <P>However, opposers of the deal, led by the main opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , fear that the ECFA will make Taiwan, which exports more than 40
percent of its products to China, even more dependent on the other side of the
Taiwan Strait and increase the unemployment rate when an influx of Chinese
products and services jeopardizes local industries.</P>
      <P>The DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union, a minor opposition party led by former
President Lee Teng-hui which will organize Saturday's rally, will again demand a
referendum on whether the deal should go ahead. Similar demands have already
been rejected by the government.</P>
      <P>The DPP said it was hoping to mobilize 100,000 supporters to take part in the
protest.</P>
      <P>The ECFA will be reviewed by the Legislative Yuan in an extra session in July.
While the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) has said the legislature can only decide
whether it will ratify the pact or not, opposition legislators have insisted on
an article-by-article review.</P>
      <P>Another concern is whether China will stop interfering with Taiwan's effort to
seek free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries, especially its major
trading partners such as the United States, the European Union and Japan, once
the ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>Zheng Lizhong,  vice president of China's Association  for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits, did not give a direct answer Thursday when asked about the
issue, saying only that "China will properly address the issue to help create an
environment in which Taiwan can tackle opportunities and challenges arising from
growing cross-strait economic integration."</P>
      <P>The agreement has been welcomed by various countries, including the United
States and the European Union.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Presidential Office spokesman said the government realizes that the
ECFA does not solve all the country's problems because local businesses will
have to upgrade themselves after the pact kicks in to increase their global
competitiveness. President Ma Ying-jeou will deliver "in due time" Taiwan's
global economic strategy in the post-ECFA era, the spokesman said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 1.51 percent Friday after the central bank
unexpectedly raised interest rates in a move to rein in soaring domestic
property prices, dealers said that day.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 115.18 points to 7,474.71 after moving between 7,463.29
and 7,537.37, on turnover of NT$87.82 (US$2.73 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened down 1.06 percent as market confidence was dampened by the
0.125 percentage point hike in the discount rate announced by the central bank
the previous day,  and selling accelerated during the trading session, led by
property stocks, amid fears that the tightening monetary policy will hurt their
bottom lines, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,454 stocks closed down and 643 were up, with 210 stocks remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The construction sector suffered the steepest decline, dropping 3.7 percent.
Textile shares closed down 3.1 percent, plastics and chemicals, along with paper
and pulp, each closed down 2.1 percent, the cement sector fell 1.7 percent and
machinery and electronics shares lost 1.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The foodstuff sector closed down 0.9 percent but financial stocks ended the day
up 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>"The rate hike surprised many investors and was the last thing the market wanted
to see, evidence of which can be seen in the amount of selling," Mega Securities
analyst Alex Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang said that prior to Thursday, the market had expected the central bank to
leave its benchmark  interest rate unchanged, believing that it did not want to
see any immediate rate hike to disrupt the pace of economic recovery.</P>
      <P>Apart from the higher discount rate, the central bank also announced a ceiling
on bank loans for second home buyers in Taipei and other major cities in the
greater Taipei area to prevent property speculation.</P>
      <P>"The central bank move shows that it is concerned about a possible property
bubble. Before things got really bad, it had to take action," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Among property developers, Kuo Yang Construction shed 6.75 percent to NT$19.35,
Goldsun Development lost 2.81 percent to close at NT$13.85, and Cathay Real
Estate fell 2.12 percent to end the day at NT$11.55.</P>
      <P>"And worse, most of the recent U.S. economic data suggests that the U.S. economy
will slow down in the second half of this year. Wall Street's performance has
also worried investors here," said Huang.</P>
      <P>"I do not expect any breakthrough in the local bourse in the short term. The
index might continue to fall gradually to find new technical support," he said.</P>
      <P>The financial sector outperformed the broader market, as the local financial
services business has been put on Taiwan's "early harvest" list subject to
easier market access to China under the proposed economic cooperation  framework
agreement with China, according to the dealers.</P>
      <P>Chang Hwa Bank rose 4.85 percent to close at NT$14.05, while First Financial
gained 3.18 percent to finish at NT$17.85.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chicken chain to stop giving away toys with children's meals</HEADLINE>

      <P>Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) Taiwan announced Friday that from July 5 it will no
longer give away toys with its children's meals -- a promotional method commonly
adopted by fast food chains that has been blamed for encouraging unhealthy diets
among children.</P>
      <P>In line with the decision, the price of KFC's children meals will be reduced
from NT$89 to NT$69, the company said.</P>
      <P>Ku Wen-chen,  a senior manager  with KFC's public affairs department, explained
that the new policy is based mainly out of environmental concerns, because most
children already have a lot of toys.</P>
      <P>"The toys obtained from fast food restaurants very often end up in recycling
bins, so we think it would be better to set a realistic price to give back to
consumers," Ku said.</P>
      <P>KFC will also donate NT$1 for each children's meal sold to World Vision Taiwan
to sponsor the charity group's meal delivery services for children living in
remote areas, Ku said.</P>
      <P>The decision came one month after a group of 17 legislators, led by the ruling
Kuomintang's Chiang Nai-shin, signed a petition calling for a ban on toys given
away with children's meals to address the increasing problem of childhood
obesity.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a survey by the Bureau of Health Promotion, Chiang said
the obesity rate among the 2-18 age group in Taiwan has risen from 6 percent to
25 percent over the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>Another  survey  by the John Tung Foundation  shows  that approximately 30
percent of school children eat fast food four to five times a month, Chiang
said.</P>
      <P>Asked about the issue Friday, Chao Min-su, public relations manager for Burger
King in Taiwan, said her company welcomes KFC's decision.</P>
      <P>Chao also said Burger King is evaluating whether to stop giving away toys with
its children's meals, although she added that even if it decides to do so, the
measure will only be implemented next year at the earliest because the toys are
purchased annually.</P>
      <P>McDonald's, whose Happy Meals are very popular among children in Taiwan,
declined to comment.</P>

      <P>The Coast Guard Administration rescued a fishing vessel named Yu Chan Hsiang
that had been hijacked by its Indonesian crew in waters off Pingtung, Taiwan's
southernmost county, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>The rescue mission, carried out by a Taiwanese patrol boat, led to the arrest of
seven Indonesian crew members, according to a spokesman for the administration's
Maritime Patrol Directorate General.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the directorate general has been maintaining contact with the
patrol boat on a regular basis to keep abreast of developments and the fishing
boat, registered in Pingtung County's Liouciou Township, is expected to be
escorted to Kaohsiung Harbor in the next three to four days.</P>
      <P>Coast guard officers in southern Taiwan received a report June 23 from the
Donggang Fishery Radio Station that said captain Tsai Kun-he and chief engineer
Lee Hui-fa were threatened and held captive after a clash with Indonesian crew
members. Their ship was 800 nautical miles southeast of Eluanbi on the southern
tip of the island, the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>The directorate general sent a Taiwanese patrol vessel carrying five armed
special service officers and two inspectors to carry out the rescue mission
later that day. The 51-ton fishing boat was not found until Friday, when patrol
guard officers spotted it with a telescope.</P>
      <P>The officers approached the fishing boat and overpowered the Indonesian crew
after making certain that Tsai and Lee were safe, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>After the coast guard officers brought the situation under control, however, Lee
suffered minor cuts on his left arm from a crew member's knife when he tried to
go to the toilet, the spokesman said.</P>

      <P>Memory chip maker Mosel Vitelic Inc. said Friday that a settlement it has
reached with 33 states in the United States to resolve price-fixing allegations
will have only limited impact on the company's operations.</P>
      <P>Mosel Vitelic and five other dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chip makers
reached the US$173 million agreement to settle the price-fixing allegations with
the 33 U.S. states.</P>
      <P>The five other manufacturers are Micron Technology Inc. of the U.S., NEC
Electronics America Inc., Infineon Technologies AG  of Germany, Hynix
Semiconductor Inc. of South Korea and Elpida Memory Inc. of Japan.</P>
      <P>While Mosel Vitelic declined to disclose the share it will pay for the
settlement, it noted that it has assigned an unspecified provision for
litigation costs and settlement payments, and admitted that the litigation
process in the U.S. has cost the company dearly.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Department of Justice launched probes into price-fixing allegations
involving the six DRAM firms in 2002, alleging that all six colluded to fix
prices for their products between 1998 and 2002.</P>
      <P>The 33 states moved to file a class action lawsuit against the six companies in
2006,  claiming that the collusion had hurt consumers, state agencies,
universities and other groups.</P>
      <P>According to California Attorney-General Edmund Brown Jr., who was involved in
the investigation, salespeople and management of the DRAM firms met frequently
to exchange pricing information, and agreed to overcharge their customers.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, the Justice Department indicted Taiwanese flat panel maker
AU Optronics and six of its executives on charges of price-fixing, but the
company has repeatedly denied the allegations.</P>
      <P>AU Optronics has vowed to fight the charges to clear the company's name and
protect its reputation and credibility.</P>

      <P>A planned joint venture between Taiwanese lithium battery maker Amita
Technologies Inc. and a U.S. counterpart, Gold Peak Industries North America
(GPINA), will help give Taiwan the upper hand in the green energy market,
analysts said Friday.</P>
      <P>The joint venture -- a plant that will be established in San Diego, California
-- will assemble lithium electrodes manufactured by Amita along with other
components to make lithium batteries designed for use in electric vehicles in
North America.</P>
      <P>According to EnergyTrend,  a research subsidiary of market intelligence provider
TrendForce, the U.S. lithium battery industry is still in the R&amp;D stage,
with many problems needing to be overcome with regard to its commercialization
capacity.</P>
      <P>The situation in Taiwan is just the opposite, because Taiwanese businesses have
mostly focused on production and have not invested so much in R&amp;D,
EnergyTrend said.</P>
      <P>The joint venture, which was brokered by the governments of the two countries,
will allow for a perfect division of labor that complements each other's
strengths, the research organization said.</P>
      <P>It noted that since 2009, the United States has injected US$100 million into a

      <P>Taiwan's first lady, Chow Mei-ching, enthralled Italian children Thursday with a
Chinese legend during a storytelling session at a municipal children's library
in suburban Rome.</P>
      <P>Speaking through an interpreter, Chow told the story of how the 12 animals were
chosen for the Chinese zodiac to a group of young children, using lively body
language to increase the children's interest and understanding.</P>
      <P>Her imitation of the sounds and actions of the various zodiac animals fascinated
the children, who started off sitting quietly but later lost their reserve and
some of them even ended up sitting in her lap.</P>
      <P>At the end of her story, the children clamored around Chow, asking her which
zodiac sign they belong to.</P>
      <P>Following the storytelling session came a dance-and-sing-along routine in which
Chow sang and danced with the children and their parents despite an injury to
her waist.</P>
      <P>At one point, a 7-month-old extended her hand to Chow from her month's arms,
providing a touching photo-op when Chow took the child in her arms.</P>
      <P>The library is exclusively set up for children and is the only facility of its
kind in Rome. Despite its compact size, the library offers services not only to
children but also to mothers-to-be and those with newborns.</P>
      <P>The library's chief executive told Chow that the library is open nearly all year
round. It has more than 6,000 books, including English, French and Spanish
volumes, but no Chinese books.</P>
      <P>Chow  then presented  scores  of Chinese-English  bilingual children's books
published in Taiwan to the library.</P>
      <P>In return, the chief executive gave Chow a hand-made photo album which she had
made herself. On the first page is a photo of Italian children and the message:
"greetings from Italian children to Taiwanese children."</P>
      <P>Chow, who arrived in Rome Sunday in her capacity as honorary director of
Taiwan's Cloud Gate Dance Theatre, was accompanied by Taiwan's representative to
Italy, Yih Jung-tzung.</P>
      <P>Cloud Gate performed its signature "Songs of the Wanderers" Tuesday and
Wednesday at Villa Adriana in Tivoli, on the outskirts of Rome.</P>
      <P>After the troupe performs at the Ravenna Festival in northeastern Italy June
27-29, Chow will also accompany it to the Grec Festival in the Spanish city of
Barcelona, where it will perform its widely acclaimed "Wild Cursive" from July
1-4.</P>
      <P>Chow began to assume the role as Cloud Gate's honorary director on its overseas
engagements early this year when she accompanied the group on a tour of the
United States and Canada in late January and early February.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, she led the Cloud Gate dancers on a tour of Russia, where
they performed "Whisper of Flowers" at the 2010 Chekhov International Theatre
Festival from June 10-13.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's under-18 women's national basketball team held off a furious rally by
South Korea to win its third consecutive game at the International Basketball
Federation (FIFA) Asia U18 Championship for Women in Thailand Friday.</P>
      <P>"I'm proud of the way the girls kept their composure," head coach Chen Mei-li
said after Taiwan was forced to regroup in the final minute for an 84-82 victory
after blowing a 20-point lead.</P>
      <P>By edging the South Koreans, Taiwan virtually assured itself a berth in the
final four of the tournament, which serves as a qualifying event for the FIBA
World U19 Championship for Women to be held in Chile next year.</P>
      <P>It will likely be joined by China, Japan and South Korea, because the other
countries in the six-team preliminary round group, Malaysia and Kazakhstan,
remain winless.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will play China Saturday and Japan Sunday in the last two games of the
preliminary round. The top three teams in the tournament will represent Asia in
Chile.</P>
      <P>Taiwan maintained a lead throughout much of the game and had a 70-54 advantage
after three quarters.</P>
      <P>But the Koreans mounted a 12-3 run in the first five minutes of the fourth
quarter to pull close and actually grabbed a lead with 2: 45 left, behind three
three-pointers from Cha Hongjin and nine points from Lee Seungah.</P>
      <P>Chang Chi-fang paced Taiwan with a team-high 23 points while Lin Yu-ting had 19
points and Chang Yi-lin added 16.</P>
      <P>The biennial competition had been dominated by China and South Korea, winners of
11 and seven U18 Asian titles, respectively, before Japan upset China to capture
the gold medal for the first time in 2008. Taiwan has won silver and bronze
three times each.</P>
      <P>Twelve teams are participating in the biennial tournament, which runs June 23-30
in Surat Thani, Thailand. They are divided into two six-team levels -- the elite
Level I and the qualifying Level II.</P>
      <P>Teams play all other teams in their group, with the top four in Level I
qualifying for the semifinals, while the top two Level II teams will play the
bottom two Level I teams for a chance to enter Level I competition in the
future.</P>

      <P>Major Japanese newspapers said Friday that the preferential tariffs Taiwanese
goods will enjoy once a trade pact with China is signed will be beneficial to
Taiwan's companies, but may affect Japanese or South Korean industries.</P>
      <P>Nihon Keizai Shimbun said that Taiwan's LED panel and automobile sectors, which
could compete directly with those in Japan and South Korea, are not included in
the economic cooperation framework agreement's (ECFA) "early harvest" list of
goods that will get tariff reductions or exemptions.</P>
      <P>But if more items are put on the list in the future, they will provide a boost
to Taiwan businesses, the paper said.</P>
      <P>To Japanese businesses, the inking of the ECFA will mean that Japan can more
flexibly divide its production bases on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the
paper added.</P>
      <P>Sankei Shimbun, another Japanese daily, concluded that based on the information
unveiled Thursday, the "early harvest" list is more favorable to Taiwan than to
China.</P>
      <P>It contended that the Chinese are accepting a pact that favors Taiwan with an
eye on gaining leverage to move from economic integration to political
integration.</P>
      <P>Asahi Shimbun  said that overall,  China has made greater concessions, while
Yomiuri Shimbun said the concessions could be seen as China's gesture to woo
Taiwan back into its fold.</P>
      <P>A total of 539 Taiwanese goods and services with an export value of US$13.83
billion are on the "early harvest" list, compared with 267 Chinese items that
have an export value to Taiwan of US$2.86 billion.</P>
      <P>With the completion of talks on the "early harvest" list, the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait are expected to sign the agreement June 29.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's service sector might face a boycott or resistance from its Chinese
counterparts, although certain service businesses have been put on an "early
harvest" list under a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
with China, a China-based business advisor said Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China Thursday exchanged their "early harvest" lists of items that
will be subject to tariff waivers or easier market access under the trade pact.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese investors will be allowed to set up wholly owned hospitals in major
areas such as Shanghai, Jiangsu Province and Fujian Province after the signing
of the ECFA, while Taiwanese banks will  be granted  preferential  status
compared  with foreign counterparts, when opening branches or subsidiaries in
China.</P>
      <P>However, Lee Jen-hsiang, general manager of Kunshan-based Hamber Consultant
Services Co., said things are unlikely to proceed as smoothly as many Taiwanese
investors are anticipating.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese service sector will resist the opening out of concern that foreign
investors will compete with them and take away their business," Lee told CNA.</P>
      <P>"The signing of the ECFA is just a beginning. Taiwanese investors are still
expected to face a great deal of difficulty getting into the Chinese market,"
Lee added. "It will take time," he added.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwanese investors will need to take on bureaucratic red tape as they
seek regulatory approval to open hospitals in China, adding that resistance or
boycotts from Chinese hospitals could further complicate the application
process.</P>
      <P>He added that he does not expect state-owned Chinese hospitals, which provide
poor service but enjoy a large number of patient visits, to welcome the
competition from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While many Taiwanese banks are eager to set up footholds in China, Lee went on,
it will not be easy for them to find good locations as most of the existing
premier office space in major cities is occupied and unavailable to newcomers.</P>
      <P>Lee said it is likely that Taiwanese banks will have to wait for two to three
years until construction of new commercial buildings has been completed before
they will be able to find suitable office locations.</P>

      <P>Prosecutors filed an appeal Friday against the Taiwan High Court's lightening of
sentences in the case involving former President Chen Shui-bian, his family
members and former aides.</P>
      <P>Hours before the deadline for appeal, prosecutors from the Special Investigation
Division under the Taiwan High Prosecutors' Office presented their appeal
against the High Court sentences for all of the 10 defendants involved.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors said the judges, who commuted the punishment for most of the
defendants in the case, gave conflicting reasons in their decision and applied
the wrong articles of the law to back up their judgment.</P>
      <P>They said the judges allowed Chen Shui-bian's defense that he used parts of his
state affairs funds -- an allowance set aside for the president's discretionary
use for state business -- for secret diplomatic operations. Secret diplomatic
operations could be financed by other public funds, however, and Chen didn't
need to disguise his spending by collecting invoices from others to claim
reimbursement from the state affairs funds, the prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>They also noted that the judges said Chen's confidant Ma Yung-cheng, who helped
Chen claim reimbursement from the state affairs funds under the pretext of
rewarding Chen's body guards, had created false private documents. But when the
judges gave the reasons for Ma's sentence, they applied the rules for punishing
an official who writes false information on state documents.</P>
      <P>The difference  between the court's sentences  and reasons undermined the
grounds on which the judgment was based,  the prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife Wu Shu-jen were indicted on Dec. 12, 2008 for allegedly
accumulating about NT$1 billion (US$31.15 million) in embezzled public funds and
bribes during Chen's terms as president.</P>
      <P>His son Chen Chih-chung, daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching and four others were
charged with helping the former president collect the funds or to transmit them
to foreign bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife each were sentenced to life imprisonment by a district court,
but the sentences were cut to 20 year prison terms by the Taiwan High Court on
June 11.</P>
      <P>Others who received jail terms from six months to 20 years by the district
courts saw their sentences commuted by the high court, except for a cashier.</P>
      <P>The cashier -- who was given immunity for testifying on behalf of prosecutors in
the first trial -- was handed a seven-month jail term that is suspended for two
years.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian and Wu Shu-jen denied the charges from the beginning of the
trial, claiming that their funds were political contributions from supporters,
and have filed an appeal against the Taiwan High Court ruling.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) is set to help sell more than
8,000 additional tons of locally grown bananas by the end of August to further
stabilize the price of the fruit, according to a statement released Friday.</P>
      <P>The council has taken actions to battle a banana glut by helping to prop up
prices since the middle of May, including the arrangement of group purchases,
buying bananas for disadvantaged  groups, stimulating  banana exports and
increasing the consumption  of processed green banana products.</P>
      <P>The council's Agriculture and Food Agency (AFA) said it aims to export 4,605
tons of bananas to Japan and 339 tons to China, and it will also encourage
processing companies to purchase 2,633 tons of green bananas at NT$5 per
kilogram.</P>
      <P>The other 487 tons will be sold to the military, prisons and other government
agencies, the agency said.</P>
      <P>According to the AFA, demand for bananas has been affected by the harvest of
many other summer fruits between May and July, which caused prices to drop.</P>
      <P>AFA said the result of the council's efforts since May have been positive as the
domestic price of green bananas rose from NT$3-6 to NT$6-10 per kilogram in
June, while export prices rose from NT$12-15 to NT$15-20 per kilogram.</P>

      <P>The main road to Alishan, one of Taiwan's most popular tourist destinations,
fully reopened to large vehicles Friday after being inaccessible because of
serious damage caused by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih, Minister of Transportation and Communications Mao Chih-kuo,
Chiayi County Magistrate Chang Hua-kuan and other local politicians braved heavy
rains to attend a reopening ceremony at the main entrance of the Alishan
National Forest Recreation Area.</P>
      <P>The officials greeted groups of tourists who arrived in big tour buses at the
mountainous recreation area in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County, ready to take
advantage of the road's reopening to large vehicles.</P>
      <P>Addressing the reopening ceremony, Premier Wu said the government also plans to
build a gondola or cable car system in the Alishan mountain resort area to offer
another appealing attraction for tourists from both home and abroad.</P>
      <P>The Alishan Highway, which serves as the scenic area's main lifeline, was
seriously damaged by torrential rains and mudslides triggered by Typhoon Morakot
in August 2009.</P>
      <P>The foundations of two sections in the road -- at the 59 kilometer and 71
kilometer marks -- were washed away, making repairs difficult.</P>
      <P>The highway reopened to compact vehicles last October and to medium-size
vehicles last November.</P>
      <P>Although large vehicles have been allowed to travel on the road since February
this year, they could only go as far as the 66-km point. Passengers then had to
transfer to medium-sized buses to reach the road's terminus -- the Alishan
Forest Recreation Area.</P>
      <P>Although the road has now been fully opened, work is still progressing in eight
spots, and large vehicles will be subject to a 20 km/h speed limit in those
sections, Mao said.</P>
      <P>Tourism in the Alishan area was dealt a severe blow by Typhoon Morakot, which
destroyed both the area's main road artery and its popular mountain railway.</P>
      <P>Mao said he hoped the full reopening to large vehicles could revive the industry
in the area.</P>
      <P>It already received a badly needed boost when two sections of the Forest Railway
-- the Shushan Sunrise-Watching Line and the Divine Tree Line -- resumed service
June 19.</P>
      <P>In addition to its existing "five wonders" -- the sea of clouds, the sunrise,
the sunset, the mountain-climbing railway, and the forest through which the
railway line winds -- the Chiayi Forestry Bureau that administers the Alishan
recreation area said it has developed eight new tourist attractions to add to
the area's appeal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's textile industry to benefit from ECFA: industry group</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  June 25 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's share of China's textile market should increase significantly once 136
textile items benefit from preferential duties under a trade pact that Taiwan
and China plan to sign later this month, a textile industry association said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The two countries reached a consensus Thursday that 136 Taiwanese textile items
and 22 Chinese textile products will be among the items on the economic
cooperation framework agreement's (ECFA) "early harvest" list, the list of goods
that will be the first to benefit from tariff reductions under the pact.</P>
      <P>The 136 items account for 67 percent of all of Taiwan's textile exports to China
and represents the extent to which China was willing to open its market for
Taiwanese textile products, said Huang Wei-chi, secretary-general of the
government-backed Taiwan Textile Federation.</P>
      <P>Between 2007 and 2009, Taiwan's textile exports to China totaled approximately
US$2.8 billion to US$2.9 billion annually, Huang said.</P>
      <P>China currently imposes import duties of 5 percent on Taiwan's chemical fibers
and yarns, 10 percent on fabrics, and 14-18 percent on apparel.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Taiwan levies tariffs of less than 3 percent on imported chemical
fibers and yarns and less than 10 percent on fabrics, lower than those imposed
by China, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also imposes bans or restrictions on the import of more than 600 Chinese
textile items, he added.</P>
      <P>Because China will fully remove its tariffs for the 136 Taiwanese textile goods
in three stages over two years after the ECFA takes effect, Huang expected that
sales of Taiwan's textile products in the Chinese market will grow sharply
because of lower import costs.</P>
      <P>The growth could come from an anticipated increase in demand for Taiwan's
fabrics from Chinese textile exporters or from China's domestic market, Huang
predicted.</P>
      <P>Regarding  the 22 Chinese textile items that will receive preferential tariffs
from Taiwan, Huang said they would not have a major negative impact on the local
textile industry because they account for only 10 percent of China's total
textile exports to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Despite the competitiveness of China's yarn manufacturing and its large scale of
production, for instance, most of its yarn products are standardized
commodities,  in contrast to Taiwan's smaller production scale but more
diversified product line, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Manufacturers on the two sides could complement each other well, he believed.</P>
      <P>Huang also downplayed the possibility that the higher number of Taiwanese
textile products on the early harvest list would adversely impact China's
textile industry.</P>
      <P>He cited China's strength in the production of natural and chemical fibers, its
large production scale, and the relatively limited value of Taiwan's textile
exports to China as factors that would limit the impact of the deal there.</P>

the bureau's plan to give more accurate weather forecasts.</P>
      <P>The trial run of the planned system, which aims to give forecasts for more

(CommonWealth 448)(translated by Kay Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>High-end decor and consistent service are two of many reasons people are willing
to make reservations two months ahead or wait in line for one and a half hours
just to enjoy the spicy hot pots at Tripod King's Taipei branch.</P>
      <P>Tripod King had its start in a night market in central Taiwan's Taichung City,
where owner Chen Shih-ming spent six years running a stall and pondering his
next step. After reading a survey saying three out of every 10 people like spicy
food, he opened his first hot pot restaurant in 1997. Now the brand has five
restaurants around Taiwan, with three in Taichung, one in the southern city of
Kaohsiung and one in the country's capital.</P>
      <P>As the head chef of Tripod King, Chen developed its spicy soup stock with a
dozen vegetables, tea leaves, and more than 30 Chinese medicinal herbs to create
a unique taste that stands out from most hot pot restaurants, which often make
their stock with bones. He also insists on making ingredients like dumplings and
other hot pot additives in-house rather than order them in bulk from
wholesalers.</P>
      <P>Chen's attention to detail includes restaurant  design and choosing new
locations. He said he has rejected more than 20 locations for minor flaws
including noise, poor air quality or fire safety issues. Interior designer Lin
Chin-lien said he once spent more than a month with Chen before deciding on a
final design.</P>
      <P>"I've never met a restaurant owner able to consider every aspect, including
profitability per square meter, aesthetic and details of how the service is
conducted," Lin said.</P>
      <P>While Chen continues to look for a second location in Taipei, he is also
venturing out to set up new brands and sell different kinds of hot pots. Wu
Cheng-he, head of Providence University's Department of Tourism in Taichung,
said the expansion will be a test of Chen's management skills and whether his
team is ready.</P>

      <P>The Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO) in Taipei celebrated the 112th
anniversary of the founding of the Philippines Friday in a cocktail reception
with diplomats from the  Philippines  and Taiwan  calling  for deeper  and
closer relationships under the new Philippine administration.</P>
      <P>Benigno Simeon C. Aquino will be sworn in as Philippine president on June 30.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  "is  our  sixth-largest  trading  partner  and our fifth-largest source
of foreign direct investments. It ranks fifth in tourist arrivals and is host to
almost 90,000 Filipino workers, of which 65 percent work in the high-tech
manufacturing industry, " said Antonio Basilio, managing director of the MECO,
the Philippine authority in Taiwan in the absence of official diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Basilio told around 300 guests, including Taiwan diplomats, businesspeople and
foreign representatives in Taiwan,  that 21 memorandums of understanding (MOUs)
on a wide range of areas have been signed by both sides in the last five years
-- evidence of a strong friendship.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is keen to forge a closer partnership with its closest neighbor to the
south because the countries  "share the same democratic values" and the
economies of Taiwan and the Philippines complement each other well, said Shen
Ssu-tsun, deputy minister of Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Basilio and Shen both said that warming cross-Taiwan Strait relations have had a
positive impact on peace and stability in the region and created new dynamics
that favor economic growth and integration in the region.</P>
      <P>"This has also opened new pathways of friendship and cooperation between Taiwan
and the Philippines," Basilio said.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Friday that an estimated 260,000 jobs are expected to be
created in Taiwan after it signs a trade pact with China later this month.</P>
      <P>Wu was rebutting media reports that said the trade deal will cause 150,000 local
people to lose their jobs, a day after Taiwan and China finalized the early
harvest lists for goods and services to enjoy preferential treatment under the
trade pact.</P>
      <P>According to the finalized lists, a total of 539 Taiwanese products and services
will be given tariff cuts or improved market access under the cross-strait
economic  cooperation  framework agreement (ECFA) , more than double the 267
Chinese products and services included.</P>
      <P>At a ceremony to mark the reopening of the Alishan Highway to large vehicles, Wu
said Taiwan managed to place more items than expected on its early harvest list

      <P>Wu also said that most financial and economic scholars in Taiwan and abroad
predicted Taiwan would benefit considerably from the ECFA even though it may
negatively impact some local industries and services.</P>
      <P>However, the government has devised measures and earmarked funds to help sectors
that could be affected by the ECFA to deal with the challenges and strengthen

      <P>Six former Navy officers who were charged with corruption in the country's 1991
purchase of six Lafayette-class missile frigates from France were found not
guilty by the Taiwan District Court Friday.</P>
      <P>After a trial of almost 10 years, the court said there was insufficient evidence
to convict retired Vice Admirals Lei Hsueh-min, Yao Neng-chun, retired Rear
Admiral Wang Chin-sheng, and three other middle-level staff officers responsible
for the acquisition of the frigates of corruption.</P>
      <P>Lei served as the chief of the Navy's Warship Management Office at the time
while Yao served as the office's executive director.</P>
      <P>They and the four others were indicted in July 5, 2001 for failing to check the
price asked by French contractor Thomson-CSF (now known as Thales) for the six
Lafayettes.</P>
      <P>Because of their dereliction of duty, the indictment said, the cost of the deal
increased sharply from US$2.45 billion when negotiations on the deal began in
1990 to US$2.8 billion when the contract was sealed in 1991.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors said in the indictment that the French contractor overcharged
Taiwan's government for the warships and paid at least US$160 million in
kickbacks to brokers to secure the deal.</P>
      <P>Lei, the most senior officer among the accused, said he was glad the court had
cleared them of the charges even though it took almost 10 years and Yao had
already passed away.</P>
      <P>He urged the prosecutors not to appeal the verdict to spare the defendants the
ordeal of another time-consuming trial, insisting that they were innocent and
saying the indictment was not supported by evidence.</P>
      <P>The original indictment  was controversial  within Taiwan's judicial ranks.</P>
      <P>Incumbent Prosecutor General Huang Shyh-ming, who was the chief of the Taipei
District Prosecutors Office in 2001, revealed at a Legislative Yuan hearing
recently that he lost the job because he refused to bow to pressure from then
Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa to indict Lei and the five others in the case.</P>
      <P>It was Huang's successor,  Shih Mao-lin, who approved the indictment.</P>
      <P>Both Lu and Shih have retired and didn't respond to Huang's claims.</P>
      <P>The case came to Taiwan's attention in August 1996 when a court in Geneva,
Switzerland ordered Thomson-CSF to pay self-declared middleman Edmond Kwan 160
million francs in commission for the sale.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's judicial authorities were drawn to the court ruling because the
contract for the frigates explicitly forbid commissions to be paid on the sale.</P>
      <P>However, Taipei's attempts to track down the allegedly massive kickbacks were
stonewalled because the arms broker believed to have masterminded the sale,
Andrew Wang, fled Taiwan in 1993 before investigators could question him.</P>
      <P>When President Chen Shui-bian assumed office in 2000, he ordered the reopening
of the probe, which resulted in the indictment of the six Navy officials.</P>
      <P>Local prosecutors asked Swiss authorities in 2001 to freeze the US$520 million
in Wang's bank account and indicted him and his five family members in the case
in 2006, but his trial has never started because he refused to return to Taiwan
to answer the charges.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors in charge of the investigation of the case said they could not
convince Swiss authorities to transfer Wang's funds back to Taiwan unless they
were determined by a court to be illegally obtained gains.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) said it will not waver in
its stance that it is too early to push for a trade deal with China and that the
government cannot resolve misgivings about the pact, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai's comment came one day before the DPP stages a major rally in Taipei to
voice its opposition to the signing of the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>Many DPP heavyweights are expected to take part in the rally. Former President
Lee Teng-hui will also address the protesters, but Kaohsiung County Magistrate
Yang Chiu-hsing,  Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair and Tainan County Magistrate Su
Huan-jhih will not attend.</P>
      <P>Su suggesting that the party has been ambivalent about the signing the ECFA.</P>
      <P>Tsai accused the government of stressing the pact's "early harvest" list,
calling "it a strategy of shifting the focus."</P>
      <P>She said the real issue with the ECFA was its long-term and structural problems,
and she challenged the government to tell the people about the impact of the
pact on Taiwan a decade from now.</P>
      <P>She also voiced suspicions that the list, which includes 539 Taiwanese goods and
267 Chinese goods that will receive preferential treatment once the pact takes
effect, has "many things that have been beautified and we've also seen places
where China deliberately made concessions."</P>
      <P>The DPP wants to ask why China is making the concessions and its political
motives, she said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the party has prepared 100 "Taiwanese vuvuzelas" to distribute among
the protesters.</P>
      <P>DPP  legislator  Gao Jyh-peng  bought  200 vuvuzelas,  the noise-making trumpet
of South African football fans, from abroad for use at the rally.</P>
      <P>But he said the vuvuzela required a lot of skill to use, so Taipei City
councilman Chen Chien-ming commissioned a southern Taiwan plant to make a
Taiwanese version.</P>
      <P>Nearly 1,000 policemen will be mobilized to maintain order.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ruling Kuomintang on Friday suspected that the DPP was using
Saturday's rally as a facade and that the real purpose was to build momentum for
the five special municipality elections on Nov. 27.</P>
      <P>While Taipei is swarmed with protesters, President Ma Ying-jeou and Premier Wu
Den-yih will travel to southern Taiwan to review the results of post-disaster
construction after Typhoon Morakot last August.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Mainland
Affairs Council and Council of Agriculture will host ECFA seminars in northern,

    <HEADLINE>DPP reiterates anti-ECFA stance on eve of rally</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) said it will not waver in
its stance that it is too early to push for a trade deal with China and that the
government cannot resolve misgivings about the pact, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai's comment came one day before the DPP stages a major rally in Taipei to
voice its opposition to the signing of the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>Many DPP heavyweights are expected to take part in the rally. Former President
Lee Teng-hui will also address the protesters, but Kaohsiung County Magistrate
Yang Chiu-hsing,  Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair and Tainan County Magistrate Su
Huan-jhih will not attend.</P>
      <P>Su suggesting that the party has been ambivalent about the signing the ECFA.</P>
      <P>Tsai accused the government of stressing the pact's "early harvest" list,
calling "it a strategy of shifting the focus."</P>
      <P>She said the real issue with the ECFA was its long-term and structural problems,
and she challenged the government to tell the people about the impact of the
pact on Taiwan a decade from now.</P>
      <P>She also voiced suspicions that the list, which includes 539 Taiwanese goods and
267 Chinese goods that will receive preferential treatment once the pact takes
effect, has "many things that have been beautified and we've also seen places
where China deliberately made concessions."</P>
      <P>The DPP wants to ask why China is making the concessions and its political
motives, she said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the party has prepared 100 "Taiwanese vuvuzelas" to distribute among
the protesters.</P>
      <P>DPP  legislator  Gao Jyh-peng  bought  200 vuvuzelas,  the noise-making trumpet
of South African football fans, from abroad for use at the rally.</P>
      <P>But he said the vuvuzela required a lot of skill to use, so Taipei City
councilman Chen Chien-ming commissioned a southern Taiwan plant to make a
Taiwanese version.</P>
      <P>Nearly 1,000 policemen will be mobilized to maintain order.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ruling Kuomintang on Friday suspected that the DPP was using
Saturday's rally as a facade and that the real purpose was to build momentum for
the five special municipality elections on Nov. 27.</P>
      <P>While Taipei is swarmed with protesters, President Ma Ying-jeou and Premier Wu
Den-yih will travel to southern Taiwan to review the results of post-disaster
construction after Typhoon Morakot last August.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Mainland
Affairs Council and Council of Agriculture will host ECFA seminars in northern,
central and southern Taiwan.</P>

      <P>will hold a march in protest against the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China Saturday, when Taiwan has already entered the "post-
ECFA" period.</P>
      <P>The DPP's action is just like trying to reverse the direction of the earth's
rotation.</P>
      <P>In the post-ECFA period, the urgency for unification with China has diminished,
and the possibility for Taiwan independence has also decreased to near zero.
Beijing is bound to display its goodwill to try to win the support of the
Taiwanese people. And Taiwan needs to maintain its vibrant democratic system and
heed public opinion while engaging in "co-opetition" with China.</P>
      <P>Getting to the bottom of the DPP's problem, the party needs to change its "anti-
Republic of China" policy, because its anti-ECFA stance is derived from its
opposition to the ROC. By doing so, the DPP would generate a more accurate and
balanced view of the world, cross-Taiwan Strait relations and Taiwan. (June 26,

      <P>Lu Yen-hsun set another record at Wimbledon Friday when his third-round opponent
withdrew with an injury, making him the first man from Taiwan to advance to the
fourth round of a grand slam tennis tournament.</P>
      <P>Lu grabbed the lead over Germany's Florian Mayer soon after the opening and held
it through the first two sets 6-4, 6-4. The 190 cm-tall Mayer -- who won when
they last played each other in 2003 -- retired in the third set with Lu ahead
2-1.</P>
      <P>It was Lu's best performance since he began taking part in grand slam
tournaments in 2004 and the first time an Asian player reached the fourth round
at Wimbledon since 2003.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday Lu became the first Taiwanese player to ever advance to the third
round in a Wimbledon singles event. The world No. 82 had only reached the third
round of one other grand slam event in his career -- the Australian Open in
2009.</P>
      <P>Speaking after his latest victory, the 26-year-old expressed thanks to people

      <P>will stage a demonstration Saturday against the cross-Taiwan Strait economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) that will highlight the party's stance on
the "one China market" and call for a referendum on the trade pact.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, the pro-independence green camp has been using the so-
called "one China market" argument to try to demonize cross-strait economic
cooperation. It is also "heavy artillery" used by the greens to attack the ECFA.</P>
      <P>However, following the release of the ECFA "early harvest" lists -- which
include 539 Taiwan goods and 267 China products -- the "one China market" has
been proven a hollow issue and even a pseudo-issue.</P>
      <P>The lists prove that the two sides are economic entities on equal footing. It
has been shown that the ECFA is in essence a free trade agreement (FTA), without
a trace of the "one China market."</P>
      <P>If the DPP insists on following the ECFA issue, it should change its angle. For
example, the party can demand that the government open the second round of
"early harvest" talks soon to obtain more tariff reductions and market access
opportunities for Taiwanese businesses. The DPP can also press the government to
speed up its efforts to sign FTAs with other countries to further
internationalize Taiwan's economy. (June 26, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>To cool the red-hot housing market, the central bank decided on Thursday to
raise its key interest rates by 0.125 percentage points and impose credit
control on second-home buyers in areas of greater Taipei where housing prices
have seen the biggest increases.</P>
      <P>The hike demonstrates that the qualitative easing policy is being phased out,
which carries great significance to the financial markets. Its small margin
demonstrates that the central bank is handling the issue very cautiously.</P>
      <P>The extent of the credit control, meanwhile, is moderate because it targets
mainly speculators, and only in the greater Taipei area. Further observation is
required to see if it is effective in curbing Taipei's soaring housing prices.</P>
      <P>Besides raising interest rates and imposing credit control, improving
transparency in the real estate market and setting up a reasonable land tax
system are also essential if the government is to succeed in lowering housing
prices. With the Cabinet having approved a package that is aimed at building a
healthy housing market, we hope the plan can be implemented as soon as possible.

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Post-ECFA negotiations</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/26/10  14:56:56
(By Flor  Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China will sign a tariff-cutting economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) in Chongqing, China on June 29, heralding a new era in cross-
Taiwan Strait trade amid efforts to gradually slash or remove barriers to
bilateral trade and investment.</P>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said Friday that
China granted preferential treatment to a large number of Taiwan's products
because of the special relationship between the two sides. After the ECFA
signing, the two sides are set to continue negotiations on more types of
merchandise, service and investment at the next round of talks in six months, he
added.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, the ECFA will only serve as a framework, and future
negotiations in the three fields will have a profound impact on Taiwan's
economy. Agreements will be inked as soon as respective talks are completed, he
said.</P>
      <P>Follow-up negotiations in the fields of merchandise, service and investment will
be much more critical than the "early harvest" items for both sides, Chiang
said, predicting that there will be greater conflicts of interest.</P>
      <P>The SEF chief, however, said that Taiwan will benefit from the ECFA and its
consequent negotiations, which will put it on an equal footing to compete with
Association of Southeast Asian Nations members and help it gain greater
advantages than South Korea in the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>When the two sides eventually arrive at a free trade agreement (FTA) , Taiwan's
exports will be significantly expanded and both foreign and domestic companies
will be willing to increase investment in Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>A key Chinese think tank proposed Friday the two sides set up work offices and
hold high-level talks in order to strike a balance between economic cooperation
and political dialogue.</P>
      <P>It also predicted that the two sides will encounter more difficulties in future
negotiations because of decreased room for mutual concessions. (June 26, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, director general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade, said Friday
that China's consent to allow 539 items from Taiwan's industries -- amounting to
nearly 20 percent of Taiwan's total export value -- to enter its market without
tariffs two years from when the agreement goes into effect will threaten the
development of Japanese and South Korean businesses operating in China.</P>
      <P>Major competitors of these Taiwan products in the Chinese market are Japanese or
South Korean goods, and they have a market valuation of US$2.35 billion, Huang
said.</P>
      <P>Government officials said Taiwan will seek to forge FTAs with other prime trade
partners after the ECFA is signed. Taiwan has asked for FTA talks with
Singapore, Malaysia, the United States, the European Union, Japan and Thailand.</P>
      <P>Vice President  Vincent  Siew told a seminar  Friday that China-based Taiwan
enterprises should shift from export-oriented manufacturing to a local demand-
driven business model, seizing the chance to profit from China's internal
transformation. (June 26, 2010).</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU),
along with some civic groups, will stage a demonstration to voice their
objections to the ECFA in Taipei on Saturday. The two pro-independence parties
are demanding a referendum be held to allow the public to decide the issue.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei confirmed that former President Lee Teng-hui, the
spiritual leader of the small party, will also take part in the protest.</P>
      <P>"The ECFA will mark a watershed in Taiwan-China relations, which will further
boost the pace in bilateral exchanges and increase Taiwanese people's
misgivings," Huang said.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said the government's rush to clinch the ECFA
without complementary measures in place will definitely hurt Taiwan's industry,
economy and job market. This is why the party is opposed to the trade deal with
China, she said.</P>
      <P>Tsai accused the government of placing emphasis only on the ECFA's "early
harvest" list as a means of shifting public attention from the core issue.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the ECFA will pose a long-term structural problem to Taiwan
and the government has failed to give the public an explanation of its possible
impact on the country.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that she is highly concerned about China's motive in signing the ECFA
and that she suspects Beijing is trying to exercise leverage in Taiwan's
political and democratic system to eventually swallow Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wong Chin-chu said that the 267 Chinese goods that will be
permitted to enter Taiwan under the ECFA will seriously hurt Taiwan's industry
as many of them are highly competitive in Taiwan's market and can easily take
the place of local goods.</P>
      <P>"Has the government already made full preparations for this and worked out
projects to assist affected companies? " she asked. (June 26, 2010).</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Hsieh Su-wei scored a rare double at Wimbledon Friday, winning matches
in both the women's and mixed doubles to advance to the third round in the two
events.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, an accomplished doubles player who had never won a women's doubles match
at Wimbledon in four previous tries before this year, teamed with Alla
Kudryavtseva of Russia to oust China's Zhang Shuai and Estonia's Kaia Kanepi
6-3, 4-6, 6-1 in a second round encounter.</P>
      <P>If Hsieh wins her third round match, she would become the first Taiwanese
women's doubles player ever to reach the quarterfinals of the event.</P>
      <P>But to make history, she and Kudryavtseva, seeded 16th this year, will have to
overcome the formidable fifth-seeded duo of Liezel Huber and Bethanie Mattek-
Sands of the United States.</P>
      <P>Just hours after her victory in the women's doubles, the 24-year-old and
Brazil's Bruno Soares fought past the experienced Czech duo of Barbora Zahlavova
Strycova and Philipp Petzschner, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, in the second round of the mixed
doubles.</P>
      <P>Hsieh told the Central News Agency that she was very happy with her results at
Wimbledon so far this year and that she hoped she could sustain her high level
of play and continue to post good results.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's pinnacle as a pro was when she reached the fourth round of the women's
singles at the Australian Open in 2008. Her singles ranking peaked later that
year at 78, but she has focused most of her attention since then on doubles.</P>
      <P>Also on Friday, Taiwan's Chuang Chia-jung and Filip Polasek of Slovakia lost to
the Belgium pair of Kim Clijsters -- the 2009 U.S. Open women's singles champion
-- and Xavier Malisse 6-3, 6-4 in the second round of the mixed doubles.</P>
      <P>Chuang and Russia's Olga Govortsova will try to join Hsieh and Kudryavtseva in
the third round of the women's doubles when they play Russians Elena Vesnina and
Vera Zvonareva Saturday.</P>
      <P>In another second round women's doubles match Friday featuring a Taiwanese
player, 19-year-old Chang Kai-chen and Japanese partner Ayumi Morita were
eliminated by Julia Goerges of Germany and Agnes Szavay of Hungary 6-2, 7-5.</P>
      <P>Chang felt she was not as aggressive and focused as she needed to be during the
match, but overall she was delighted at reaching the second round of both the
women's singles and doubles at the world's premier grasscourt tournament.</P>
      <P>"I'm satisfied with my performance, but I can do better, " Chang said. "I was
really lucky to have a chance to play on Center Court this year, and I hope I
can come back to Wimbledon next year and do even better."</P>
      <P>Chang, currently ranked 89th in the world in singles, now has her eyes on the
U.S. Open. She will return to Taiwan for a quick break and then head to Florida
to train for the hardcourt grand slam that begins in late August.</P>
      <P>"I love American hardcourts, and the U.S. Open is my favorite event. With the
experience gained from last year, I have a lot more confidence, and technically
I'll be able to prepare better, " she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan Tea Association rep calls for market opening to Chinese tea</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan should open its market to Chinese tea so that local tea makers can more
easily obtain raw materials to produce high-quality tea, an association said on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Tea Association Chairman Hsu Cheng-ching issued the call at a seminar
sponsored by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Taipei County to discuss a
tariff-cutting economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) that Taiwan and
China plan to sign on June 29 in Chongqing, China.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement, tariffs on 539 kinds of Taiwanese products,
including tea, and 267 categories of Chinese goods will be completely removed
within two years. Delegates from both sides also plan to continue negotiations
to allow more goods and services to receive special trade treatment.</P>
      <P>Hsu suggested Taiwan fully open its market to Chinese tea in the follow-up
negotiations, saying that cross-strait tea trade should be decided by market
forces.</P>
      <P>"Doing so would be mutually beneficial and help provide Taiwanese makers with
greater access to Chinese materials and tea," he said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is the only country in the world with the skills to produce green tea,
red tea and oolong tea, which all require different degrees of fermentation," he
said.</P>
      <P>After customs rates on Taiwan-grown  teas are lowered and eventually removed for
export to China, the outlook for Taiwanese tea there is unlimited, he said.</P>
      <P>To best take advantage of the opportunity, Taiwan should allow tea makers to
import Chinese materials.</P>
      <P>"Local producers would be given greater access to raw materials in China if
Taiwan opens its market to Chinese tea,"  Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese tea will get a better chance internationally and will stage a
comeback in China."</P>
      <P>In response to some people's concern that substandard Chinese tea would invade
Taiwan's market under a zero-tariff treatment, he urged both the government and
the private sector to have confidence in local products.</P>
      <P>"Tea industries on both sides of the strait are closely linked, and channels for
two-way cooperation should be created to permit them to forge common ground and
explore the world market," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A  highly  disaster-resistant communications platform -- the first of its kind
in Taiwan -- was launched Saturday in Kaohsiung County's Namasia Township, one
of the places hit hardest by last August's Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>The multi-purpose facility was constructed with the goal of ensuring that
communications are not disrupted in the event of a disaster. Besides being a
mobile phone base station, it can interface with the military's communications
equipment.</P>
      <P>At the platform's opening ceremony at Jiasian Elementary School, President Ma
Ying-jeou held a video conference with village chiefs and local residents to
remind them to make proper preparations for the flood season.</P>
      <P>Ma said that even with state-of-the-art communication facilities, it is
essential that the public improve its awareness of disaster prevention.</P>
      <P>"Once a warning is issued,  evacuation  should take place immediately," he said.</P>
      <P>According to National Communications Commission Chairwoman Peng Yun,  the
disaster-resistant  communications platform integrates optical fiber,  microwave
and satellite television transmission technologies.</P>
      <P>Five other such platforms are under construction in the county's Fongshan City
and Maolin, Taoyuan, Liouguei and Shanlin townships, Peng said, adding that work
is expected to be completed in October.</P>
      <P>Also at the opening ceremony, Chunghwa Telecom displayed a newly developed low-
frequency wireless system that can be used for issuing disaster warnings.</P>
      <P>According to Huang Chin-shih, an expert from Chunghwa Telecom's
Telecommunication Laboratories who coordinates the research project, the system
will allow people to receive government-issued disaster warnings using radio-
controlled watches and clocks.</P>
      <P>Hsu Ching-hsing, an official from the Bureau of Standards, Metrology and
Inspection, explained that low frequency technology is ideal for use in
emergency warning broadcasts because it is not influenced by climatic and
geographical conditions.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Saturday urged Taiwan's opposition parties to join the
government in monitoring the implementation of a soon-to-be-signed cross-Taiwan
Strait trade pact.</P>
      <P>Ma said he respected the opposition's holding of a protest rally, during which
it underscored its misgivings about the economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) and called for a national referendum on the agreement.</P>
      <P>But the president said that after the pact was signed June 29, it will be passed
by the Executive Yuan, and sent to the Legislative Yuan for screening.</P>
      <P>"Rather than just criticizing it,  it is better that the opposition joins the
efforts to monitor the pact, " the president suggested.</P>
      <P>Ma made the appeal in Kaohsiung County's Jiasian where he attended the reopening
of the Jiasian bridge, a key link at the western end of the southern cross-
island highway that collapsed when Typhoon Sinlaku struck in 2008.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Presidential Office has been preparing for the signing of the
ECFA, with Vice President Vincent Siew leading the way in explaining the pact in
recent days, sources there said.</P>
      <P>Cabinet officials in agencies related to the ECFA traveled to northern, central
and southern Taiwan to host seminars Saturday.</P>
      <P>After the agreement is signed on June 29, the president will speak on the effect
of the ECFA on Taiwan's economy and its future development.</P>
      <P>He is expected to address Taiwan's global economic strategy during the post-ECFA
era, focusing on industrial transformation, foreign  investment  solicitation,
complementary  measures  for industries vulnerable to the pact, and a clearer

    <TEXT>
      <P>Thousands of protesters rallied in downtown Taipei in heavy rain Saturday to
voice their opposition to a trade pact between Taiwan and China and demand a
referendum on the agreement before it takes effect.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) heavyweights and the demonstrators
contended that the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), which is
scheduled to be signed in Chongqing, China June 29, was negotiated without
transparency and will put local small- and medium-sized businesses at risk.</P>
      <P>"A referendum will be the last line of defense for Taiwan's democracy, " said
DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government has argued that the reduced tariffs, relaxed trade
regulations and liberalized market access under the ECFA will boost Taiwan's
economy and to prevent it from being marginalized as East Asia's economy becomes
more integrated.</P>
      <P>The DPP believes, however, that Taiwan, which currently sends 42 percent of its
exports to China and places about 66 percent of its foreign direct investment
there, will become even more dependent on China's economy after the ECFA is
signed, said Julian Kuo, convener of the DPP's ECFA task force.</P>
      <P>The ECFA negotiations also lacked transparency because they were not monitored
by the Legislature or approved by the people, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>"That's why a referendum is needed to gain the people's mandate on such an
important issue that would affect the well-being of millions of people and
thousands of private businesses," Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Though items on the "early harvest" list, which was announced Thursday, will
receive immediate tariff reductions, a majority of the beneficiaries will be
large businesses rather than SMEs, said former Vice President Annette Lu, who
also expressed concerns about an influx of cheap Chinese products.</P>
      <P>Tsai said Taiwan was in danger of losing its "community-based businesses" after
the cross-Strait agreement goes into effect because Taiwan will be integrated
into China's economy as a part of its supply chain, she said.</P>
      <P>"Eventually Taiwan's economy will be a part of China's economy, " she said.
"We're here to protect Taiwan's independent rights to make our own decision and
speak for disadvantaged groups."</P>
      <P>The rally was comprised of two groups of protesters that arrived from separate
starting times before gathering at the plaza in front of the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>Heavy rain began falling just past 5 p.m. before the two groups arrived, which
may have affected turnout. The number of demonstrators appeared to be well below
100,000, the number the DPP said it would mobilize for the protest.</P>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui also attended the rally and spoke against the
agreement, saying that the ECFA is not a good policy that benefits Taiwan's
people.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's government has unveiled the country's first high-tech intelligent
system for managing bicycle convoys to help cycling groups cope with emergencies
on the road.</P>
      <P>The system, consisting of a global positioning system (GPS) and online map
technologies, automatically issues a warning to the leader of a bike convoy
equipped with smartphones when any member of the group lags far behind, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs said in a recent statement.</P>
      <P>"When you get lost or have a flat tire, all you have to do is to press a button
and you can immediately inform others of your situation," the ministry said.</P>
      <P>The system is aimed not just at enhancing the safety of cyclists but also to
help them share their fun, according to the ministry.</P>
      <P>"Bikers can use a feature to share photos or videos with their family members to
show where they are and what they have seen along the trip," the statement said.</P>
      <P>Several bicycle groups have used the system for trips of a combined length of
more than 4,000 kilometers, the ministry added.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Taiwan -- where Giant Manufacturing Co., the world's largest
bicycle manufacturer, is based -- has seen a boom in bicycle riders on holidays.</P>
      <P>Johnny Yeh, director-general of the ministry's Department of Commerce, said the
system is part of the government's efforts to boost local tourism.</P>
      <P>"We are using technology to help create a higher commercial value (for the
industry)," he said.</P>
      <P>The ministry commissioned the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) ,
Taiwan's top research institute, to develop the system.</P>
      <P>"We designed this innovative application service based on our observation  of
consumer  behavior, " Yu Shiaw-shian,  deputy general-director of the
institute's Information and Communications Research Laboratories, said in the
statement.</P>
      <P>The management system can also be used by organizers of other kinds of outdoor
activities or exhibitions, logistics companies or security companies, the
ministry noted.</P>

      <P>A greenish jade seal from China's Qing Dynasty sold for NT$482.5 million
(US$14.98 million) at an auction Saturday, more than 400 times the NT$1.09
million it fetched 25 years ago.</P>
      <P>The imperial Dragon Seal from the Qianlong Emperor period (1736-1799) was one of
304 antiques and artworks being put on auction by the Central Deposit Insurance
Corp. (CDIC) in two separate sales.</P>
      <P>The works had been in the possession of Chinfon Commercial Bank since 1985, when
the bank, which has been sold off in pieces in recent years, took them from
their debt-ridden collector, former Cathay Trust Co. Chairman Tsai Chen-nan, as
collateral.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based Yu-Jen International Art and Antique Co. was commissioned by
CDIC to organize the high-profile auction, dubbed "The Recurrence of the 25-year
Dust-laden Treasure of the Former Cathay Art Museum."</P>
      <P>Tsai, known for his passion for art, music, antiques and gourmet food,
established the museum in 1977. It was Taiwan's first private museum, but it did
not survive for long because of Tsai's financial woes.</P>
      <P>The jade seal sold for the highest price of the 55 objects put on auction
Saturday. The 54 items that found buyers sold for a total of NT$772.73 million.</P>
      <P>"Tsai purchased the seal for US$33,000 (about NT$1.09 million) in 1984, " said
Yu-Jen International general manager Chang Yu-hsia. "It sold for 442 times
higher today."</P>
      <P>According to some rumors, Dragon Seal was bought by Michael Wang, chairman of
the My Humble House Group, a business founded by Tsai's brother Tsai Chen-yang.
But Wang only confirmed that he was present at the auction and refused to
comment on the speculation.</P>
      <P>"Those who know all came for it," he said.</P>
      <P>According to Yu-Jen, the 12 cm x 12 cm Dragon Seal is believed to have been made
three years after the Qianlong Emperor took the throne in 1736.</P>
      <P>Yu-Jen is scheduled to auction off the remaining 249 objects on June 30.</P>

economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) as a major step in the
transformation of Taiwan's economy and said he will address the nation's global
economic strategy in the ECFA era on July 1.</P>
      <P>Ma is expected  to touch  on such  issues  as industrial transformation,
foreign investment  solicitation,  complementary measures for industries
vulnerable to the pact, and a clearer picture of the nation's development over
the next decade, the Presidential Office said earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that Taiwan's external economic development has been shrinking
over the past decade, while the economies of other nations has been growing
rapidly.</P>
      <P>"If the situation continues, Taiwan will be marginalized, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>When a nation's economy encounters a bottleneck, it needs fresh momentum, he
added, noting that Taiwan's wage level has not changed much over the past decade
thanks to the economy's lack of vitality.</P>
      <P>"The ECFA will provide Taiwan a big opportunity to ride on its wings and fly
high," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The president also indicated that a cross-strait investment protection agreement
should be discussed within six months after the ECFA takes effect.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during his visit of southern Taiwan to attend the opening of
a new bridge in Jiasian, Kaohsiung County. The original one collapsed when
Typhoon Sinlaku struck in 2008.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy in the first quarter grew 13.27 percent from a year earlier,
according to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The DGBAS attributed the growth to a stable global economic recovery led by
robust growth in China and other emerging Asian nations, the introduction of new
high-tech products and last year's low baseline.</P>

      <P>African students in Taiwan captivated a local audience Saturday night with
various traditional dances and performances from their countries to give local
residents a deeper appreciation for their cultures.</P>
      <P>Organized by over 50 students from Nigeria, Gambia, Swaziland, Sao Tome and
Principe, Malawi, South Africa, and Ghana, the second annual 2010 African
Cultural Jamboree was held at the National Taiwan University of Technology
(NTUT).</P>
      <P>The night was kicked off with an ensemble performance of the "Wavin' Flags, " a
blood-pumping song by Somalian musician K'naan that put the audience in high
spirits.</P>
      <P>A South African student highlighted the diversity of her heritage by singing a
medley of six songs performed in six different languages spoken in her country.</P>
      <P>Edward Sanmeh, a doctorate student from Gambia, chose a more cerebral approach,
making a power point presentation to explain to the audience  the history of the
continent,  from slavery to colonization to the rise of Africa's economy in
recent years.</P>
      <P>Dumile Dlamini, a graduate of National Kaohsiung University who has been in
Taiwan for 10 years, explained the importance of the event.</P>
      <P>"We want to hold this jamboree because we want the Taiwanese people to see
Africa from another perspective. Africa is not a third world place but a
developing country improving at a very fast pace, " said Dlamini.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwanese people,  said the students,  have incorrect impressions of
Africa, such as that it is a continent constantly at war and that people live in
trees.</P>
      <P>"The fact is, there are many good things about Africa, and the media has only
focused on the bad," said Ebrima Tunkara, 23, a member of the Gambia Elite
Program in NTUT.</P>
      <P>The audience was not only treated to a night of African musical, dance, poetry
recitals and dramas, it was also invited to sample African food, such as domoda
and benchin.</P>
      <P>The students also put on a fashion show showcasing clothing crafted by aspiring
young designers from Swaziland.</P>
      <P>Among the distinguished guests attending the event included Ministry  of Foreign
Affairs  Department  of African  Affairs Director-general Chen Shih-liang,
Gambian ambassador Alhaji Ebrima N.H.  Jarjou,  and diplomatic  personnel  from

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Can old running gags be convincing?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/27/10  14:32:22
(June 27, 2010)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Heavyweights  and supporters  of the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) took to the streets Saturday in protest against an imminent cross-strait
trade pact and to demand a referendum on the agreement before it takes effect.</P>
      <P>The DPP chose to play two old running gags -- opposing a "one-China market" and
calling for a referendum on the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
, which is scheduled to be signed on June 29.</P>
      <P>We do not see much hope of the DPP convincing the Taiwan people with these tired
old talking points. It depends on the Legislature, rather  than demonstrators,
to lower the vote threshold  for referendums which might give the bid for this
one a chance at success. As for the "anti-one China market" slogan, it proved to
be a failure two years ago in the last presidential election.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, we do not see that the DPP has any convincing reasons to oppose the
ECFA, as Taiwanese businessmen would not be willing to confine themselves  to
Taiwan amid mounting global competition and the ECFA is set to revitalize
Taiwan's industrial and business  sectors,  particularly  the  small  and
medium-sized enterprises.</P>
      <P>While opposing the ECFA simply for opposition sake, the DPP is intentionally
ignoring the fact that under the "early harvest" list, many of Taiwan's
traditional manufacturing  industries will be entitled to immediate tariff
reductions and eventually zero tariffs on their exports to China in three years,
which will make them significantly more competitive in the region.</P>
      <P>The DPP has also been pretending that it is not aware that President Ma Ying-
jeou's administration has not only succeeded in barring China agricultural
products from entering Taiwan, but has also managed to gain access to the huge
Chinese market for 18 Taiwan agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Su Huan-chih, the incumbent DPP Tainan County magistrate who has not been
nominated by the DPP to run in the Tainan municipality mayoral election, was
absent from Saturday's DPP rally.</P>
      <P>Su said on his blog that strict adherence to a stance of ignoring the Chinese
market in the long term would only marginalize Taiwan further and make it
weaker. "Taiwan would be in great danger if its political leaders act
foolhardily and like small-town folk," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Effects of ECFA on year-end mayoral elections</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/27/10  14:51:39
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tens of thousands of opposition party supporters took to the streets in Taipei
Saturday to protest a soon-to-be-signed trade agreement with China that they
fear will undermine Taiwan's sovereign status and hurt its economy.</P>
      <P>Addressing the rally in front of the Presidential Office, opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen urged the public to cast a no-
confidence vote in the year-end mayoral elections in five special municipalities
to show their opposition to the cross-strait economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) that will be signed in Chongqing, China June 29.</P>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui also led the demonstrators in chanting anti-ECFA
slogans and urged the public to help the DPP secure all five mayoral seats up
for grabs in the pivotal Nov. 27 elections.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the DPP-organized protest march, President Ma Ying-jeou said it
would be more conducive to national development if the opposition camp joined
the efforts to closely and rationally monitor the implementation of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Su Tseng-chang, the DPP candidate for Taipei mayor in the November election,
said at Saturday's rally that the ECFA panders to big corporations at the
expense of small and medium-size enterprises and would eventually lead to a
further widening of the wealth gap in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, Taiwan will open its doors to some of China's service
industries, which Su said could affect the job prospects of Taipei residents in
the long run because over 80 percent of the city's employed population is
working in the service sector.</P>
      <P>In response, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, who is seeking a second term,  ridiculed
Su as lacking knowledge of Taipei's economic structure and having no confidence
in its strength.</P>
      <P>According to Hau, Su is aware of the positive effects the ECFA will have on
Taipei City but dares not voice support for the pact for fear of alienating die-
hard pro-independence voters.</P>
      <P>Hau further said Taipei is not afraid of competition but rather is afraid of
lack of progress. "Su's lack of confidence in the city's development potential
renders him incapable of leading the city to become a world-class metropolis,"
Hau contended. (June 27, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>For the first time since he announced his candidacy for Taipei City mayor
earlier this year, Su expressed open opposition to the ECFA Saturday.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taipei is part of Taiwan, Su said it is unlikely that the city by
itself would benefit from a policy initiative that would hurt Taiwan as a whole.</P>
      <P>The adverse effects of the ECFA will gradually spread from the agricultural and
industrial sectors to the service sector, and Taipei will eventually be affected
because service industries form the backbone of the city's economy, he said.</P>
      <P>In contrast, incumbent Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said the ECFA will contribute
to Taipei City's technology, cultural and filmmaking industries.</P>
      <P>"Many local filmmakers told me at the opening of the 2010 Taipei Film Festival
that the ECFA will help Taiwan tap into the vast Chinese movie market, Hau said
at a farm produce trade fair Saturday. (June 27, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Former President Lee said at Saturday's protest rally that the ECFA would
incorporate Taiwanese businesses into China's industrial chain step by step and
make Taiwan's economy part of China's, which would serve China's long-term goal
of bringing Taiwan under its control.</P>
      <P>Lee urged all opposition supporters to unite to ensure that the DPP  candidates
win the mayoral  elections  in five  special municipalities -- Taipei, Xinbei,
Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Many of the DPP politicians who spoke at the rally said that Taiwan may gain
short-term benefits from tariff cuts under the ECFA, but that a number of local
factories may be forced to shut down within a few years as a result of the ECFA-
prescribed market opening and a flood of cheap Chinese imports.</P>
      <P>After the ECFA is signed, China will definitely increase the pressure on Taiwan
to start political talks on sensitive issues such as the establishment of a
military confidence building mechanism and signing of a peace agreement, which
would lead to eventual annexation of Taiwan, they warned. (June 27, 2010).</P>

      <P>There were fewer marriages in Taiwan last year compared to 2008 and the average
age of people getting married for the first time was higher than in previous
years, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Some 116,392 marriages were recorded in Taiwan in 2009, a decline of 32,033 from
2008, according to an MOI report.</P>
      <P>The ministry attributed the decline mainly to the global economic downturn, a
high unemployment rate in Taiwan and the fact that 2009 was believed to be a "ku
luan nien, " or "lonely phoenix year."</P>
      <P>It is a superstition in Taiwan that the chances of breakup are higher in certain
years, which are known as "lonely phoenix years."</P>
      <P>According to the MOI report, the number of first-time spouses in 2009 was around
200,000, which was the lowest figure in 40 years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the average age of first-time husbands was 31.6 in 2009, while for
the first-time brides it was 28.9, which represented a rise of 0.5 years in both
cases from the previous year, according to the MOI report.</P>
      <P>The report also shows that 37 percent, or 35,280, of the men who got married
last year were between the ages of 30 and 34, while 43.75 percent, or 43,275, of
the women were between 25 and 29.</P>
      <P>Of the total number of new marriages recorded last year, 18.6 percent involved
one foreign spouse or one from China, Hong Kong or Macau, the report stated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Students design 'breakup gifts' to encourage positive endings</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Giving a creative gift to a soon-to-be ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend might help
ease the awkwardness of a pending breakup, according to a group of Taiwanese
college students.</P>
      <P>With the departure of new graduates from school campuses at the end of the
semester, a number of breakups can be expected, one student said.</P>
      <P>"June is usually a time when many student couples break up because new graduates
take different paths in life," Weng Shih-han, a National Taiwan University
student, told the Central News Agency recently.</P>
      <P>As a result, one of Weng's teachers Jerry Hsia, came up with the idea of asking
Weng and her classmates in the art design and marketing class to use their
creativity to come up with "breakup gifts."</P>
      <P>"My idea caught them be surprise as they were probably thinking 'Who would give
a gift to someone they're about to break up with, '" Hsia said.</P>
      <P>Initially, the students proposed gifts that would help people to vent anger --
items such as darts to be thrown at photos, Hsia said.</P>
      <P>However, the professor asked the students to consider the idea of a positive
ending to love relationships.</P>
      <P>"Breakups are often negative and unpleasant and sometimes they can be violent, "
he said. "But we can actually deal with our negative feelings from a positive
perspective."</P>
      <P>He asked his students to examine why couples should exchange gifts only when the
relationship is very good.</P>
      <P>"Why can't you give a gift as form of comfort when you are breaking up with each
other?" he asked the students.</P>
      <P>One group of students later designed black-and-white T-shirts bearing slogans
such as "Now available, " "I'm a good man" and other such messages to boost the
image of the wearer.</P>
      <P>"Giving this kind of T-shirt as a breakup gift is a way of telling your
boyfriend or girlfriend that you're do not feel awkward in the relationship and
you hope you hope they don't either, " said Phil Hu, one of the class students.</P>
      <P>Another group of students came up with "breakup chocolates" of different
flavors, each of which represents a different emotion at different stages of a
breakup.</P>
      <P>"The first is a pepper chocolate that represents the pain of a breakup, " said
one of the students, Wu Pan. "The second is a bitter coffee chocolate, and the
third is a wine chocolate that symbolizes the stage of being relaxed and
comfortable with the breakup."</P>
      <P>According to Pan, the other flavors are fruit, which is sweet and acidic at the
same time and means being single is enjoyable, while the popping candy chocolate
signals excitement over a new start.</P>
      <P>Some of the other students designed special face tissue wipes bearing slogans
such as "You cry, I die."</P>
      <P>The students are now working to commercialize their gift designs, their
professor said.</P>
      <P>"A company that is producing a Chinese-language movie about breakups has
contacted the students and will allow them to sell their products at the film
premiere," he said.</P>
      <P>People have also placed online orders for dozens of T-shirts on a blog site
created by the students, Hsia added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a noted tissue paper manufacturer in Taiwan has asked the students to
submit a proposal for future collaboration, he said.</P>
      <P>"I think these opportunities show that there is actually demand for such
products, " he said. "This also suggests that the idea of an amicable breakup
might be acceptable to the public."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan market for information security software forecast to grow</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 27 (CNA)
06/27/10  17:02:58
(By Tien Yu-pin and Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An international information consultancy firm has forecast that Taiwan's
software market for information security and enterprise resource management
products will grow this year.</P>
      <P>International Data Corporation said in a report that Taiwan's information
security market will grow by 7.5 percent this year to NT$1.74 billion (US$54.03
million).</P>
      <P>After showing shrinkage for 18 months, the information security market began to
recover in the second half of last year, as the private and public sectors
resumed their ordinary spending in this regard, the report stated.</P>
      <P>With the enactment of the Personal Information Protection Act, which specifies
tighter protection of personal information, this market is set to expand at a
rapid pace seldom seen before, according to the corporation.</P>
      <P>Local enterprises have been trying to beef up information security in the last
few years but their efforts have been restricted by tight budgets, and some of
their investments in this field have been put on hold.</P>
      <P>However, they will spend more to tighten security of their information data
systems, as the new act imposes heavy civil liability and criminal punishment on
owners of enterprises that allow leakage of information, the International Data
Corporation said.</P>
      <P>This will benefit software, hardware and service suppliers, the report forecast.</P>
      <P>The corporation  also predicted an increase in demand for enterprise resource
management software over the next few years.</P>
      <P>As a result, the market for this software is expected to grow by 8.9 percent
annually from 2010 to 2014, according to the corporation.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons the corporation gave for its forecast was the fact that some
Taiwan-made software will have to be updated when the Republic of China (ROC)
enters its 100th year in 2011, to make the change from two digits to three in
the display of dates on the ROC calendar.</P>
      <P>This will be especially relevant among state-run business and small and medium-
sized enterprises, the report indicated.</P>
      <P>Another factor is that the country is poised to bring its financial reporting
system for public listed companies in line with international practices in 2013
and expand the policy to all companies by 2015.</P>
      <P>This will force local business to alter their financial booking systems before
2015 and thereby boost demand for resource management software, the corporation
predicted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan is drafting measures to encourage Taiwanese investors abroad,
particularly those in China, to return home.</P>
      <P>Among the incentives being considered is the establishment of certain special
economic zones where companies will be allowed easier terms in the employment of
foreign workers to help reduce production costs.</P>
      <P>This proposal is unsuitable and obsolete. With its limited natural resources and
land acreage, Taiwan can no longer afford to lure investors in labor-intensive
industries by easing restrictions on the employment of foreign workers. In light
of its progress in technological development over the decades, Taiwan should now
focus on high value-added industries and services.</P>
      <P>The decisions to reduce the corporate income tax rate to 17 percent and to end
tax breaks for selected industries under the newly passed  Industrial
Innovation  Act  reflect  the  government's understanding  that market forces,
rather  than administrative intervention, are more effective in setting the
course of industrial and economic development.</P>
      <P>How can the government now consider using tied old strategies such as creating
special economic zones or using cheap foreign labor to bolster our economic
development?</P>
      <P>At a time when China no longer wants to use cheap labor as its main incentive to
woo foreign investors, our government should some show guts and far-sightedness
by formulating new development plans and strategies. Ideas such as setting up
special economic zones should be allowed to recede into history and never be
raised again. (June 27, 2010).</P>

      <P>A total of 268 second-generation overseas Taiwanese from 18 countries around the
world will start internships at some 50 institution and companies around Taiwan
Tuesday to enable them to gain a deeper understanding and greater recognition of
Taiwan, the National Science Council (NSC) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The eight-week Taiwan Tech Trek 2010 internship program will open formally at
Tamkang University in Danshuei, Taipei County, with the sponsorship of the NSC
and many other public agencies, the NSC said.</P>
      <P>The interns will participate in a group orientation week at Tamkang University
June 29-July 3 before dispersing to designated companies throughout Taiwan for
seven weeks of internship, from July 5 to Aug. 21, according to the NSC.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Tech Trek is part of the government's efforts to recruit a new generation
of overseas Taiwanese graduates who, it is hoped, will eventually help to
improve Taiwan's global competitiveness. The program provides opportunities  for
overseas  Taiwanese  youths interested in hands-on internships or research
experience in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The NSC said that the Taiwan Teck Trek internship program has become
increasingly popular among overseas Taiwanese youths since its inception in
2005.</P>
      <P>A total of 841 young Taiwanese applied for the 268 internship openings this
year, the NSC said. In the period 2005-2009, the number of participants was more
than 1,100, it added.</P>
      <P>Tina Fan, who did an internship at CECI Engineering Consultants in Taipei and
has now graduated, has returned to Taiwan from the U.S. and is now working as a
civil engineer at the same company, the NSC said.</P>
      <P>The NSC said it provides NT$40,000 (US$1,250) as subsidies for the training of

    <HEADLINE>Water supply will remain stable over the next few months: official</HEADLINE>

      <P>The water supply throughout Taiwan for household and industrial use is expected
to remain stable at least until the end of October, Wu Yueh-hsi, director-
general of the Water Resources Agency, said Sunday.</P>
      <P>After October, if the rainfall amounts to a minimum of 40 percent of the average
for the same period over past few years, then an adequate water supply would be
ensured to the end of December, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The levels in the country's three major reservoirs have risen significantly as a
result of the recent plum rains, which usually fall between late May and mid
June, he said.</P>
      <P>Precipitation levels at Tsengwen and Wushantou reservoirs in southern Taiwan
were about 79 percent of the average for the same period over past few years,
according to Wu.</P>
      <P>At Nanhua Reservoir it was 64 percent of the average over the past few years, he
added.</P>
      <P>The monsoon rains have also brought enough water for irrigation of the second
rice crop this year in the southern region, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Although the drought in southern Taiwan has ended, climate change could pose
potential risks to a stable water supply, and water conservation measures would
be needed to ensure a reliable water supply in the future, he said.</P>
      <P>While stressing the importance of dealing with droughts, Wu also urged
government agencies and the general public to prepare for the upcoming typhoon
season to avoid flood damage.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Central Weather Bureau issued heavy rain warnings for northern,
northeastern and eastern areas of Taiwan Sunday, which is part of a system of
afternoon thunder showers that are common in summer in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Eric Liluan Chu, one the Kuomintang's mayoral candidates for the November
elections, went on the campaign trail Sunday in Pingsi township, Taipei County,
which will be upgraded to a municipality called Xinbei City later this year.</P>
      <P>Chu traveled by train from Rueifang to Shuangsi village in Pingsi, rubbing
shoulders with the many weekend passengers who were heading to the scenic areas
of Pingsi, Houtung and Fulong beach.</P>
      <P>He was greeted at the railway station by many supporters and he walked along the
street in front of the station, shaking hands with shopkeepers.</P>
      <P>From the station, Chu rode an electric scooter to a vegetable garden where he
planted a row of green onions to show his solidarity with farmers.</P>
      <P>The candidate, who hold a doctorate degree in accounting from New York
University and has served as deputy premier and magistrate of Taoyuan County,
planted the green onions expertly, earning the praise of the garden's owner.</P>
      <P>Chu said he had planted onions and other vegetables before. Water spinach is
easy to grow as it thrives in almost any kind of soil, but spinach needs a lot
of care, he told the accompanying group of reporters.</P>
      <P>Noting that many people in Taiwan are fond of playing an online farming game,
Chu said toiling on a real farm is much more interesting, as it allows people
the fun of sowing and harvesting, and instills in them concern for the land.</P>
      <P>He lauded the scenery from Rueifang to Pingsi and said that if he is elected
mayor of Xinbei City, he will work out a plan to boost tourism in the
surrounding villages.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a demonstration in Taipei City Saturday that was organized by the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to protest against the
government's plan to sign a trade pact with China, Chu said it is an example of
how economic issues can be politicized.</P>
      <P>"Economic issues should be viewed in an economic context, and political issues
in a political context," said Chu.</P>
      <P>The DPP has been appealing to the public to vote against the trade pact by
rejecting the KMT candidates  in the Nov.  27 municipality elections.</P>
      <P>Chu is competing against DPP chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen in Xinbei City.</P>

      <P>Taiwan residents traveling abroad, particularly to China and Southeast Asia,
should take precautions against disease outbreaks in their travel destinations,
an official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director-general of the Centers for Disease Control under the
Department of Health, made the appeal at the start of the peak overseas travel
season as schools are about to close for the summer break.</P>
      <P>Popular destinations for families, such as Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand, tend
to report more serious dengue fever outbreaks in summer, Lin said.</P>
      <P>This year, measles outbreaks have been reported in China and several Southeast
Asian countries, such as Vietnam, the Philippines and Singapore, he noted.</P>
      <P>The reports of measles in Beijing have continued, Lin said, urging parents to
make sure their children are properly immunized before taking them on visits to
the Chinese capital.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that people seek travel medicine services or take preventive
medication before embarking on overseas travel.</P>
      <P>While abroad, travelers should pay attention to personal hygiene and proper
diets, Lin suggested.</P>
      <P>Upon return to Taiwan, travelers who fall ill or develop symptoms of diseases
should seek medical care and inform their attending physicians of their travel

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will stand a far better chance of becoming an Asia-Pacific trade hub and
an operation center for Taiwanese business groups after a wide-ranging trade
pact is signed with China later this week, a senior negotiator said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The imminent  cross-strait  economic cooperation  framework agreement (ECFA)
will offer us fair opportunity to compete with member states of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the vast Chinese market, which will make
it much easier for us to transform into a regional trade hub, " said Straits
Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung.</P>
      <P>"Our geographical proximity to China, the cultural similarities across the
strait, our huge investments there and our government's operational efficiency
will complement the ECFA and help us in our quest to develop as a regional trade
hub and operation center, " said the country's top negotiator with China.</P>
      <P>Chiang is scheduled to depart for Chongqing, China Monday to meet with his
Chinese counterpart  Chen Yunlin,  president  of the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), for the fifth round of high-level cross-
strait talks since President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>Chiang said at a pre-departure news conference that the main agenda for the
upcoming meeting will be the signing Tuesday of the ECFA,  which is focused  on
mutual tariff reductions  and an intellectual property rights protection
agreement.</P>
      <P>The two sides have also agreed that within six months after the ECFA takes
effect, they will start follow-up talks on merchandise and service trade and
investment protection, Chiang said. Those talks may lead to the inclusion of
more items for tariff concessions and easier market access terms, he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that investment, consumption and foreign trade form the backbone of a
country's economy, Chiang said upgrading Taiwan's export competitiveness is
crucial to its well-being because its economic growth is largely reliant on
export trade.</P>
      <P>Now that China has emerged as Taiwan's top export market and its top overseas
investment destination, Chiang said, Taiwan should cash in on the tariff cuts
offered under the ECFA to hone its competitive edge in order to sustain its
economic growth and maintain its market niche worldwide.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official  intermediary  bodies established by Taiwan
and China, respectively, to handle exchanges in the absence of official ties.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Su Jia-chyuan, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) mayoral
candidate in the municipality of Taichung City, officially launched his campaign
office in that central Taiwan city Sunday.</P>
      <P>He promised to conduct an honest campaign to win support by projecting his
visions for the city rather than by trying to belittle his opponent.</P>
      <P>He expressed gratitude to DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, who joined him in
unveiling a name plaque for the office, saying that it was very kind of Tsai to
take time off from her own campaign for mayor of Xinbei City to attend the
opening of his campaign office.</P>
      <P>Su, a former DPP secretary-general, vowed to do his best to win the election and
lead the central Taiwan city to compete with Xinbei City, which he said
hopefully will be led by Tsai.</P>
      <P>Former Government Information Office Minister Lin Chia-lung, who agreed to serve
as Su's campaign manager after an unsuccessful bid for his party's nomination in
Taichung, said at the opening that Tsai did a great job in the selection process
because Su is the party's best chance of winning the election.</P>
      <P>Tsai praised Lin as a promising DPP star who puts the interests of the party
before his own. With Lin's help, Su's victory is assured, she said.</P>
      <P>She said that a scandal which exposed a close association between senior police
officers and gangsters in Taichung cast a cloud over the city, but that Su, a
former interior minister and Pingtung County magistrate, would work to ensure
the safety of life in the city.</P>
      <P>In response, Su said that when he was magistrate of Pingtung County, he kept
close tabs on the social order situation there and was always informed within
one hour of any incidents, not after four days.</P>
      <P>He was referring the fact that his Kuomintang rival in the mayoral race, the
incumbent Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, was not aware of the extent of the recent
scandal until four days after it erupted.</P>
      <P>Although there are various DPP factions in Taichung, they have all rallied
behind his candidacy, Su said. He promised to forbid his aides from engaging in
any personal character attacks during the campaign.</P>
      <P>Also on Sunday, Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng who was elected in Kaohsiung
County, promised to give full support to the Kuomintang mayoral candidate in
that southern county, Huang Chao-shun.</P>
      <P>However, Wang said he cannot serve as Huang's campaign manager because of his
demanding job in the legislature.</P>
      <P>"I can only help her to campaign in Kaohsiung on weekends, therefore, I'd rather
to serve as the nominal director of her campaign office." Wang said.</P>
      <P>Although the incumbent Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu is considered the favorite in
the race, Wang said Huang has chance because the KMT won three of the four
legislative seats in Kaohsiung County two years ago.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has honored his promise of protecting Taiwan's interests
by not opening Taiwan to any additional Chinese goods since taking office,
Premier Wu Den-yih said Sunday.</P>
      <P>This is quite an achievement considering that former President Lee Teng-hui had
approved the importation of 479 Chinese items, while former President Chen Shui-
bian had approved 936, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu made the comments in response to the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)
remarks during a demonstration in Taipei Saturday that Ma has compromised
Taiwan's interests by agreeing to sign a trade pact with China, which the DPP
said would open Taiwan wider to Chinese goods.</P>
      <P>Lee, who was at the demonstration, called on the public to reject President Ma
in order to protect Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Wu said, the performance of the president should be assessed on the
basis of his integrity and competence, his ability to ensure peace in the Taiwan
Strait and national security, and his ability to revive the economy.</P>
      <P>The premier said Taiwan's negotiations with China on the economic cooperation
framework agreement were not perfect but "have succeeded in protecting the
interests of the country by not allowing the importation of Chinese labor or any
additional Chinese goods, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>"Ma has safeguarded the country's interests,  but his two predecessors opened
the doors to Chinese goods, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan opened its market to selected Chinese goods during the administrations of
Ma's two predecessors mainly to facilitate its bid to join the World Trade
Organization.</P>

never regards anything as beneath his notice or as unworthy of serious and
careful attention -- that is what is meant by being dignified without being
supercilious."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Investment pact high on post-ECFA agenda</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/28/10  11:05:19
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations across the Taiwan Strait will enter a new era following the signing of
a wide-ranging  economic cooperation  framework agreement (ECFA) and an
intellectual property rights (IPR) protection agreement in Chongqing, China
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>On the eve of his departure for the southwestern Chinese city for the signing of
the two key pacts, Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kun
said Sunday that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will start talks on a number
of new trade accords within six months after the ECFA takes effect.</P>
      <P>A bilateral investment protection agreement is most likely to be signed first,
Chiang predicted.</P>
      <P>Sources familiar with cross-strait affairs said the Taiwan government also hopes
to sign an accord on medical exchanges and cooperation in the next round of
talks.</P>
      <P>For its part, China reportedly will propose negotiations for the two quasi-
official  intermediary organizations --  SEF and the Beijing-based Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) -- to each set up offices on the
other side.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Chiang said at a pre-departure news conference that three agreements on
merchandise trade,  service trade and investment protection are high on the
agenda for talks after the ECFA is concluded.</P>
      <P>As the issues to be covered in the investment protection pact are less
contentious, that agreement may be signed in the next round of high-level cross-
strait meetings.</P>
      <P>Once the agreement is sealed, a mechanism will be forged to resolve investment
disputes by means of arbitration, mediation or litigation, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, many foreign business groups are
interested in collaborating with Taiwanese companies to tap into the Chinese
market, but the lack of a cross-strait investment protection agreement has
dampened their enthusiasm. Conditions will become more suitable for such
cooperation if an investment protection pact is signed, the officials said.
(June 28, 2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>The cross-strait IPR agreement to be signed along with the ECFA Tuesday will be
more substantive than the ones China has signed with other countries because the
pact will give Taiwanese patent applicants priority and plant variety rights,
senior IPR officials said.</P>
      <P>The right of priority means that when Taiwan manufacturers file for patent or
trademark applications in Taiwan, they will be given priority patent or
trademark protection in China for up to one year. It will benefit local high-
tech companies, particularly those in the cell phone and LCD panel display
industries, said Wang Mei-hua, director-general of the Intellectual Property
Office under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The new IPR pact will also offer better protection for local plant breeders who
will enjoy cross-strait plant variety rights once they obtain certification in
Taiwan for any new varieties they may develop.</P>
      <P>Under the new agreement, the two sides will also establish a collaborative
mechanism to deal with trademark disputes such as those involving Taiwanese
brands Chihshang Rice and Gukeng Coffee that were registered in China by Chinese
applicants.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, domestic trademark, patent and variety laws must be revised
to facilitate implementation of the new cross-strait IPR pact. (June 28, 2010).</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Government sources said the ECFA will establish a new framework for cross-strait
economic interaction. It contains two clauses that will offer a 10-year grace
period for 17 of Taiwan's less competitive industries to adapt to market
liberalization and will allow Taiwan to take trade disputes to the World Trade
Organization for settlement, they said.</P>
      <P>The sources further said Taiwan will not propose cross-strait talks on a
contentious agreement on avoidance of double taxation in the foreseeable future
because there is still no consensus between the two sides on some key points.
(June 28, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) will file a new application with
the Central Election Commission (CEC) Wednesday --</P>
      <P>the day after the ECFA is signed-- to hold a national referendum on the pact.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, the Executive Yuan's Referendum Review Commission rejected
an ECFA referendum initiative by the party. But TSU Secretary-General Lin Chih-
jia said Sunday the party will revise its wording this time around to make it
easier to obtain approval for the initiative.</P>
      <P>"After the signing of the ECFA, the social situation will change," Lin said.
"While some people support the pact, others oppose. In a democratic society like
Taiwan, a national referendum should be held to allow people to decide on the
pact."</P>
      <P>The government does not have the right to reject the initiative, he contended.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with China, Chiang Pin-kung, departed for Chongqing,
China Monday for a fifth round of high-level cross-strait talks that is expected
to be concluded with the signing of a landmark cross-strait trade pact.</P>
      <P>Chiang,  chairman  of the quasi-official  Straits  Exchange Foundation (SEF), is
expected to sign the agreement, which focuses on tariff concessions, with his
Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin, president of Beijing's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) and an intellectual property
rights (IPR) protection agreement are at the top of the meeting's  agenda,
Chiang said at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport prior to his departure.</P>
      <P>Also on the agenda is a review of the success and progress of the 12 agreements
that Taiwan and China have signed since 2008 to bring about closer exchanges
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The meeting will also discuss plans for the further development of cross-strait
relations after the ECFA is concluded, in areas such as commodity  trade and
service  trade agreements,  investment guarantees for Taiwanese businesses in
China, and cultural, media, educational, medical and health exchanges, Chiang
said.</P>
      <P>On the imminent signing of the ECFA, Chiang said that the trade pact is one of
give and take, in which both sides will have gains and losses, advantages and
disadvantages.</P>
      <P>"With the ECFA, we are ushering in a new era of negotiations based on mutual
trust," he said.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, Taiwanese businesses have been facing "unfair competition"
in the world market since China joined the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations to form a powerful regional trade bloc called the ASEAN Plus One, on
Jan. 1 this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese businesses are not daunted by fair competition, but are indeed afraid
of "unfair competition," he said.</P>
      <P>"The ECFA will offer us a fair opportunity to compete with ASEAN members in the
vast Chinese market, which will make it much easier for us to transform into a
regional trade hub," Chiang reiterated.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's under-18 women's national basketball team finished third in the
preliminary round of the 2010 International Basketball Federation (FIBA) Asia
U-18 Championship for Women in Thailand and is scheduled to meet China later
Monday in the semifinals.</P>
      <P>Opening the tournament with a three-game winning streak, Taiwan lost to China,
55-106, and to Japan, 62-67, in the last two games. The Taiwan team finished
with three wins and two losses in the six-team single round-robin preliminary
round, behind defending champions Japan (5-0) and China (4-1) . South Korea
squeezed into the final four with two wins and three losses.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is scheduled to meet China 8 p.m. Monday, Taiwan time, while Japan will
take on South Korea in the other semifinal game.</P>
      <P>The biennial tournament, which is being held in Surat Thani, Thailand, from June
23-30, serves as a qualifying event for the FIBA World U19 Championship for
Women to be held in Chile next year. The top three teams in the tournament will
represent Asia in Chile.</P>
      <P>The tourney is divided into two six-team levels -- the elite Level I and the
qualifying Level II. The teams will play all the other teams in their group,
with the top four in Level I qualifying for the semifinals, while winners in
Level II will play the bottom two in Level I for a chance to enter the Level I
competition in the future.</P>
      <P>Malaysia (1-4) and Kazakhstan (0-5) failed to advance to the semifinal round in
the Level I. Host Thailand (5-0) and India (4-1) emerged as the top two teams in
the Level II.</P>
      <P>The competition had been dominated by China and South Korea before Japan upset
China to capture the gold medal for the first time in 2008. Taiwan has won
silver and bronze in the competition, but never gold. China has won 11 U18 Asian
titles, while South Korea has won seven.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: DPP should be able to hold rational dialogues</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>After the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>staged a demonstration in Taipei Saturday to protest against a proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, the fact remains that if the
largest opposition party in the country wants to shoulder more responsibility
for Taiwan's future, it should hold rational dialogue with the whole of
Taiwanese society rather than just shout slogans.</P>
      <P>Under the ECFA, trade, economic exchanges and cooperation between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait will expand on an unprecedented scale.</P>
      <P>As most Taiwanese people appear to support positive cross-strait interaction,
the DPP should refrain from spouting sensational rhetoric, threatening people
with the irrational argument that Taiwan will be annexed by China if the trade
pact is signed.</P>
      <P>These threats do not add anything to rational debate on the ECFA issue, nor do
they prove the DPP's ability to initiate a cross-strait policy that benefits
Taiwan, which, unlike most other countries, has only a little over 20 diplomatic
allies in the international community.</P>
      <P>The DPP should also be able to hold dialogue with China -- which is an emerging
power capable of affecting Taiwan's development in diplomatic, economic and
military terms -- as well as holding dialogues with the international community
to seek exchanges with different parties as part of efforts to expand Taiwan's
foreign relations. (June 28, 2010).</P>

      <P>A "driving drinkers home" (DDH) service initiated by the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) is scheduled to be launched islandwide
Tuesday in an effort to stop drunk people from getting behind the wheels of
their cars.</P>
      <P>The MOTC organized the DDH service drive in collaboration with the 7-Eleven
convenience store chain and the Taiwan Taxi Co.</P>
      <P>Users of the service can ask for a DDH connection at any of 7-Eleven's 4,800
stores around the country via the convenience store's ibon website, into which
they can key in their mobile phone number.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan Taxi Co. driver will then arrive within 10 minutes to drive the
drinker's own car to an appointed location, for a fee of NT$1,000 for a journey
of 10 km or less, according to Taiwan Taxi Co.</P>
      <P>The fee will be higher if the journey is longer than 10 km, the taxi company
said.</P>
      <P>The MOTC said that although cases of drunken driving nationwide declined from
705 in 2006 to 387 in 2008, drunken driving remains one of the major reasons
behind fatal car accidents in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ibon DDH service can help get drinkers and their cars home safely and it is
hoped the service will lead to a significant reduction in the number of car
accidents, MOTC officials said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A landmark cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) to be
signed Tuesday in Chongqing, China, offers Taiwan a golden opportunity to
restructure its economy and sharpen its competitive edge to excel in the global
market.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to help mitigate Taiwan's internal dispute on the pact and
facilitate an early conclusion of the agreement, China has offered sweet tariff
terms for a number of Taiwanese products and services entering its market and
has asked for much less in return.</P>
      <P>An urgent task for the government in the post-ECFA era is to collaborate  with
the private sector to draft new development strategies with new vision.</P>
      <P>With China agreeing to offer zero-tariff treatment for 18 Taiwanese agricultural
and fishery items, as well as products in 17 less competitive  industries,  the
government  should work out complementary measures to help those sectors find a
new lease on life in China.</P>
      <P>The government should also organize a competent negotiating team in preparation
for future rounds of talks with China after the ECFA takes effect. As Taiwan
still unilaterally bars entry of a large number of Chinese products and services
-- in violation of World Trade Organization regulations -- China will definitely
pressure Taiwan to open its market  post-ECFA.  We badly need capable
negotiators to defend our national interests.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the government should shift the focus of economic development to the
high added value realm by encouraging innovation, branding  and integration
services for middle-  and up-stream industries. (June 28, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-owned Land Bank of Taiwan said Monday it is seeking China's approval
to set up a branch in Shanghai, with an eye to attracting clients among the many
Taiwanese investors in the city.</P>
      <P>The bank said it filed an application with the Shanghai bureau of the China
Banking Regulatory Commission on June 25, the day after Taiwan's Financial
Supervisory Commission (FSC) gave the green light for the bank to open a
Shanghai branch.</P>
      <P>Lank Bank of Taiwan said it has had a representative office in Shanghai for
seven years and is eager to upgrade to a branch there.</P>
      <P>"We have to act very quickly -- we are eager to take advantage of the
preferential status under a Taiwan-China pact to seize business opportunities in
China," the bank told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>One of Land Bank's representatives in Shanghai, Kuo Chnag-lung, said the
timetable is to open the Shanghai branch by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China have each drawn up a list of "early harvest" businesses that
will be granted tariff concessions and easier market access under an imminent
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Financial services is one of the 539 businesses on Taiwan's early harvest list.
Under the agreement, Taiwanese banks will be allowed to conduct lending business
with the Chinese yuan as the currency, if the banks post profit in the first
year of operations in China.</P>
      <P>"Shanghai has many Taiwanese investors. If the bank can serve them by supplying
loans in Chinese yuan and help them expand, the lending business in the city
will be very promising," the bank said.</P>
      <P>Land Bank is expected to meet the terms to issue loans in the Chinese yuan by
2012, he said.</P>
      <P>The bank said it is seeking a location for the Shanghai branch, while selecting
and relocating employees from Taiwan to the Chinese city.</P>
      <P>It is also planning to open branches in Chongqing and Shenyang to help Taiwanese
investors there raise funds, it said.</P>
      <P>Apart from Land Bank, The FSC has also given approval for First Bank, Taiwan
Cooperative Bank and Chang Hwa Bank to open branches in China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan dismissed criticism
Monday that a landmark cross-Taiwan Strait trade pact will benefit conglomerates
only, saying that the agreement will benefit small-  and medium-sized  companies
and traditional industries as well.</P>
      <P>The "early harvest" lists of goods and services that will enjoy preferential
tariff treatment  under the economic  cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
will bring substantial  demand for industries such as automobiles and machine
tools, according to Lai.</P>
      <P>She predicted that the machine tool industry will see a 20 percent growth in
orders and a 10 percent increase in employment every year.</P>
      <P>"Saying that signing the ECFA will only benefit conglomerates is irrational and
untrue, " Lai said at the Taoyuan Taiwan International Airport after seeing off
Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, Taiwan's top negotiator
with China, upon his departure for Chongqing, China, for a meeting with his
Chinese counterpart, Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
President Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>According to the finalized "early harvest" lists, a total of 539 Taiwanese
products and services will be given tariff cuts or improved market access under
the ECFA, more than double the 267 products and services included on China's
list.</P>
      <P>Asked about an ECFA referendum demanded by the opposition parties but rejected
by the government, Lai said only that the right to referendum is a right of the
people in a democratic country and that the government will respect any legal
referendum result.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The central bank's unexpected move June 24 to raise its benchmark interest rate
for the first time since 2008 surprised many foreign fund managers who had
anticipated that the bank would not take the measure before its U.S. counterpart
did so.</P>
      <P>The hike on the discount rate for 10-day loans to commercial banks to 1.375
percent from a record low 1.25 percent is regarded as a wise measure formed out
of thoughtful calculation based on Taiwan's current economic condition.</P>
      <P>Signs suggest that Taiwan has rebounded from the recession, including that the
overall light indicator of the government's economic rating system flashed red
-- suggesting an overheated economy -- for the fourth consecutive month in
April.</P>
      <P>In addition, the industrial production index in May surged to 124.42, marking a
historic high for the third consecutive month. The manufacturing output index in
May also showed record growth to 127.63 for the third consecutive month.</P>
      <P>Heated trading in the wholesale, retail and construction sectors all show that
economic development is enjoying steady growth -- a sign suggesting that capital
demand will increase gradually in the future.</P>
      <P>The central bank's new measure clearly marked the end of a loose monetary
policy even though the bank already  announced  the termination of the
quantitative loose monetary policy in March in an attempt to stop banks from
providing unrestricted low-interest loans to boost their operational turnovers.</P>
      <P>The interest hike can be regarded as a decision that is in line with the
country's general economic development. (June 28, 2010).</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.34 percent Monday as the market staged a
technical rebound from heavy losses at the end of last week, according to
dealers.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 26.08 points to 7,500.79 after moving between 7,489.55
and 7,536.61 on turnover of NT$73.80 billion (US$2.30 billion).</P>
      <P>The weighted index opened 0.43 percent higher as investors took advantage of
reduced valuations after the market was hit hard Friday by a surprise interest
rate hike by the central bank, but the upward momentum was compromised as the
index moved closer to the strong resistance range of 7,500-7,600 points, the
dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,145 stocks closed up and 1,768 were down, with 348 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The financial sector posted the highest gains, up 2.2 percent. Plastics and
chemicals closed up 1.2 percent, foodstuffs were 0.6 percent higher, the cement
sector was up 0.4 percent, and textile shares gained 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector fell 0.3 percent, while construction
issues, as well as paper and pulp, each lost 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>"The strength of the rebound was limited as investors preferred to stay on the
sidelines to watch how Wall Street would go, " said Concord Securities analyst
Allan Lin,  referring to lackluster performance in U.S. markets at the end of
last week.</P>
      <P>"As turnover remained low, it was not easy for the market to overcome stiff
resistance at the 7,500-7,600 point range. Despite the gains, the market remains
in consolidation mode," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said that as financial services have been included on Taiwan's "early
harvest" list under the imminent economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
with China, which will give them easier market access to China, buying in the
financial sector was obvious during the trading session.</P>
      <P>Chang Hwa Bank added 6.76 percent to close at NT$15.00 and First Financial
gained 3.64 percent to end the day at NT$18.50 after the Financial Supervisory
Commission approved their applications to open branches in China, while Cathay
Financial rose 2.24 percent to finish at NT$50.10.</P>
      <P>"Today's gains have got many financial stocks closer to their nearest technical
pressure. I am afraid that investors will sell after the ECFA is signed later
this week," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lingering concerns over debt problems in Europe and recent disappointing
economic data in the United States are still haunting markets at home and
abroad, he went on.</P>
      <P>"Many foreign institutional investors have become cautious and have retreated
from the trading floor. Without their active buying, large cap high tech stocks
here are unlikely to get out of the current doldrums," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai Precision,  the world's largest contract maker of electronics products,
closed unchanged at NT$120.50, while personal computer vendor Acer fell 1.75
percent to end at NT$78.60.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has donated 15 ambulances and two shipping containers of medical supplies
and equipment to hospitals serving remote parts of Guatemala, one of its Central
American diplomatic allies, the Republic of China ambassador to Guatemala said
in a recent presentation ceremony.</P>
      <P>Ambassador Sun Ta-cheng said Taiwan has now dispatched 72 ambulances to rural
counties in the country so far to help carry out Guatemala's four policy
objectives of "education, medical resources, safety and food security.</P>
      <P>Sun also pointed out that Taiwan has speeded up the process of donating medical
equipment  to aid the recovery of Guatemalan hospitals that were badly damaged
by tropical storm Agatha at the end of May and added that Taiwan's promise of a
total of 87 ambulances will be fulfilled within the coming two years.</P>
      <P>Guatemalan Health Minister Ludwig Ovalle expressed appreciation for the
donation, saying that Taiwan has helped Guatemala to improve its medical system

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progress Party (DPP) said Monday that it respects the
decision of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) to file a new application
Wednesday calling for a referendum on a landmark cross-Taiwan Strait trade pact,
which is scheduled to be signed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, the Executive Yuan's Referendum Review Committee rejected a
referendum initiative by the TSU on the economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA).</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said the DPP respects the TSU's call for ECFA
referendum and will offer assistance. He also said the DPP will report its post-
ECFA strategy after more internal planning and discussions.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the impact of the ECFA will not be seen immediately, but that it
will have long-term negative effects such as widening the wealth gap, hurting
sensitive industries and raising unemployment.</P>
      <P>TSU Secretary-General Lin Chih-jia said earlier the same day that the party has
collected about 100,000 signatures, exceeding the 86,000 signatures needed to
initiate a referendum process.</P>
      <P>More than 20,000 signatures were collected during an anti-ECFA rally on
Saturday, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said that although the government will send the trade pact to the
Legislative Yuan for review, it is still an indirect way of exercising the
public's right to decide on such matters -- which he said should be done
directly via referendum.</P>
      <P>"Letting people directly approve the content of the ECFA would be more effective
than relying on the Legislative Yuan's approval and supervision," Lin said.</P>
      <P>He also said that his party will revise its wording in the coming proposal to
make it easier to obtain the Executive Yuan committee's approval.</P>

      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Huang Chung-chiou reiterated Monday the
government's determination to help domestic manufacturers in the conventional
industries sharpen their competitiveness amid the global trend toward trade
liberalization.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks at a workshop held by the Industrial Development Bureau
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs at Kun Shan University in Tainan County,
southern Taiwan, to gather opinions as part of the government's effort to
initiate measures to help local producers.</P>
      <P>The event was attended by representatives of manufacturers of shoes, ready-to-

      <P>Taiwan is about to open its market further to Chinese goods and services
following the signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA),
which the government regards as a crucial pact that will prevent Taiwan from
being marginalized in the region after China and the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations entered a free trade agreement Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>"The ECFA is just a beginning, " Huang said, adding that Taiwan hopes to sign
free trade agreements with other countries once the ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan should not just want other countries to open their markets. It must
gradually open its own, too, " he said.</P>
      <P>So long as companies can strengthen their competitiveness, they can resist the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with China, Chiang Pin-kung, and his entourage arrived
in China's southwest municipality of Chongqing around noon Monday for a meeting
that will feature the signing of a landmark cross-strait trade pact.</P>
      <P>Chiang, chairman of Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) ,
is scheduled to ink the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), which
focuses on tariff concessions, with his Chinese counterpart  Chen Yunlin,
president  of Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS), on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The ECFA signing,  the centerpiece of the fifth round of high-level cross-strait
talks since President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May 2008, will be held at the
five-star luxury hotel Sofitel Forebase Chongqing, where Chiang and his
entourage will be staying.</P>
      <P>Chen gave Chiang and the Taiwan delegation a red-carpet welcome at the hotel.</P>
      <P>At the reception, Chen said the SEF and the ARATS have forged 12 agreements
over the past two years,  which  have contributed significantly to closer
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"Our efforts proved that we Chinese have the wisdom and ability to solve our own
problems through negotiations," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen said that in his meeting with Chiang Tuesday they will review the final
details of the ECFA and an intellectual property rights (IPRs) protection
agreement before signing the two pacts.</P>
      <P>The agreements are highly strategic moves at a time when new variables are
emerging amid a trend of globalization and regional trade blocs, Chen said .</P>
      <P>For his part, Chiang said the ECFA and the IPR will have deep and far-reaching
effects on the economic development of both Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The ECFA is "an opening of Taiwan's major acupoints on Ren and Du Channels" in
terms of bilateral trade with China, Chiang said. It will allow Taiwan a fair
opportunity to compete with the members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) in the vast Chinese market in the wake of the formation of a
powerful regional trade bloc called ASEAN Plus China that took effect on Jan. 1
this year, he said.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the ECFA will also help China-based Taiwanese businesses upgrade
their operations, from manufacturing to the service industry, while mainland
Chinese businesses will be able to sharpen their export competitiveness by
importing capital goods, such as machinery, from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The ECFA will also bring quality made-in-Taiwan products to Chinese consumers
at lower prices," he added.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the 12 agreements that have been concluded by the two intermediary
bodies over the past two years were virtually "12 fast tracks" that have sped up
travel and the flow of goods and capital across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He said the fifth round of high-level cross-strait talks in Chongqing is a
mutually beneficial undertaking as it reflects the fact that through cooperation
and engagement, the two sides can prosper.</P>
      <P>Chiang also expressed appreciation to the other SEF and ARATS negotiators for
what he said was their hard work and persistence over the last six months to
make the signing of the ECFA possible.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's consumer confidence in June rose to a 6-year high, with confidence in
the stock market increasing the most, according to the results of a monthly
survey released Monday.</P>
      <P>The consumer confidence index (CCI) for June stood at 77.8, up 1.8 points from
May to reach the highest level recorded since May 2004, according to the results
of the survey conducted by National Central  University's  Research  Center  for
Taiwan's  Economic Development (RCTED).</P>
      <P>Three out of the six sub-indices rose, with the largest increase seen in the
sub-index for projected stock market investing over the next six months -- which
rose 9.1 points to 87.4.</P>
      <P>Confidence in job opportunities for the next six months increased 5.1 points to
80.35 in June, making it the ninth consecutive month to show growth, while
confidence in buying durable goods rose 0.5 points to 94.1.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chih-chiang, head of the research center, said the increase in confidence in
the stock market was due to easing worries about the European debt crisis.</P>
      <P>Hsu said, however, that the study suggests consumers were slightly conservative
toward the economy for the next six months, as the sub- index for the overall
domestic economic outlook showed its first drop in nine months.</P>
      <P>The sub-index for the overall domestic economic outlook dropped 1.75 from the
previous month to 81.45. As the drop was relatively small, Hsu said, this should
not be over-interpreted as an economic decline.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that the economy in the next six months will be mostly influenced by
long term factors such as the signing of a landmark cross-Taiwan Strait trade
pact, and short term factors like the central bank's policy moves.</P>
      <P>But Hsu said the survey, which was carried out June 19-22, did not reflect the
central bank's interest rate hikes of June 22.</P>
      <P>Outlook on price levels was at 52.3, down 1.35 points, while the outlook on the
family's financial situation was at 71.20 points, down 0.85 from May.</P>
      <P>The RCTED noted that the fact that all six sub-indices were below 100 shows that
consumer sentiment remains pessimistic.</P>
      <P>An index of 0-100 is indicative of pessimism, while one between 100 and 200
reveals optimism.</P>
      <P>The survey of 2,396 adults had a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage
points.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan urged to restructure old economy sector</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should speed up the pace of restructuring its old economy sector to
alleviate impact after the imminent signing of the economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China, an economist said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chu Yun-peng, an economist with National Central University, said the government
should make upgrading the island's traditional industries its top priority when
mapping out strategies for economic development after the ECFA takes effect.</P>
      <P>Chu, a former minister without portfolio in the administration of President Ma
Ying-jeou, said it is very positive that the "early harvest" list under the
trade pact makes old economy industries such as textiles, rubber and plastic
products subject to tariff waivers for the mainland market.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan should seize the opportunity to reshape its old economy sector
and change its habit of concentrating its financial resources on the high-tech
sector.</P>
      <P>Chu's comments came after Ma said Sunday that the government would announce new
strategies for Taiwan's economic future on July 1 in a follow-up to signing the
ECFA.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are scheduled to sign the trade pact on June 29.</P>
      <P>Chu said the transformation of the local old economy sector is expected to help
Taiwan take on challenges from South Korea, which is boosting its business ties
with China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>Apart from the restructuring of the country's old economy sector, Chu suggested
Taiwan try to introduce foreign funds, saying foreign firms will be eager to use
Taiwan as a springboard to the mainland market after the ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>According to a government estimate, the ECFA is expected to attract about US$8.9
billion in foreign direct investment.</P>
      <P>Chu said Taiwan also has to build its own brands to polish its global image and
enhance its international visibility as the country competes with Japan and the
United States.</P>
      <P>Late last year, the government announced it would spend NT$95 billion (US$3
billion) over the next 10 years to reshape its old economy sector, helping the
sector upgrade production technology, intensify efforts in on-the-job training
of blue collar workers and grant subsidies to workers affected by the ECFA.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that it was at the suggestion of a professor
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that he determined to do
away with national conscription.</P>
      <P>During a meeting in his office with MIT President  Susan Hockfield, Ma said he
met in 2003 with Victor Zue, a professor of electrical engineering and computer
science at MIT.</P>
      <P>Zue told him that Taiwan's compulsory military service makes college graduates
forget what they learned in school and keeps them out of touch with the latest
technological advances in their disciplines.</P>
      <P>"His opinion was one of the reasons that prompted me to advocate the
establishment of a volunteer armed forces during my campaign for president in
2008," Ma told his guest.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese men still have to serve one year and two months in the military or
three years in alternative national service when they turn 18, although Ma's
administration has set 2014 as the target year for ending conscription.</P>
      <P>Ma, who holds a doctorate in law from Harvard, said his relationship with MIT
began during his Harvard days when he took an optional course at MIT, where he
benefited from the books of many MIT professors.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of the meeting, he said jokingly that he liked MIT not only
because it is a prestigious university, but also because the acronym also stands
for "Made in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>As a university with a history of more than a century, MIT is more than just a
school that turns out many geniuses, it is a supplier of solutions to many
worldwide problems, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Noting that MIT alumni have set up more than 25,800 companies with a combined
employment of 3.3 million and a combined revenue of US$2 trillion a year around
the world, the president said the university is the creator of many business
opportunities and jobs in the United States and the world.</P>
      <P>He said he floated the idea of strengthening Taiwan through innovation as the
first of six goals he set up for his administration during the midterm of his
presidency.</P>
      <P>"Actually, I had the vision of developing the island into one of the world's
innovation centers, one of the business hubs in the Asia-Pacific  region,  the
headquarters  of Taiwanese companies worldwide and the regional headquarters of
foreign companies during my presidential campaign," Ma said.</P>
      <P>"My administration is pressing ahead with plans to realize these visions and has
already realized some of them," he went on.</P>
      <P>Hockfield arrived in Taiwan Sunday at the head of a delegation of 18 MIT faculty
members to attend a Tuesday seminar organized by a private foundation in Taipei.
She and her group are slated to depart Wednesday.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's economy flashed a "yellow-red" light in May, indicating the local
economy is booming and ending a four-month overheating "red light" streak, the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development said Monday.</P>
      <P>The council adopts a five-color measurement for the country's economic
performance: A red light shows the economy is overheated, a yellow-red light
indicates a heating economy, a green light signals stable growth, a yellow-blue
light indicates a slowing economy and a blue light shows a recession.</P>
      <P>The yellow-red light flashed on declines in money supply and share prices, the
government agency said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the May leading indicators -- which forecast economic activity in the
upcoming three to six months -- rose 0.3 percent from April to 110.5, the
council said.</P>
      <P>The rise in the leading indicators showed increases in the manufacturing
inventory, floor area of approved construction projects and overtime hours in
both the industrial and service sectors, the council said.</P>
      <P>But share prices, export orders, money supply and a ratio of semiconductor
bookings to shipments all saw declines last month, it said.</P>
      <P>The annualized six-month rate of change of the leading indicators fell 2.4
percentage points to 10.8 percent, marking the fourth consecutive decline, it
added.</P>
      <P>In addition, the May index of coincident indicators -- which measures the pace
of economic activity -- rose 0.9 percent from a month earlier to 112.8.</P>
      <P>The council said it is optimistic about the local economic future on a
recovering global economy and improving cross strait relations, adding it
expects the economy will continue a stable pace of growth on rising domestic
consumption and investment.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan contains a priceless collection of masterpieces  by world-
renowned  Chinese artists, paintings that in the past were piled up in a
warehouse but which are now all well-kept and documented, Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang was responding to a United Daily News (UDN) report that the legislature has
"seven treasures" that include a splash-ink lotus painting by Chang Da-chien
(1899-1983) , one of the best-known and most prolific Chinese artists of the
20th century.</P>
      <P>The other treasures are landscape by Huang Chun-pi (1898-1991), a portrait of a
lady by Chi Kang, a banana painting by Chen Tzu-ho (1910-1983), a bamboo brush
painting by Ma Shou-hua (1893-1977), a pine-bamboo-plum painting by Fu Chuan-fu
(1910-2007) and a giant pine tree by Kao Yi-hung (1908-1982).</P>
      <P>The UDN report said Chang's lotus painting is worth an estimated NT$30 million
(about US$1 million).</P>
      <P>"The report far underestimates the painting's value. That amount would never be
enough for the masterwork. In my eyes, all of the paintings in our collection
are priceless, " Wang said.</P>
      <P>The paintings were once stacked in the legislature's warehouse as the staff did
not know their value, Wang admitted. Now, however, the situation has changed.</P>
      <P>Some 10 years ago, he recalled, legislative staff conducted a full survey of the
legislature's fixed and unfixed assets. At the time, many valuable paintings and
calligraphic works were sorted out from the warehouse, including the "seven
treasures. "</P>
      <P>The collection  has since been documented  and the "seven treasures" have been
re-framed. Chang's lotus painting is displayed on the 12th floor of the
legislature's Chunghsing Building, while the remaining paintings have been hung
in either the banquet hall or guest hall.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, all the works were gifts to the legislature from various
sources. Noting that the legislature has a well-managed monitoring system, Wang
said he is not worried about the safety of the treasures.</P>
      <P>While some visitors and guests at the Legislative Yuan have been aware of the
value of the paintings, Wang said quite a few of his colleagues have no idea
about their worth, even though they are in and out of the halls every day.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A jet bridge at the second terminal of Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
collapsed Monday afternoon, but no injuries were reported. Authorities said the
cause is still being investigated.</P>
      <P>The collapse took place at 1: 24 p.m. at boarding gate D6 of the second
terminal, while airport staff were preparing to receive 30 business class
passengers arriving from Singapore on flight SQ876.</P>
      <P>The jet bridge -- a walkway that connects aircraft to the airport -- was
scheduled for maintenance the same morning after one of its motors
malfunctioned. A South Korean company sold the bridge to the airport for NT$10
million (US$312,000) in 2005.</P>
      <P>Chang Tie-yuan, the deputy director of the airport, said Monday afternoon that
the cause of the collapse was still unknown and that the maintenance department
will conduct an overall inspection of all the airport's jet bridges.</P>
      <P>"The collapse will have virtually no impact on the operation of the airport, "
he said. "We have shut down the boarding gate but no flights will be delayed due
to the closure."</P>
      <P>This is the first time that a jet bridge has toppled at the airport, which was
originally named Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. It opened in 1979 and
the second terminal was added in 2000.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, Minister of Transportation and Communications Mao Chi-kuo
announced that construction for a third terminal will begin later this year as
part of the Airport Zone project.</P>
      <P>In a briefing with President Ma Ying-jeou, Mao said the goal is to turn the
airport into a transportation hub for Northeast Asia.</P>
      <P>According to the Airport Council International's (AIC) 2009 Airport Service
Quality Survey, the airport fell to 27th place, a sharp decline from the
previous year's 18th place.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin signed a contract Monday with a corporation founded by
Hon Hai Group to build the "Taipei Information Park" on a build-operate-transfer

      <P>Hau said the park's construction is scheduled to start next year and will come
into operation in 2014. The city hopes to open a Taipei version of Akihabara --
a major shopping area in Japan for electronics and computer goods -- and even
replace Akihabara as Asia's most important hub for information products, he
said.</P>
      <P>The mayor also said that Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Gou promised a few days
ago that the group will invest NT$200 million (US$6.24 million) to establish an
innovation development fund to help young people start businesses and sponsor
students to participate in international information products design
competitions.</P>
      <P>Chang Jui-lin, chairman of the Hon Hai-affiliated company, said that once the
park's construction is completed, it will not only be able to provide creative
products and innovative services, but will also create about 1,500 jobs.</P>
      <P>He said the park will house 3C (computer,  communication, consumer) and

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's grouper aquaculture to benefit from ECFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With Taiwan's cultured grouper to be given zero tariff treatment under a
landmark cross-Taiwan Strait trade pact, many grouper farmers plan to expand
their grouper ponds and even fishermen have expressed interest in entering the
lucrative market, industry sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, President Ma Ying-jeou predicted that Taiwan will become the
largest source of grouper in the world as the fish has been included on Taiwan's
"early harvest" list of goods and services that will enjoy preferential tariff
treatment under the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Two days previously, Ma expressed hope that the total annual production value of
grouper -- which are mainly raised in Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties in
southern Taiwan -- will increase to NT$7.6 billion (US$237 million)</P>
      <P>Dai Kun-Tsai, a grouper farmer who successfully raises giant grouper in
Pingtung, said that increasing demand from China made him consider to double the
acerage of his ponds.</P>
      <P>"The demand from China for the fish during the Shanghai World Expo has been the
greatest I have ever seen in more than 20 years, " Dai said.</P>
      <P>Dai also said that as the government now allows boats to transport live grouper
directly to 11 harbors in China's Fujian Province, the high quality of the fish
and the zero tariff treatment are expected to increase the economic potential
for the product.</P>
      <P>He noted that two fisheries in China have recently set up offices in Taiwan with
the aim of grabbing more grouper wholesale business.</P>
      <P>According to Ho Shu-yuan, director of a fishermen's association in Kaohsiung
County, some local fishermen have approached the association to seek advice on
how to enter the grouper aquaculture business.</P>
      <P>Ho said the price of quality grouper has increased to NT$416 per kilo, up 56
percent from last year, while the price of giant grouper has risen by 27 percent
to NT$466 per kilo.</P>
      <P>Huang  Tsai-tuan,  head  of Pingtung  County's  Aquaculture Development
Association, said local grouper aquaculturists hope the signing of the ECFA will
help them recover from losses they sustained because of the inundation triggered
by Typhoon Morakot last August.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as butterfly orchids are also on the country's "early harvest" list,
the combined size of Taiwan's orchid farms is also expected to increase from 200
hectares to 300 hectares, according to a local media report.</P>
      <P>The signing of the ECFA will enable local orchid growers to expand their export
market, in which about 98 percent of local butterfly orchids at present are
shipped to Japan, one grower was quoted as saying.</P>

      <P>Shipments of Taiwan-made notebook computers are expected to exceed 100 million
units in the second half of this year, largely on a Christmas season buying
spree, a research agency Monday said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-based Topology Research Institute said it expects the global business
sector will replace its notebook computers in the second half, boosting demand.</P>
      <P>Strong consumption during a prolonged holiday in China to celebrate the
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1 will
also contribute to the growth, Topology said.</P>
      <P>Globally, shipments of notebook computers are likely to reach 113 million units
in the second half of this year, up from an estimated 97 million units in the
first half.</P>
      <P>For all of 2010, global shipments of notebook computers are expected to reach
210 million units, up 25 percent from a year earlier, the research institute
said.</P>
      <P>Topology said that it expects consumers  will shift their attention to tablet
computers from netbook computers, adding that global shipments of netbook
computers in 2010 will rise just 19 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>Global shipments of netbook computers in 2009 almost doubled from 2008.</P>

      <P>Alishan, one of Taiwan's most popular tourist attractions, saw an increase in
visitor numbers on the first weekend since last year that large tour buses were
allowed to use the area's main highway, which was damaged last August, officials
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi Forest District Office said 4,029 people visited the Alishan Forest
Recreation Area in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County June 26 and 27 after Highway
No. 18, which serves the area, was reopened to large tour buses a day earlier.
The number marked an increase of 761 visitors compared to the previous weekend.</P>
      <P>The road was closed after it sustained massive damage from landslides triggered
by last August's Typhoon Morakot. It was first reopened to four-wheel drive
vehicles only Sept. 15, 2009 and gradually opened to larger cars and mini-buses
as the repairs progressed.</P>
      <P>Large tour buses -- which bring the most tourists -- were allowed only as far as
the 66 km point of the highway prior to June 25. The main attractions of the
Alishan mountain resort are located from the 88 km point and beyond.</P>
      <P>The office said it also expects visitor numbers to further increase  over the
summer season thanks  to Alishan's  cooler temperatures attracting tourists
eager to beat the heat.</P>
      <P>Road maintenance officials cautioned drivers to drive slowly and carefully on
the road, as there are still eight sets of roadworks on the route.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, traveling at the head of a delegation of city
officials, left for Japan Monday on a five-day business-promotion trip.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the media prior to her departure, Chen said the main goal of the
trip is to solicit Japanese investment in Kaohsiung, touting the advantages  of
the southern port city's excellent investment climate.</P>
      <P>She said the delegation will focus on Japanese companies involved in the
cultural and creative industries and green, clean energy -- two areas that will
be centerpieces of industrial development in the future Kaohsiung special
municipality to be formed by a merger of Kaohsiung city and county at the end of
this year.</P>
      <P>Chen is accompanied by Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Lee Yung-teh, Kaohsiung City
Economic Development Bureau Director Liu Hsing-cheng and former Minister of
Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh, as well as several aides.</P>
      <P>During the trip, which will take them to Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, Kyodo and
Okazaki, the mayor and her group will visit a number of leading firms, including
Japan's most veteran advertisement company Hakuhodo; InterOcean; Vantan; Omron
Global; and Mitsubishi Motors.</P>
      <P>Chen said the delegation will sign a memorandum of understanding with Hakuhodo
for closer cooperation, in the hope that the country's second-largest
advertising firm can use its exceptional marketing and advertising skills to
sell Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>They will also visit a Mitsubishi Motors plant located in Okazaki that is
renowned for its electric car manufacturing technology, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"We hope that our visit there will eventually bring the key technology  for
manufacturing  electric vehicles from Japan to Kaohsiung, " she said.</P>
      <P>Chen said she made a similar business promotion trip to Japan in 2008, a trip
that proved fruitful and rewarding, successfully attracting Sony Computer
Entertainment Taiwan (SCET) to relocate part of its Taiwan operations to
Kaohsiung's Pier-2 Art District, and Shogakukan Inc. to open a hub at the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kiko Hsiao's childhood interest in and devotion to fossils has led to Taiwan
becoming the home of Asia's only professional fossil cleaning and preparation
group, but Hsiao's dream extends beyond this.</P>
      <P>"I would often spend all day in the National Taiwan Museum looking at all the
different kind of fossils behind the glass," Hsiao recalled of his fascination
with fossils when he was a child. After graduating from junior college, he spent
most his time and money visiting fossil exhibitions around the world.</P>
      <P>During his travels, Hsiao met a family-run fossil preparation team in Germany
and the team made an exception by teaching him the techniques that previously
were passed down only to family members. After four years of study, Hsiao
returned to Taiwan, where he founded Paleo Wonders in 1997.</P>
      <P>While the company has made a name in the industry with its professional work,
most people know Paleo Wonders through its 20 shops selling kits and products
for natural science education. Selling merchandise based on its specialization
and using the profits to support the core fossil preparation work is the
company's unique model for success.</P>
      <P>Although the company's preparation schedule is full for the next five years, it
continues to support research and educational events, including exhibitions.
Working with Cheng Yen-nien, a geology curator at the National Museum of Natural
Science, they have published two papers in the international journals "Nature"
and "Science." One unveiled changes in reproduction of Triassic marine reptiles
and the other showed the link between birds and dinosaurs.</P>
      <P>"Paleo Wonders' ultimate goal is to close the gap between the modern public and
ancient creatures so the history of life can become closer to our daily lives, "
said Hsiao's partner, Dick Feng. While the company is planning to set up shops
in Singapore and China next year, it is also looking for partners to set up a
museum of natural history in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China held the final preparatory meeting for the fifth round of
cross-strait negotiations here on Monday, putting the final touches on two
historic pacts the two sides plan to sign on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In addition to Kao Koong-lian, the vice chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) who led the Taiwan delegation in previous preparatory meetings,
three senior Taiwan economic officials also attended for the first time: Vice
Minister of Economic Affairs Francis Kuo-hsin Liang, director-general of the
Bureau of Foreign Trade@Huang Chih-peng,  and director-general of the Industrial
Development Bureau Woody T.J. Duh.</P>
      <P>Their presence at the meeting was part of Taiwan's efforts to impart an official
air to cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>The Chinese delegation was led by Zheng Lizhong, vice president of Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>The meeting was held to confirm the text of the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA)  and a pact to protect intellectual property rights and to make
them ready for signing the next day by SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS
President Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening of the meeting, Kao extended his greetings to the 30
million residents of the host city, saying the two pacts are aimed to benefit
people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and to usher in a prosperous era.</P>
      <P>"The negotiation teams from both sides will leave a brilliant stamp on history
by wrapping up the two pacts after the longest talks to have ever taken place
between the two sides," he said.</P>
      <P>Zheng said the two pacts will boost the two signatories' economic cooperation,
sharpen their competitiveness and improve their economic strength.</P>
      <P>"To meet the needs of people on both side of the strait is the purposes of talks

    <TEXT>
      <P>China is likely to see its working population fall in coming years and could
face a labor shortage, a visiting Chinese scholar warned Monday.</P>
      <P>"Some experts believe that China's population structure will reach a turning
point, " Huang Yiping, professor with Peking University's National School of
Development, said in a public speech in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Experts forecast that the Chinese working population will begin falling in 2015,
while China's total population will start declining in 2030, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"I'm inclined to support the argument that China is close to a population
turning point," he told the audience.</P>
      <P>The professor, who was the chief economist for Citigroup's Greater China region,
said there was a shrinking workforce pool in the Yangtze River Delta and the
Pearl River Delta -- both of which are China's major economic areas.</P>
      <P>Huang also said that he visited villages in the western part of China in the
past year and observed that there were few young or middle-aged people.</P>
      <P>"There are mostly old people and children in the villages now, " he said.</P>
      <P>He described China's oversupply of cheap workers as an important factor driving
the country's rapid economic growth for the last three decades.</P>
      <P>"But this factor might be changing now," he noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said that another economic problem facing China is surging wages.</P>
      <P>Chinese wage hikes started as early as 2004 and have posted significant annual
increases ranging an average 13 percent to 18 percent, the professor said.</P>
      <P>"These increases are much higher than China's economic growth during the same
period," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Chinese wage hikes slowed in 2008 and 2009, but started to rise again from the
end of last year, he said.</P>
      <P>"This will have a big impact on our economy," he said.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on whether western China might be companies' best choice to
cope with rising wages, Huang said that these companies cannot go further into
the western region as there are not many workers there and the mountainous
terrain makes transport inconvenient.</P>
      <P>"So they might turn around and head to Vietnam," he said.</P>

      <P>The government will officially open the first detention center exclusively for
women on July 1 to provide a better environment for female detainees, officials
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The women's detention center is part of a Ministry of Justice plan to improve
conditions for detained women that was announced by former Justice Minister Wang
Ching-feng in March. The center will be set up by transforming the current
Shihlin Detention Center and will house detainees from northern Taiwanese areas
including Taipei, Keelung and Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>Shihlin Detention Center is currently using facilities at the Taipei Detention
Center in Taipei County's Tucheng City because Shihlin's original facility has
safety issues. The temporary Shihlin Detention Center is across a street from
the Taipei Detention Center.</P>
      <P>Chih Yen-lieh, deputy head of the Taipei Detention Center, said it took more
than 100 male detainees from the Shihlin center on May 1 and transferred its
female detainees to Shihlin on June 19.</P>
      <P>Chih said that as both centers hold detainees of a single gender, medical
examinations and other activities will be easier and simpler. The number of
detainees transferred is similar so the use of space in the two centers is
barely affected.</P>
      <P>Detention centers differ from prisons as they house criminal defendants, people
jailed for petty crimes, and drug offenders.</P>
      <P>The Shihlin Detention Center said the separation would allow it to better
accommodate the needs of female detainees, such as providing hot showers during
certain hours.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Liu Ching-cheng, better known as "Master A-Cheng" in Taiwan for his superb
ability to make dragon boats, impressed large crowds of Germans when he
introduced special features of his craft in Hamburg over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Liu led an eight-member dragon boat racing team from Taiwan to demonstrate how
to grab the flag planted at the end of the course, which is crucial to winning a
dragon boat race, at the second Taiwan Cup dragon boat race tournament in
Hamburg.</P>
      <P>Liu's team also joined with a Taiwan-friendly German group and Taiwanese
expatriates residing in Hamburg to take part in the race.</P>
      <P>Liu has been credited for helping fuel a craze for dragon boat racing in
Germany, as two dragon boats he crafted drew strong interest when they were
brought to Hamburg in 1989 by a group of Taiwanese dragon boat enthusiasts to
join a race commemorating the 800th anniversary of the opening of Germany's
largest port.</P>
      <P>The two gaily colored boats have since been anchored at the port city's Elbe
River banks, where they are well-kept and remain in good condition.</P>
      <P>The dragon boat race has also blossomed into a hot sport throughout Germany.
There are now over 200 dragon boat race associations across the country and the
annual dragon boat race championships in Berlin attracts hundreds of teams.</P>
      <P>The three-day Taiwan Cup dragon boat race tournament  was inaugurated June 25 at
Allermoehe, Hamburg's water sport training center. A total of 57 teams took part
in the contest.</P>
      <P>Master A-Cheng has been widely recognized as one of Taiwan's most outstanding
and experienced dragon boat craftsmen. He has produced over 130 boats that have
been adopted by owners as far away as Canada.</P>
      <P>His family was long engaged in the making of boats in Taipei's Jiantan
neighborhood, located along the Keelung River. At 17, Liu decided to take up the
reins, starting off with regular wooden boats and crafting his first dragon boat
at 24.</P>
      <P>"Wood is the heart and soul of the dragon boat, so careful selection is
essential, " he says. "The carving and the drawing and coloring of patterns are
also important. The dragon head gives the boat a living spirit, and must match
the length of the boat to create visual balance."</P>
      <P>He uses his imagination when making the dragons' heads, carving the eyes, nose,
horns and whiskers, matching the head design with painted patterns on the body
and with a high, curling tail. His first dragon-headed craft quickly brought
attention from near and far, and today even dragon-boat craftsmen from mainland
China come to learn from the master.</P>

However, during long breaks such as summer and winter vacations, many are left
hungry.</P>
      <P>"For some children, the free lunch they get in school is the most nutritional
meal they have each time. This means when school is out, many kids will suffer
from malnutrition," he added.</P>
      <P>The foundation said the public can help with the project by donating NT$350
online.</P>
      <P>The money, said Abby Chen, a deputy-director of the Office of Resource
Development, will be used to pay the school's chef to cook for the kids during
the break and buy basic food essentials for the children to take home.</P>
      <P>For students that live far away from the school, a meal truck will be dispatched
to make deliveries on a daily basis, she added.</P>
      <P>In Taichung City, the local government plans to issue over 37,000 coupons this
summer for disadvantaged students to purchase lunchboxes at various convenient
stores in the city. (By Jenny W. Hsu)</P>

      <P>The pace of economic growth will slow in the second half of this year and
private investment will be the main force keeping it going, Hu Chung-ying,
deputy minister of the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD),
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hu made his predictions after the CEPD reported earlier in the day that Taiwan's
economy flashed a "yellow-red" light in May, indicating the local economy is
booming and ending a four-month overheating "red light" streak.</P>
      <P>The growth rate will slow in the next six months due to the relative high
comparison base for the same period last year, Hu said. He added, however, that
with stable growth in production, trade and consumption, and an improvement in
the labor market, overall economic growth will continue.</P>
      <P>Noting that economic growth is closely related to private sector confidence,  Hu
said a planned economic cooperation  framework agreement that Taiwan will soon
sign with China is expected to boost private enterprises' confidence and spur
investment in Taiwan by foreign businesses and overseas Taiwanese companies.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, the introduction of the Industry Innovation Act and a revised bill
reducing the corporate income tax to 17 percent will also help stimulate private
investment and consumption and provide good momentum for growth in the second
half of this year, Hu added.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) on June 9 sharply
raised its forecast for Taiwan's GDP growth this year to 8.5 percent from 5.6
percent, largely based on private investment.</P>
      <P>The key for EIU to revise upward its forecast was the ECFA, because the unit
predicted the agreement will give Taiwan an edge in competing with South Korea
in the Chinese market. It also forecast the deal will be conducive to Taiwan's
efforts to join regional economic blocs or establish free trade agreements with
other countries, according to Hu.</P>

      <P>Vice  Minister  of Transportation  and  Communications  Yeh Kuang-shih, who had
just returned from a cruiser show in Suzhou, eastern China, said the question
will be broached during the shipping talks between Taiwan and China -- via their

      <P>Many foreign cruiser operators at the Suzhou show complained about the vague
rules on whether their ships could travel between Taiwan and China directly, as
some foreign cruisers have been permitted, while others have been forbidden.</P>
      <P>According to a shipping pact between Taiwan and China, only each other's ships
can sail directly between the two sides. Foreign ships, including cruisers, have

      <P>However, the ban was waived when 12,000 Chinese Amway employees visited Taiwan
in nine groups on foreign cruisers last year.</P>
      <P>Yeh said Taiwan keeps an open mind on the issue as both Taiwan and China have no

but even in minor details of dress, so as to produce an effect upon the public
mind, which, without these influences, could only have been produced by fear."</TEXT>

      <P>Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun knocked out fifth seed Andy Roddick of the United States in
the fourth round of the men's singles at Wimbledon Monday, becoming the first
Taiwanese player to make the last eight at the All England Club.</P>
      <P>President  Ma Ying-jeou  and Premier Wu Den-yih both sent congratulatory
messages to the history-maker upon hearing about his victory.</P>
      <P>Lu showed a spirit of dogged fearlessness in eliminating the three-time
finalist, ranked seventh in the world, with a final score of 4-6, 7-6(7/3),
7-6(7/4), 6-7(5/7), 9-7 in a hard-fought match that lasted four hours and 36
minutes.</P>
      <P>It was the first time Lu had beaten Roddick, who he had played against three
times previously.</P>
      <P>The 26-year-old, ranked 82nd in the world, also became the first Asian player to
make it to the quarterfinals at Wimbledon since Japan's Shuzo Masuoka in 1995.</P>
      <P>He will face Serbia's Novak Djokovic, the third seed, Wednesday.</P>
      <P>After his decisive final swing, Lu raised hands to the sky and sent an air kiss
in a gesture of respect for his late father.</P>
      <P>Lu said that when the match started, he knew it would be a long battle.</P>
      <P>"I kept telling myself to hold on," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, back in Lu's home town of Taipei, his brother Lu Wei-lu told CNA on
the telephone that "me and my mother both cried while embracing each other."</P>
      <P>He also said the match was very significant to the family, which lost their
father in 2000, "because Wimbledon was my father's favorite sporting event and
Lu Yen-hsun took his first grand slam win at Wimbledon in 2004."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) reiterated Monday that after the inking of an
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, Taiwan will maintain
its ban on the importing of 830 Chinese agricultural products and will not
reduce tariffs on the 1,415 agricultural items already allowed to enter the
country.</P>
      <P>The COA also noted that President Ma Ying-jeou's administration has not allowed
any more Chinese farm items into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The COA made the remarks in a news release in response to media reports that the
opening to Chinese farm products during the former Chen Shui-bian administration
was the result of fulfilling a promise made by the preceding Kuomintang (KMT)
administration to ensure Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>According to the COA, among the 1,415 Chinese agricultural items, 479 were
permitted entry during the former KMT administration before May 20, 2000, when
the Democratic Progressive Party took office.</P>
      <P>The other 936 items were allowed in by the DPP administration between 2000 and
2008.</P>
      <P>The COA said that since Taiwan entered the WTO in 2002, it has not held
negotiations with China on the matter and that cross-Taiwan Strait economic and
trade policies on the issue were mapped out by the DPP government.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet meeting held Jan. 16, 2002 passed a resolution that led to letting in
more agricultural goods from China, the COA said.</P>
      <P>It also denied DPP claims that under WTO rules, Taiwan is required to open up 90
percent of its market within 10 years of signing the ECFA with China.</P>

six months of the ECFA taking effect. The sooner the talks are completed, the
shorter the "early harvest" period will be.</P>
      <P>In addition, because of the special relationship between the two sides, the ECFA
follows a format that is very different from the free trade agreements (FTAs)
that have been adopted internationally. This special case might become a model
to follow in future FTA talks with other countries, but it could also become an
obstacle in Taiwan's FTA efforts.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the signing of the ECFA might also prompt South Korea to
speed up the signing of an FTA with China, which would affect Taiwan's benefits
from the ECFA. (June 29, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese tennis player Lu Yen-hsun said Monday that holding service was key to
his winning his ticket to the quarterfinals of the men's singles at Wimbledon
and that he was confident of winning his next match.</P>
      <P>The unseeded Lu elbowed Andy Roddick of the United States, the fifth seed, out
of Wimbledon in the fourth round with a score of 4-6, 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/4), 6-7
(5/7), 9-7 to reach his career high.</P>
      <P>"It was the most delightful victory of my professional career, " said Lu, the
first Taiwanese player and the first Asian man since 1995 to make it to the last
eight at the All-England Club.</P>
      <P>It was Lu's best grand slam performance since he got through to the third round
in the Australian Open in 2009. He has never been beyond the second round at
Wimbledon.</P>
      <P>The 26-year-old, ranked 82nd in the world, had never beaten Roddick in three
previous attempts. He said after the match that "I have lost to him three times.
Today, I did not want to lose again."</P>
      <P>"I kept giving him pressure on court... trying to stop him from controlling the
match and taking control of him at the baseline."</P>
      <P>Lu said he thought that so long as they kept playing until the tie break, he
would have a 50-50 chance of winning.</P>
      <P>"Today I did well with my service; it's the key to winning, " he said.</P>
      <P>Lu will face Serbia's Novak Djorkovic, third-ranked in the world, in the final
eight.</P>
      <P>He admitted that it will be "an uneven match judging from the world rankings.
But as long as I have the chance to stand on the court I have the chance to
win."</P>
      <P>"I will not shrink just because my opponent has a higher world ranking than me,"
he said.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic monitoring indicators flashed a "yellow-red" light in May,
ending a four-month streak of "red, " which signals overheating, because of
subdued growth in money supply and a drop in share prices.</P>
      <P>"The new signal means that the pace of our economic expansion has slowed but the
economy is still posting healthy growth, " said Hung Jui-bin, director-general
of the Economic Research Department under the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) , at a news conference Monday.</P>
      <P>In the months ahead, Hung predicted, the domestic economy will continue its
steady growth, with the monitoring indicators flashing "green" because of
relatively higher comparison bases recorded for the second half of last year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  CEPD  Vice Chairman  Hu Chung-ying  said major international
economic research institutions have revised upward their GDP growth forecasts
for Taiwan for 2010 as they believe a new cross-Taiwan Strait trade pact will
accelerate the country's economic development.</P>
      <P>Among others, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) raised its growth forecast
for Taiwan to 8.5 percent earlier this month, up from its previous estimate of
5.6 percent.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) is the key
that will spur the country's fixed capital investment and improve job prospects.
In the first five months alone, private investment already exceeded NT$447
billion, he added.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou forecast optimistically  Monday that Taiwan's economy is
likely to post a hefty 8 percent growth this year, up from the original estimate
of 6.14 percent, because the ECFA will help spur investment and industrial
development.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks during a dinner with senior administration officials and
heavyweight ruling Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers on the eve of the signing of the
landmark cross-strait agreement in Chongqing, China, to seek legislative support
for the pact.</P>
      <P>Ma, who concurrently serves as KMT chairman, said he hopes the Legislative Yuan
will hold an extra session by the end of August to screen and approve the ECFA
so that the agreement can take effect in mid-September to facilitate follow-up
cross-strait negotiations on investment protection and further trade
liberalization.</P>
      <P>Describing the pact as very important to Taiwan's economic well-being, Ma said
Taiwan's exports to China will spike on tariff cuts under the ECFA's "early
harvest" program, which will in turn fuel overall economic growth and generate
more jobs.</P>
      <P>"Up to 23,000 small- and medium-sized enterprises, with a combined work force of
420,000, will benefit from the ECFA, " according to Ma. (June 29, 2010).</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait have agreed to speed up the establishment of
a cross-strait economic cooperation committee to resolve trade disputes that
might arise from the implementation of the "early harvest" program under the
ECFA.</P>
      <P>Sources familiar with cross-strait affairs said China intends to assign
officials from 17 of its various government departments to join the proposed
cross-strait committee to address trade disputes. Those departments include
China's finance and commerce ministries, as well as its customs and quality
control agencies. (June 29, 2010)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>China reportedly would very much like to sign a cultural exchange agreement with
Taiwan in the post-ECFA era.</P>
      <P>Chinese officials have been quoted as saying they hope the proposal can be
included on the agenda of the biannual high-level cross-strait talks scheduled
for the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>China especially wants to strengthen information  and news exchanges with Taiwan
in the hope that its media outlets will be allowed to set up offices in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Relevant proposals, however, have received a lukewarm response from Taiwan.
According to Taiwanese officials, cultural and news exchanges can be more
effectively conducted by means of private or civic channels rather than through
official channels.</P>
      <P>Taiwan reportedly instead most looks forward to signing an investment protection
pact and a health care exchange pact in the next round of talks. (June 29,
2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>It was decided during a dinner hosted by President and KMT Chairman Ma Monday in
honor of KMT lawmakers that the ECFA will not be subject to a "clause by clause"
screening by the legislature and will instead be put up for screening in a whole
package.</P>
      <P>The  KMT-dominated  legislature  is  expected  to call  an extraordinary session
on July 5 at the earliest to screen the ECFA, political sources said. (June 29,

      <P>Suicides committed in Taipei City claimed 341 lives last year, with the rate
among males more than double that of females, the Taipei City Department of
Health said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A total of 234 male citizens in the city killed themselves in 2009, compared to
107 females, giving men a suicide rate that was 2.2 times higher than that of
women in the capital, according to statistics released by the health department.</P>
      <P>The men who ended their own lives did so for varying reasons in the different
age groups -- most of those aged 15-24 committed suicide because of a failed
relationship, while most of those in the 25-64 age group killed themselves
because of family problems or unemployment, and most of those aged over 65 opted
for suicide because they were suffering from chronic disease, according to the
health department.</P>
      <P>Kao Wei-chun, chief of the department's Medical Affairs Division, said that men
are traditionally more reluctant to seek counseling or help when faced with
emotional problems.</P>
      <P>She suggested that people should pay closer attention to their family members or
friends who appear emotionally disturbed to help prevent suicides.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she went on, over 18,000 Taipei citizens called the toll-free, round-
the-clock helpline at 0800-788-995 last year for counseling, compared to fewer
than 10,000 people who called in 2003.</P>
      <P>According to the department's statistics, Taipei City had the third-lowest
suicide mortality rate in the 25 cities and counties around the country in 2009,
behind the outlying islands of Matsu and Kinmen, which had the lowest suicide
rates that year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has approved an application by Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) , the world's largest contract chipmaker,
to take a stake in China-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.
(SMIC).</P>
      <P>In a statement released Monday, the MOEA said TSMC's investment in SMIC meets
the requirements set by the government to ensure Taiwan's advantage over China
in technology, the investor's financial health, and the protection of Taiwanese
workers.</P>
      <P>In November 2009, TSMC and SMIC settled in secret a legal dispute, with SMIC
agreeing to pay TSMC US$200 million in cash and to issue an 8 percent stake to
the Taiwanese firm without payment.</P>
      <P>In the settlement, TSMC also obtained a warrant to buy an additional 2 percent
of SMIC for HK$1.30 (NT$5.30) per share.</P>
      <P>The ministry said that as the acquisition is unlikely to impact TSMC's finances,
while the company will not be involved in SMIC's operations after the
acquisition, there are no concerns about any technology or equipment transfers.</P>
      <P>The MOEA said TSMC is planning to spend US$4.8 billion on capital expenditure in
Taiwan this year to boost its production capacity by 13 percent, a move that
will enable it to maintain its global lead.</P>
      <P>The ministry said TSMC will pay US$300-500 million of the US$4.8 billion to
Taiwanese construction firms and equipment makers, and will recruit 5,000 new
employees this year. It added that TSMC's investments  in Taiwan are expected
to help boost the local manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>TSMC filed the application in March, after the government relaxed restrictions
on high tech investment in China.</P>
      <P>Under the new investment regulations, Taiwanese investors can acquire full or
partial stakes in Chinese chipmakers whose foundries are at least two
generations behind the investors' most advanced facilities in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with China urged the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
Tuesday to launch follow-up talks on an economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) soon after the pact is signed.</P>
      <P>The two sides were scheduled to seal the agreement later in the day, hours after
the fifth biannual talks between Straits Exchange Foundation  (SEF)  Chairman
Chiang  Pin-kung  and his Chinese counterpart, Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) President Chen Yunlin, began in the southwestern
Chinese city of Chongqing.</P>
      <P>In an address at the opening of the meeting, Chiang pointed out that the goal of
the meeting was to sign the ECFA and another agreement on intellectual property
rights protection.</P>
      <P>"Time shall not be wasted" when facing the global financial crisis and the fast
integration of regional economies, he said, describing the ECFA as an important
milestone in the development of cross-strait trade and economic ties.</P>
      <P>It is also a key step taken by the two sides while each seeks a place in the
regional economic integration and catches up with the worldwide trend of
globalization, Chiang stated.</P>
      <P>And "because the ECFA is set to progress step by step, I hope that after the
signing, the two parties will have follow-up talks based on the results of its
implementation and the actual needs of the cross-strait economic development, "
he said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chen said the ECFA signing will take SEF-ARATS talks on economic
issues into a new phase.</P>
      <P>Chen said he regards the ECFA as an agreement formed through talks based on
equality and one that pursues mutual benefit. It has been produced in an
environment that has seen the two sides showing goodwill and making allowances
for each other.</P>
      <P>It further confirms cross-strait trade and investment relations and establishes
a cooperation mechanism that will help the economic and prosperous development
of the two sides, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The two intermediary  institutes  were  founded  to handle cross-strait
exchanges  in the absence  of diplomatic  links. Negotiations between them
started in 1992 and one year later, the heads of the two bodies, Taiwan's Koo
Chen-fu and China's Wang Daohan, met each other in Singapore.</P>
      <P>A second round of cross-strait talks was suspended in 1999 after Taiwan's then-
president, Lee Teng-hui, released his "two states" theory, prompting China's
ire. The talks were not resumed until 2008, when the Kuomintang  won back power
from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party.</P>

      <P>Minister of National Defense Kao Hua-chu said recently that he has no idea where
to obtain the money that will be needed to implement a volunteer military, a
policy that is expected to be launched on a trial basis in 2011 and fully

determination to push for reforms.</P>
      <P>At present, officers account for 20 percent of all military personnel, which is
obviously too high. Why does the Ministry of National Defense (MND) not downsize
the officer corps and use the saved resources to pay for entry-level personnel?</P>
      <P>Such streamlining will definitely offend many people. Those in charge of the
matter must therefore be determined and make proper plans.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that the signing of a landmark cross-Taiwan
Strait trade pact shows that Taiwan and China can interact cooperatively and
that therefore, peace and prosperity between both sides are also achievable.</P>
      <P>Addressing a general meeting of the Chinese National Association of Industry and
Commerce,  Ma said that signing the economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) -- which was expected to take place in the southwestern Chinese city of
Chongqing later in the day -- is meaningful because it can make Taiwan more
internationalized, institutionalized and can avoid its marginalization.</P>
      <P>"It also shows that peace and prosperity between the two sides are not like
roses in the sky, " Ma said. "We are able to touch them with our hands."</P>
      <P>Countries that have been forced until now to choose only one side of the Taiwan
Strait are now able to develop peaceful and prosperous relations with both sides
at the same time, Ma said, adding that this is "a very important part of signing
the ECFA."</P>
      <P>The president described the ECFA as being like a vitamin but not a panacea that
can cure all ills. He said Taiwan still needs to focus on innovation  to build
up a positive environment  for local businesses.</P>
      <P>Ma said local industry should transform China from a global factory to a global
market, adding that more than 500 Taiwanese products -- most of which are
produced by competitive local small- and medium-sized companies -- will be
allowed tariff privileges in China after the ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that if the ECFA takes effect from January 2011, Taiwanese
banks -- if proved to be profitable in China -- will be able to operate Chinese
yuan business from January 2012, which he said would be very important for
Taiwan's financial industry.</P>
      <P>Ma expressed hope that foreign companies will become more willing to set up
their regional headquarters in Taiwan and increase their investments here, and
that more Taiwanese businessmen operating in China will choose Taiwan as their
global headquarters.</P>
      <P>He also urged both the ruling and opposition parties to take a more rational
stance toward the trade pact and to avoid "unnecessary and pointless"
objections.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>While putting the final touches to the signing of a landmark cross-Taiwan Strait
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) Tuesday, Taiwanese negotiators
told their Chinese counterparts that Taiwan will not forsake its right to seek
World Trade Organization (WTO) protection in the event of trade disputes with
China.</P>
      <P>Trade officials from both sides agreed during the last-minute negotiations
prior to the signing of the ECFA that until a cross-strait trade dispute-
resolution agreement is forged, the two sides will try to solve any disputes
through negotiations, but will not refer the controversial cases to the WTO for
arbitration.</P>
      <P>However, the Taiwanese negotiators, including Vice Minister of Economic Affairs
Liang Kuo-hsin, told their Chinese counterparts that Taiwan will seek in future
talks to have black-and-white stipulations included in a cross-strait trade
dispute-resolution agreement that will entitle Taiwan and Taiwanese individuals
to the right and responsibility to refer disputes to the WTO for arbitration.</P>
      <P>The ECFA, which focuses on tariff concessions, was scheduled to be signed later
in the day by Taipei-based  Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung
and his Beijing counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, in the southwestern Chinese city of
Chongqing.</P>
      <P>The ECFA stipulates that both sides should start talks on commodities, the
service industry, investment guarantees and the signing of an agreement on trade
disputes within six months of the ECFA signing.</P>
      <P>With the signing of the ECFA, the trade pact, which was two years in the making,
is scheduled to come into force Jan. 1, 2011.</P>
      <P>From that date, the "early harvest" lists of each side will also take effect,
allowing 539 items of Taiwanese exports to China worth around US$13.8 billion
per year to receive zero tariff treatment within the next two years, while
Chinese exporters will gain similar treatment for 267 items worth US$2.9 billion
in exports to Taiwan each year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, both sides also agreed during the final negotiation session that
morning that talks on the signing of an investment guarantee agreement must be
carried out in the next, or sixth, round of bi-annual Chiang-Chen talks.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese negotiators, nevertheless, said that the next round of talks
should focus on investment protection rather than investment promotion.</P>

      <P>Teenage girls living in remote mountainous and island areas or in low-income
households will be offered free cervical cancer vaccine from the second half of
this year, a Department of Health (DOH) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Bureau of Health Promotion Deputy Director Chao Kun-yu said the government will
earmark NT$42.16 million (US$1.27 million)  to purchase the human
papilliomavirus vaccine (HPV vaccine) for cervical cancer prevention, of which
NT$33.6 million will be used to subsidize teenage girls from remote areas, and
NT$8.5 million will be spent on those from low-income families.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has been promoting cervical smear tests for years, few women
from remote areas actually have the tests, Chou said, adding that the government
therefore decided to take World Health Organization's suggestion of carrying out
a vaccination program with priority given to those from disadvantaged groups.</P>
      <P>Chao said the price of the vaccine normally ranges from NT$2,000 to NT$3,000 per
dose but that the DOH has managed to negotiate a price cut of 30 percent with
the companies that provide the vaccine, bringing the price down to NT$1,220. The
bureau has predicted that the program will benefit more than 10,000 girls.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH, although HPV vaccine is not covered by Taiwan's national
health insurance, the outlying counties of Kinmen and Matsu have already
provided free vaccines to all residents, while Taipei County has also subsidized
vaccination for disadvantaged girls.</P>
      <P>Chen Tian-shun, director of the Kinmen Health Bureau, said that thanks to the
county government's subsidies, 70 percent of girls aged between 16-18 have had
all three required HPV shots and that 45 percent-50 percent of girls aged
between 19-26 have been vaccinated.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 1.02 percent Tuesday as investors took profit
from early gains ahead of the singing of an economic cooperation framework

      <P>The weighted index fell 77.22 points to the day's low of 7,423.57, off a high of

      <P>The market opened 0.72 percent higher amid optimism over the local economic
outlook after Taiwan and China sign a trade pact. However, selling emerged later
in the session, eroding the early gains as investors rushed to pocket recent
profits, dealers said.</P>

      <P>Cement shares dropped 1.0 percent, machinery and electronics stocks lost 0.7
percent and the construction sector shed 0.4 percent.</P>
      <P>Food maker Uni-President  Enterprises fell 1.52 percent to NT$35.55 and its
competitor AGV dropped 2.0 percent to NT$12.25.</P>
      <P>"While many investors have faith in the long term economic outlook after the
signing of the ECFA with China, it was time for them to adjust their portfolios,
" said TLG Asset Management analyst Arch Shih.</P>
      <P>"The reversal of the early gains was no surprise as the positive aspects of the
trade pact have mostly been digested," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China signed the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
Tuesday, after both sides finalized their lists of industries that would be
eligible for tariff waivers and easy market access.</P>
      <P>Shih said selling focused on stocks that have close business ties with China, as
they have recently risen on high hopes that their bottom lines would be boosted
by increasing cross-strait economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>Among the financial stocks that scored the highest gains Monday on hopes of
easier market access to China, Hua Nan Financial on Tuesday fell 3.33 percent to
NT$18.85 and Cathay Financial dropped 2.20 percent to NT$49.00.</P>
      <P>Shih said select high tech stocks appeared resilient to the weakness of the
broader market.</P>
      <P>"It seems that funds are shifting back to the high tech sector from old economy
stocks. This sector may support the broader market in the short term," Shih
said.</P>
      <P>Notebook computer maker Quanta closed unchanged at NT$59.00, while touch panel
firm Young Fast rose 0.84 percent to NT$241.50.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECFA cracks open world market for Taiwanese products: scholar</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Hong Kong scholar said Tuesday that Taiwan will benefit from the signing of a
cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , as the
trade pact will crack open the world market for Taiwanese products through China
as an operations platform.</P>
      <P>From a global economics perspective, all bilateral trade benefits both sides,
said Kwok Yun Kwong, an assistant professor at Hong Kong Baptist University's
Department of Economics.</P>
      <P>"As part of the global industrial chain, Taiwan can use China as a platform to
push its products in the world market under the stimulation of the ECFA, " Kwok
told CNA.</P>
      <P>Under the ECFA, scheduled to be signed in the Chinese city of Chongqing later
that day, Taiwan will benefit more than China, as the Chinese market is so much
larger than Taiwan's, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he added, the initial benefits are heavily skewed toward Taiwanese
businesses, as the "early harvest" lists of each side, scheduled to come into
force Jan. 1, 2011, allow 539 items of Taiwanese exports to China worth around
US$13.8 billion per year to receive zero tariff treatment within the next two
years, while Chinese exporters will gain similar treatment for 267 items worth
US$2.9 billion in exports to Taiwan each year.</P>
      <P>Kwok said the ECFA will help shore up Taiwan's overall economic growth and will
help Taiwanese industries to excel.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) will grow remarkably because of the ECFA,
but it will also become more heavily reliant on the Chinese market, Kwok said.</P>
      <P>On some Taiwanese concerns that the ECFA will adversely affect or even impede
the development of certain industrial sectors in Taiwan, Kwok said the impact
will be temporary, but in the long run, will help Taiwanese industries to
upgrade and restructure into more competitive ones.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang Jianmin, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Science,
said the ECFA encompasses content and influence much more far-reaching than
those carried in the previous 12 agreements that Taiwan and China have signed
over the past two years.</P>

      <P>Export-reliant Taiwan will step up efforts to expand its exports to South Korea
by holding a series of seminars from Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Foreign Trade under Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs will
organize three seminars  for local companies  in Kaohsiung,  Taipei and Taichung
on June 30, July 2 and July 6 respectively, the bureau said in a statement
Monday.</P>
      <P>Expert speakers will be invited to help local companies better understand South
Korea's business culture as well as potential opportunities and risks, the
bureau said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has long had a trade deficit with South Korea, its fifth-largest trading
partner, according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>The statement came amid rising competition between Taiwan and South Korea as a
result of Taiwan's signing of the economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan and China could agree to include flat panels in a list of priority
items that will soon enjoy tariff reductions  or exemptions under the ECFA,
South Korea plans to increase investment in China, Taiwan's China Times on
Tuesday quoted Taiwanese officials as saying.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are expected to launch another round of talks targeting cargo
trade six months after the trade pact takes effect and flat panels will be top
on the agenda, the officials said.</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government announced Tuesday that it will begin an energy-saving
campaign in July in which heavy electricity consumers such as department stores,
hotels and office buildings will be asked to keep their indoor mean temperature
no lower than 26 degrees Celsius.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said that Taipei City will be the first city in the
country to introduce self-governance articles on energy saving and carbon
emission reductions. The city government will start a six-month promotion period
from July and launch formal inspections from next January, he said, adding that
the inspectors will offer advice and counselling on energy-saving.</P>
      <P>The city government will first focus on 500 heavy consumers in the city with an
average electricity consumption of more than NT$300,000 (US$9,344) per month in
its promotion of energy-saving measures, Hau said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>The mayor said that power consumption of those heavy consumers accounts for 38
percent of the city's total power consumption.</P>
      <P>"Just 1 percent of the energy saved by those heavy users would be equal to the
combined one-year power consumption of 7,000 families, " Hau said.</P>
      <P>The city government started energy-saving measures -- including keeping indoor
temperatures no lower than 26 degrees and installing energy- efficient bulbs in
City Hall -- from 2006, making savings of about 8 percent of electricity use in
three years, the mayor said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. has not taken beef trade dispute with Taiwan to WTO: MOFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States so far has not sought the assistance of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) to resolve its beef trade dispute with Taiwan, the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Geneva-based WTO is scheduled to call a meeting in July to review Taiwan's
trade policy. It will be the second such review since Taiwan's accession to the
world trade regulatory body in 2002.</P>
      <P>There has been speculation on whether the U.S. government will bring up its beef
trade dispute with Taiwan at the meeting, as Taiwan and the U.S. are no closer
to resolving the issue since it arose late last year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan struck a deal with the U.S. last October that would see Taiwan lifting
import bans on U.S. bone-in beef and bovine offal. The deal sparked strong
opposition in Taiwan and prompted the Legislative Yuan to pass legal amendments
to bar imports of U.S. ground beef and bovine offal over mad cow disease
concerns.</P>
      <P>The reversal, however, drew a backlash from the U.S., which said the move
undermined Taiwan's credibility as a trading partner and threatened to bring the
dispute to the WTO for arbitration.</P>
      <P>Weber V.B. Shih, director-general of the MOFA's Department of Economic and Trade
Affairs, said that to the best of his knowledge, the U.S. has no intention to
take the issue to the WTO.</P>
      <P>Shih said the WTO's review mechanism is primarily aimed at achieving greater
transparency in the trade policies of member states and facilitating the
multilateral global trading system.</P>
      <P>"These reviews are open to the participation of all WTO member states, " said
Shih who will part of the Taiwan delegation to the meeting scheduled for July
5-7.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Shih said, many of Taiwan's major laws and administrative and
trading systems have been amended or revised. Among them was the law that
reduced the number of legislative seats by 50 percent and the bill to allow for
an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, he noted.</P>
      <P>"We will detail all these new developments in the report that we will present at
the WTO review meeting, " Shih said.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, the WTO Secretariat calls a review meeting on Taiwan's trade
regime once every four years. The first such meeting took place June 20-22,
2006.</P>
      <P>Under the WTO rules, the frequency of trade review meeting hinges on a member
state's annual trading volume. The top four trading nations are subject to a
biennial review, while the fifth to 20th largest trading nations are subject to
a quadrennial review. The remaining member states are reviewed once every six
years.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih on Tuesday said the freshly inked economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) Taiwan signed with Beijing on Tuesday will be
reviewed by Taiwan's legislature early next month in an extra legislative
session.</P>
      <P>It is believed the meeting will be held on July 5 but the premier was non-
committal on the exact date. The legislature is currently in recess, but an
extra interpellation session will be held just for the agreement.</P>
      <P>Wu said he will lead a group of officials to personally defend and answer
questions on the controversial trade pact.</P>
      <P>The agreement, which aims to reduce or eliminate tariffs on hundreds of export
products and several types of services was signed on Tuesday afternoon 2:30 p.m.
in Chongqing, China.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, the chairman of the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation
signed the landmark document on behalf of Taiwan while Chen Yunlin, the head of
the Beijing-based Association of Relations Across Taiwan Straits represented
China.</P>
      <P>Wu said the early harvest list of export items that will enjoy tariff cuts or
reductions immediately includes 539 items from Taiwan. They were negotiated last
week in Taiwan and will officially go into effect on January 1, 2011.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government has touted the agreement as a catalyst to bolster  Taiwans
economy  and  competitiveness  in face  of globalization and a rising China.
However, the opposition fears the agreement will accelerate Beijings absorption
of Taiwan and further deepen the countrys dependency on China.</P>
      <P>The premier was reluctant to put a figure on how the trade deal would boost
Taiwans economy, but said "much depends on the global economy and individual
countrys diligence."</P>
      <P>"The world is still feeling the residues of the global economic tsunami. But the
act helps to remove many hurdles such as the unfair  terms  of tariff  and thus
increasing  Taiwans competitiveness,said Wu.</P>
      <P>Wu did not specify when he will appear at the Legislative Yuan, but said he
believes a second extra session will be held in mid-or late August.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the amendments to four lawsXthe Patent Act, Custom Import
Tariff, Plant Variety and Plant Seed Act, and Trade Mark ActVwill also be
reviewed, with the goal of passing them by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>When asked if President Ma Ying-jeou would make an exception by attending a
legislative interpellation session as rumored, the premier answered with a
categoricalno, saying the laws of the land does not require the president to
appear at the Legislative Yuan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China signed an agreement on intellectual property rights (IPR)
protection Tuesday, creating a mechanism  for resolving  IPR disputes arising
from increasing cross-Taiwan Strait business exchanges.</P>
      <P>The IPR protection pact was inked in the Chinese city of Chongqing along with
the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) in the fifth round of high
level cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>Lai Wen-ping, head of the IPR division of the General Chamber of Commerce of the
Republic of China, said IPR violation has become the biggest cause of disputes
in cross-strait business activities and that it is necessary for the Taiwanese
and Chinese authorities to step in to the resolution process.</P>
      <P>He said the IPR agreement is independent from the ECFA, so that even if the ECFA
is terminated,  cross-strait efforts in IPR protection will not stop
accordingly.</P>
      <P>Such an arrangement, Lai said, indicates that both sides place great emphasis on
IPR protection.</P>
      <P>Lai said the signing of the IPR agreement also shows the determination of the
two sides to resolve disagreements and protect these intangible assets.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, IPR protection-related agencies on both sides will be in
charge of the dispute-resolution process.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the Intellectual Property Office will supervise cross-strait
protection of trademarks, patents and copyrights, while the Council of
Agriculture will take charge of protection of plant species.</P>
      <P>In China, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the State
Intellectual Property Office, and the State Copyright Bureau will take care of
cross-strait protection of trademarks, patents and copyrights, with the State
Forestry Administration and the Ministry of Agriculture in charge of plant
species protection.</P>
      <P>Lai said both sides have agreed to mutually recognize trademarks and patents
that have been registered on each side, push for information exchanges, join
forces in copyright certification and enhance efforts to prevent falsification
of fruit origins.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China are expected to enter talks on the topic of medical cooperation
after the current meeting between their top cross-Taiwan Strait negotiators,
officials of both sides said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, Republic of China Minister of Health Yaung Chih-
liang  revealed  in May during a visit to Geneva, Switzerland that the two sides
will sign an agreement on medical cooperation in the sixth meeting between
Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, and his
Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen are now engaged in their fifth two-day meeting that began
earlier in the day in Chongqing, southwestern China.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS officials explained that since the people in Taiwan and China
are prone to common diseases like pulmonary tuberculosis and enterovirus, it
would be mutually beneficial for the two sides to work together to develop
vaccines against diseases like these.</P>
      <P>Such cross-strait medical cooperation would enhance cross-strait disease
prevention efforts, which would in turn help secure the global medical safety
network, they added.</P>
      <P>In addition to the issue of medical cooperation, Chiang and Chen are expected to
sign an agreement on investment protection during their next meeting, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>They noted that SEF Vice Chairman Kao Koong-liang also recently disclosed that
the issue of a planned investment protection agreement will be on the agenda of
the next round of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>At the Chongqing meeting, Chiang and Chen signed the long-awaited economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) and an agreement on intellectual property
rights protection, adding two more pacts to 12 cooperation agreements the two
sides have forged.</P>

      <P>The main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Tuesday that it will
support a new referendum proposal put forward by its ally against the newly
signed trade pact between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>"The DPP will give its full assistance and backing to the Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) 's new referendum initiative, " DPP spokesman Lin Yu-chang told a
press conference.</P>
      <P>The TSU has said it will submit its new proposal to the Central Election
Commission for initial screening Wednesday. The Cabinet's Referendum Review
Committee rejected the previous one June 3.</P>
      <P>The committee holds that the proposal did not conform with the law because of a
"conflict between the reasoning and the question itself."</P>
      <P>The DPP does not rule out the possibility of initiating another referendum
proposal if the TSU's new proposal is rejected again, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>The DPP said it made its decision amid a growing number of phone calls from
small and medium-sized companies and those involved in the traditional
industries expressing their concerns over the ECFA.</P>
      <P>The callers are worried that their interests will be sacrificed because of the
"early harvest" lists of priority items that will enjoy tariff reductions or
exemptions within two years of the ECFA taking effect, according to the DPP.</P>
      <P>The trade pact still requires the approval of the legislature before it can take
effect, possibly at the beginning of next year.</P>
      <P>According to the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou, the ECFA will create
job opportunities for Taiwan and will pave the way for signing future free trade
agreements with other countries, as the ECFA could reduce China's objections.</P>
      <P>The opposition parties, however, are concerned that the pact will result in an
influx of cheap laborers and goods from China into Taiwan and that it will

    <TEXT>
      <P>Operators of Taiwan's fish farms, mostly congregated in the southern part of the
country, welcomed Tuesday the signing of the landmark cross-Taiwan Strait
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) under which China will offer
zero-tariff treatment for 18 Taiwanese agricultural and fishery items.</P>
      <P>Milkfish are one of several cultured fish products included among the 18 items.</P>
      <P>Wang Chang-hao, chairman of the Tainan Aquaculture Development Association, said
that all the members of the association -- most of whom are owners of major
aquaculture farms in Tainan County -- are in agreement that the tariff
concessions will benefit them economically and keep them busy in the coming
years.</P>
      <P>Tainan City and Tainan County together have the largest acreage of saltwater
aquaculture ponds in Taiwan, covering about 18,000 hectares, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Nearly 7,000 hectares of the ponds are used for the mixed culture of milkfish
and grouper fry, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Tainan fish farmers began to export frozen milkfish balls and
milkfish fillets to China some three years ago, followed this year by exports of
fresh whole milkfish.</P>
      <P>He said that although milkfish are also raised in the Chinese provinces of
Hainan, Fujian and Guangdong, Taiwanese milkfish, which are of higher quality,
have a competitive edge in the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, due to the lack of a branding system, Chinese milkfish are
often falsely labeled as a Taiwanese product in the China market, which damages
the reputation of the real thing.</P>
      <P>He therefore suggested that the government should come up with a corporate
branding strategy for Taiwan's aquaculture farms to help them build an image in
China and better protect their products.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Tsai Chun-sheng, chief secretary of the Chiayi Fishermen's
Association in the southern county of Chiayi, said many local fishermen have
approached the association to seek advice on how to shift their aquaculture
operations from other fish species to milkfish to take advantage of China's
zero-tariff incentive.</P>
      <P>"Some have said they will reopen fish ponds that have been left idle for years
to start milkfish culture," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the ECFA is creating a new business niche for Taiwanese milkfish
farmers, who have suffered from market stagnation over the past several years
after Chinese and other Asian competitors stole their markets in the United
States.</P>
      <P>He called for the government to provide transport assistance for milkfish
farmers so that their fresh milkfish can be delivered to Chinese buyers within
one day.</P>

      <P>A biennial exhibition featuring 43 artists from 17 countries will kick off the
2010 International Ceramics Festival in Taipei County's Yingge Township on July
1, the county's Cultural Affairs Bureau said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Taipei County Yingge Ceramics Museum exhibition will feature a total of 105
works, said Ching Min-liang, director of the bureau.</P>
      <P>The curator of the exhibition, entitled "Korero, " is Moyra Elliott from New
Zealand, who the museum selected from 64 candidates.</P>
      <P>She said that "korero" means "to speak" in Maori and that she hopes viewers will
have lively "conversations" with the ceramic pieces on display.</P>
      <P>"My approach is to produce a show that includes multiple works so viewers can
see the work of artists at the highest level, artists who do not usually enter
competitions, such as Ron Nagle and Alev Siesbye, " Elliott told the Central
News Agency.</P>
      <P>The organizer wanted an event where the curator's thought processes could be
easily followed by a wide audience, she said, adding that the ceramic works on
display had many stories to share with visitors.</P>
      <P>"The central feature of the event is many interesting and famous works by well-
known artists worldwide, such as various cups made by American artist Ron Nagle,
and 'Big Flower' by Japanese artisan Mariko Isozaki, as well as Alev Siesbye's
bowls, which show amazing magic," she said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the exhibit, the festival will also invite people to participate

    <HEADLINE>Chimei Innolux 8.5G capacity to expand to 57,000 units in Q3 2011</HEADLINE>

      <P>Flat panel maker Chimei Innolux Corp. said Tuesday  that the monthly  capacity
of its 8.5th  generation thin-film-transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD)
plant is expected to rise to 57,000 units in the third quarter of next year from
the current 24,000 units.</P>
      <P>The expansion of capacity is expected to meet demand for large-sized flat
panels, the company said.</P>
      <P>After the company's annual general meeting,  company chief executive officer
C.H. Tuan said products from the 8.5G plant have been overbooked, with monthly
orders reaching 55,000 to 56,000 units.</P>
      <P>Tuan said the company has poured more than NT$40 billion (US$1.25 billion) into
capacity expenditure so far this year, mainly to expand the capacity of the 8.5G
plant and an older 6G plant.</P>
      <P>At the end of this year, the 8.5G plant is expected to be producing 27,000 units
per month, he said.</P>
      <P>The 8.5G plant started operations at the beginning of this year, churning out
flat panels for 50-inch TVs or larger.</P>
      <P>The company's 2010 capital expenditure is expected to total NT$100 billion.</P>
      <P>While rival AU Optronics sought regulatory approval in March to set up a 7.5G
plant in Kunshan, in China's Jiangsu Province, after the government lifted a ban
on such high tech investment, Tuan said Chimei Innolux has no immediate plans to
do likewise.</P>
      <P>Tuan said the company will wait until the 8.5G plant has expanded its capacity
to a certain level before going to China.</P>
      <P>The government in February relaxed China investment restrictions for the local
high tech sector by allowing flat panel makers to build up to three 6G or above
flat panel plants in China.</P>
      <P>However, local flat panel producers who want to build plants above 6G must
operate plants in Taiwan that are at least one generation ahead in technology.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with China, Chiang Pin-kung, said Tuesday that cross-
Taiwan Strait medical cooperation and investment protection will be on the
agenda for the sixth high-level meeting between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Chiang, chairman of Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), inked the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin, president of the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), at their fifth round of talks since President
Ma Ying-jeou took office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>Chiang expressed hope at a press conference that both sides can start
communications immediately and try to complete the negotiations as early as
possible.</P>
      <P>During a nearly three-hour talk earlier in the day, Chiang told Chen that
despite the two sides having signed 12 agreements, further discussions will be
needed to address insufficient flights and food safety issues, and that there
was also room for further improvement regarding jointly fighting crime and
mutual legal assistance.</P>
      <P>Chen suggested that issues related to the 12 agreements be prioritized, Chiang
said.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) gave approval Tuesday for subsidies to
be granted to an R&amp;D alliance for the development of new NAND flash
technology.</P>
      <P>The project, which was proposed by a group led by Taiwan Innovation Memory Co.
(TIMC) , will receive government funding of up to 40 percent of its total cost.</P>
      <P>The newly established R&amp;D alliance, which comprises TIMC, Promos
Technologies, Photronics Semiconductor Mask Corp., and Elite Semiconductor
Memory Technology Inc., will work jointly to develop new NAND flash Gemini
technology, the MOEA said.</P>
      <P>Once the project is completed, Taiwanese companies will be able to source NAND
flash technologies domestically instead of relying on major suppliers in the
U.S., Japan and South Korea, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>An official at Promos Technologies said that the development project has already
started, but it is uncertain when it will produce results.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's other major DRAM companies said they were not unduly concerned about
competition from the alliance.</P>
      <P>According to Nanya Technology Corporation, the TIMC project will not
significantly affect the local DRAM manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Powerchip Semiconductor Corp., which supplies 70-nm NAND- based flash devices,
said that it is left to be seen what contribution the TIMC-led alliance will
make to the industry.</P>
      <P>TIMC was established in 2009 with government backing, in the hope that it would
help restructure the country's DRAM industry. However, the Legislative Yuan
adopted a resolution last November asking the MOEA to suspend its DRAM industry
restructuring plan and withdraw its proposed investment in TIMC.</P>

      <P>Jeremy Horng,  deputy executive director of the exhibition department at the

Seoul.</P>
      <P>"We welcome South Korean companies to attend the fair in Taiwan and also explore

Industry (CEPSI) from Oct. 25-28.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, Horng gave a briefing on Taiwan's developments in photovoltaics,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City plans to build itself into a hub for cruise
liners to attract more tourists to the city, officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Sun Jyh-perng, director of the city's Marine Bureau, said about 15 cruise ships
with some 30,000 tourists call at Kaohsiung port every year. Most passengers are
picked up by tour buses and taken to other places, however, so they bring little
business to the city.</P>
      <P>He added that there are no tourist facilities at Kaohsiung Harbor's Pier 1 or
Pier 2, where most large cruise ships berth, so visitors usually just "pass by"
the port.</P>
      <P>Sun said that the Marine Bureau is working with the central government's
Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau to create dedicated piers for cruise ships in the harbor
and that the Ministry of Transportation and Communications has approved the
project. He expects the number of visitors brought in by cruise ships to double
once the facilities are completed.</P>
      <P>Some NT$2.85 billion (US$89 million) will be invested in the project's first
phase, which will include two berths at least 11 meters deep that are capable of
accommodating cruise ships of 70,000-100,000 gross tons each, as well as a
terminal building. Construction on the project, which will be able to serve
4,000-5,000 passengers, is scheduled to be finished by 2013, Sun said.</P>
      <P>The harbor bureau is now holding an international competition for the terminal's
design so that more detailed planning can begin by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Sun said the city government will host a meeting in August to discuss how to
market Kaohsiung as a hub for cruise ships. Industry leaders such as Star
Cruises Director William Ng Ko Seng have been invited, Sun said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Soccer fever in Taiwan during 2010 World Cup</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/29/10  21:45:42</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hundreds of fans have packed more than a dozen outdoor beer bars in Taiwan's
southern city of Tainan, their eyes glued to the TV screens broadcasting the
2010 World Cup soccer tournament.</P>
      <P>In the capital city of Taipei, many restaurants have also been trying to ride
the World Cup fever by setting up big-screen TVs to show live broadcasts and
attract customers.</P>
      <P>Media coverage of the tourney has increased dramatically in newspapers and on
the TV news since May, and thousands of fans have been staying up to watch late-
night live broadcasts since the tournament kicked off June 12.</P>
      <P>The extensive coverage has largely eclipsed the scintillating performance of Lu
Yen-hsun, who became the first Taiwanese tennis player to advance to the
quarterfinal of the Wimbledon tennis tournament early Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The phenomenon is unusual in the "soccer desert, " as Taiwan is called by local
soccer fans, because soccer is a minor sport in Taiwan, where baseball and
basketball are the most popular sports, and its national team ranks way down at
167 in the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) world
rankings.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese  cable television  operators carry limited soccer broadcasts of the
top divisions such as the English Premier League and the European Champions
League, but the ratings do not fare well due to lack of attention and the time
difference.</P>
      <P>That is why it's surprising to discover that World Cup matches have received
relative success in Taiwan, where a 1.0 television rating is usually considered
"above average" for any program.</P>
      <P>"TV ratings of almost all the 10 p.m. games have surpassed 2.0 with a peak
rating of 2.4, " said Su Chi-hui, a producer at Era Television, the exclusive
local carrier of this year's World Cup competition. Su added that most of the
games aired at 2: 30 a.m. have registered ratings of at least 0.8 percent.</P>
      <P>"Keep in mind that those ratings were just for the group stage games, because
the latest ratings have not yet been announced, " he added.</P>
      <P>Viewership has been much better than the last World Cup four years ago when it
was held in Germany, he went on. TV ratings at that time did not exceed 2.0
until the knockout stage of the final 16. Su said he expected the ratings to be
even higher in the later stages of this year's cup.</P>
      <P>But die-hard soccer fans who regularly follow the game dismissed the phenomenon
of the "soccer madness every four years, " saying that the fad -- including the
extensive media coverage and high TV ratings -- comes and goes quickly.</P>
      <P>World Cup fever has become a norm, but is unrelated to the development of the
game, according to local fans.</P>
      <P>"Actually, it's not that unusual. We've seen this pattern every four years. It
happened in 2002 and again in 2006, when almost everyone was talking about
soccer for one month. It's happening again this year," said Clement Tsai, a
soccer fan.</P>
      <P>"The next thing you know, no-one cares about the sport once the World Cup is
over," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Despite the disgruntled fans, soccer fever has hit the island on almost every
front. And Taiwan is not exactly just an observer on the sidelines, as local
textile manufacturers have supplied strips made from recycled materials for nine
of the teams this year, according to the European Parliament magazine published
recently.</P>
      <P>Brazil, the Netherlands, Portugal, the United States, South Korea, Australia,
New Zealand, Serbia and Slovakia are all wearing the Taiwan-made strips, which
are made from 13 million recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles.</P>
      <P>Off the pitch, meanwhile, Taiwanese politicians have not missed out on the most
talked-about feature of this year's World Cup -- the vuvuzela, a raucous plastic
horn blown by the fans that has become a symbol of South African soccer.</P>
      <P>Gao Jyh-peng, a legislator of the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) , took notice of the trend and picked up the instrument in a June 26 rally
in Taipei to protest against a trade agreement to be signed this week between
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that the 200 vuvuzelas he bought were made in China, Gao was
quoted by Agence Presse France as saying that "we'll beat them with their own
medicine."</P>
      <P>Other representatives of the DPP also used 100 "Taiwanese vuvuzelas" -- actually
the traditional suona -- to make noise during the rally.</P>
      <P>At the same time, legislators from the ruling Kuomintang, which favors the trade
pact, have described the signing of the agreement as "scoring a goal."</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou also referred to the quadrennial event, telling reporters
June 15 that he played soccer in high school almost four decades ago. However,
he also said soccer is unsuitable for Asians because Asians are "physically
inferior to the bigger and stronger Westerners." Ma apparently was unaware that
Japan, South Korea and North Korea are all playing in the 2010 World Cup.</P>
      <P>The comment drew criticism from Lin De-jia, secretary-general of the Chinese
Taipei Soccer Association, who disagreed with Ma and urged the government to
show more support for "the beautiful game."</P>
      <P>Lin said his federation receives only NT$6.7 million in funding from the
government, which is not even enough to pay for airfares for national teams to
play abroad in international competitions.</P>
      <P>"The fact is, our government does not pay enough attention to this sport," Lin
said.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan to establish itself as a soccer power to be reckoned with rather than
just cheering from the sidelines during the World Cup, it needs to build up a
soccer culture and develop players in all age groups.</P>
      <P>"This takes time, patience and hard work," Lin noted. By Chris Wang CNA Staff

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou described the economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) between Taiwan and China as "innovation" Tuesday, adding that the pact
symbolizes a new beginning for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We have completed the signing of the ECFA with mainland China today. This is
very meaningful for Taiwan as the pact starts a whole new era for Taiwan," Ma
said.</P>
      <P>"From a certain angle, it is a form of innovation," he added.</P>
      <P>The president  made the remarks  during a meeting at the Presidential Office
with Clayton Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor who proposed the
idea of "disruptive innovation, " used to describe positive, unexpected market
results from innovations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will use the ECFA to build itself as a global innovation center, a trade
hub in the Asia Pacific region, and a headquarters for both Taiwanese and
foreign businesses, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He also said that innovation is the most important concept in Taiwan's economic
development.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has enacted the Industrial Innovation Act and has cut its corporate
income tax to 17 percent, Ma noted.</P>
      <P>"The government also offered many incentives  to encourage innovation in the
agriculture, industry and service sectors, " he added.</P>
      <P>In a public speech earlier in the day, Christensen said that the ECFA gives
Taiwan a very important role as the pact will allow the country free access to
the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>He added that China's consumer  market will provide  many innovation
opportunities for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The professor quoted former U.S. President Richard Nixon as saying that
isolation will only strengthen a totalitarian government, while opening up
diplomatic, educational and economic relations will weaken it.</P>
      <P>Ma has said the ECFA will reduce China's obstruction of Taiwan's efforts to sign
free trade agreements with other countries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's opposition, however, has strongly protested against the ECFA, saying it

Even in Taiwan, not many people had heard of him.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, nobody cares about athletes before they gain fame. The Sports Affairs
Council (SAC) has been spending our taxpayers' money but has never nurtured any
good athletes.</P>
      <P>Tennis players such as Lu and Chan Yung-jan were all on their own before winning
important games, but after they became famous, politicians and government

      <P>The United States Department of State said Tuesday it welcomes boosted dialogue
and exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, adding that it hopes
the links will continue expanding.</P>
      <P>State Department acting deputy spokesman Gordon Duguid made the remarks after
Taiwanese and Chinese negotiators signed an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) in Chongqing, China earlier that day, which observers described
as one of the most significant steps in the development of cross-strait
relations in six decades.</P>
      <P>During a daily press briefing, Duguid was asked whether the ECFA will bring any
changes to the region, such as promping other countries to have similar ties
with China.</P>
      <P>Duguid said: "China being an economic power. Idon't think it's limited to other
states in the region. And I do believe that most of the states in the region do
have very strong economic relationships with China."</P>
      <P>On the cross-strait ECFA, Duguid said: "This particular agreement is one of a
framework for tariffs and so the two-both PRC and Taiwan will be looking at
their tariff structure to try and increase trade. Increased trade does create
more peaceful ties between nations. And as far as that can carry forward a more
stable Asia, a more stable Southeast Asia, we are certainly in favor of that

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- FTA issue comes to fore after ECFA signing</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>The issue of Taiwan  signing  free trade agreements  (FTAs)
06/30/10  12:24:09
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>with other countries has come to the fore after the country struck an FTA-like
deal with China, its largest trade partner, on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with Taiwanese media Tuesday, Wang Yi, director of the Taiwan
Affairs Office under China's State Council, said Beijing will deal with Taiwan's
FTA bid in a reasonable and pragmatic manner as long as the two sides maintain
peaceful constructive interaction.</P>
      <P>Wang's comments marked the first clear response from Chinese authorities to
President Ma Ying-jeou's previous statement that his administration will seek to
sign FTAs with Taiwan's major trade partners after sealing the landmark cross-
strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Responding to Wang's statement, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) issued a
press release stressing that signing FTAs with major trade partners is a
legitimate right of all members of the World Trade Organization (WTO)  and that
Taiwan's pace to ink such agreements remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the ECFA is purely an economic agreement that removes tariffs
to boost bilateral trade, whereas Taiwan's bid to sign FTAs with other countries
will touch on issues regarding Taiwan's international presence or space that
Wang said are sensitive and complicated.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that all of China's diplomatic allies have publicly committed to
upholding a "one China" policy in their trade and economic relations with
Taiwan. "This is an objective international political reality, " he reminded
Taiwanese reporters.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wang added, Beijing understands Taiwan's desire to sign FTAs with
its trade partners out of the need to sustain Taiwan's economic growth.</P>
      <P>Under the premise that cross-strait  relations continue to progress peacefully
and mutual trust continue to build, Wang said China is willing to appropriately
deal with relevant issues in a pragmatic and reasonable manner. (June 30, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The MAC reaffirmed in a late-night press statement that as a WTO member, Taiwan
is entitled to sign FTAs with its major trade partners to facilitate its
participation in regional economic integration, which has become a mainstream
global trend.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Sheng-chung also said Tuesday that Taiwan
will step up efforts to sign FTAs with other countries now that the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait have signed the ECFA,  which is widely  seen as one of the
most significant developments in cross-strait relations in six decades.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the ECFA has increased pressure on South Korea and Japan to
strike FTAs with China.</P>
      <P>Lin further revealed that Taiwan has been actively negotiating FTAs with major
Southeast Asian nations, including Singapore and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>"We have also expressed our wish for FTAs with our major trade partners, such as
the United States, Britain and Japan, " he added. (June 30, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Taiwan signed the ECFA with China on the seventh anniversary of the signing of
the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement between China and Hong Kong, a
coincidence that the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) described as
the first step to turn Taiwan into another of China's special administrative
regions, like Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union, another pro-independence opposition party, said the
ECFA will make Taiwan too economically dependent on China and therefore
politically vulnerable. The party will file an application with the Central
Election Commission Wednesday for holding a referendum on the pact. (June 30,
2010).</P>

      <P>Facing overwhelming invitations for interviews, Lu answered only those chosen by
the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) . As a result, only three
television channels and the Central News Agency had the chance to interview the
emerging tennis star Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The TV channels included the British Broadcasting Corp. (BBC) in the U.K.,
Wimbledon's official TV channel and the Tennis Channel of the United States. The
Tennis Channel sent retired U.S. tennis player Justin Gimelstob, who won the
1998 Australian Open and French Open mixed doubles titles with Venus Williams,
to interview Lu.</P>
      <P>ATP personnel said that because Lu was scheduled to play world third-ranking
Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals Wednesday, the association felt responsible
for limiting the number of interviewers to prevent them from affecting Lu's
preparation.</P>
      <P>The unseeded Lu, ranked 82nd in the world, beat Roddick 4-6, 7-6 (3) , 7-6 (4) ,
6-7 (5) , 9-7 on Monday in a match that lasted four-and-a-half hours and left
the American three-time finalist and world No. 7 reeling.</P>
      <P>The 26-year-old Lu, having lost in Wimbledon's first round four straight  times,
became the first Asian player to reach the quarterfinals of any grand slam
tournament since Japan's Shuzo Matsuoka achieved it in 1995.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's branding efforts are expected by the government to obtain substantial
results within 10 years, hopefully making the country an Asia-Pacific  branding

      <P>Speaking at a seminar on a branding campaign sponsored by the Bureau of Foreign
Trade under his ministry, Shih said that "I am confident Taiwan companies, with
their own brands, will create distinction that will lure large numbers of users
within 10 years across the globe."</P>
      <P>According to Shih, Taiwan businesses have three advantages that will help it
establish distinguished marques on the world market.</P>
      <P>First, Taiwan has accumulated strong momentum with many years of experience in
manufacturing as a foundation upon which it can diversify into the service
industry. Second, the rise of emerging markets, including China, provides a good
chance for Taiwan to build its own brands. Third, Taiwan-made high-quality and
fair-priced products will satisfy the appetites of clients in the Chinese and
emerging markets, he said.</P>
      <P>"The country will have more world-class brands like Acer, TrendMicro, HTC, Asus,
Hon Hai, Master Kang, Uni-president and Giant," he predicted.</P>

good time for transformation, " Shih said, noting that "the manufacturing and

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) signed with China a day earlier will help create an environment
in which Taiwan can compete more fairly with other economies.</P>
      <P>The cross-Taiwan Strait pact also reduces the pressure faced by other countries
and boosts their intentions of negotiating free trade agreements (FTAs) with
Taiwan, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"The government cannot guarantee that many FTAs will be signed immediately...
but at least Taiwan will stand a chance, " Ma said during a seminar with a group
of Taiwanese American political scientists.</P>
      <P>He described Taiwanese as persistent and enterprising people who will do a very
good job as long as there is a chance, pointing to Taiwanese tennis player Lu
Yen-hsun's outstanding performance at Wimbledon.</P>
      <P>Ma rejected allegations by pro-independence media that his administration is
"leaning toward China and selling out Taiwan" by improving relations with China,
saying that China represents "both a threat and an opportunity" for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although 14 agreements, including the ECFA, have so far been signed between
Taiwan and China since cross-strait dialogue resumed in June 2008, this is only
the beginning, according to the president. Negotiations on many other
agreements, such as those on investment protection and dispute settlements, will
follow, he said.</P>
      <P>Ma said dealing with Taiwan's domestic situation  and the country's relations
with China and the United States is like "playing three chess games
simultaneously" for the government.</P>
      <P>"To achieve an outcome that pleases everyone is not easy and is perhaps even
impossible," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma said Taiwan-China-U.S. relations are now in their best shape ever and he

      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) and pro-independence groups jointly

      <P>TSU Chairman Huang Kung-huei and leaders from the World United Formosans for

110,000 signatures to the Central Election Commission (CEC), exceeding the
86,000 signatures needed to initiate a referendum process.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, the Executive Yuan's Referendum Review Commission rejected
an initiative by the TSU against the economic cooperation framework agreement

      <P>Huang said that if the ECFA is not considered a free trade agreement (FTA) under
the World Trade Organization (WTO), which would entail both sides opening 90
percent of markets to each other within 10 years, then Taiwan is being
downgraded to the status of Hong Kong.</P>

and 7,337.32 on turnover of NT$88.84 billion (US$2.76 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened down 1.97 percent in a knee jerk response to the dive on Wall
Street, and pressure continued during most of the trading session, focusing on
large-cap high tech stocks due to heavy losses posted by their counterparts in
the U.S., according to the dealers.</P>
      <P>However, bargain hunters became active in late trading to take advantage of
battered valuations following declines in the past few sessions, they said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,564 stocks closed down and 596 were up, with 201 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics, and financial sectors suffered the steepest
declines, down 1.7 percent each. The cement sector closed down 1.2 percent,
textiles were 1.0 percent lower, paper and pulp shares dropped 0.9 percent and
construction issues ended the day 0.6 percent lower.</P>
      <P>Foodstuff stocks rose 0.1 percent, while plastics and chemicals closed
unchanged.</P>
      <P>"Worry over the global economy was the theme of today's trade after market
sentiment was hit by the dive on Wall Street, " Hua Nan Securities Vice
President Henry Miao said.</P>
      <P>"Investors at home and abroad are watching closely how the debt problems in
Europe will evolve. The debt crisis could further impact stock markets
worldwide," Miao said.</P>
      <P>He said that with U.S.  high tech stocks falling sharply overnight, the local
electronics sector, led by Hon Hai Precision, the world's largest contract maker
of electronics, faced the heaviest pressure.</P>
      <P>"There are doubts about the outlook of the global high tech sector amid fears
that the lingering financial crisis in the eurozone will hurt global demand,"
Miao said.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai Precision fell 5.79 percent to NT$114.00, personal computer maker Acer
shed 4.20 percent to end at NT$75.20 and integrated circuit designer MediaTek
lost 2.06 percent to finish the trading session at NT$452.50.</P>
      <P>Bucking the downslide on the broader market, transport stocks were boosted by
optimism about their bottom lines amid closer business ties across the Taiwan
Strait, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>China Airlines closed up 6.80 percent at NT$16.50 and EVA Airways shares were
2.70 percent higher at NT$19.00.</P>
      <P>Miao said that despite the late trading bargain-hunting, the market was
technically  weaker,  adding that if volatility in international markets
continues, the local bourse might drop further and test the 7,000-point mark.</P>
      <P>"Investors had better seize any technical rebound to pocket profits before
rebuilding their portfolios," he said.</P>

      <P>Ninety-five percent of students surfed the Internet at home during past summer
vacations, and they can be expected to gain an average of between three and five
kilograms this summer, according to a recent survey conducted by the Formosa
Cancer Foundation.</P>
      <P>The survey suggested that surfing the Internet and playing video games are very
popular among Taiwan's schoolchildren during their two-month vacation, with 77
percent of respondents saying they played games for around three hours a day,
and 30 percent saying they devoted more than five hours to games.</P>
      <P>Another 65 percent of the respondents said they preferred to watch television,
of which 61 percent spent more than three hours per day watching TV.</P>
      <P>When asked about bedtime, 40 percent of the schoolchildren said they went to
sleep soon after 11 p.m., while 20 percent said they stayed up after midnight.</P>
      <P>Tsai Li-chuan, deputy executive director of the foundation, said that
schoolchildren lacked exercise and had erratic sleeping and eating habits, and
that they usually put on considerable weight over the break.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 50 percent of students said they normally have late-
night snacks three days per week, while some 30 percent usually skipped
breakfast because they woke up too late.</P>
      <P>Tsai said students enjoyed more freedom to choose their meals during vacations
because their parents are at work. The survey found that more than 60 percent of
respondents said they had eaten sugary foods like ice cream and drank sugary
beverages almost every day during previous vacations.</P>
      <P>Instant noodles were often their choice for lunch, Tsai said, adding that the
food was high in calories and that the average student would gain between three
and five kilograms during the break.</P>
      <P>The charity foundation has carried out the same survey during summer vacations
for four consecutive years. A total of 4,057 valid responses from elementary
students between the third grade and sixth grade were collected online from June
3-17 this year.</P>

      <P>China could follow a business path taken by Taiwan and turn itself from a
manufacturer into one of Taiwan's main competitors, a visiting Harvard Business
School professor said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In past years, Taiwanese companies started as manufacturers for U.S. and
European computer companies, but later became their strong rivals, Clayton
Christensen said at a forum in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Now, China could do the same as many Taiwanese companies have relocated their
manufacturing process to China, he noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese businesses need to focus on originality and design if they want to
counter a growing threat from Chinese companies, he said.</P>
      <P>It will not be easy, but it is something that Taiwan must do, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the professor said China-based Taiwanese companies should not just
rely on China's cheap labor for profits, but should also seek to minimize costs
of the entire production process following recent Chinese wage hikes.</P>
      <P>The cost of labor in China should be just one of the profitable advantages, he
added.</P>
      <P>His idea was echoed by Jonney Shih, chairman of Taiwanese computer maker Asustek
Computer Inc.</P>
      <P>Shih said that his company had diversified its profit sources by capitalizing on
its product design capability.</P>

      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, Taiwan's top negotiator with China, met with Chongqing
Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Secretary Bo Xilai
Wednesday ahead of his departure for home.</P>
      <P>Chiang, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , invited Bo, the top
CPC official in the southwestern Chinese municipality, to organize the largest-
ever Chinese provincial and municipal delegation to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Bo, however, did not respond to the invitation in public.</P>
      <P>If Bo, a member of the CPC's decision-making Political Bureau, were to visit
Taiwan, he would be the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit the country.</P>
      <P>Before the meeting, Chiang toured the Zhaomushan Botanical Gardens in the
company of his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president of the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , where the two top cross-strait
negotiators planted a ficus virens tree -- the city tree of Chongqing -- which
Chiang named "cooperation win-win."</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen made history in the city a day earlier by signing an economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) in their fifth biannual meeting since
2008, heralding a new era in cross-strait trade amid efforts to slash or
gradually remove barriers to bilateral trade and investment.</P>
      <P>Chiang and an SEF delegation were scheduled to leave for home later in the day,
concluding their three-day visit.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are two intermediary bodies set up to handle cross-strait
exchanges in the absence of diplomatic links.</P>
      <P>Talks between the two resumed in 2008 after being suspended in 1999 after then-
President  Lee Teng-huei  defined  cross-strait relations as a "special state-
to-state relationship, " irritating the Beijing regime.</P>
      <P>Since the resumption of talks, the two sides have inked 14 agreements covering a

      <P>During his meeting with Zedkaia, who was making his first official state visit
to Taiwan, Ma announced that Taiwan will donate 1,000 pairs of sunglasses to the
Marshall Islands to help reduce the prevalence of cataracts in the Pacific

      <P>Ma said the Republic of China and the Marshall Islands have enjoyed diplomatic

      <P>The landmark trade agreement -- economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
-- signed between Taiwan and China this week is the most important step in the
history of cross-Taiwan Strait relations, a U.S. expert on Taiwan issues said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"But the lasting impact will depend on where ECFA leads in terms of mutually
beneficial economic relations, and on the creation of a framework for peaceful
development of cross-strait ties over a long period of time," Alan Romberg, a
distinguished fellow and director of the East Asia Program at the Henry L.
Stimson Center, told the CNA.</P>
      <P>Under the trade agreement, which was signed Tuesday in Chongqing, China, the
tariffs for 539 Taiwanese goods and 267 Chinese products will be reduced to zero
within the two years after the pact takes effect.</P>
      <P>While the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou has hailed the outcome as
beneficial to Taiwan, there have been concerns that Chinese products and workers
may flood into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The opposition camp are arguing that the ECFA will benefit only a small minority
of Taiwan businesses, mostly big companies hoping for easier access to the
Chinese market, and alleged that the agreement will lead to the creation of a
"one China" market and undermine Taiwan's sovereign status.</P>
      <P>Romberg said many of the arguments against the ECFA are "long on political
rhetoric and short on underlying economic analysis."</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, he said, there are questions that will have to be answered by the
Ma administration, both about the benefits to Taiwan's economy and how anyone
hurt by ECFA will be helped.</P>
      <P>"The opposition has every right and responsibility to hold the administration's
feet to the fire to explain and justify the agreement," Romberg said.</P>

according to the results of a survey published Wednesday in Singapore's Chinese-

      <P>Some 31 percent of the young travelers polled said Taipei is top of the list of

      <P>The survey examined the preferences of the city state's young people, including
the most popular brands, video games and places to go.</P>

to young tourists.</P>
      <P>Philip Chao, director of Taiwan's Tourism Bureau Office in Singapore, said
Taipei offers tourists fine cuisine, high mountains and spectacular sea views

still bustling and humming with people and cars at all hours of the day and
night. Tourists can easily find everything from 24-hour bookstores and karaoke
clubs to late-night snack vendors and hot spring resorts.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's capital market has become more competitive after the signing of a major
trade pact with China, with many overseas Taiwanese investors studying the
possibility of listing on the island, Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp. (TWSE) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>TWSE said in a statement that the pact built on years of efforts to liberalize
its capital market, relax trading restrictions and improve market transparency
in an attempt to attract overseas Taiwanese investors to return and list on the
local main board and the over-the-counter market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China signed the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) in
Chongqing, China Tuesday. The pact will allow tariff waivers and easy market
access in China to 539 Taiwanese merchandise and service items.</P>
      <P>Allied Technologies Ltd., a precision stamped metal part maker listed on the
main board of the Singapore Exchange, said it is investigating the effect of the
ECFA on Taiwan's relationship with China.</P>
      <P>Allied Technologies Chief Executive Officer Hsu Ching-yuh told the Central News
Agency that the trade pact with China is a milestone in Taiwan's economic
development and that the signing of the agreement  was considered  important to
Taiwanese investors in Singapore.</P>
      <P>Originally from Taiwan, Hsu said he expects Taiwan's economy to benefit from
increasing cross-strait economic exchanges and his company is evaluating the
feasibility of listing in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the stock  exchange  statement  said that many international
investors pay attention to Taiwan's capital market because the island is home to
major high-tech companies, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and
United Microelectronics Corp., the world's two largest chipmakers.</P>
      <P>The stock exchange has held a number of roadshows worldwide that were arranged
by renowned investment bankers and attended by many Taiwanese investors
overseas, it said.</P>
      <P>So far, U.S.-based integrated circuit designer Integrated Logic Memory Ltd. has
been listed on the main board, making it the only foreign  company to have a
primary listing in Taiwan,  while China-based TPK Holdings, a touch panel
provider, has passed a preliminary review for a primary listing on the main
board.</P>
      <P>According to TWSE, another 57 foreign-based companies have expressed interest in

    <TEXT>
      <P>Over 100 angry farmers from Dapu Township in Miaoli County staged their sixth
demonstration in the last two months Wednesday to protest against the county
government's forced expropriation of their land to make way for a private
business.</P>
      <P>The farmers claim that despite their vehement objections, the Miaoli county
government is forcibly taking over their ancestral farmland in order to sell it
to a computer company in a move that will add 23 hectares to the Jhunan Science
Park.</P>
      <P>"The government is acting like a ruthless bandit. We are being robbed in broad
daylight, " said Hung Hsiang, an organic farmer and secretary-general of the
Wanbao Borough Self-help Association, who said she will never sell her land, no
matter what price is offered.</P>
      <P>The row between the farmers and the county government has been going on for
months and although the residents have lodged several protests against the
expropriation, their demands have fallen on deaf ears, she added.</P>
      <P>"What we produce on our land provides food that feed millions of Taiwanese
people, including the president and the county magistrate. By taking our land,
they are cutting off their own food supplies, " Hung added.</P>
      <P>However, according to Chiang Sung-mao, the head of the Miaoli county
government's Economic Development Department, the county has done "nothing
wrong" and the entire process has been "perfectly legitimate."</P>
      <P>Chiang said that once the county received the green light for the project from
the Ministry of the Interior Construction and Planning Agency, it no longer
required permission from the actual owners of the land.</P>
      <P>"We have done everything according to the law. Moreover, we plan to compensate
the landowners by paying 40 percent over the value of the land, as well as a
relocation fee, " he said. He added that the landowners have no say whatsoever
as long as the MOI has deemed the project legitimate.</P>
      <P>County government Secretary-General  Yeh Chih-hang said the protesters were in
the minority and that over 98 percent of the local residents support the
expansion project, which he said will create thousands of jobs.</P>
      <P>On June 23, a group of protesters submitted a petition to the Presidential
Office to beseech President Ma Ying-jeou to place a moratorium on the project
until consensus has been reached and they were promised that further talks would
be held on the issue.</P>
      <P>However, 65-year-old rice farmer Hsu Jui-chen said that over 20 excavators were
dispatched the very next day to destroy the rice paddies and fruit that were
ready for harvest in the coming months.</P>
      <P>"Our family has tilled that land for five generations and my husband has always
planned on passing the land down to our children. The economy is so volatile
that we had hoped to keep the land so that even if our children lose their jobs,
they can always sustain themselves by farming," she lamented.</P>
      <P>Hsu added that she attended the protest alone, as her husband stayed home after
suffering a mental breakdown brought on by the stress of the expropriation.</P>
      <P>The protesters  met with Presidential  Office  staff again Wednesday, and again
they were promised that their case would be heard.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's ruling and opposition parties are still at odds over the legislative
procedure for the screening of the new economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>The trade pact that was signed Tuesday between Taiwan and China must be approved
by the Taiwan legislature before it can take effect.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) party whip Lin Hung-chih said Wednesday that while the ECFA is
not a "standard treaty, " it is similar in terms of its formality and content
and should be screened in accordance with "international precedence." This means
it should be debated and passed in the legislature as a "single package," Lin
said.</P>
      <P>However, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus argued that
the ECFA is a treaty and should be subject to the same legislative screening
process as all other bills, which means it should be debated and approved clause
by clause.</P>
      <P>"The opposition will stage the strongest possible protest if the KMT chooses to
ram the pact through the legislature in disregard of public opinion." said DPP
legislative caucus leader Trong Chai.</P>
      <P>"How can an agreement signed by two civilian groups be viewed as a treaty?" DPP
Legislator Pan Meng-an asked.</P>
      <P>Screening the ECFA as a single package will contravene the principles of
democracy and deprive lawmakers of their right to perform their duties as
required by the Constitution, Pan said.</P>
      <P>The ECFA, which seeks to liberalize cross-strait trade, was signed in Chongquing
Tuesday by the heads of two quasi-official intermediary bodies -- Taiwan's
Straits Exchange Foundation and China's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits -- in the absence of official ties between the two sides.</P>
      <P>According to Chai and Pan, the KMT caucus' proposal for screening the ECFA only
pays lip service to the idea of robust scrutiny. However, they did not detail
what action the DPP caucus might take if the KMT, which has a strong majority in
the 113-seat legislature, decides to proceed with its plan.</P>
      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said that because of the unique nature of the
relations between Taiwan and China, the ECFA should be viewed as a "cross-strait
agreement" rather than an international treaty. The legislative procedure for
screening the pact should be determined through bipartisan negotiations in the
legislature over the next few days, he said.</P>
      <P>In related news, several academic and social groups announced Wednesday that
they will form an alliance to monitor the execution of the ECFA and any other
agreements that may be forged between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>"People from all walks of life should oversee the ECFA, from the perspectives of
democracy, human rights, environmental protection, labor rights and the rights
of the less privileged, instead of giving way to political confrontation," said
Lai Chung- chiang, head of the preparatory committee for the alliance.</P>
      <P>Chang Feng-yi, chairman of the Taiwan Labor Front that is one of the groups
which will be part of the Alliance for Supervising Cross-strait Agreements, said
that there was a lack of transparency in the signing of the ECFA and that it is
still unclear how the pact will affect Taiwan industries and workers.</P>
      <P>Under the government plan, only employers are eligible to apply for government
subsidies for any losses resulting from the ECFA, which leaves employees as the
biggest victims of the pact, Chang said.</P>
      <P>"The alliance will monitor not only the administrative but also the legislative
branches of the government with regard to the ECFA and other cross- strait
agreements," he added.</P>
      <P>The alliance, which will be launched July 10, will also include the Taiwan
Association for Human Rights, the Taiwan Society, the Citizen Congress Watch and
Taiwan Law Society.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinatrust has no plans to renegotiate Nan Shan deal</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinatrust Financial Holding Co. Ltd. said Wednesday it has no plans to
renegotiate with Hong Kong-listed China Strategic on the acquisition of a stake
in Taiwan-based Nan Shan Life Insurance.</P>
      <P>Chinatrust Financial signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with China
Strategic in November 2009 to acquire a 30-percent stake in Nan Shan Life after
a consortium led by China Strategic and Hong Kong's Primus Financial  Holdings
completes  a deal to buy a 97.57-percent stake in Nan Shan Life from debt-ridden
American International Group (AIG).</P>
      <P>However, the MOU expired June 25, while the Hong Kong consortium has not yet
completed the Nan Shan Life stake acquisition.</P>
      <P>Last week, the Hong Kong consortium and AIG extended the deadline of the
acquisition from July 12 to Oct 12, as the deal is still being screened by the
Taiwanese authorities.</P>
      <P>During the company's annual general meeting, Chinatrust Financial President
Daniel Wu said his company has no immediate plans to extend the MOU and also
sees no need to renegotiate with China Strategic on the Nan Shan Life stake
deal.</P>
      <P>Wu said the company will not do anything until the completion of the AIG-Hong
Kong consortium deal.</P>
      <P>Under the MOU, Chinatrust Financial agreed to buy the Nan Shan stake for US$660
million, and in turn, China Strategic would take a nearly 10 percent stake in
Chinatrust Financial worth NT$20.8 billion (US$646 million) via a private
placement.</P>
      <P>Chinatrust Financial reached the agreement with China Strategic after it lost
its bid to the Hong Kong consortium to buy Nan Shan Life from AIG in October
2009.</P>
      <P>The deal between AIG and the Hong Kong consortium has come under close scrutiny
amid concerns among Taiwan's financial regulators that the consortium is backed
by Chinese capital and has no experience operating a life insurer.</P>
      <P>Nan Shan Life is the largest life insurer in Taiwan, with approximately 4
million policyholders and about 4,000 employees.</P>

      <P>A record number of students from St. Lucia have been granted scholarships this
year by the Taiwan government, mainly because of the good performance of those
already studying in Taiwan, according to Taiwan's ambassador to the Caribbean
country.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Ambassador to St. Lucia Tom Chou said Wednesday that with the support and
promotional efforts of the St. Lucian government, more and more students have
been applying for Taiwan scholarships.</P>
      <P>In 2007, after Taiwan and St. Lucia resumed diplomatic ties, four students were
granted scholarships to study in Taiwan. Since then the number has been
increasing annually to five in 2008, nine in 2009, and 14 this year, he said at
a scholarship award ceremony at St. Lucia's National ICT Center.</P>
      <P>Alongside the increase in numbers, the quality of the students' performance has
also been improving,  Chou said,  adding that universities in Taiwan have spoken
well about the St. Lucian students.</P>
      <P>Half of the 14 scholarship winners this year will be funded under the Taiwan
Scholarship Program, and the other half under Taiwan's International Cooperation
and Development Fund.</P>
      <P>Chou said that Taiwan's success in technology is based on its emphasis on
education, and he hopes the St. Lucian students who obtain Taiwan scholarships
can become the backbone of their country's development.</P>
      <P>St. Lucia's Human Resource Development Minister Leonard Montoute and Education
Minister Arsene James both said at the ceremony that apart from the main course
of study, the scholarship students have an opportunity to learn Mandarin and to
experience different cultures.</P>
      <P>The two ministers also encouraged the students to be cultural ambassadors for
their country while in Taiwan and to return to make a contribution to St.

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States welcomes the signing of a historical cross-Taiwan Strait trade
agreement and its policy on arm sales to Taiwan remains unchanged, the top U.S.
diplomat in Taiwan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"We welcome the kind of interaction between Taiwan and the mainland that leads
to an agreement like this which can contribute to peace, stability and
prosperity in the region. We're encouraged by this development, " said William
Stanton, Director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Taipei Office, on
the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), which was signed by
Taiwanese and Chinese officials in Chongqing, China Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The agreement, which still has to be reviewed by Taiwans legislature before
going into effect, aims to liberalize cross-Strait trade with measures including
reduce tariffs, relax trade regulations and allow market access to each other.</P>
      <P>Stanton said that the AIT, the U.S. representative office in Taiwan, hasno
comments on the agreement per se because we haven't read the complete texts and
haven't had the chance to study it, but in general the U.S. would like to
emphasize the positive development of the pact since it indicatesa level of
interaction and cooperation that's welcomed by the region and the world.</P>
      <P>He went on to deny a report in a U.S.-based Defense News magazine, which cited
sources in Washington and Taipei and reported that the U.S. State Department has
frozen three congressional notifications for new arm sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>No matter what the press may say, we abide by the TRA and what stipulated there.
We continue on a regular basis to assess Taiwan's needs and to act with
accordance to the assessment. Nothing's changed in our policy on arms sales to
Taiwan,he said.</P>
      <P>Stanton  noted  that there  is noschedulein  terms  of notification, which will
only occurwhen you need to notify the Congress because the arm sale is going to
take place.</P>
      <P>So until that happens -- until the U.S. government makes a decision  --  there's
no  notification.  I think  there's  a misunderstanding,he added.</P>
      <P>The U.S. announced January 29 that it planned to sell US$6.4 billion worth of
arms to Taiwan, which subsequently sparked Chinas protest.</P>
      <P>According to the Defense News report, three notifications have been frozen to
until spring next year but the contents of those notifications were not
confirmed. It also reported that a program to upgrade Taiwans aging F-16 A/B
fighter aircraft was not included in the freeze as it has yet to enter the

      <P>The Gaomei wetland in central Taiwan's Taichung County, one of the most
important wildlife sanctuaries along Taiwan's coastline, has been polluted by
waste heavy oil dumped by unknown sources, environmental officials said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The waste oil pollution, stretching for nearly 2 kilometers and covering some
1,000 square meters of the wetland, is the worst man-made environmental damage
the sanctuary has sustained in recent memory, said Jiang Chu-nung, head of the
central Taiwan environmental monitoring corps under the Cabinet-level
Environmental Protection Administration.</P>
      <P>"Initial investigations show that the heavy oil comes from utility boilers,"
said Jiang.</P>
      <P>As there are no such plants in the immediate region, Jiang said, the oil is
believed to have been illegally dumped there.</P>
      <P>The Taichung county government's environmental department has launched a probe
into the cause of the pollution and according to the department, the oil could
have been dumped from fuel tankers.</P>
      <P>Local police said they were scrutinizing video monitor footage in hope of
identifying the culprits.</P>
      <P>More than 100 county cleanup crew and environmental volunteers had been
mobilized to clean up the waste oil since the previous night and county
officials said floating booms had been deployed to prevent any further spread of
the oil. Firefighters have also put absorbent fibers on the beach to absorb and
contain the oil slick.</P>
      <P>"About a quarter of the polluted area is wetland subject to strict protection, "
said Lee Tai-chuan,  head of the county government's conservation department.</P>
      <P>"It is tragic that someone has unscrupulously damaged the wetland that we have
been so painstakingly working to conserve," she added.</P>
      <P>After leading a group of Tunghai University professors to inspect the polluted
region Wednesday morning, Lee said an endangered wetland plant species
Bolboschoenus planiculmis (F. Schmidt) T. Koyama was seriously polluted and
might be wiped out. Other special wetland species such as fiddler crabs and
various fish have also sustained damage, she added.</P>
      <P>However, through the concerted efforts of the environmental officials and
volunteers, the slick has roughly been contained, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The Gaomei wetland, located on the south bank of the Dajia River estuary, has
abundant natural diversity, especially the migratory birds and plants found in
the area. Since the wetland is the biggest one in Taiwan and so rich in terms of
both landscape and ecosystem, it draws tens of thousands of visitors every year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AmCham calls for better business climate in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) said Wednesday that Taiwan should
continue to improve its domestic business climate, as a landmark trade pact
signed between Taiwan and China a day earlier is not enough to help Taiwan
attract foreign investment.</P>
      <P>"In fact, ECFA (economic cooperation framework agreement) -- while very
important -- is not in itself enough to restore Taiwan's luster as an investment
destination, " AmCham Chairman Alan Eusden told a press briefing as the business
alliance unveiled its annual white paper.</P>
      <P>"It does, however, present a rare opportunity, since many international
companies and research institutes over the coming months or year may be taking a
fresh look at Taiwan," he noted.</P>
      <P>"It will be crucial to use that time to make substantial improvements in the
domestic business climate," he said.</P>
      <P>Eusden said, for example, that although Taiwan has done well in intellectual
property rights protection, it is now seeing "the growth of smuggling from
China, " including low-quality pesticides that pose a health risk.</P>
      <P>AmCham also welcomes the government's recent decision to cut the corporate
income tax rate to as low as 17 percent, but that has also led to other
problems, in that "it has created certain imbalances in relation to the personal
income tax rate that needs to be addressed."</P>
      <P>In terms of the financial sector, Taiwan should work to revive its goal of
becoming an asset-management and fundraising center for the region, he told
reporters.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the country should both upgrade its educational system and ease
regulations to make it more attractive to foreign and Chinese business
professionals, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese government officials have said that Taiwan has become a more favorable
environment for foreign investors than its main rival, South Korea, due to the
signing of the ECFA and the lowering of the corporate income tax.</P>
      <P>They also describe Taiwan as an ideal springboard for foreign companies that
plan to invest in China thanks to the signing of the ECFA and Taiwan's better
cultural understanding of China.</P>
      <P>The AmCham chairman, however, said that it is too early to tell what kind of
companies or how much investment will be likely to be attracted to Taiwan as
result of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>At the press briefing, AmCham also urged Taiwan not to rely too much on the
Chinese market, a concern shared by critics of the administration of President
Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>"It will also be important for Taiwan, as it fosters improved cross-Strait
economic relations, to balance that with strong ties to the United States so as
not to become over-dependent on any one market," Eusden said.</P>
      <P>"Unfortunately, the U.S.-Taiwan economic relationship has been disrupted for the
past several years by Taiwan's continued ban on the import of certain cuts of
U.S. beef," he noted.</P>
      <P>In addition to sending the message to Taiwan, Eusden urged the U.S. to give
"careful attention and consideration" to Taiwan as Taiwan is not a small market,
but the U.S.'s ninth-largest trading partner.</P>
      <P>He said the U.S. should "seek the early scheduling of TIFA (Trade and Investment
Framework Agreement) talks with Taiwan" to continue to move "this very
important" economic relationship forward.</P>
      <P>AmCham also called on the U.S. government to prepare to grant visa- waiver
privileges for Taiwanese travelers.</P>

      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Wednesday that the Taiwan government will
continue to seek preferential treatment for local banks, negotiate on a cross-
Taiwan Strait currency settlement mechanism and push for free trade agreements
with other countries, in the wake of a trade pact that it signed with China
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a speech on how Taiwan's banking and financial sector should face the new
situation across the Taiwan Strait, Siew said that according to the spirit of
the agreement, it should be implemented gradually rather than in one step.</P>
      <P>The follow-up to the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) will be
carried in three broad areas, he said.</P>
      <P>First, the government will continue to ask China to give preferential treatment
to Taiwan banks, financial institutions, insurance firms, and security companies
that wish to operate in the Chinese market, he said. The incentives should take
the form of easier access to market, capital, and locations, which would allow
the institutions to establish footholds in China in the shortest possible time,
he added.</P>
      <P>Second, the negotiations on a cross-strait currency settlement mechanism will
continue, in an effort to address the problems of high currency exchange
transaction fees and high levels of risk in currency trading, Siew said.</P>
      <P>Such a mechanism would help Taiwan to develop into a major offshore center for
the Chinese yuan (renminbi) business and to upgrade its financial status in the
Asia Pacific region, according to the vice president.</P>
      <P>Third, Taiwan must step up its efforts to sign FTAs with other countries  in
order to obtain better opportunities  for local businesses, he said.</P>
      <P>In its bid to gain accession to the World Trade Organization in 2002, Taiwan
promised, among other things, to open its financial market wider to allow some
of its trading partners fair access, but this put local financial institutions
at a competitive disadvantage, he noted.  This problem can be tackled by forging
other free trade agreements, he said.</P>

      <P>"We hope China would honor its promise not to hobble Taiwan's attempts to expand

      <P>Wang Yi, Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under the Beijing's  State

adequately" deal with issues related to Taiwan's efforts to forge other FTAs
after the signing of a cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA).</P>
      <P>Beijing has been blamed for Taiwan's failure to achieve FTAs with its major
trading partners.</P>
      <P>Wang's remarks were interpreted by some analysts as a signal that Beijing might
be ready to ease its rigid stance on Taiwan seeking FTAs.</P>
      <P>"Wang's remarks are indicative  of Beijing's sincerity  in promoting cross-
strait peace and prosperity amid warming relations between Taiwan and China, "
Premier Wu said at an award ceremony in Taipei for outstanding public service.</P>
      <P>"Wang's remarks are laudable and I hope this kind of sincerity on the part of
China could be converted into action in many areas, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>Beijing should not continue to boycott Taiwan's participation in non-political
international organizations such as the International Civil Aviation
Organization  and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or
in non-governmental organizations, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An international survey has ranked the "civic understanding"  of Taiwanese
eighth-grade  students  as fourth-highest  among 38 countries that teach civic
education, according to the lcoal conductor of the survey.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan Normal University professor Lin Mei-huei unveiled the results of
her study and of the 2009 International Civic and Citizenship Education Study
(ICCS) initiated by the International Association for the Evaluation of
Education Achievement (IEA) at a news conference in Taipeia day earlier.</P>
      <P>Lin was commissioned by the Cabinet-level National Science Council to carry out
the ICCS survey in Taiwan between 2007 and 2009.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the average score of Taiwanese students in tests of their
civic understanding was 559 points, higher than the international average level
of 500 points.</P>
      <P>The performance put Taiwan fourth in the world, behind Finland, Denmark and
South Korea. Lin attributed the high ranking to the importance Taiwan attaches
to intellectual education.</P>
      <P>Addressing the definition of "civic understanding, " Lin cited as an example
that the surveyed students were asked to answer questions such as: "Why would a
student refuse to wear his new shoes after learning that they were produced in a
factory that employs child labor?"</P>
      <P>The answer is that he "does not want to support the factory that made the shoes,
" Lin said, noting that the questions were about civic concepts rather than
traditional civic education questions like: "What is the voting age?"</P>
      <P>Although  Taiwanese  students  performed  well  in  civic understanding, they
were less successful in terms of "attitude" and "values," Lin went on.</P>
      <P>For example,  Taiwanese eighth graders' support for gender equality rights
ranked first in the world, but the degree of their trust in the government,
political parties and the media was lower than the international average, she
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese students were found to be keen to participate in class activities but
reluctant to take part in human rights campaigns outside school, according to
Lin.</P>
      <P>"The percentage of the students who had never taken part in civic activities
off-campus  was also higher than the international average," Lin added.</P>
      <P>Her research team also found that the teachers who took part in the survey
mostly believed the country needs to increase lessons on civic education.</P>
      <P>The team suggested that the government should initiate civic activities in which
parents can take part, thereby establishing platforms for individual families,
communities and schools to interact.</P>
      <P>A total of 5,167 eighth graders,  2,367 teachers and 150 principals from 150
schools in Taiwan took part in the survey.</P>

      <P>After the raging success of "Cape No. 7" and "Monga, " Taiwans domestic film
industry is ready to present nine more films, starting in August, to showcase
the country's creativity, the Government Information Office said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, Taiwan movies such as "Pinoy Sunday" and "Au Revoir Taipei"
won acclaim from audiences as well as critics. The GIO said it hopes the
industry will continue to ride the wave of popularity for the rest of the year.</P>
      <P>"Since 2008, with the release of 'Cape No.7', domestic films have been receiving
more support and public recognition," said Frank Chen, director of the
Department of Motion Pictures. "However, there is still room for improvement and
the GIO is fully behind the movement."</P>
      <P>To encourage more people to join the film industry, the GIO has set up a program
under which the government can guarantee loans to aspiring producers, and the
GIO can cover up to 3 percent of the interest, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, producers and directors of films that take in more than NT$20 million
at the box office will automatically receive a substantial subsidy for their
next project, he said.</P>
      <P>"The efforts to revive Taiwan's domestic film industry require everyone's
support, " he said. "We are urging people to go see the movies at a theater
instead of watching pirated copies of the film."</P>
      <P>Starting in August, nine locally made films of various genres will be released
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The Fourth Portrait, " starring Golden Horse winner Leon Dai, is a drama about
a 10 year-old boy who communicates through his drawings when he is forced to
live with his estranged mother after his father dies.</P>
      <P>The comedy "Bed Man" follows the antics of a mattress salesman with an over-
active imagination who is torn between his mistress and his pregnant wife.</P>
      <P>"In Case of Love" is the first Taiwanese movie to deal with the subject of the

      <P>The European Union (EU) lauded the "constructive measures" Taiwan and China have
taken with the signing of a historical trade agreement, saying Wednesday that
the pact will contribute to regional stability.</P>
      <P>"The European Union believes that the expansion of cross-strait economic
relations has a potential also to benefit the development of its already
significant trade and investment links in East Asia, " said Catherine Ashton,
the EU High Representative for foreign affairs and security policy.</P>
      <P>The Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) , signed Tuesday in
Chongqing, China, aims to liberalize cross-strait trade by reducing tariffs,
relaxing trade regulations and allowing better market access.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government has said it hopes that the pact will boost the country's
economy and employment and prevent it from being marginalized in the economic
integration process in East Asia.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued the day after the signing of the ECFA, Ashton reiterated
that, in the context of the EU's one-China policy, the EU believes that the
"Taiwan question" must be resolved through dialogue between all concerned
parties.</P>
      <P>Ashton said she appreciates and supports the efforts of both sides to find
pragmatic solutions and peacefully develop relations.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan government should seek to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with its
major trading partners, including the United States, in the wake of its landmark
trade pact with China, an industrial federation official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"I think Taiwan should turn itself into a free trade island by easing its
regulations to pave the way for FTAs with other countries, " said Hsu Sheng-
hsiung, a vice chairman of the Taipei-based Chinese National Federation of
Industries, at a press conference.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's should pursue FTAs with its major trading partners such as the United
States, Japan, the European nations and Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) countries, he suggested.</P>
      <P>While the newly signed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) will help
Taiwan to become a platform for international investors seeking to enter China,
the Taiwanese government should also lend support to China-based Taiwanese
companies, he urged.</P>
      <P>"I think it is important now (for the government) to think about how to help
small- and medium-sized companies to expand their operations, enhance their
competitiveness and reduce their costs in mainland China," he said.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, the federation released its annual white paper, in
which it urged the government to continue to improve the domestic business
climate and crack down on counterfeit goods.</P>
      <P>The federation also asked the government to promote Taiwan-made goods
internationally to help local companies explore overseas markets.</P>

      <P>The economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) that Taiwan signed with
China Tuesday cannot be likened to the closer economic partnership arrangements
(CEPA) that Hong Kong and Macau inked with China, a mainland affairs official
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The ECFA is an economic deal signed on an equal footing by two members of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) on the basis of WTO principles, according to
Mainland Affairs Council Deputy Chairman Kao Charng.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the CEPA is an economic arrangement between China and Hong Kong
and China and Macau based on the "one country, two systems" model, Kao said.
Under the CEPA,  there are no WTO trade-restriction safeguards on either side to
protect local products from competition from imports, he said.</P>
      <P>Kao made the remarks in response to media reports that the ECFA partially
excludes the right of each side to use WTO trade remedies and thus could weaken
Taiwan's market against imports from China.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party also questioned whether the fact
that the ECFA was signed on the same date as the CEPA between China and Hong
Kong in 2003 means that Taiwan is about to become the next Hong Kong or Macau.</P>
      <P>In response, Kao said that the ECFA gives Taiwan the right to apply WTO
safeguards, as both Taiwan and China are full WTO members.</P>
      <P>Kao dismissed the speculations over the significance of the date as far-fetched,
noting that Japan declared war on the U.S. on Dec 8, 1941 and signed a security
treaty with on the U.S. same date in 1951. The two events  had very different
historical  and political connotations, he said.</P>

      <P>The semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) ,  which
will celebrate its 40th anniversary July 1, will hold an exquisite products fair
in China a week later, it said.</P>
      <P>It will be the first large-scale exhibition of its kind after the signing of a
landmark economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and
China on June 29 in Chongqing, China, TIATRA said.</P>
      <P>The 2010 Taiwan exquisite products fair, which will open in Tianjin on July 8,
was designed exclusively to help Taiwan businesses that are on the ECFA's "early
harvest list" to gain a bigger slice of China's vast consumption market, TAITRA
said.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the trade agreement, 539 Taiwanese items and 267 categories
of Chinese goods will be eligible for zero-tariff treatment within two years
after the implementation of the ECFA. The Taiwan-made products range from shoes,
bicycles, and machine tools to sports products.</P>
      <P>At the TIATRA fair, 791 Taiwan companies, 200 of which are on the early harvest
list, will showcase their products at 1,900 booths in northern China's Hebei
Province.</P>
      <P>Now in its 40th year, TAITRA has offices in Guangzhou, Nanjing, Dalian, Wuhan,
Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, Chengdu and Xiamen to help Taiwan companies explore
the China market.</P>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, Straits
Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun are expected to take part in TIATRA's anniversary
celebrations.</P>
      <P>TAITRA was set up in 1970 jointly by the government and major business
associations to help promote foreign trade, as the country was in a difficult
position internationally as a result of its decades-old feud with China.</P>

      <P>Germany's foreign ministry thinks that China's attitude will be a key factor in
any possible free trade agreement between Taiwan and the European Union, a
Taiwan lawmaker reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Kuomintang lawmaker Lin Yu-fang, officials in charge of the German
foreign ministry's East Asian affairs division said that China's attitude is
very important, but declined to say directly whether the European Union would be
willing to negotiate an FTA with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin, who concluded a visit to Germany along with other Taiwan lawmakers
Wednesday,  did not reveal the names of the German officials.</P>
      <P>His remarks came one day after Taiwan and China signed an economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) to further liberalize bilateral trade.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government is hoping that the signing of the ECFA will usher in a new
era in which China will desist from obstructing Taiwan's efforts to ink similar
pacts with other countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mathieu Duchatel, a research fellow at the Asia Centre at Sciences Po
Paris, said that the ECFA will contribute to Taiwan's efforts to expand its
international role.</P>
      <P>However, Duchatel said it seems unlikely that Taiwan and China will engage in
any political dialogue in the near future.</P>
      <P>Also on Wednesday, a spokesman for Japan's foreign ministry told the Central
News Agency that Japan welcomes the ECFA and expects Taiwan and China to engage
in direct and peaceful dialogue.</P>
      <P>Japan will keep a close eye on the developments of the ECFA, including its
impact on Japan's economy, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The United States also welcomed the signing of the landmark trade agreement
between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>"We welcome the kind of interaction between Taiwan and the mainland that leads
to an agreement like this which can contribute to peace, stability and
prosperity in the region," said William Stanton, director of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Taipei Office, Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"We're encouraged by this development, " he added.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese tennis player Lu Yen-hsun lost to the world No. 3 Novak Djokovic of
Serbia in straight sets Wednesday, which stopped Lu short of the semifinal in
the 2010 Wimbledon Tennis Championship.</P>
      <P>Lu, 26, appeared not be in top form, as he lost 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 in one hour and 51
minutes to the third-seeded Djokovic.</P>
      <P>Djokovic, the 2008 Australian Open winner, was almost flawless in the match,
blasting 29 winners over Lu's 13.</P>
      <P>Despite being eliminated, Lu, who is currently ranked 82nd in the world, is
expected to make the top 50 in the latest world ranking for the first time in
his career with his berth in the Wimbledon quarterfinal.</P>
      <P>Lu scored a marathon upset early Tuesday when he beat the world No. 7 Andy
Roddick of the U.S. and became the first Taiwanese tennis player to advance to
the quarterfinal round in a Grand Slam tournament.</P>
      <P>According to Wimbledon broadcaster STAR TV, around 620,000 fans stayed up
Tuesday to watch Lu's epic win over Roddick, which made headlines on almost

      <P>Recycling stations will be opened at 1,500 drug stores around Taiwan Thursday
for the collection of expired or unused medications in an effort to prevent
environmental pollution, a national federation of pharmacist groups said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The recycling stations are being set up to encourage people to join the
campaign against environmental  pollution by properly disposing of drugs and
other medical products, " said Lien Jui-meng, president of the Union of
Pharmacist Associations.</P>
      <P>According to a survey by a research team headed by Chen Chia-yang, a National
Taiwan University associate professor, traces of fever reducers, pain relievers,
antibiotics and lipid lowering drugs have been found in major rivers in central
and northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although these medications have tested safe for human ingestion, they may cause
ecological changes if they dumped in rivers, as long-term exposure to
contaminated river water may affect the growth of aquatic plants and fish
species, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, antibiotics can remain viable in the environment for more than a year,
leading to an increase in drug-resistant bacteria, he added.</P>
      <P>In addition to dissuading local people from taking unnecessary medications, Lien
said, the federation will coordinate with local drug stores to recycle solid and
liquid drugs that have not been used for more than six months.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will hold an international press conference Thursday to
explain Taiwan's economic strategy in the wake of an economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) that it signed with China a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Ma will discuss industrial transformation, attracting foreign investment and
measures to help industries that may be adversely affected by the ECFA,
according to officials familiar with the matter.</P>
      <P>The president, who sees innovation as the centerpiece of his government's
economic strategy, is expected to talk about his administration's plan to pool
resources from the public and private sectors to build Taiwan into a global
innovation center, on the basis of the Industry Innovation Act and the ECFA with
China.</P>
      <P>Ma said a few days ago that the ECFA would inject new life into Taiwan's economy
and that Taiwan will continue to seek to place the fishery industries on the
ECFA's early harvest list for preferential tariff treatment.</P>
      <P>He also said the government will continue to negotiate with China to ink an
investment guarantee agreement and set up a dispute settlement mechanism.</P>
      <P>At a ruling Kuomintang  Central Standing Committee meeting Wednesday, Ma, who is
also KMT chairman, said the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's move to
hold a protest against a one-China market is "pointless" as the ECFA will not
lead to a one-China market.</P>
      <P>In one-China market, there must be at least a customs union that would require
its members to adopt a common external tariff, he said.</P>
      <P>However, "we have not adopted a common external tariff with China, "Ma said,
adding that the DPP's argument is "unprofessional."</P>
