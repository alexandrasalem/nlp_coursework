    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan does not exclude the possibility of
unification with China at some point in the future if the latter
becomes a democratic country, Taiwan's top envoy in Germany said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking in an interview on German television, Shieh Jhy-wey said
that what he is opposed to is the threats posed by China's
totalitarianism to Taiwan's freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>The envoy also questioned the restrictions imposed by German
authorities on the designation used by Taiwan's representative office
in the country. He pointing out that the two countries share a close
economic and trade relationship, with Germany being Taiwan's most
important trading partner in Europe and Taiwan being Germany's fourth
largest trading partner in Asia.</P>
      <P>"The designation of Taiwan's representative office in Berlin as
'the Taipei Representative Office' does not adequately represent
Taiwan," he said.</P>
      <P>Shieh further said that he respects Germany's "One China" policy
and its position of not officially recognizing Taiwan, adding,
however, that he hopes Berlin will at least pay proper attention to
the fact of Taiwan's existence in order to have exchanges with the
island in a fairer and more open manner.</P>
      <P>Talking about cross-Taiwan Strait relations, the envoy said that
Taiwan does not exclude the possibility of unification with China at
some time in the future if China becomes a democratic country.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Shieh also invited German tourists to come
visit Taiwan, pointing out that Taiwan now offers visa-free treatment
to German citizens for stays of up to 30 days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>10 PEOPLE CONTRACT AIDS/HIV EVERYDAY IN TAIWAN: CDC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 10,414 cases of AIDS/HIV
infection have been reported in Taiwan up to the end of November
2005, with the number increasing rapidly over the past year at a rate
of 10 cases per day, according to data released Thursday by the
Center for Disease Control (CDC) on World AIDS Day.</P>
      <P>Of these AIDS/HIV cases, 9,872 are locals, CDC officials said.</P>
      <P>Unprotected sex between heterosexual couples has been the main
cause of these AIDS/HIV cases, which accounts for 49 percent of the
cases. Intravenous drug users account for 41 percent, with 60 percent
to 70 percent of the new cases reported this year being intravenous
drug users.</P>
      <P>While the AIDS/HIV cases include infants and elderly as old as
93, most of them fall in the 20-40 age group.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Lin Ting attributed the fast spread
of AIDS/HIV in Taiwan to the open attitude toward sex by the younger
generation, the popularity of sex orgies, the seldom use of condoms
during sexual intercourse, and the increase in the number of
intravenous drug users.</P>
      <P>Calling on the public to show their concern and care for AIDS
patients, Lin said the transmissibility of HIV is much lower than
that of bird flu and tuberculosis and that the public should not
discriminate against AIDS patients because of fear or a
misunderstanding of the disease.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VISA-FREE PERIOD FOR JAPANESE VISITORS MAY BE EXTENDED TO 90 DAYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is assessing whether or not to extend
the existing 30-day visa-free treatment for Japanese tourists to 90
days as a reciprocal response to Japan's recent move of lifting visa
requirements for Taiwanese tourists, a foreign affairs official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Liao Ching-pang, deputy chief executive officer of the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs' Committee on Japanese Affairs, said that consular
affairs officials are studying the case. At present, 30 days is the
longest visa-free period that Taiwan grants to any country.</P>
      <P>Japan announced in mid-September that it would offer permanent
visa-free privileges to travelers from Taiwan starting Sept. 26 as a
belated reciprocal measure since Taiwan has long offered visa-free
treatment to Japanese tourists.</P>
      <P>Liao also said that exchanges between Taiwan and Japan have been
largely boosted in recent months, with Taiwan hosting eight Japanese
parliamentarian delegations and 30 civil group delegations in the
past two months.</P>
      <P>The significant contact between the two nations recently includes
the 30th Taiwan-Japan economic and trade conference which was held in
Tokyo on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1.</P>

from the committee and department of treaty and legal affairs, as

    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking sports official said Thursday
that the National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports (NCPFS)
under the Executive Yuan will cautiously deal with China's suggestion
that Taiwan and China jointly host the 2008 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>Chu Show-chien, vice chairman of the council, made the comments
in response to a Chinese sports leader's recent proposal that certain
events of the 2008 Olympic Games could be held on the island.</P>
      <P>According to Yuan Weimin, honorary chairman of the Chinese
Olympic Committee, Taiwan could host some events, such as baseball,
archery and taekwondo.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chu said that if the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
decided that they wanted to jointly host the Olympic Games, they
would first have to seek approval from the International Olympic
Committee. He added that "as the cross-strait issue is very
complicated and politically sensitive, it wouldn't be simple for them
to do what they wanted to do."</P>
      <P>Besides, Chu also questioned whether Yuan's suggestion carries
any weight, noting that the official has already retired.</P>
      <P>China's Taiwan policy, which has always taken political factors
into consideration, is aimed at downgrading Taiwan's position, Chu
further said, claiming that Yuan's proposal "is only for political
purposes."</P>
      <P>"The NCPFS cannot make any decisions on issues related to China
and Taiwan co-hosting the Olympic Games, but it will closely watch
developments and deal with the matter cautiously," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GET OUT AND VOTE ON DECEMBER 3: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian called on the
country's citizens Thursday to turn out for the Dec. 3 "three-in-one"
elections to enjoy their right to be their own masters and manifest
the essence of democracy.</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue in the latest edition of his online
newsletter, Chen said people can have different opinions on different
issues in a pluralistic, democratic society and that brainstorming
can lead to progressiveness.</P>
      <P>"It is not enough for us to sit down and talk; we also need to
stand up and act to bring our power into full play. The best
opportunity is to cast our sacred votes in every election, " Chen
said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the core value of democracy lies in the
people, rather than the government or political parties, because the
people are the true masters of the country.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is still a fledgling democracy, with its people having
only started to learn to be their own masters, it is a priority to
maintain the hard-fought democratic system and deepen the essence of
democracy through elections, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president said he hopes that every voter will turn out for
the upcoming elections to use their votes to express their stand,
instead of thinking that politics is the business of politicians.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that because many people are dissatisfied with the
current political situation in Taiwan, they are reluctant to come out
to vote for competent candidates.</P>
      <P>These people only start to express their displeasure and put the
blame on the government after those who were elected turn out to be
so incompetent that they lower the government's overall efficiency,
he said.</P>
      <P>"Such an indifferent attitude is the greatest harm to democracy.
Everyone should learn to play their roles as the masters of the
country and of themselves," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In addition to cherishing every opportunity to participate in an
election, it is most important for voters to turn down any offers to
buy their votes and reject candidates with gangster backgrounds who
are trying to expand their influence into politics through taking
part in elections, he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ultimate goal of elections is to choose the
virtuous and the capable, Chen said the people will only lead a happy
life if they elect county and city chiefs, county and city
councilors, and township and village heads who are serious about
their jobs and about serving the public.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's democracy still has room for improvement, the
country will one day emerge to become a pioneer in global democratic
reforms as long as more and more people in the country are willing to
express themselves with their votes, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Thursday that he will step down if KMT candidates
cannot take more than half of the seats -- 11 -- in the upcoming city
and county chief elections.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks when he attended a news conference convened
by Chou Hsi-wei, candidate of the KMT for Taipei County magistrate,
to drum up support for the Dec. 3 elections. Taipei County is
considered the key battleground between the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the KMT.</P>
      <P>Ma explained that the KMT currently rules in eight out of 23
cities and counties, but it has not nominated candidates in the
outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu. For this reason, he
said that by saying "more than half," he meant that if the KMT cannot
win 11 seats on Taiwan proper, he will resign from his post.</P>
      <P>He said that he has worked 18 hours a day, every day recently.
Though the islandwide stumping trips are tough, he has received
enthusiastic responses.</P>
      <P>During the at least 300 campaign rallies, he has felt acutely the
passion of the Taiwan people. Though these are local elections, they
cover 99 percent of the island and affect 89 percent of the people,
he added.</P>
      <P>Ma, already tipped as the KMT's standard-bearer in the 2008
presidential election, pointed out that the DPP has performed poorly
over the past five years, and has had to rely on smear tactics in
these elections.</P>
      <P>The more pathetic thing, according to Ma, is that bribery has
been even more serious than he imagined, saying that it has been the
most outrageous since he first took part in election campaigns.</P>
      <P>He urged the public to vote for the KMT in the Dec. 3 elections
if they want Taiwan to move upward and cast ballots for the DPP if
they want the island to sink further.</P>
      <P>But if people vote for the DPP, this also means that he has not
done a good job, and he is willing to step down from his post.</P>
      <P>With two more days to go before Saturday's "three-in-one"
elections, Ma appealed to the public to see the elections as a
"no-confidence vote" for the DPP, and expressed the hope that the KMT
will gain seats to continue its reform platform.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HALVING NUMBER OF STATE-OWNED BANKS CAN BE DONE: VICE PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Wu Rong-i said Thursday that
the government is confident of meeting the goal of halving the number
of state-owned banks to six as part of the ongoing "second-phase
financial reform" program by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks after attending a seminar on financial
reforms and strategies held at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic
Research, a local think tank.</P>
      <P>When it was pointed out that there was still one bank yet to be
dealt with, with only one month before the end of this year, he said
that although there is rampant speculation, the government has made
preparations and he is confident that the goal can be reached.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu also dismissed reports that the government does not
welcome the opposition parties to take part in a planned national
economic development advisory conference.</P>
      <P>He said that the government welcomes views from all quarters,
saying that the economy can only develop with a national consensus.</P>
      <P>He noted that compared with the previous economic development
advisory conference when the economic situation was worse, this time,
the government has made some strides in economic growth and reducing
jobless rates.</P>
      <P>The government will have to consider its next move for the
nation's economy, he said. Cross-strait trade will also be addressed
in the planned economic conference.</P>
      <P>During the first meeting, which took place in August 2001,
representatives from different sectors discussed a wide range of
issues concerning industry, finance, investment, labor affairs and
cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT POLICY NOT SUBJECT TO CHANGE BY ELECTIONS: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
his administration has maintained a consistent cross-strait policy
and it is not subject to any change by the results of the upcoming
local government elections.</P>
      <P>Answering journalists' questions during a breakfast meeting with
Lo Wen-chia -- the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's candidate
for Taipei County chief -- President Chen hinted that the DPP
administration's China policy will remain pragmatic but slightly
restrictive and conservative as it has been over the past five years
after the Dec. 3 "three-in-one" elections.</P>
      <P>Chen discounted allegations that Taiwan's China policy will
become more open and more relaxed in the event of a sweeping victory
by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang, the People
First Party and the New Party in the upcoming elections, arguing that
the country's cross-strait policy, including economic and trade
measures, will become even more restrictive should the "pan-blue
alliance" win because, he said, he will have to tighten the policy to
"safeguard the well-being and rights of the people."</P>
      <P>Taking last year's legislative election as an example, Chen said
that despite the victory of the "pan-blue alliance, " which is
pro-unification with China, Beijing passed its Anti-Secession Law a
few months afterward authorizing non-peaceful means if Taiwan edges
toward formal independence. The law, which was legislated in defiance
of opposition also from the United States, Japan and the European
Union, has forced Taiwan to tighten its cross-strait policy, he
added.</P>
      <P>The Dec. 3 "three-in-one" elections are for city mayors and
county magistrates, city and county councilors, and township and
village chiefs in 21 cities and counties islandwide as well as the
two outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BOFT DELEGATION TO INSPECT INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT IN BANGLADESH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) Deputy
Director-General Wu Hsin-hua led a trade delegation to Bangladesh
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu's delegation, comprised of local bicycle, shoe, and plastic
product manufacturers, is expected to assess the feasibility of
Taiwan businessmen investing in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, and
an export processing zone at Chittagong, the second-largest city and
the commercial capital city of Bangladesh.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials noted that Taiwan's bicycle manufacturers have
focused their investments in China and Vietnam. With the European
Union's recent imposition of an anti-dumping tax on Chinese and
Vietnamese bicycles exported to Europe, the impact on Taiwan
businessmen has been significant.</P>
      <P>Wu's delegation will help Taiwan businessmen reach out globally
and diversity their operational risks.</P>
      <P>The EU announced in July that it would impose an anti-dumping tax
up to 48.5 percent and 34.5 percent, respectively, on bicycles
exporting to the EU from China and Vietnam.</P>
      <P>The BOFT is actively wooing those high-priced bicycles (over
US$200 per unit) manufacturers that have their own brand names to
return to Taiwan and wants to help those Taiwan businessmen that
produce medium-priced bicycles to diversify their investments.
Bangladesh is one of the countries under consideration, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>They said that Bangladesh has an ample pool of laborers and low
wages. As an underdeveloped country, its products exported to the EU,
Japan and Canada enjoy quota and tariff-free treatment. The Dhaka
government also provides tax incentives to lure foreign businessmen
to invest in the country.</P>

      <P>Witnessing the inauguration of the Taipei
Arena sports center, Asia's synthesizing dance genius Lin Hwai-min
said Thursday that he looks forward to seeing the dome become a
"soul-nourishing haven" for Taipei residents.</P>
      <P>Lin, founder of the widely acclaimed Cloud Gate Dance Theater and
one of the "Asian Heroes" chosen by Time magazine in 2005, welcomed
the opening of the NT$4.6 billion (US$139.4 million) domed stadium
after five years of construction on the site of the former Taipei
Baseball Stadium near the intersection of Nanking East Road and
Tunhua North Road.</P>
      <P>In his opening speech, Lin recalled that Cloud Gate Dance Theater
maintained an office in a basement near the Nanking-Tunhua
intersection many years ago and whenever he was at the office and
heard the sounds from the baseball stadium, whether it was music,
songs or baseball fans' jubilation over a home run, he thought it was
the most beautiful sound in Taipei.</P>
      <P>After a hiatus of five years, he said, Taipei's most beautiful
sounds will be heard again after the 15,000-seat dome opens to
concerts and other performances.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the inaugural ceremony, Taipei Mayor Ma

where even the world renowned Cloud Gate Dance Theater can get a
reservation for only eight days each year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT URGES SWIFT DOH ACTION ON UNLAWFUL DISCLOSURE OF MEDICAL RECORDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Thursday urged the Department of Health (DOH) to set
up a task force to investigate the disclosure of Taichung Mayor
Janson Hu's medical records by a ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) legislator.</P>
      <P>At a breakfast meeting with representatives from the DOH and the
Taiwan Medical Association, KMT legislators said the DOH must take
swift action to deal with the apparent violation of the Doctor's Law
and medical ethics in order to restore public confidence in the
nation's health service.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, DPP Legislator Lin Chin-hsin, who is a practicing
physician, appeared at a news conference in Taichung with 11 other
doctors and disclosed what they claimed to be Hu's medical history
from the Taichung Veterans General Hospital.</P>
      <P>They demanded that Hu withdraw from the Dec. 3 elections because
they believed that his chances of having a stroke were 30 times that
of a healthy person.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislator did not explain how he obtained Hu's medical
records, nor was he able to confirm that the records were genuine. He
claimed that he did not violate medical ethics because Hu was not his
patient.</P>
      <P>Dr. Shao Ke-yung, director of the Taichung Veterans General
Hospital, told KMT lawmakers Thursday that he did not see the
document obtained by Lin and could not verify whether it was genuine.</P>
      <P>Shao added, however, that his hospital is rigid on rules about
the safekeeping of patients' health information, and that there was
no record showing that anyone had gone through regular channels to
look at the Taichung mayor's medical history.</P>
      <P>Replying to KMT legislators' questions, Chen Tzay-Jinn, deputy
head of the DOH, said the DOH has already asked the health
authorities in Taichung City to establish whether the 12 doctors
violated the Doctor's Law, and that it will be up to the local
medical associations to determine if these doctors violated the
ethics of the medical profession.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on the incident at a separate occasion, DOH
Minister Hou Shen-mao said it was very inappropriate for doctors to
publicize a patient's medical records. He stressed that it is a basic
ethical tenant that the medical profession should protect a patient's
privacy.</P>
      <P>Dr. Wu Nan-ho, chairman of the Taiwan Medical Association, said
in a statement Thursday that the behavior of the 12 doctors does not
represent the position of the nation's medical profession, and that
the association will take appropriate action according to medical
ethics when the investigation on the incident is completed.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus also distanced itself from Lin's
conduct. Caucus whip William Lai admitted that Lin's disclosure of
the Taichung mayor's medical records was against doctors' ethics. He
said that if the KMT legislators want an apology from the DPP caucus,
they should go directly to Lin.</P>
      <P>Another DPP legislator, Hsu Kuo-yung, also said he does not
approve of Lin's behavior. He urged Lin to face the consequences of
his actions.</P>

      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu is taking extra
safety precautions after receiving intelligence reports that threats
have been made to remove him from the Dec. 3 "three in one" elections.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the media Thursday, Hu, of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), acknowledged that the safety precautions include him bringing
his own food and water to campaign sites on his daily itinerary.</P>
      <P>Opinion poll results show that Hu, who is seeking re-election in
the central Taiwan city, is slightly ahead of Lin Chia-lung,
candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, and Shen
Chi-hui, candidate of the People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>According to an estimate by Hu's aides, the "pan-blue alliance"
of the KMT and the PFP might get 30,000 more votes than the DPP in
Taichung. If Shen receives more than 30,000 votes, Hu's chances of
re-election could be in jeopardy.</P>
      <P>On the DPP's attempt to focus public attention on his health, Hu
said that while he does not mind discussion of the issue, he will not
agree to the DPP's demand to publicize his medical records because
they would be misused.</P>
      <P>Hu said he will file a civil lawsuit after the elections against
DPP Legislator Dr. Lin Chin-hsin and 11 other medical doctors for
disclosing what they claimed to be his medical history, and that he
will donate whatever compensation he might receive from the
defendants to charity.</P>

      <P>The Alliance of Fairness and Justice
Thursday dismissed the tax rebates announced by the Cabinet a day
earlier as a trick aimed at grabbing votes in the Dec. 3
"three-in-one" elections.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh announced Wednesday that the standard
deduction for married couples filing their income tax jointly will be
increased from NT$67,000 (US$2,000) to NT$88,000 this year</P>
      <P>In line with the rise in consumer prices, the personal income tax
exemption will be hiked from NT$74,000 to NT$77,000 starting next
year. The standard deduction for married couples will be further
increased to NT$92,000, while the special deduction on salaries and
that for the mentally or physically challenged will each be raised by
NT$3,000.</P>
      <P>In addition, the exemptions and deductions for inheritance tax
and gift tax will also be hiked, with the tax rate differentials
widened.</P>
      <P>Chien Hsi-chieh, convener of the alliance, said increasing the
exemptions and deductions for inheritance tax and gift tax is similar
to lowering the tax rate, which he said will benefit people who
obviously are already very wealthy.</P>
      <P>The alliance will only agree to lowering the inheritance and gift
tax rates if overseas income and securities trading are made taxable
in Taiwan to prevent rich people from evading paying tax, Chien said.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng Chu-wei, a professor of public finance at
National Chengchi University, the Cabinet is cheating the people by
treating the tax deduction issue as if the government is granting
some kind of a favor to the people.</P>
      <P>Tseng pointed out that it is stipulated in related tax laws that
the exemptions, deductions and tax rate differentials should be
adjusted in accordance with the fluctuations of consumer prices.</P>

      <P>The Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement
(CEPA) pact signed by Hong Kong and China might affect some Taiwan
exports next year as the accord enters its third phrase, the Bureau
of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs warned
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exports of spectacle frames and synthetic fabrics might be
hindered after the Hong Kong-China CEPA enters its third year in
2006, BOFT officials said.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the third-phase CEPA, 261 items of Hong Kong
exports to China will be granted zero-tariff treatment, including
garment, synthetic fabrics, fruit juice, dried fish and some plastics
and chemical products, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Last year, Hong Kong exports of cotton fabrics and spectacle
frames to China were worth US$5.99 million and US$8.65 million, ahead
of Taiwan's US$1.59 million and US$3.17 million, respectively.</P>
      <P>With the 10 percent custom duties to be removed from the

outbound shipments to China will be further affected, the officials
pointed out.</P>
      <P>After the third-phase of the Hong Kong-China CEPD takes effect
early next year, it will bring the number of Hong Kong export items
eligible for China's zero-tariff privilege to 1,369, accounting for
only 18.7 percent of the 7,316 items listed in its tariff code after
China joined in the World Trade Organization by the end of 2001.</P>

Hsiu-yi did eight years ago for the then-DPP candidate for the Taipei
county magistrateship, Su Tsen-chang, who is now DPP chairman.</P>
      <P>Lu's kneeling at Su's last campaign rally ahead of the 1997
Taipei County election was believed to be among a constellation of
factors contributing to Su's victory by a narrow margin against his
then-ruling Kuomintang rival.</P>
      <P>"Lu was then a terminally ill cancer patient. He could not speak
for Su on that occasion. Therefore, he chose to kneel before the
voters to solicit their support for Su. It was a solemn and moving
moment, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>It's a wholly different thing for a normal and healthy candidate
or campaign aide to get on his knees and beg for ballots, Lin said,
adding that local voters should pay no heed to candidates' gratuitous
campaign gimmicks.</P>
      <P>Speaking while accompanying Chen on a vote-canvassing tour of an
open-air traditional marketplace in Lotung, Ilan County, Lin said he
decided to come out of retirement to stump for Chen, mainly to show
"warmth of friendship."</P>
      <P>"Chen is a good friend of mine of more than 30 years. He is a
respectable politician. I feel compelled to throw my support behind
him. I'm hopeful that all eligible voters will make the right choice
and elect a candidate who can serve the people selflessly," Lin said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, JAPAN STRIKE BASEL PACT ON HAZARDOUS WASTE MOVEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan forged a bilateral
agreement in Tokyo Thursday on international hazardous waste control
under the spirit of the Basel Convention in an effort to jointly help
conserve the environment.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Republic of China government, Yang Ching-hsi,
director-general of the Solid Waste Management Bureau under the
Environmental Protection Administration, signed the Taiwan-Japan
bilateral agreement, which reflects the environmentally sound
management of waste stipulated by the Basel Convention on the Control
of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste and its Disposal.</P>
      <P>The agreement was signed as a final touch to the 30th
Taiwan-Japan Economic and Trade Conference that opened in Tokyo
Wednesday and was attended by some 90 officials from the two
countries.</P>
      <P>The agreement marked the first time Taiwan has entered a
bilateral pact on environmental protection efforts with another
country based on an international treaty.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, Taiwan and Japan will maintain a formal
channel to jointly trace and control hazardous waste and will
cooperate on the exchange of information, technology transfer, and
the harmonization of standards, codes and guidelines on hazardous
waste management.</P>
      <P>Worldwide concern about the transboundary movement and disposal
of hazardous waste was heightened in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
The major concern was waste being exported from industrial nations
for cheap disposal in inadequately prepared sites in developing
countries.</P>
      <P>This concern led to a new urgency in developing and implementing
international controls. It culminated in the landmark global
convention under the United Nations -- the Basel Convention.</P>
      <P>The United Nations invited 116 countries to participate in the
development of the convention and made them original signatories on
March 22, 1989. It came into force May 5, 1992 after being ratified
by 20 countries. As of February 2004, 158 countries, including the
European Union, are party to the convention.</P>
      <P>Nations that have ratified the Basel Convention are allowed to
ship hazardous waste to, from or through only other parties to the
convention.</P>
      <P>The convention, however, permits an exception to this requirement
if a separate bilateral agreement covers relations with a given
trading partner that is not a party to the convention. It allows
parties to the convention to develop such a bilateral agreement as
long as the agreement reflects the environmentally sound management
of waste.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is not a Basel Convention signatory, but Japan is. The
same thing happened between Canada and the United States, which is
also not a signatory.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-Japan Economic and Trade conference -- co-sponsored by
the Association of East Asian Relations (AEAR) and its Japanese
counterpart, the Interchange Association -- was divided into three
groups that exchanged views on more than 72 issues concerning general
policy, agriculture, fishery, medicine and technology exchanges, and
intellectual property rights protection.</P>
      <P>The 42-strong Taiwan delegation was headed by AEAR President Lo
Fu-chen with Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Foreign Trade
Bureau under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, serving as the supreme
adviser to the delegation.</P>
      <P>Other members of the Taiwan delegation included officials from
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Economic Affairs,
Ministry of Transportation and Communications, Council of
Agriculture, Environmental Protection Administration, Fair Trade
Commission and Taiwan's Representative Office in Japan.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: For
New Court, Abortion Case Takes Old Path


The question that had drawn the crowds to
the Supreme Court in a New Hampshire abortion
case Wednesday morning had an answer. The
abortion law was not about to undergo a major
change in the hands of the new Supreme Court, at
least not yet. Justices across the ideological
s pectrum appeared inclined to send the case
back to the federal appeals court that had
declared the law unenforceable in all respects,
and to instruct that court to render a narrower
ruling. Such a ruling would permit the law to
take effect except when a doctor had certified
that an immediate abortion - without either
notifying a parent or seeking approval from a
judge, an option known as a judicial bypass -
was necessary to preserve a girl's health.

Wall Street Journal: In South Africa, 
Corruption Charge Tests Democracy

Until recently South Africa's deputy
president Jacob Zuma was charged with corruption
stemming from a big arms deals. A former
guerrilla ldeader, Zuma fought and was
incarcerated by the defunct apartheid regime.
Now he's facing the prospect of prison again,
but this time he's battling completely
different adversaries: state institutions
of a new, democratic South Africa. A populist
champion of the nation's increasingly frustrated
poor, Zuma is also being investigated on
allegations of rape. Zuma denies any wrongdoing;
his left-wing followers were quick to blast
the unfolding legal onslaught as political
persecution orchestrated by President Thabo
Mbeki. The case already is rattling the
legitimacy of many institutions of the new
South Africa, including its judicial system, its
law-enforcement agencies, the media and the ANC
itself.</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Nantou County,  central Taiwan,  Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Public prosecutors
supported by riot police searched the office of Nantou County
Magistrate Lin Tsung-nan and six other locations Thursday for
evidence of vote buying and took away large piles of documents during
the three-and-a-half-hour operation.</P>
      <P>They also tried to summon Lin and about 20 of his associates for
questioning, but the magistrate, who is seeking re-election in the
Dec. 3 "three in one" elections, did not show up at the county's
Prosecutor's Office and instead continued with his scheduled campaign
activities.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors were acting on tipoffs that Lin and his men were
buying votes with cash and trying to win voter support through the
awarding of contracts for miscellaneous construction projects.</P>
      <P>Emerging from his campaign headquarters later that day, Lin
questioned why the prosecutors waited until two days from the
elections to search his office and summon him. He claimed it would be
difficult to make people believe the operation was unrelated to
political persecution.</P>
      <P>Choking back tears, he pleaded that he be allowed to finish his
election campaign and promised that he would report to the
prosecutors after Dec. 3.</P>
      <P>He also said that if he could have a second chance, he would
finish his current term and quit politics forever.</P>
      <P>Lin, of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), is running
for re-election as an independent against DPP-nominated candidate
Tsai Huang-lang and opposition Kuomintang candidate Li Chao-ching. He

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TONES DOWN SIGNIFICANCE OF DEC. 3 ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian attempted to tone
down Thursday the significance of the upcoming "three-in-one"
elections, saying that the elections are not the mid-term test of his
presidency as seen by some observers.</P>
      <P>"The Dec. 3 elections are local elections, not a mid-term test of
the presidency. They have nothing to do with the transfer of power at
the central government level, nor are they a confidence vote on the
Cabinet, " Chen said in a pre-election interview with cable
broadcaster ETTV.</P>
      <P>Chen acknowledged that the outcome of the elections is
significant in four ways -- it will decide interaction between
central and local governments as well as whether the domestic
political situation will remain stable in the coming two years,
whether his various reform initiatives can be carried out smoothly
and how the future policies on economic development and relations
with China will take shape.</P>
      <P>Even so, Chen insisted that the electoral results will not
necessarily mandate a post-election Cabinet reshuffle.</P>
      <P>"At the moment, I'm preoccupied with how to help the ruling
party's candidates stand out in the weekend elections. I have not
given any thought to issues regarding a reshuffle of the
administrative team, " Chen said, adding that it will depend on the
post-election circumstances, including interaction between the ruling
and opposition camps, cross-strait relations and the general
international situation.</P>
      <P>With only two days to go before the elections for city
mayors/county magistrates, city/county councilors and
township/village chiefs, most media opinion polls have shown the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lagging behind the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in more than half the constituencies,
although one quarter of voters remain undecided.</P>
      <P>Hitting the campaign trail for the DPP earlier in the day, Chen
appeared to be turning up anti-China rhetoric to consolidate his
party's core pro-independence support base.</P>
      <P>The DPP advocates a separate identity for Taiwan, whereas the KMT
and its allies oppose Taiwan independence. China claims the
self-ruled island of 23 million as part of its territory and says
Taiwan must be brought back to the fold, by force if</P>
      <P>Chen told voters that an opposition win in local government
elections this weekend would undermine the island's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>"If the opposition parties win, Taiwan is finished. They will
pass the Taiwan version of the anti-secession law, or a surrender
law, " Chen told a rally in central Taiwan. "Taiwan will have to
accept the one-China principle and become a part of China." He was
referring to a bill proposed by the opposition to set up a commission
responsible for talks with China. Critics say the bill would serve to
legalize Beijing's "one China" policy. China's anti-secession law
allows the use of "non-peaceful means" if Taiwan pushes for a
permanent split from the mainland.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of the Interior will draft law
revisions to require more job openings for mentally or physically
challenged individuals, Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyuan said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Su made the announcement ahead of the Dec. 3 International Day of

      <P>Under the terms of the present Disabled People Protection Law,
public agencies with a staff of more than 50 must hire at least 2
percent of staffers with physical or mental disabilities. Meanwhile,
private enterprises with a staff of more than 100 must hire at least
1 percent of staffers with disabilities.</P>
      <P>As of the end of this past September, private and public agencies
had employed a total of 45,400 disabled staffers, exceeding the
mandatory number of 33,955.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Su said the MOI plans to revise the
current law to offer even more job opening to the disabled. Su said
the ministry plans to raise the disabled hiring ratio for public
agencies to 3 percent and that for the private sector to 1.5 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHAIRMAN TO QUIT IF PARTY FAILS TO KEEP 10 SEATS OR TAIPEI COUNTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), Su Tseng-chang, announced Friday that if his
party fails to keep 10 seats in Saturday's city and county chief
elections or loses the key election in Taipei County, he will step
down to take responsibility.</P>
      <P>Su, who is tipped to be one of the party's standard bearers in
the 2008 presidential election, made the solemn announcement in a
press conference held at the party's headquarters.</P>
      <P>Su put his post on line one day after main opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said he would quit if KMT candidates cannot
take more than half of the seats -- 11 seats -- in the upcoming
elections.</P>
      <P>"The DPP plays a major role in Taiwan's path to progress and
democracy, and if it fails to keep 10 seats, it will represent a
major upset for the party," Su said.</P>
      <P>"The opposition parties will become even more outrageous, and it
will also send a wrong signal to China, " Su said, adding that
Taiwan's political situation will become even more chaotic.</P>
      <P>Su, who had been elected Taipei county magistrate twice, said
that the county is now on the path of rapid growth, and that if Luo
Wen-jia, the DPP's candidate, cannot continue as magistrate, this
"process will be suspended."</P>
      <P>If Luo loses, "I'll definitely resign from the chairmanship, "
even if the DPP shines in other cities and counties, Su said. The DPP
has held the Taipei County magistrate post for 16 years.</P>
      <P>Taipei County -- the nation's largest with a population of 3.7
million -- is the key battleground for the DPP and the KMT. Luo is in
a neck-and-neck race with Chou Hsi-wei, the KMT candidate.</P>
      <P>Su said that since he hit the campaign trail, he has taken part
in 480 rallies, stumping for candidates in every city, county,
village and township.</P>
      <P>The DPP has engaged in a uphill battle after a mass rapid transit
construction corruption scandal involving a former presidential aide
came to light in late August.</P>
      <P>Seventy-seven hopefuls are vying for 23 city mayor and county
magistrate posts. During the previous city and county chief elections
in 2001, the DPP won nine posts, and the KMT also took nine, while
the KMT's allies, the People First Party and the New Party, took a
total of three seats, and independents took the other two.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-wei of the KMT was elected as Yunlin county magistrate
in 2001. But he was sent to the prison for corruption early this
year, and the central government sent Lee Chin-yung to take his
place.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, SWISS INSTITUTES SIGN MOU ON MICROTECHNOLOGY COOPERATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of Taiwan's Industrial
Technology Research Institute (ITRI) and the Swiss Center of
Electronics and Microtechnologies (SCEM) signed Thursday a memorandum
of understanding on cooperation and exchanges in the fields of
microelectronics and nanotechnology.</P>
      <P>The ITRI is a primary research and development center for
industry in Taiwan, while the SCEM specializes in the development,
engineering and production of realizations in microelectronics,
microtechnologies and bio-inspired systems for industry.</P>
      <P>Dr. Shyu Jyuo-min, the ITRI's executive vice president, said
after signing the memorandum that both Taiwan and Switzerland have
made remarkable achievements in research related to microelectronics,
microsystems and microtechnologies, adding that cooperation between
the two organizations will certainly bring about fruitful and
mutually-beneficial results.</P>
      <P>Besides signing the MOU, an ITRI delegation headed by Shyu also
visited the Swiss research center the same day and listened to a
briefing given by staff of the center. In return, Su Tsung-Tsan,
general director of the ITRI's NanoTechnology Research Center,
briefed his Swiss counterparts on the development of nanotechnologies
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Taiwan's international high-tech cooperation
projects have put more emphasis on such sectors as semiconductors and
information technologies, Shyu said that naturally, this has made the
island inclined to engage in cooperation with the United States
rather than Europe which has only had an upper hand in biotechnology
and precision machinery.</P>
      <P>He further said that he sees future cooperation between the two
institutions helping the research and development of both sides as
Taiwan's R&amp;D in microelectronics and microsystems is focused on
information technology, while Switzerland's is focused on medical
science.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's budget for scientific research has been cut due
to internal political factors, Shyu said that the private sector in
Taiwan still attaches great importance to research and development.
"All in all, the competitiveness of the island's high-tech R&amp;D and
industry has not been regressive," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>APPOINTMENT OF AIT HEADS TO BE 'LUMPED TOGETHER'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. Government will "lump together"
the appointment of American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) managing
director and AIT Taipei office director in order for smooth
operations, David Ta-wei Lee, the Republic of China representative to
the United States, said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The AIT is a quasi-official U.S. organization authorized to
handle exchanges with Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic
ties.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks when asked why the appointment of AIT
managing director has been stalled for so long. The post has been
vacant for 19 months since the former AIT managing director, Therese
Shaheen, resigned in April 2004.</P>
      <P>Reports had said that the U.S. State Department would ask Raymond
Burghardt, who served as the AIT Taipei office director -- the de
facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan -- from 1999 to 2001, to head the
AIT, and that his appointment would be announced prior to President
Chen Shui-bian's visit to Central America in September 2005.</P>
      <P>After ending his AIT Taipei office director tenure in 2001,
Burghardt took over as U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, serving in that
post until last year. He assumed his current post as a department
chief at the East-West Center in Hawaii early this year.</P>
      <P>Lee said senior U.S. officials did tell him that the new AIT
managing director would be announced prior to President Chen's visit,
but he learned later that the appointment was shelved.</P>
      <P>The reasons for shelving the appointment could be attributed to
post-Hurricane Katrina relief efforts as well as differences over
whether the AIT managing director should be a political appointee or
a career diplomat.</P>
      <P>To date, "the original planned candidate" has yet to be changed,
Lee said.</P>
      <P>As for the successor of Douglas Paal, the AIT Taipei Office
director whose term will expire at the end of this year, Lee said the
U.S. State Department has tentatively chosen one, but so far, the
U.S. has not yet consulted with Taiwan on the candidate.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The "three-in-one" local government
elections are slated to be held nationwide Saturday, the Central
Election Commission (CEC) announced Friday.</P>
      <P>Between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. Saturday, eligible voters, totaling
13,645,079, are expected to cast their ballots at some 12,000 polling
stations scattered around 21 cities and counties in Taiwan proper and
the two frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu, as well as the
offshore county of Penghu, CEC officials said.</P>
      <P>Saturday's "three-in-one" elections are for city mayors and
county magistrates, city and county councilors, and township and
rural township chiefs.</P>
      <P>A total of 76 candidates are competing for 23 city mayor and
county magistrate posts, while 901 city and county councilor seats
are up for grabs among 1,690 candidates and 319 seats for township
and rural township chiefs are up for grabs among 786 candidates,
according to CEC tallies.</P>
      <P>The ballots for the various elections will be in different
colors, with white ballots for the city mayor and county magistrate
elections, pale yellow ballots for the city and county councilor
elections, pink ballots for the township and rural township chief
elections, pale blue ballots for the low-lying areas' aboriginal city
and county councilor elections, and pale green ballots for the
mountain areas' aboriginal city and county councilor elections, the
CEC officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials called for the country's voters make note of the
various regulations at the polling stations, including no mobile
phone handsets allowed at the stations, no tearing or any other form
of destruction of the ballots, and no removal of ballots from the
stations. Violators could face fines of up to NT$50,000 (US$1,515) or
even prison sentences of up to one year.</P>
      <P>The elections are seen as a hot contest between the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the opposition "pan blue
alliance" led by Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou. Both DPP Chairman
Su Tseng-chang and Ma have vowed to step down if their respective
parties fail to win half of the seats up for grabs in the city and

    <HEADLINE>KMT SAYS 8 SEATS SECURE, 7 POSSIBLE IN DEC. 3 ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is secure in
eight of the 23 county and city chief races in the "three-in-one"
elections set for Dec. 3 and is striving for another seven seats,
party officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>With KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou having announced that he will step
down if the party fails to seize more than half of the seats, KMT
officials said they expect this move to help boost voter support for
the party.</P>
      <P>KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen said the KMT has stable leads in
eight counties and cities that are currently held by the party, and
also stands a good chance of seizing Changhua County, Chiayi City,
Ilan County, Miaoli County, Nantou County, Pingtung County and Taipei
County.</P>
      <P>Six KMT incumbents who are seeking re-election, including Chu
Li-lun in Taoyuan County, Cheng Yung-chin in Hsinchu County, Lin
Junq-tzer in Hsinchu City, Huang Chung-sheng in Taichung County,
Jason Hu in Taichung City and Hsieh Shen-shan in Hualien County, have
stable leads, according to pollsters.</P>
      <P>In Keelung City, KMT incumbent Hsu Tsai-li is facing a strong
challenge from Liu Wen-hsiung of the opposition People First Party --
the KMT's ally in the "pan-blue alliance" that has a similar support
base to the KMT. Ma is scheduled to accompany Hsu to cast his vote
Saturday in an effort to prevent "pan-blue" voters from dumping Hsu
for Liu.</P>
      <P>In Penghu County, KMT candidate Wang Chien-fa has had a distant
lead over his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) opponent, Chen
Kuang-fu, since President Chen Shui-bian promoted his promise to cut
the retirement benefits for civil servants, military personnel and
teachers, according to Liao Feng-teh, head of the KMT's Organization
and Development Committee.</P>
      <P>The KMT has also a stable lead in Miaoli County, where the
support rate for KMT candidate Liu Cheng-hung is significantly higher
than that of other candidates, Liao said.</P>
      <P>In Taipei County, KMT candidate Chou Hsi-wei appears to enjoy
good prospects, but the race in that county is unpredictable because
there is a large number of supporters of the "pan-green camp" who
tend not to disclose their preferences in opinion polls, Liao said.</P>
      <P>In addition, neutral voters are expected to be influenced in the
wake of allegations by DPP candidate Luo Wen-jia that Chou was
involved in a series of scandals, including abusing his privilege
during his term as a Taiwan Provincial Assembly member in 1997 to
obtain a NT$15 million loan from the Taiwan Business Bank, Liao said.</P>
      <P>In Ilan County and Chiayi City, the KMT is in the lead in terms
of its performance in opinion polls and in mobilizing its voters, and
it will enhance the KMT's morale if the party is able to seize these
two places, Liao said.</P>
      <P>Also, he said, it is very likely that the KMT will win in Nantou
County, where DPP candidate Tsai Huang-liang and independent
candidate Lin Tzung-nan are splitting the support of "pan-green"
voters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the races in Changhua County and Pingtung County are
too close to call, he added.</P>

      <P>CIB investigators, led by Taipei District Prosecutor Tai Tung-li,
raided the homes of two men, surnamed Wu and Chen, in Taichung,
central Taiwan and seized more than 5,000 tablets of counterfeit
medicine.</P>

Reductil (Sibutramine) , 1,500 tablets of Viagra, 280 tablets of
Cialis -- another drug for the treatment of erectile dysfunction --

      <P>The investigators learned that the medicine was counterfeited in
China and smuggled into Taiwan by people returning from China, aimed
for sale to Taiwan customers via online transactions, CIB officials
said.</P>
      <P>The police also learned that the drug smugglers have sold the
counterfeit medicine at lower-than-normal prices. For example, they

      <P>The United States is concerned about
Saturday's "three-in-one" elections in Taiwan and their possible
impact on future political developments, Republic of China
Representative to the United States David Lee said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Although Saturday's elections are local level, Lee said that
various senior U. S. officials from different agencies he has met
recently have all asked about and shown keen interest in the polls.
He noted that he will make a briefing to U. S. officials after ballot
counting ends Saturday evening.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, it is natural that the United States would care
about major activities in Taiwan due to the long-term good and close
relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>To the United States, the elections of city mayors and county
magistrates, city and county councilors and village and township
chiefs this weekend are a very important political event in Taiwan,
Lee said, noting that American Institute in Taiwan officials have
periodically reported the newest developments to Washington, while
Washington has also tried to gain information through media reports.</P>
      <P>U. S. officials are actually quite familiar with the election
developments, Lee said. But he pointed out that they will maintain
neutrality toward the elections and care only about whether the

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG TO REPRESENT TAIWAN IN BID FOR 2011 WORLD UNIVERSITY GAMES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A screening team of the National Council on
Physical Fitness and Sports has selected Kaohsiung to represent
Taiwan in the country's bid to host the 2011 World University Games.</P>
      <P>Council officials said that one of the government's major
policies is to bid to host international athletic meets, noting that
Taipei has been awarded the right to host the 2009 Deaflympic Games
for athletes with hearing impairment, and that Kaohsiung has already
been awarded the right to host the 2009 World Games.</P>
      <P>In the near future, they have set the goal of bidding to host the
World University Games with the aim of accumulating more experience
in sponsoring international games to achieve the eventual goals of
bidding to host the 2018 Asian Games and the 2020 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>To select the city that best represents Taiwan, as well as taking
into consideration the international level, profile and related
software and hardware facilities of various cities, the council
boiled the possible choices down to Taipei and Kaohsiung and asked
the screening team to provide the council with its views.</P>
      <P>The team was inaugurated Nov. 22, with Academia Sinica member Lo
Tung-pi serving as convener and 12 members, including Huang Ta-chou,
chairman of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee. The team reviewed
proposals submitted by both cities and made on-site inspections
before making its decision.</P>

      <P>A total of 25,000 temporary part-time

which is 40 percent more than the same time last year, officials at
the online employment service provider 104 Job Bank said Friday.</P>
      <P>Opportunities for temporary part-time jobs have increased because
a lot of business activities are being held in December ahead of the
arrival of Christmas and New Year, the officials said.</P>
      <P>One of these activities is a computer show set to open Dec. 3,
which will require a large number of temporary salespeople. Most of
these positions offer an hourly wage of NT$85 to NT$100, while others
offer a daily wage of NT$1,000, they said.</P>
      <P>Also on demand are models who will be responsible for warming up
the atmosphere at the exhibition, they said, adding that such
positions usually offer NT$1,500 to NT$6,000 per day.</P>
      <P>According to tallies by the job bank, the industries in which

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTER SILENT ON WAFER FOUNDRY INVESTMENT IN CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
refused Friday to deny or confirm news reports that her ministry will
allow two more local wafer foundries to invest in China this month.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on local newspaper reports that a panel
authorized to review local wafer foundries' overseas investment plans
is set to meet by the end of this month to give the nod to Powerchip
Semiconductor Corporation (PSC) and ProMOS Technologies to invest in
China, the minister said only that "the panel will be asked to meet
when the time is ripe."</P>
      <P>The Taiwan authorities have decided to allow three local wafer
manufacturers to relocate outdated equipment to China to continue
producing wafers there.</P>
      <P>Thus far, only United Microelectronics Corp. has applied and been
given permission to produce eight-inch wafers in China, while PSC and
ProMOS have submitted applications and are awaiting approval.</P>
      <P>Citing the current regulations, Ho said local wafer manufacturers
that have invested in wafer fabs to produce 12-inch wafers in Taiwan
can venture into the China six months after its local 12-inch wafer
fabs have come on stream.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of Economic Affairs will not stop local businessmen
from breaking into the Chinese market as long as they continue
investing in Taiwan," the minister said.</P>
      <P>In a related development Friday, PSC Chairman Frank Huang said
his company is in no hurry to invest in China.</P>
      <P>Huang said the government's policy of allowing local foundries
producing eight-inch wafer with 0.25 um technology to relocate to
China will not be of much benefit in any case, as only wafers
produced with 0.18 um technology can survive in the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Taiwan's wafer fabs are about five years ahead of
their Chinese counterparts in terms of technology, Huang said PSC
will wait until the government lifts restrictions on wafers using
0.18 um technology to invest in China even if it is given the green
light.</P>
      <P>Warning that the window of chance is narrow for local wafer
manufacturers, Huang predicted the technological edge of 0.18 um will
be closed in China within three years, by which time only 0.15 um
technology will be able to survive.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH PROPOSES STRICTER LAWS ON TRADE IN FOOD PRODUCTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) has recently
completed a proposed amendment to the laws concerning food product
management in an effort to stop dishonest food producers from selling
substandard food that is hazardous to health.</P>
      <P>The problem of food safety is a perennial concern among consumers
because of frequent news reports exposing the sale of dangerous food
such as pork from sick hogs and contaminated cooked eggs.</P>
      <P>In the proposed amendment, punishments for dishonest food
businesses are more strict, allowing health authorities to ban
problematic goods from being traded as soon as they are found to
contain toxic or hazardous substance, or to carry no descriptions or
incomplete descriptions of their contents.</P>
      <P>Fines for health foods businesses that make false claims that
their products have curative effects would also be raised from the
existing level of NT$60,000-NT$300,000 to NT$200,000-NT$1 million.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, businesses who are discovered to have produced and
marketed hazardous food products will be stripped of their business
certificates.</P>
      <P>DOH Director-General of Food Sanitation Chen Lu-hung said Friday
that so far, health authorities are only allowed to ask businesses to
recall problematic food products from the market and ask them to
improve. However, during the period of time allowed for improvement,
consumers can still buy the products, he explained.</P>
      <P>The amended laws can seal this loophole and give the authorities
the power to confiscate suspect products and prevent them from
entering the market until they are proved safe, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The draft bill will be delivered to the Legislative Yuan for
review in the near future, he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Keelung,  Dec.  2 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A chink is appearing the armor of the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People
First Party (PFP) , with PFP Chairman James Soong making a thinly
veiled threat Friday that the KMT will have to fend for itself in the
legislature if the PFP candidate for Keelung mayor is defeated in the
Dec. 3 elections.</P>
      <P>PFP candidate Liu Wen-hsiung is running for mayor of the port
city of Keelung against KMT candidate Hsu Tsai-li, who is the
incumbent mayor, and opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union candidate
Chen Chien-min.</P>
      <P>The KMT refused to give up fielding its own candidate, despite
repeated requests from the PFP that the KMT should support the PFP
candidate, who has a good chance of winning the election. KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said in an interview with ETTV that there is a
"practical difficulty" for him to support the PFP candidate instead
of the candidate from his own party.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a rally in Keelung to boost Liu's campaign, Soong
warned that if the incumbent Keelung mayor is re-elected, his close
association with the "black gold" groups could become an obstacle in
the KMT's future plan to crack down on corruption and crime.</P>
      <P>Soong also claimed that he will go into seclusion or even
overseas to reflect on what he did wrong in the elections if Liu is
not elected as Keelung mayor.</P>
      <P>The PFP chairman warned that in the event of Liu's defeat, the
KMT, as the second-largest party in the legislature, will have to
face the consequences of how to deal with the largest party -- the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party -- without the assistance of the
PFP.

      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) said
Friday that ballots garnered by uncontested candidates in Saturday's
"three-in-one" elections for city and county chiefs, city and county
councilors and village and township heads will have to achieve a
certain threshold before the candidate can be counted as having been
elected.</P>
      <P>CEC spokesman Teng Tien-you noted that in 14 cities and counties
where councilor candidates are running without any rivals and in 31
villages and townships where the candidates are running uncontested,
the candidates will still have to get a certain number of ballots
before they can claim victory.</P>
      <P>He said that according to the Election and Recall Law, city and
county councilor hopefuls will have to get at least 10 percent of the
votes based on the total number of elected officials divided by the
total number of the electorate in the constituency.</P>
      <P>In the township and village elections, the hopefuls will have to
get at least 20 percent of the electorate before claiming victory.</P>
      <P>With some legislators leaving the legislature to run for posts as
city or county chiefs in the election, the law also stipulates that
if the legislators cannot complete their terms and if more than half
of the legislative seats in a constituency are left vacant, the CEC
will hold by-elections.</P>
      <P>The CEC also updated the latest count of the "three-in-one"
elections, listing 76 hopefuls running for city and county chief
positions, 1,689 aspirants (one short of the original count 1,690)
running for city and country council posts, and 788 (compared with
the original 786) running for township and village chief positions.</P>
      <P>The elected winners of the 23 cities and counties will be

      <P>Prosecutors' search of

      <P>Claiming that the actions of the prosecutors were in violation of

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) will launch a publicity drive in December in preparation for
the nationwide implementation of a garbage separation policy Jan. 1,
officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>The policy, which has been enforced in 10 cities and counties
islandwide since the beginning of this year, requires the public to
sort their garbage into three categories -- ordinary garbage,
recyclables and food scraps -- before taking it out to the garbage
truck.</P>
      <P>Garbage that is not properly separated will be rejected, with
offenders facing a fine of NT$1,200 to NT$6,000. The policy is set to
expand to all 25 cities and counties nationwide next year.</P>
      <P>According to Chang Hsu-chang, a section chief at the EPA's
Department of Waste Management, local environmental protection staff
will open garbage bags for inspection to see if the rules are being
followed by the public.</P>
      <P>During the first three months of the policy's implementation,
offenders will not be fined but will be given advice and told to
separate their garbage properly, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Those who ignore the advice will be fined, he said.</P>
      <P>In the 10 cities where the policy has been implemented, the
amount of garbage in the first 10 months of this year decreased 10
percent compared with the same period of last year, Chang noted.
While the amount of recyclables rose by 30 percent, the amount of
food scraps increased by 65 percent, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VOTER TURNOUT EXPECTED NOT TO FALL BELOW 66 PERCENT: CEC CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Voter turnout for the hotly contested local
government chiefs elections is not expected to fall below the level
recorded in the preceding elections four years ago, Central Election
Commission (CEC) Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks while presiding over a vote-counting
rehearsal at the CEC's computer operations center on the eve of the
"three-in-one" elections for city mayors/county magistrates,
city/county councilors and township/village chiefs.</P>
      <P>Vote-counting in local-level elections has traditionally been
handled by the election commission in each city and county. This time
around, Chang said the CEC has been involved in overall planning with
a view to upgrading efficiency.</P>
      <P>As to voter turnout, Chang was reluctant to make a concrete
forecast. He instead said that the last city mayor/county magistrate
elections saw a 66 percent voter turnout.</P>
      <P>"This time around, with three local elections taking place
simultaneously and polls in many constituencies deadlocked, those who
originally did not plan to vote may change their minds and go to the
polls. Against this backdrop, I assume that voter turnout will not be
below 66 percent," Chang said.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, 12,081 polling stations have been set up
around the country with the exception of the Taipei and Kaohsiung
special municipalities where no elections will be held. The polling
stations will be staffed by 162,811 workers.</P>
      <P>After the voting ends at 4 p.m. Saturday, Chang said vote
counting will proceed in the following order: city mayors/county
magistrates, city/county councilors, and township/village chiefs. If
the polling stations are spacious enough, vote counting for
city/county chiefs and councilors will take place simultaneously.</P>
      <P>Chang said ballots cast into the wrong boxes will remain valid.
If all goes well, Chang said vote counting will be completed by 10
p.m. Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the CEC tallies, 13,587,635 citizens are eligible to
vote in the city mayor/county magistrate elections.</P>
      <P>For the township/village chief elections, the number of eligible
voters stands at 11,484,871. Meanwhile, 13,281,916 citizens are
eligible to vote in regional elections for city/county councilors,
168,024 people are eligible to vote for urban aboriginal city/county
council seats and 112,979 people are eligible to vote for mountainous
aboriginal city/county council seats.</P>
      <P>Except for the nation's two largest municipalities -- Taipei and
Kaohsiung -- all other local government top posts are up for grabs,
including the two frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>A total of 76 hopefuls are vying for city and county chief posts,
1,689 aspirants for city and country council seats and 788 for
township and village chief positions.</P>
      <P>The elected five city mayors and 18 county magistrates will be
sworn in Dec. 20, while the elected city and county councilors and
village and township chiefs will not take office until March 1, 2006.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN OBSERVERS SAY MEDIA KEYING ON NEGATIVE ELECTION NEWS: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign election observers invited by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to Taiwan say that local
media spends too much time reporting negative aspects of campaigning
and should work harder to verify stories before publishing or
broadcasting them, Hsieh Huai-hui, deputy director of the DPP's
International Affairs Department, said Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is holding "three-in-one" elections for local chiefs on
Dec. 3 and there are about 20 delegations from various nations
currently on the island to observe the voting process.</P>
      <P>The 100 or so journalists and academics from the delegations have
been mostly looking at how hopefuls canvass for votes and visiting
campaign headquarters.</P>
      <P>"Some of the people who the DPP invited to the island have said
that Taiwanese media has too much leeway in its reporting and that
they over-report allegations of misconduct and scandals by
candidates. They said that the media here should remember that they
are responsible for what they do and must verify their information, "
Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Echoing the observers' views, Su Chi, a main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker, said that negative campaigning, where
people make ad hominem remarks at each other, is a sign of the
degradation of democracy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Hsieh noted that most delegation members were
surprised and curious at the liberal atmosphere surrounding the
campaigning in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Some of them come from less-democratized countries, which
explains why they are astonished at the very noisy and animated
evening rallies organized in the run-up to the elections, and the way
candidates go after each other," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The election observers have been invited to Taiwan by a number of
organizations, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the
Mainland Affairs Council, the DPP and civilian parties such as the
Democratic Pacific Union (DPU).</P>
      <P>Among the delegations, the one invited by the DPU, is the biggest
with more than 20 members. The one invited by the DPP has 16 members
made up of scholars and journalists from Japan, South Korea, the
Philippines, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN MAKES FRESH PROMISES TO VOTERS IN ILAN COUNTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ilan  County,  northern  Taiwan,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen
Shui-bian pledged Friday that he would speed up three major
construction projects in Ilan County if Chen Ding-nan, the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) candidate, is elected Ilan
County magistrate in the Dec. 3 election.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a rally to boost Chen Ding-nan's campaign, the
president said the central government fully supports Ilan County's
plans to build a science park, elevate the railway in Ilan City, and
set up a marine biology science and technology park.</P>
      <P>He promised that in the first year after Chen Ding-nan becomes
county magistrate, the plan to build the science park will be
finalized, followed by the inauguration of the railway elevation
project in the second year, and the completion of the groundwork for
the marine biology science and technology park in the third year.</P>
      <P>Chen Ding-nan, who served two terms as Ilan County magistrate
from 1981 to 1989 and was minister of justice from May 2000 to
February 2005, is running against opposition Kuomintang candidate Lu
Kuo-hua and an independent.</P>
      <P>The DPP views Ilan County as its "democratic holy land" where the
DPP should remain in power. However, opinion polls over the past two
months show that Chen Ding-nan is slightly behind Lu in popularity.</P>
      <P>The election battle has become so close that this is President
Chen's third visit to Ilan County in a week. The DPP's desperation
has become more apparent with the president's promise to speed up the
county's three major construction projects on the condition of Chen
Ding-nan being elected.</P>

Profusion of Rebel Groups Helps Them Survive in 
Iraq 

Iraqi and American officials in Iraq say the
single most important fact about the insurgency
is that it consists not of a few groups but of
dozens, possibly as many as 100. And it is not,
as often depicted, a coherent organization whose
members dutifully carry out orders from above
but a far-flung collection of smaller groups
that often act on their own or come together for
a single attack, the officials say. Each is
believed to have its own leader and is free to
act on its own. Highly visible groups like Al
Qaeda, Ansar al Sunna and the Victorious Army
Group appear to act as fronts, the Iraqis and
the Americans say, providing money, general
direction and expertise to the smaller groups,
but often taking responsibility for their
attacks by broadcasting them across the globe.

Wall Street Journal: Strained Relations;
With Israel Gone, Election Splinters A Family in
Gaza

When Beit Lahia in Gaza held elections in
May, Mohammed Hamouda and his son, Ahmed,
ran for very different reasons. In the end, they
both won seats on the 13-member city council.
But the bruising campaign tore apart a
relationship already shaken by violence and
Ahmed Hamouda's embrace of Hamas. The rift in
the Hamouda family reflects a broader problem
for the Palestinians. When Israel quit the Gaza
Strip this summer, it did more than relinquish
land to the Palestinians. The historic move also
uncorked conflicts lurking just below the
surface of Palestinian society. Before the
withdrawal, these religious, political and
economic divisions had been overshadowed by a
much more powerful force: enmity toward Israel.
Now in Gaza, and to a lesser extent in the West 
Bank, powerful businessmen are scrambling for 
control of the real-estate market. Crime and 
street violence is on the rise. Meanwhile, the 
Fatah-run Palestinian Authority is struggling 
to rein in armed groups belonging to religious 
extremists and rival factions out to settle 
scores.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>DPP HEAVYWEIGHTS PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS ON EVE OF CRITICAL ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
heavyweights from President Chen Shui-bian on down pulled out all the
stops to canvass voters Friday with the "three-in-one" elections
entering the home stretch.</P>
      <P>More than 13 million eligible voters from around the country
except for those in Taipei and Kaohsiung special municipalities have
the chance to go to the polls Saturday to elect city mayors/county
magistrates, city/county councilors and township/village chiefs.</P>
      <P>DPP political stars have focused their energies on the
city/county chief elections because the outcome could provide
momentum for the winning party ahead of the next legislative and
presidential elections.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the elections, President Chen continued shuttling
around several critical constituencies, including Taipei County,
Changhua County, Taichung County, Taichung City, Ilan County and
Chiayi City.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu, accompanied by Cheng Pao-ching, the
DPP standard-bearer for the Taoyuan County magistrateship, went on a
door-to-door vote-canvassing tour in the northern county early in the
morning and joined street parades in Yunlin, Changhua and Taichung
counties and Taichung City to solicit support for DPP candidates.</P>
      <P>In the face of the opposition camp's assiduous efforts to draw
attention to a major scandal involving the Kaohsiung mass rapid
transit system project, the DPP has been fighting a tough battle from
the beginning of the campaigning. Many media opinion polls have shown
the DPP lagging the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in more than half the
constituencies, although one-quarter of voters remain undecided.</P>
      <P>Through concerted efforts by all DPP politicians, party sources
said, the prospects have improved in several constituencies. The
party is striving to retain its current grip on the 10 mayoral and
magistrate seats, the sources said, adding that the party's top goal
is to win more than half of the 23 top local government posts up for
grabs.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang vowed early Friday to resign if the
DPP failed to secure 10 seats in Saturday's local elections.</P>
      <P>"If the DPP can't take 10 seats in tomorrow's elections, it will
be a serious setback...I will resign to take responsibility, " Su
told reporters in Taipei County, the nation's most populous
constituency, which is traditionally viewed as a testing ground for
the presidential election.</P>
      <P>"As a former Taipei County magistrate, I would also step down if
Luo Wen-jia fails to win, " he said. The DPP's Luo is in a tight race
against the KMT's Chou Hsi-wei for magistrate.</P>
      <P>Su accompanied Luo on door-to-door vote-canvassing tours around
Taipei County all day long and attended two large-scale campaign
rallies in the evening.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh led his Cabinet team to stump for the DPP
standard-bearer in the offshore Penghu County in the morning, joined
street parades in the two southern counties of Pingtung and Kaohsiung
in the afternoon to woo voters for the DPP candidates and attended a
campaign rally in Tainan City before returning to Taipei to take part
in Luo's last pre-election campaign rally in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>According to a DPP election-eve assessment, the party enjoys
stable leads in seven constituencies -- Changhua County, Yunlin
County, Chiayi County, Tainan County, Tainan City, Kaohsiung County
and Pingtung County -- while running neck and neck with the
opposition KMT in six constituencies -- Ilan County, Taipei county,
Miaoli County, Nantou County, Chiayi City and Penghu County.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan speaker Wang
Jin-pyng, a former Kuomintang (KMT) vice chairman, said it should be
no problem for the party to win at least 11 posts in Saturday's mayor
and magistrate elections.</P>
      <P>Wang made the comments after voting in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>The "three-in-one" elections, which will elect 23 mayors and
magistrates as well as 901 city and county councillors and 319
township chiefs, are being held in 21 counties, plus the outlying
island county of Penghu and the two islands of Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the KMT candidates are taking stable leads into
several of the county's elections, including Keelung, Taoyuan,
Taichung and Hualien, Wang said, "The KMT will have no problem
winning 11 mayor and magistrate seats."</P>
      <P>He also predicted that the KMT will claim victory in the local
councilor and township chief elections as the party has always had a
big advantage over the other political parties from grassroots
supporters.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wang warned that the KMT would have to be
reform-minded in the future, saying, "Only by doing so, can the party
give itself a 'fresh spirit' and adequately respond to the people's
needs. Winning the 2008 presidential election is the KMT's top
priority."</P>
      <P>Asked whether KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's Thursday pledge to step
down from his post if his party cannot win more than half of the
seats in the mayor and magistrate elections would affect the decision
of voters, Wang said that the pledge might help consolidate the
supporters of the "pan-blue alliance" and make an impact on the
candidates of the People First Party, the KMT's ally.</P>
      <P>As to whether he will run for the KMT chairmanship if Ma does
step down, Wang said that it is quite out of the question for him to
take this issue into consideration since "this problem does not exist
now and I needn't think about the issue."</P>
      <P>"Realizing that current developments favor the KMT, all
party members should work together to win the elections, " he added.</P>

      <P>A free trade agreement (FTA) between
Taiwan and the United States would have to come at the "right time, "
a high-ranking U.S. trade official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Moreover, if Taiwan could be more supportive of World Trade
Organization (WTO) talks on controversial agricultural issues, it
might expect progress on the FTA issue, Timothy Stratford, assistant
U.S. trade representative for China affairs, said in a speech at a
lunch meeting of members of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council in the
U.S. capital.</P>
      <P>Stratford said he will visit Taiwan at the beginning of next year
to attend the already-postponed Taiwan-U.S. trade and investment
framework agreement (TIFA) meeting, which was originally scheduled to
take place in November. Asked whether or not talks at the
vice-ministerial, technical-level TIFA meeting will touch the issues
concerning preliminary Taiwan-U.S. FTA negotiations, Stratford said
"no," adding that "the two are different."</P>
      <P>Stratford explained that an FTA involves many factors, the most
decisive being the "right time."</P>
      <P>The U.S. side hopes Taiwan can back U.S. proposals to lower
tariffs on agricultural products and decrease subsidies when it
attends the WTO negotiations.</P>
      <P>The support -- meaning Taiwan has to open further to imports of
agricultural products -- is "very important" because it is "the key
factor" for a Taiwan-U.S. FTA to see progress, Stratford stressed.</P>
      <P>Asked whether there is a plan for the opening of FTA talks, the
U.S. official said that "so far, no schedule has been set."</P>

      <P>He also said the same day that the vice minister and
technical-level TIFA meeting and FTA talks are "two separate issues."</P>
      <P>The TIFA meeting, which was scheduled to be held last month in
Taipei, was postponed due to personnel reshuffle issues at the U.S.
Trade Representative Office.</P>
      <P>According to Stratford, issues to be discussed in the upcoming
TIFA meeting will include intellectual property rights,
telecommunications and pharmaceuticals.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan had made an important concession on relevant issues at
last year's TIFA meeting to the United States, the official said that
Washington hopes that the upcoming meeting will also be able to bring
about some good results.</P>
      <P>Taiwan promised last year to further open its telecommunications
market and that move has made the United States remove the island
from the "priority Watch List" of its Special 301 provision of the
Trade Act and instead, place it on the "Watch list."</P>
      <P>It is generally believed by some U.S. lawmakers that reaching an
accord with the United States on the TIFA by reducing some trade
barriers in such sectors as telecommunications, pharmaceuticals,
financial services, electronics and agriculture is the first step for
Taipei to establish free trade exchanges between the two countries.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung police said Saturday that the text
message alleging Taichung Mayor Jason Hu was rushed to hospital due
to serious illness was sent from cellular phones registered in the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>Police made the announcement after some Taichung residents
received the text message at around 4 a.m. earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Hu, who is seeking another term in Saturday's election, voted in
the central Taiwan city as scheduled, clearly putting to rest
speculation about his health.</P>
      <P>According to initial investigations, police said the text message
was sent from cell phones registered in the Philippines and that
there were at least two sources of the transmission, with one number
being 639-163-946-821.</P>
      <P>Police said that if the Filipino-registered cell phone was
brought to Taiwan to send the text message, then it would be easier
to track down, but if the text message was sent from the Philippines
or via the Internet, then it will be hard to trace.</P>
      <P>Lin Chin-hsin, a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) as well as a practicing medical doctor, together with 11
other doctors, recently revealed what they said were Hu's medical
records during a news conference. Hu has twice had mild strokes. The
doctors were attempting to show that Hu might not be healthy enough
to serve another term. Lin and the 11 doctors are now being
investigated whether they violated their ethical code of not
infringing upon a patient's privacy by revealing his medical records.</P>
      <P>Hu, who is generally believed to be ahead of his rival, Lin
Chia-lung, a DPP candidate for the same post, took the matter in
stride, saying tongue-in-cheek that he would live to be 95 and would
invite President Chen Shui-bian to his birthday party then, although
he wasn't sure if Chen would still be alive.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou defended his presence at a polling station in the northern
port city of Keelung Saturday, saying that he was merely accompanying
his friend -- Keelung Mayor Hsu Tsai-li, who is seeking reelection --
and did not violate any law.</P>
      <P>Ma went to Keelung early Saturday morning and walked with Hsu
hand in hand to the polling station. He and Hsu both declined media
requests for an analysis on the "three-in-one" local government
elections, but said they encourage people to turn out and votes.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman was confronted by one woman who heckled him and
questioned the justification of his presence. He told her that the
Republic of China on Taiwan is a free country, and that its citizens
can go anywhere they want.</P>
      <P>Ma explained to the media that as the mayor of Taipei, he had in
the past accompanied the former president and the former KMT chairman
and presidential candidate to polling stations during presidential
elections, and that there was no transgression against any law in
doing so.</P>
      <P>Liu Wen-hsiung, the opposition People First Party's candidate for
Keelung mayor, who went to the polling station in the company of his
wife, criticized Ma for setting a bad example by using his presence
to influence Hsu's chances of winning. His criticism was dismissed as
"sour grapes" by the candidate of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU),
Chen Chien-min, who was accompanied to the polling station by TSU
Chairman Su Chin-chiang.</P>
      <P>Ma later also went to Taipei County and walked with KMT candidate

    <HEADLINE>IT INDUSTRY URGED TO REDUCE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh on Saturday urged the
information technology (IT) industry to do more software research and
reduce gradually the nation's digital divide between urban and rural
areas.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks at the opening ceremony of a month-long
information technology exhibition held at the Taipei World Trade
Center.</P>
      <P>The premier noted that the annual IT month celebrations usually
coincide with Taiwan's different types of elections; however, the
elections have not cooled down the public's passion to attend the
computer show. Hsieh attributed the situation to the attractive and
highly competitive IT products presented by the information industry.</P>
      <P>The inauguration of this year's IT month coincide with the
country's city and county chief elections.</P>
      <P>Noting that last year's IT month attracted more than two million
visitors, Hsieh said it was a good sign, but urged the public to pay
more attention to the country's future.</P>
      <P>Hailing Taiwan's IT industry for its brilliant performance in
global markets, Hsieh said Taiwan has been the world's largest
supplier of motherboards, PDAs, and monitors, and the second-largest
producer of servers.</P>
      <P>However, he added, it would be great if the information industry
can focus more on software research and do more to allow people
living in rural areas to have more access to computers and the
Internet.</P>
      <P>Knowing the tremendous power of the Internet, the premier cited
the example of his recent visit to a village restaurant in Taiwan
that was quite crowded.</P>
      <P>While wondering why such a small restaurant in such a remote
village could attract so many people, the restaurant owner told Hsieh
that it was because of the word spread via the Internet.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said now that the elections have passed, the pace of life
can return to normal, and the legislature can reinstate the budget of
NT$5.5 billion (US$164 million) designated for hi-tech development
which it cut in the recent legislative session.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh expressed the hope
Saturday that the social and political situations in Taiwan will
become peaceful and stable after the hotly contested "three-in-one"
elections.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the outcomes of the elections will definitely make
some people happy and some others sad, but this is how democracy
works.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks during an inspection of a computer center
set up at the Central Election Commission to compile the results of
the vote count of the elections for county and city chiefs, county
and city councilors as well as township and village heads.</P>
      <P>Hsieh pointed out that many people were worried that holding the
three elections at the same time would make vote-buying even more
prevalent but that the government decided to go ahead with the plan
in order to reduce costs and the negative impact on the economy.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, it turned out that vote-buying cases decreased this
year compared with the past, which was good, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on the elections after participating in the
opening of a computer exhibition, Hsieh said it is depressing that
many candidates still resorted to mud-slinging to defame their
rivals, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the public should be conscientious and avoid
saying anything that is not based on evidence.</P>
      <P>On the outcomes of the elections, he said it is hard to predict
which party will be the biggest winner in light of the heated
competition. But he said he is "cautiously optimistic" about the
showing of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The premier noted that the government will start organizing the
second economic development conference after the elections, with
cross-strait relations and global issues included on the agenda.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that consensus will be established soon
between the ruling and opposition parties to remove the political
barriers in the country's economic policies.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The success of Liu Cheng-hung of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in the Miaoli County magistrate election
can be attributed to his long-term efforts in the northern Taiwan
county as well as on the strength of KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou,
according to observers.</P>
      <P>Liu has become the first Hoklo county magistrate in Miaoli, a
Hakka-dominated county where two-thirds of the residents are Hakkas.</P>
      <P>Liu, a four-time legislator, is a veteran in politics and
maintained a steady lead in pre-election polls. As all KMT candidates
were chosen via a party primary, Liu got the jump on his rivals on
the campaign trail. He ran against outgoing Miaoli Mayor Chiu
Ping-kun and Legislator Hsu Yao-chang of the People First Party
(PFP), an ally of the KMT.</P>
      <P>Chiu, originally a KMT member, made a U-turn shortly after the
KMT primary where he trailed Liu. Chiu quit the KMT, joined the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and was recruited to serve
as the DPP's candidate, stunning many Miaoli residents. Though
President Chen Shui-bian went to Miaoli several times to canvass for
Chiu, the DPP was well aware that it would be tough going in the
stronghold of the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP.</P>
      <P>Liu also said that he would nominate Liu Chiou-hsiang, a former
provincial assemblyman and the grandson of a former Miaoli County
magistrate -- and a Hakka -- as deputy magistrate, thus assuaging
some of the misgivings of the Hakkas about a non-Hakka county chief.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma also helped as his presence in Miaoli created a
positive stir.</P>
      <P>Fu Hsueh-peng, the popular incumbent Miaoli magistrate, wanted to
pass his baton to Hsu Yao-Chang, but Hsu refused to change his party
affiliation despite the fact that it was the precondition for the DPP
to choose him as its candidate.</P>
      <P>Hsu was the last among the trio to throw his hat in the ring when
he formally announced his bid to join the race as an independent in

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  3  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Claiming that the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) has defeated itself, opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou on Saturday demanded that the government
set up a political integrity commission to clean up the nation's
politics.</P>
      <P>Ma made his demand while speaking to KMT supporters who helped
the party win 14 out of 23 city and county government posts,
including the largest, Taipei County, and the "most symbolic," Chiayi
City. The DPP even lost Ilan County, which it had held for 24 years
and nominated former magistrate and justice minister Chen Ding-nan to
defend.</P>
      <P>He said the people of Taiwan have cast a vote of no-confidence on
the ruling DPP. "In a democracy, when you have not performed well,
it's natural that you will be replaced," he added.</P>
      <P>After going through "the worst ever campaign, " Ma said, "We must
ensure that Taiwan's politics are conducted in such away that no
vote-buying will be tolerated in any elections and no corruption will
be allowed in the government."</P>
      <P>He pledged that the KMT will offer a "clean, diligent and loving"
government if given the chance to rule the country, adding that it
can do that now in the newly mandated 14 local governments.</P>
      <P>He advised the winning KMT candidates to "take your rivals'
policy proposals seriously if you deem them feasible and beneficial
to the public."</P>
      <P>Ma praised Taiwan's people for having made a wise choice but
hoped that in the future, all political parties and candidates will
vie in a healthy environment marked by "law-abiding, cost-saving and
sportsmanship."</P>
      <P>Only when elections can be held in this way "can we hope to have
all people, instead of just a certain party, win in the democratic
competitions," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He lauded the DPP leadership for promising to "look deeply into
themselves" when they bowed three times in front of the people to
show their determination to take full responsibility for the party's
poor performance.</P>
      <P>Ma said the government must not stop there but should continue to
investigate all political corruption cases such as the Kaohsiung
rapid transit scandal and other irregularities in order to return
justice to the people.</P>
      <P>Ma's call for leading a government of integrity was echoed by
Chou Hsi-wei, who won the Taipei County election and promised to use
his four years in office to make it "the most clean and efficient"
government that cares about all citizens.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Dec.   3  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu won his
re-election battle Saturday despite strong doubts by a rival camp in
the final week of the campaign over whether his health would allow
him to serve a second term.</P>
      <P>A spokeswoman for Hu's camp declared his victory at 6: 30 p.m.
after a majority of the ballots were counted.</P>
      <P>Hu led his opponents from the outset during the vote counting.
Final figures released by the Central Election Commission showed that
Hu, of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), captured 262,667 votes, about
58 percent of the total votes.</P>
      <P>Hu's chief opponent from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), Lin Chia-lung, received 87,065 votes, representing 39 percent
of the total votes. Another candidate, Shen Chi-hui, of the People
First Party (PFP), got 10,061, or 2.2 percent, of the votes.</P>
      <P>Hu's elated campaign staff set off firecrackers at his campaign
headquarters to celebrate the victory as well-wishers congratulated
him.</P>
      <P>In his victory speech, Hu said that his re-election was not only
his victory but also the victory of Taichung City. He promised that
the future of Taichung will only be better, and that he would work
even harder in his second term to make Taichung "one of the most
shining cities in Asia."</P>
      <P>Hu also expressed relief that there is no need for KMT Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou to resign his post because the KMT won in 14 of Taiwan's
21 cities and counties contested. Ma had vowed before the election
that he would quit the KMT chairmanship if the party could not win in
more than half, or 11, of the cities and counties.</P>
      <P>Lin formally acknowledged his defeat at 6:40 p.m. and offered his
congratulations to Hu over the phone. He said he will remain a good
citizen of Taichung and continue to make contributions to the city.</P>
      <P>Analysts believe that the KMT chairman's vow to quit as party
leader if his self-imposed goal was not met influenced the results of
the election in Taichung considerably by attracting votes from
supporters of the PFP candidate, because they would not like to see
the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP lose its star leader.</P>

    <DATELINE>Nantou,  Taiwan,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) candidate Lee
Chao-ching was elected Nantou magistrate Saturday, defeating
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Tsai Huang-liang and
incumbent magistrate Lin Tzung-nan who quit the DPP to seek
re-election.</P>
      <P>Political analysts said the union of the KMT-led "pan-blue
alliance" and the split of the DPP-led "pan-green" camp were the main
reasons why the "pan-blues" were able to regain control in Nantou
County after a hiatus of eight years.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 400,000 voters in Nantou County, with the
support ratio between the "pan-blue alliance" and the "pan-green"
camp registering six to four traditionally.</P>
      <P>However, the ratio seems to have drawn closer in several recent
elections. During the 2004 presidential election, the "pan-blue"
ticket of Lien Chan and James Soong only won 8,000 votes more than
the DPP ticket of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette
Lu. In the legislative elections held the same year, the "pan-blues"
and "pan-greens" garnered two seats each out of the four legislative
seats available in the county.</P>
      <P>This situation indicates that neither the "pan-blues" nor the
"pan-greens" can withstand a split without risking a defeat in an
election, and the competition between Tsai and Lin for the limited
"pan-green" support base foretold a hard battle in the county,
analysts said.</P>
      <P>By contrast, Lee managed to obtain the full support of the
"pan-blue alliance, " with Chen Chih-pin from the People First Party
deciding not to run after losing to Lee in opinion polls. Lin
Ming-chin, who had quit the KMT to run for the post, also withdrew
from the race eventually.</P>
      <P>Lending to the "pan-blue" momentum was the wide-spread wish among
Nantou residents for a new magistrate, as the unemployment rate in
the county remains high six years after the 921 earthquake, analysts
said.</P>
      <P>Admitting defeat, the DPP's Tsai said there were three reasons
for his failure. One was that he did not work hard enough to win the
support of local residents. The other two reasons were the upset of
morale of the DPP in the wake of a series of scandals involving
officials in the DPP government and the division of the "pan-green"
camp, Tsai said.</P>

      <P>Yang said he will work even harder during his second term so that

      <P>In the coming four years, Yang said the Kaohsiung County
Government will carry out a number of major construction projects,

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) should begin soul-searching instead of blaming individual
leaders such as President Chen Shui-bian or DPP Chairman Su
Tseng-chang for the party's dismal showing in local elections, a
party stalwart said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Tuan Yi-kang, convener of the DPP's New Tide Faction, said all
party members must honestly face the party's poor election results in
order to regain the confidence of the people.</P>
      <P>The party won only six cities and counties, all in southern
Taiwan, in a race for 23 local government seats, while the major
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) won 14, including the largest, Taipei
County, and the "most symbolic," Chiayi City.</P>
      <P>Tuan attributed the DPP's failure to the "overall environment and
the new election system of combining all three elections in a day of
voting" -- the elections of city, county and town government heads as
well as council members -- that he said are not to the advantage of
the party.</P>
      <P>He also blamed the party's election strategists for failing to
give the public a new vision.</P>
      <P>He refused to comment on DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang's
resignation in the wake of the elections fiasco.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHAIRMAN TO STEP DOWN OVER  POOR SHOWING IN  ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Su Cheng-chang admitted that his party suffered a major
setback in the city and county chief elections Saturday and said that
he would step down to take responsibility.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP garnered only six out of 23 posts up for
grabs in the elections, Su said that "this is the people's warning to
the DPP."</P>
      <P>Although the DPP did poorly, he urged all party members and
supporters not "to lose heart because of this one loss, " adding that
the "love and responsibility for Taiwan" is everlasting and that only
by believing that "the DPP will be better, will Taiwan be better."</P>
      <P>"The DPP still has a long way to go, " Su said emotionally.
"Because Taiwan people have high expectations for the DPP, the party
has to begin serious soul-searching to attain higher standards.</P>
      <P>"Our team has no place for members whose integrity is flawed, and
we cannot disappoint the public through our mistakes," he added.</P>
      <P>The DPP has fought an uphill battle since the Kaohsiung mass
rapid transit corruption scandal involving a former presidential aide
came to light in late August.</P>
      <P>In a last-ditch attempt to boost support for the DPP, Su said
Friday that he would step down if the DPP did not win 10 seats or if
it lost the key Taipei county -- the largest constituency with 2.75
million voters. The main opposition candidate won the Taipei county
magistrate race.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said the DPP's drubbing can be attributed to
an array of factors, and that the DPP chairman or anyone else
shouldn't shoulder the responsibility alone.</P>
      <P>"This big loss shows that the performance of the DPP falls far
short of public expectations, " Hsieh said, adding that the DPP needs
to engage in soul-searching and improve to "make a new start."</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun, who
concurrently serves as a vice chairman of the DPP's campaign
committee, said that he felt sad and regretted the poor showing by
the party, but "a defeat is a defeat, and there are no excuses."
"This is because the people of Taiwan are disappointed and
dissatisfied with the ruling party, and the DPP has some serious
introspection to do, " he said.</P>
      <P>He reaffirmed that the party has a responsibility to face all
issues, and that it will not be defeated by this setback because the
DPP is a party that is serious about pursing reforms.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) candidate Chou
Hsi-wei was elected Taipei County magistrate Saturday, ending the
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) 16-year rule in Taiwan's most
populous constituency.</P>
      <P>Chou, a KMT legislator, defeated DPP candidate Luo Wen-jia by
capturing 54.35 percent of the total votes. Final figures released by
the Central Election Commission showed that Chou received 998,739
votes, ahead of Luo's 798,233 votes.</P>
      <P>The figures also showed that the turnout rate for Taipei County's
2.75 million voters in the election was 66.35 percent.</P>
      <P>In a victory speech at his campaign headquarters, Chou thanked
the residents of the county and pledged that he would cooperate with
friends from all political parties in the most humble manner and
fulfill his campaign promises.</P>
      <P>Chou said he would spend the next four years to make the Taipei
County Government one of the "cleanest, most effective and most
caring" local governments in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also said he would not move into the existing office of the
magistrate in the county government's high-rise building, but will
find another location where he will be more accessible to his
constituents.</P>
      <P>One of Chou's major campaign promises is to push for the county
to combine with Taipei City into one administrative area, so that
residents of the county can enjoy the same resources as Taipei
residents, instead of being treated as second-class citizens.</P>
      <P>He said he will work with opposition legislators to have relevant
laws amended to pave the way for the merging of the county and the
city.</P>
      <P>Chou's election is seen as the KMT's most important gain in the
"three in one" local government elections, with the KMT holding sway
over 21 cities and counties in Taiwan and two counties in outlying
islands. The KMT won in 14 of the 21 counties and counties of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Political analysts believe that among the factors that
contributed to the KMT's landslide victory were the series of
recently exposed corruption scandals involving ranking DPP government
officials and the people's hope for a clean, capable government
through KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou because of his clean image and
charisma.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCANDAL HURT DPP IN LOCAL ELECTIONS: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A corruption scandal involving a former
presidential aide hurt the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
damaging the image of integrity and reform it has tried to project, a
scholar said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yung-ming, an associate researcher at Academia Sinica, made
the remarks regarding the outcome of the city and county chief
elections which saw the DPP win only six seats out of 23 up for
grabs, compared with the main opposition Kuomintang's 14 seats and
another two seats for the People First Party and the New Party, --
allies of the KMT -- and another one for an independent.</P>
      <P>"The outcome will affect President Chen Shui-bian's leadership,
but as there is still no one who can replace him within the party, he
won't become a lame duck for the time being."</P>
      <P>As for the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP, KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou has proved to be the standard bearer of the
alliance, and the elections only accentuated the fact that "Ma is
capable of living up to the expectations of the public."</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, Hsu said that if President Chen can't make more
positive and larger-scale reforms in response to the events of the
day, a fresh call within the party will emerge, and "the voices could
possibly challenge the power of the president."</P>
      <P>Hsu said that second-phase financial reforms should be the top
priority of the Cabinet after the elections. The planned national
economic development advisory conference should have cross-strait
issues as its focus, and it is expected that "Chen's policy will be
moving toward being more open."</P>
      <P>It is also expected that the Cabinet will undergo a major
reshuffle, but whether the pressure will be strong enough to have
Premier Frank Hsieh replaced remains to be seen.</P>

A year after marines led an American assault
force in recapturing Falluja, 10 marines
conducting a foot patrol on the edge of the
city were killed at dusk Thursday by a bomb
fashioned from several large artillery shells.
Eleven other marines were wounded in the blast, 
the worst in a drumbeat of insurgent attacks on 
American troops in and around Falluja that 
never ceased after the Nov. 2004 offensive 
there that cost 60 American marines and 
soldiers their lives. The high casualty toll in

Wall Street Journal: Chemical Disaster
In China Fuels Pollution Worries

China's slow and initially secretive
response to a chemical disaster is threatening
to turn the spread of environmental damage from
the nation's fast-growing industries into a
mounting international issue. As a massive,
noxious chemical slick moved north to Russia,
China's top environmental protection official
was forced to step down Friday, the
highest-ranking official to be removed from
office for an environmental incident. A person
familiar with the situation said more
resignations were likely by local officials and
possibly executives at China National Petroleum
Corp., the government-owned oil giant that owns
the factory that caused the disaster. And in
what could be the first sign of a public
backlash against China in the U.S. over the
pollution issue, California's state treasurer
urged its large teacher's pension fund to sell
its roughly $24 million holding of PetroChina.
China National Petroleum is the parent company of
PetroChina, which is listed in New York and 
Hong Kong.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>ELECTIONS ANOTHER VICTORY FOR TAIWAN'S DEMOCRACY: VICE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Sunday that
although the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) suffered a
major setback in the Dec. 3 local government elections, the polls as
a whole represented another victory for Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a colloquium hosted by the Democratic Pacific
Union on Taiwan's elections and reforms, Lu said that she and
President Chen Shui-bian are willing to take responsibility for the
DPP's failure in Saturday's "three-in-one" elections, in which the
ruling party garnered only 41.95 percent of the total votes while the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) won 50.96 percent.</P>
      <P>The DPP's winning only six of the local seats to the KMT's 14 was
a major setback for the ruling party, but the entire election process
-- with a higher-than-expected turnout of 66 percent and no violence
-- was a triumph for Taiwan's democracy, Lu noted.</P>
      <P>Lu offered her congratulations to KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou for
his party's sweeping victory and lauded him for his humble attitude
in accepting victory. Upon winning Saturday's elections by a
landslide, Ma told his party and KMT supporters that "we can
celebrate for one evening, but that's all, as we must continue
working to overcome the many challenges that still lie ahead."</P>
      <P>Lu also saluted DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang for his courage in
immediately offering to step down from the DPP chairmanship to take
full responsibility for the party's failure in the elections.</P>
      <P>The vice president said that although Su has offered to resign,
DPP members can still consider whether they should accept the
chairman's resignation.</P>
      <P>Lu repeated President Chen's recent remarks that the question of
whether there will be a Cabinet reshuffle doesn't necessarily have to
be related to the results of the Dec. 3 elections. She appealed to
the DPP members and the country alike to "give the president some
more time" to ponder the issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lu stressed that failures can be transformed into
strength leading to success. Citing the setback suffered by then
Taipei City Mayor Chen Shui-bian in 1998 in his re-election bid as an
example, Lu said that the 1998 failure was transformed into an
invincible strength for Chen to win the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The vice president exhorted all DPP members and supporters to be
confident in the party's strength in winning back its mandate in next
year's mayoral elections in metropolitan Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI COUNTY MAGISTRATE-ELECT ANNOUNCES THREE TOP PRIORITIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei County Magistrate-elect Chou Hsi-wei
of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Sunday that streamlining the
county's finances, boosting business and industrial development, and
taking care of the disadvantaged will be the three top priorities of
his county government after he assumes office.</P>
      <P>Chou, who ended the Democratic Progressive Party's 16-year rule
in Taiwan's most populous county by garnering 998,739 votes in
Saturday's election, said during a thank-you ride Sunday that he will
see to it that a "transparent" and written account of Taipei County
government's finances will be made public one month after he takes
office on Dec. 20.</P>
      <P>Taking heed of the imbalance in development among the 29
townships and rural townships around Taipei County, Chou said that he
will see to it that various task forces and teams made up of experts
and professionals are organized within three months to help him
address the various issues that Taiwan's largest county is facing.</P>
      <P>Chou said that he will also try to persuade Taipei City-based
industrial conglomerates to relocate their operations to Taipei
County to take advantage of the county's huge untapped hinterlands.</P>
      <P>Chou, a KMT legislator, defeated Democratic Progressive Party
candidate Luo Wen-jia by capturing 54.35 percent of the total votes.
Final figures released by the Central Election Commission showed that
Chou received 998,739 votes, ahead of Luo's 798,233 votes.</P>
      <P>In a victory speech at his campaign headquarters Sunday, Chou
thanked the residents of the county and pledged to cooperate with
friends from all political parties in the most humble manner and
fulfill his campaign promises.</P>
      <P>He also said he will not move into the existing office of the
magistrate in the county government's high-rise building and instead
will establish "mobile" offices to make his county government's
services more accessible to his constituents.</P>
      <P>Noting that there are more than 3,000 artists around Taipei
County, Chou said he will let the magistrate's office be refurbished
into an activity center for the artists to help boost their
creativity.</P>
      <P>One of Chou's major campaign promises was to push for the county
to combine with Taipei City into one administrative area, so that
residents of the county can enjoy the same resources as Taipei
residents, instead of being treated as second-class citizens.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) -- the
partner of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the
"pan-green camp" -- Sunday urged the DPP government to heed public
opinion and devote more of its efforts to economic development.</P>
      <P>Legislator Ho Min-hao, convener of the TSU's legislative caucus,
said the DPP government should conduct an overall review of what led
to its severe drubbing by the voters in Saturday's "three-in-one"
local government elections.</P>
      <P>Ho said the message from the people is clear: they want economic
development and a clean government, but the Cabinet's performance
apparently has not been up to their expectations.</P>
      <P>He called on the DPP government to institute reform more
resolutely, rather than being bent on giving the people more of the
same, because the people have made their choice with their ballots.</P>
      <P>On cross-Taiwan Strait relations, the TSU legislator said the DPP
government should seek consensus with the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party on such issues
as allowing direct transportation between Taiwan and China and
permitting people from the Chinese mainland to come to Taiwan on
sightseeing trips.</P>
      <P>Reflecting on the elections, Ho acknowledged that the TSU did not
do very well, as the party failed to win any of the 23 mayor and
county magistrate races and only managed to obtain a total of 12
seats in all of the city and county council races.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN TO TRY TO REPAIR DAMAGED RELATIONS WITH PFP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Sunday that he will try to mend fences with People
First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong, who had complained about the
KMT's insistence on fielding its own candidate for mayor in Keelung
City, where the PFP's candidate had a great chance of winning.</P>
      <P>The KMT candidate, incumbent Keelung Mayor Hsu Tsai-li, won a
second term by defeating PFP candidate Liu Wen-hsiung and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union's candidate, Chen Chien-min, in Saturday's election.
Before the election, Soong warned that the KMT would have to fend for
itself in the legislature without the assistance of the PFP if Liu
lost.</P>
      <P>Basking in the glory of his party's landslide victory in the
"three-in-one" local government elections over the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), Ma said in an interview with the CTV that if
he were in Soong's position, he would also be unhappy about Liu's
setback.</P>
      <P>However, he explained that the KMT's nomination of Hsu had been
finalized before he became the KMT chairman, and that, as the KMT
leader, he had no choice but to support Hsu all the way.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is also Taipei mayor, said he will follow Legislative
Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng's suggestion to pay a visit to Soong and
try to repair the damaged relations between the KMT and the PFP.</P>
      <P>Ma said the "pan-blue alliance" should set its eyes on a wider
horizon, as there is much room for the two parties to work together.
He expressed the hope that the cooperative relationship between the
two parties will continue unaffected.</P>
      <P>KMT-PFP cooperation is facing new challenges, as the PFP is
sliding down the road of being marginalized in Taiwan's politics.
Some of the PFP's 34 legislators are indignant toward the KMT's
unyielding stance toward PFP candidates. Other PFP legislators are
pondering whether they should leave the PFP and join the KMT.</P>
      <P>The number of seats held by the "pan-blue alliance" in the
legislature has decreased to 110, including 76 for the KMT and 34 for
the PFP, because four KMT legislators are set to assume their new
posts after winning in the mayor and county magistrate elections. As
a result, the alliance has lost its slight majority in the 220-seat
legislature.</P>
      <P>Analysts point out that KMT and PFP lawmakers not only need to
work together even more closely, but also have to seek support from
the independents if they want to maintain their checks and balances
role of keeping the DPP government in line.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA POLICY TO BE LEGISLATIVE FOCUS FOLLOWING LOCAL ELECTIONSBy S.C. ChangCNA Staff Reporter</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> With the local elections over and the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
a big winner, the party's initiatives about Taiwan's cross-strait
policy are expected to become central issues to be debated at the
Legislative Yuan, observers said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Together with its "pan-blue alliance" ally, the People First
Party (PFP), the KMT has been calling for direct transportation links
across the Taiwan Strait and an opening of Taiwan's tourism market to
Chinese visitors, policies that have the support of the business
community but that the DPP government has been wary of because of
national security concerns.</P>
      <P>The DPP, in making its China policy, has put more emphasis on
Taiwan's sovereignty and national security, sometimes to the point of
hamstringing Taiwan's economic interests, as can be seen in reports
by American and European chambers of commerce in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pan Wei-kang, deputy secretary-general of the KMT's legislative
caucus, said the city and county elections results show the "pan-blue
alliance's" policy proposals enjoy popular support. Pan said she
expects the KMT and PFP to cooperate further in pushing the
alliance's relatively liberal China policy in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Of the alliance's various policy proposals, the one that deals
with direct transportation links across the strait is "the most
important because it will play a locomotive role in Taiwan's economic
development, " said Huang Yi-chiao, convener of the PFP legislative
caucus.</P>
      <P>Against this background, the "pan-blue alliance's" proposal to
open Sungshan-Hong Kong/Macao direct flight routes has been put on
the legislative agenda, a proposal that has won the signatures of
even some DPP lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-chun, secretary-general of the DPP legislative caucus,
said President Chen Shui-bian had announced that a second national
economic development conference would be organized to discuss such
topics as launching direct shipping and air services between Taiwan
and China and allowing Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Within the "pan-blue alliance, " firm cooperation is not ensured
because of election squabbles and division. However, Huang said
improving cross-strait relations is a matter of ultimate importance
and should not be used as a pretext for partisan conflicts.</P>
      <P>Still, the DPP's Chen reminded his "pan-blue alliance" colleagues
at the legislature to place the nation's overall interests above all
else and discuss the issues connected with national security and
sovereignty rationally.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that lawmakers will also rationally debate
other key issues, such as the arms purchase package and review of the
president's nominations for the Control Yuan and the budgets for the
Mainland Affairs Council and the Government Information Office, at
the legislature which will resume meeting on Monday.</P>
      <P>The public has given the KMT a new mandate in the just-concluded
local elections to pursue economic and political reforms that include
improving ties with China. It's not yet known how far the Chen
Shui-bian government will go to resist the KMT's China initiatives
for the sake of national security.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers of both the ruling and opposition parties will have to
show their wisdom to navigate between the public's demand for a more
open China policy and the DPP's inclination toward a more
conservative one.</P>

(By Jorge Liu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has once again deeply impressed
the international community as a shining example of democracy with
the success of its "three-in-one" local elections Saturday, according
to a Washington-based China hand.</P>
      <P>Alan Romberg, director of the East Asia Program of the Henry L.
Stimson Center, said during an exclusive interview with CNA Saturday
that American political observers are impressed with the success of
the elections, viewing it as a deepening of democracy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"While, as also happens in American elections, there were
features of some campaigns that were negative, the basic democratic
process worked once again, " he said.</P>
      <P>Romberg further said that Americans will remain attentive to
whether there is good governance in Taiwan. "This is, obviously,
first and foremost a matter for people in Taiwan to deal with. But
given the deep level of involvement between our societies and our
economies, it does matter to Americans whether Taiwan is successful
at all levels," he added.</P>
      <P>As to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's major setback in
the elections, he noted that many DPP officials have already said
publicly that the party needs to reflect on why it was so broadly
rejected by the voters.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Romberg suggested that the triumphant
Kuomintang needs to reflect on why it won and avoid the pitfall of
assuming its impressive victory means voters will automatically
support it in upcoming elections.</P>
      <P>"It seems to me that the people of Taiwan will continue to look
at performance in office as the basis for judging whether an
individual or a party merits support in the future, " he added.</P>
      <P>Romberg also said that Americans will remain committed to working
with Taiwan to ensure that peace and stability are maintained in
cross-strait relations. And, more than that, they will hope for
continuing positive and mutually beneficial dealings between the two
sides of the strait, he added.</P>
      <P>"In my personal judgment, there is considerable room for greater
flexibility on both sides in promoting cross-strait economic and
other linkages that meet the needs of the people in Taiwan and on the
mainland, " he said, adding that whether the Dec. 3 elections results
will have an impact on Taiwan's cross-strait policies remains to be
seen.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will not overhaul its China
policy following the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's defeat in
Saturday's "three-in-one" local elections, Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) Vice Chairman You Ying-lung said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on the impact of the elections on
cross-Taiwan Strait relations, You said that Saturday's polls should
not be viewed as a public referendum on the government's China
policy, asserting that the government will not make any major changes
to its current China policy despite the ruling DPP's poor showing in
the elections.</P>
      <P>The government must be coherent and consistent in drawing up
stable policies, You said, adding that the MAC will continue
promoting cross-strait charter flight services, as well as the
opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists, and a resumption of
cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>You also played down the remarks made by President Chen Shui-bian
while campaigning for a DPP candidate in Ilan County last week that
the government would tighten its China policy to protect the
interests of the Taiwan people should the opposition "pan blue
alliance" win Saturday's elections. The president was just reminding
the public that a "pan blue" victory would not necessarily mean an
easing in cross-strait policy, he explained.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Beijing would do anything against Taiwan after the
elections, You argued that cross-strait relations have turned sour
due to China's hard-line position toward Taiwan, rather than due to
the DPP's strategy.</P>
      <P>Expressing the hope for cross-strait peace and stability, he said
that the MAC does not expect to see anything similar to the
Anti-Secession Law produced by Beijing again.</P>
      <P>The main opposition KMT won a landslide in Saturday's elections
for city mayors and county magistrates, city and county councilors,
and village and townships heads, dealing a heavy blow to the ruling
DPP after President Chen Shui-bian won re-election in 2004 by a
razor-thin margin.</P>
      <P>The KMT won 14 of the 23 city mayor and county magistrate posts
being contested, well ahead of the DPP's six, as well as a large

    <HEADLINE>DPP ELECTION FAILURE TO HARDEN BEIJING'S RESOLVE NOT TO HAVE DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  3  (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP's) failure in Saturday's local elections will harden
Beijing's resolve not to deal with it, although the DPP's China
policy was not a factor contributing to its setback in the polls, a
researcher at the Heritage Foundation said Saturday.</P>
      <P>In a response to questions from a CNA reporter, John Tkacik, an
American Chinese affairs expert at the Washington, D.C.-based think
tank, said the elections represented a referendum on the DPP
administration's performance, not a referendum on Taiwan's future
with China.</P>
      <P>Virtually every race was decided on local and domestic issues,
and in every district, even in the constituencies where the DPP
actually did manage to hold on to power, voters have been very
disappointed with the DPP administration across-the-board, Tkacik
said.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, he said, the KMT continually touted its ability to
improve relations with China as its central theme in the campaign,
and the DPP began to fall into the trap by warning that a loss for it
in the elections would undermine the Executive Yuan's flexibility in
dealing with China.</P>
      <P>Tkacik said the bitter battle between the KMT and the DPP over
China policy in the context of domestic elections led foreign media
to view the results as an expression of support for the KMT's new
vision for Taiwan's future with China.</P>
      <P>With this incorrect view, Tkacik said, Beijing will be even more
resolute about not engaging in any dialogue with the DPP and will
wait until 2008 in the expectation that a KMT candidate will win and
follow former KMT Chairman Lien Chan's policies of reaching out to
it.</P>
      <P>The DPP only won six of the 23 city mayor and county magistrate
posts up for grabs in Saturday's elections, down from 10 in the 2001
elections, while the KMT won 14, up from eight last time.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
government should relax its cross-Taiwan Strait policy for Taiwan's
own good, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>In a TV interview after his party's landslide victory in
Saturday's "three-in-one" local government elections, Ma said he did
not pay too much attention to President Chen Shui-bian's threat made
before the elections that the cross-strait policy would be tightened
if the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party won
overwhelmingly because the president's logic did not make sense.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman, who is also Taipei mayor, pointed out that
Taiwan is ideally located at the center of East Asia and next to
China -- the world's largest consumer market and factory -- and that
Taiwan should make good use of this advantage.</P>
      <P>He said the "three direct links" between Taiwan and China in
trade, post and transportation are necessary and should be
implemented as soon as possible so that Taiwanese entrepreneurs can
gain a foothold in China's emerging market and have access to its
resources.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the president should be blamed for the DPP's
humiliating defeat in the elections, Ma said that because the
president involved himself so deeply in the elections, he is of
course responsible for the consequences.</P>
      <P>He explained that the DPP lost the people's trust mainly because
of a series of corruption scandals involving several senior officials
at the Presidential Office and that the president's presence at every
rally to boost the campaigns of DPP candidates was bound to remind
the voters of those scandals.</P>
      <P>Asked again whether the president should acknowledge the faults
of his government and apologize to the nation, Ma said that doing so
would be helpful not only to the president himself but also to

    <HEADLINE>KMT WIN MAKES MAJOR ARMS PROCUREMENT MORE UNLIKELY: U. S. SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Olive Lin and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang's (KMT) victory in the
Dec. 3 "three-in-one" elections over the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) will make it harder for a major U. S. arms
procurement package to clear Taiwan's legislature, a U. S. scholar
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The election results will push the ruling DPP to examine and
adjust its policies, while the main opposition KMT is expected to
further toughen its stance, thereby making it harder for the arms
package to clear the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan, June
Teufel Dreyer, a professor of political science of the University of
Miami said.</P>
      <P>The DPP administration's poor performance and a series of
scandals seriously hurt its showing in the weekend elections, and the
ruling party will be forced to re-assess its policies to fend off
defeats in future elections, she said. On the other hand, the KMT's
victory will boost party chairman Ma Ying-jeou's ambition to vie for
presidency in 2008, she pointed out.</P>
      <P>The election outcome has largely slashed the possibility of the
arms bill's passage at the Legislative Yuan, a situation which might
lead to more friction between Taiwan and the United States, she said.</P>
      <P>She also predicted that major figures of the opposition "pan blue
alliance" of the KMT, the People First Party (PFP) and the New Party,
will visit China more frequently in the future.</P>
      <P>The KMT won a landslide victory in the "three-in-one" elections
by taking 14 of the 23 city mayors and county magistrates posts up
for grabs, well ahead of 6 seized by the DPP. Of the 901 city and
county councilors seats, the KMT won 408, while the DPP won just 192.
The KMT also took a majority of the 319 village and township chief
posts being contested, winning 173 to the DPP's 35.</P>
      <P>The DPP has actively been advocating for the passage of the
NT$350 billion (about US$10.5 billion) special budget for the major
military procurement bill at the opposition-dominated Legislative
Yuan since after President Chen Shui-bian narrowly won re-election in
May 2004 against the "pan blue alliance" ticket.</P>
      <P>The bill for the arms procurement, which includes eight
diesel-fueled submarines and 12 anti-submarines aircraft, has been
stalled at the Legislative Yuan since the middle of last year.
However, lawmakers have agreed to include the budget for the purchase
of six PAC III Patriot anti-missile batteries, the third item in the
package, in regular annual budget for the Ministry of National
Defense.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ELECTIONS RESULTS SIGNAL POWER SHIFT: ANALYSTSBy   Flor   WangCNA staff writer</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The outcome of Saturday's "three-in-one"
elections signaled a major power shift between the ruling and
opposition camps, which is expected to have a significant influence
on the 2007 legislative elections and the 2008 presidential race,
political observers said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) strong performance over
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the local government
elections preludes a KMT return in future elections in view of the
noticeable expansion in its voter base in northern and central
Taiwan, according to the analysts.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the DPP is set to undergo a power
restructuring and party line adjustments in order to solidify its
voter base, they predicted, adding that coming elections will pose
severe challenges to the party now that the KMT will be able to
allocate much greater resources in local governments.</P>
      <P>The KMT seized 14 out of 23 city mayor and county magistrate
posts in Saturday's elections, up from 9 in the previous elections in
2001. The DPP only managed to win six of the posts, and all of these
are in southern Taiwan. The KMT also won a majority of the city and
county councilor and village and township chief contests.</P>
      <P>Further fueling its morale, the KMT also took Taipei county --
Taiwan's most populous administrative area -- as well as Ilan county
and Chiayi city, which have long been DPP strongholds.</P>
      <P>The KMT's landslide victory will also further cement the
leadership role of KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou in the opposition
"pan blue alliance" and boost his chances of winning the presidency
in 2008, Wang Lee-yeh, a professor of political science at Tunghai
University said, noting that Ma will face no other challengers from
within the "pan blue alliance" in his quest to become Taiwan's next
head of state.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yung-ming, an Academia Sinica assistant researcher, opined
that the DPP will be unable to turn the tide in its favor if it fails
to implement sweeping reforms in the coming years ahead of the 2008
presidential race.</P>
      <P>With the DPP's power base having contracted to southern Taiwan, a
power struggle within the party is inevitable, keeping heavy pressure
on party heavyweights vying for the presidency, he said.</P>
      <P>Sheng Chih-jen, a political science professor at Soochow
University, contended that the DPP must undergo serious
soul-searching and thorough self-examination to regain the public's
faith, which has been seriously shaken by a series of corruption
scandals involving high-ranking officials in President Chen
Shui-bian's administration.</P>
      <P>The big question for the DPP at present is how the party can
convince the people that Chen will promote clean politics and stay
clean himself, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAINAN MAGISTRATE ELECTION RESULT A WARNING FOR DPPBy Taijing WuCNA Staff Writer</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,  Dec.  4 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The result of the magistrate race in the
southern county of Tainan in Saturday's "three-in-one" elections is
seen as a serious warning for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP).</P>
      <P>Although the DPP candidate Su Huan-chih won the election, his KMT
rival Kuo Tien-tsai only fell 16,696 votes short of victory, which is
rare in a region considered to be a traditional DPP stronghold.</P>
      <P>The result represented a steep decline in support for the ruling
party which garnered over 64 percent of the vote in the county in
last year's presidential election.</P>
      <P>The slim margin of victory Saturday left many high-ranking
officials in the "pan-green camp" surprised.</P>
      <P>"I never could have imagined such a scenario, where the DPP has
lost many of its base supporters," Su said.</P>
      <P>Su said that the poor showing is related to the Kaohsiung mass
rapid transit scandal in which several high-ranking officials in
President Chen Shui-bian's administration have been suspected of
involvement as well as to the administration's plan to cut the
preferential 18-percent interest rate for pension savings enjoyed by
certain retired civil servants, military personnel and teachers.</P>
      <P>"The DPP has to undergo some serious self-examination in the wake
of this outcome," Su said.</P>
      <P>He added that the DPP must figure out how to consolidate its
support in the county as many of the party's base supporters could be
leaning toward the opposing camp.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, the party will have a difficult time winning the 2008
presidential election, he said.</P>

(By Kin-fai Lo &amp; S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong people's dream for a general
election of their government will be realized when they have the
courage and enthusiasm of the Taiwanese, a political observer said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Li Ping, writing for the Apple Daily, pointed out that the most
important lesson for Hong Kongers to learn from Taiwan's democratic
experience is Taiwan people's determination to safeguard their rights
and dignity by electing whoever they like in spite of Beijing's
military and non-military threats.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Taiwan's "three-in-one" elections which saw the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party suffer a great setback Saturday,
Li said there have been criticisms about the mud-slinging tactics and
"superstar stumpings" by major political figures that outshined
individual candidates' policy proposals.</P>
      <P>These shortcomings did not stop the international community from
crediting Taiwanese for their enthusiasm to pursue democracy and
courage to maintain their dignity, he noted.</P>
      <P>Some people in Hong Kong are using Taiwan's example to claim that
time is not yet ripe for Hong Kong to hold a general election, he
said. However, he pointed out that Taiwan lifted the martial law in
1987 and the ban on forming new political parties in 1988, and then
held its first general election to elect the legislature in 1992 and
the first popular election of the president in 1996.</P>
      <P>In Hong Kong, there are neither martial law nor a ban on
organizing political parties, and it has returned to Chinese rule for
eight years, "on what grounds do we say time is not ripe yet for a
general election?" Li asked.</P>
      <P>"Say we have to wait. But please tell me, for how much longer? "
he added.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian instructed Premier
Frank Hsieh Sunday to "make thorough preparations" by inviting
opposition leaders to a new round of national economic conference, a
move that could delay the conference until after the lunar New Year
holidays.</P>
      <P>The government had earlier planned to hold the conference before
the end of January, when the Chinese New Year holidays begin.
Saturday's election setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) apparently has changed the government's plan.</P>
      <P>After a lengthy discussion with the premier, the president said
opposition views must be incorporated at the national economic
conference, according to government spokesman Cho Jung-tai.</P>
      <P>The two did not set a date for holding the important conference,
but it's likely it will be postponed until after the lunar New Year,
Cho added.</P>
      <P>Hsieh had proposed to hold the conference in two stages, with
representatives from the business, the government and the academia
participating in the first stage and political party delegates
joining the second stage.</P>
      <P>Now the president wants an extensive coverage of topics and

Motse's lesson of the day: "When the administration of the ruler
answers to the desire of the subjects, it manifests an understanding
of approvals and disapprovals of the people. When there is such an
understanding, the good will be discovered and rewarded and the bad
will be discovered and punished, and the country will surely attain
order."</TEXT>

      <P>A U.S. scholar said Sunday that the

an overwhelming victory in the islandwide local government
chief elections. </P>
      <P>The KMT won 14 of the 23 mayor and magistrate posts up for grabs,
as well as a majority of the seats in the council and township chief

      <P>"Now the onus will be on KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and his party
to do what I think the people wanted the DPP to do and didn't,
namely, push hard on reform, anti-corruption, and so forth, " he
said, adding that "they will have some difficulty doing this, but if
they do not, they will end up with the same problem as the DPP."</P>
      <P>Waldron further said that "a lot can change in two years. The KMT
has another difficult challenge. They have to show that they can do
better in a lot of things than the DPP has done. The KMT is certainly
not a party free of corruption. And it is rather divided."</P>
      <P>He also said that the KMT having more confidence after winning
the elections makes it less necessary for the party to seek China's
support,</P>
      <P>"Ma believes that if he does well, he can get Taiwan people to
vote for him in 2008 without having to go over and being photographed
in China, which would actually probably hurt his chances, " Waldron
said.</P>
      <P>Waldron, who also serves as the vice president of the
International Assessment and Strategy Center, said that China will
likely interpret the outcome of the elections as "a repudiation of
President Chen Shui-bian's foreign policy."</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he said that he himself believes the big issues in
the elections were domestic.</P>
      <P>"Internal factors were key and in particular, the DPP has never
really rooted out corruption as it had promised to do, but rather got
distracted in start stop activities, endlessly shifting focus, " the
professor added.</P>
      <P>According to Waldron, the elections results are really an
indication of the Taiwan voters' dissatisfaction with the DPP. He
compared the outcome to that of the 1992 U.S. presidential election
which Bill Clinton won. "A lot of people say that the (American)
people did not mean to let Clinton win, they were just fed up with
Bush. And I suspect that's part of the reason behind Saturday's
elections results," he said.</P>
      <P>Asked what the DPP can do after its defeat in the elections, the
scholar suggested that the party should do "a very thorough
self-examination and house-cleaning and decide what their core
mission is going to be."</P>
      <P>"The number one priority must be to improve Taiwan, making the
education better, making the health system better, making the legal
system better, making the civil service better, getting rid of the
remaining corruption, that sort of thing. That's the way to win
elections, and the same is true for the KMT, " he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP NEEDS TO REVIEW FUNDAMENTAL MATTERS: LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) should review some fundamental matters, including its
administrative polices related to meeting the needs of the general
public, in light of its defeat in the Dec. 3 local government
elections, DPP Legislator-at-Large Tsai Ing-wen said Monday.</P>
      <P>The DPP should not only face the cruel reality of being rejected
by voters, it should also review and perhaps overhaul its systems
fundamentally, such as the party's orientation, the distance between
the DPP party apparatus and the people, the gap between the DPP and
its supporters, as well as how it plays its role as the ruling party,
Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the call during a meeting of the Legislative Yuan
Finance Committee, where legislators and officials discussed matters
mainly pertaining to implementation results of the first national
economic conference, held Jan. 6, 2001, and the proposed holding of a
second national economic conference.</P>
      <P>Regarding the second national economic conference, Tsai, an
academic-turned-legislator, said that dozens of issues can be tackled
by the government and the private sector at the conference, slated to
be held prior to the Chinese New Year, which falls on Jan. 29, 2006.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the issues to be discussed at the conference should
include how policies should be carried out, how the ruling DPP should
seek to cooperate with the opposition parties, how to consolidate the
people's will, and how to make members of the administration team
more efficient and better trained.</P>
      <P>In Saturday's "three-in-one" elections, the DPP took only six of
the 23 city mayor and county magistrate posts up for grabs, while the
opposition Kuomintang won 14, representing one of the biggest
setbacks for the DPP since it became the ruling party in 2000.</P>

(By Y.S. Lo and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Association of European Journalists (AEJ)
adopted a resolution Sunday calling for the United Nations to stop
discriminating against Taiwan journalists and preventing them from
covering the news at U.N. institutions, particularly the activities
of the World Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>The association passed the resolution in its 44th General
Assembly and Congress which is being held in Patras, Greece Dec. 1-5.</P>
      <P>In the resolution, the association said that the U.N. authorities
handling media affairs have no right to arbitrarily treat different
media organizations differently or to decide which media
organizations are allowed to cover U.N. institutions' activities.</P>
      <P>"Adopting discriminating measures goes against the U.N.'s
principle of protecting freedom of the press," the resolution says.</P>
      <P>The association, which was founded in 1961 and which consists of
22 national sections each separately established in different
countries in Europe, also said in the resolution that it was shocked
by the fact that Taiwan journalists were refused permission by the
U.N. to cover last year's annual meeting of the World Health
Assembly, the highest decision-making body of the WHO.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the European Union has never taken a prejudiced
stance in its treatment of professional journalists, the association
urged in the resolution the leading international organization not to
adopt a double-standard in issuing press cards.</P>
      <P>The draft resolution was jointly introduced to the assembly by
the association's six members, who said they feel that the treatment
received by Taiwan reporters from the WHA authorities was unfair.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT-PFP MERGER MUST  HAPPEN NATURALLY: KMT CAUCUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  5  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Collaboration between the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and its ally the People First Party (PFP) has always
been welcomed by the KMT, but a merger of the two parties should
happen naturally, a KMT legislative whip said Monday.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's political landscape changed drastically after the
Dec. 3 local government elections in favor of the "pan-blue alliance"
led by the KMT, cooperation between the KMT and the PFP at the
Legislative Yuan has become even more pressing as the "pan-blue
alliance" now holds barely half of the seats in the Legislature, said
Tsai Ching-lung, a deputy convener of the KMT caucus.</P>
      <P>Party politics have been shaped after the Dec. 3 "three-in-one"
elections, in which the KMT won a sweeping victory, and the KMT will
help accelerate a substantive consolidation of the "pan-blue
alliance, " which also includes the PFP and the tiny New Party, Tsai
said.</P>
      <P>Tsai pointed out, however, that the much-talked-about KMT-PFP
merger should be conducted naturally without causing any
controversies that may widen rifts between the two brother parties
further.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng, also a KMT
heavyweight, did not think a post-election merger between the KMT and
the PFP would be instantly possible, saying that many substantive
problems, including personnel arrangement, would be challenges to be
tackled before such a consolidation becomes realistic.</P>
      <P>For example, Wang said, how should PFP Chairman James Soong be
positioned within the KMT-PFP merger is a challenging issue for the
"pan-blue alliance."</P>
      <P>Wang stressed that it is also imperative that the "pan-blue
alliance" seeks collaboration with the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union
now that the "pan-blue alliance" is a "weak majority" at the
Legislative Yuan with at least four KMT legislators being elected
local government heads.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang Yi-chiao, a PFP party whip at the Legislative
Yuan, said that the PFP would like to see a meeting between Soong and
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou -- as proposed by Ma Sunday -- prior to the
Chinese Lunar New Year, which falls on Jan. 29, 2006.</P>
      <P>The PFP will definitely give its supporters a "responsible"
answer prior to the Chinese Lunar New Year regarding a KMT-PFP
merger, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>Huang denied news reports that some members of the PFP
legislative caucus are seeking to return to the KMT fold after the
elections.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan needs to pay attention to the results
of Saturday's local elections in Taiwan as they could signal a shift
in the island's political landscape that could have an impact on
Japan-Taiwan relations, according to an editorial published by the
Nihon Keizai Shimbun Monday.</P>
      <P>The editorial, titled "The Political Winds of Changes in Taiwan,
"noted that the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , which won a landslide
victory in the elections, is headed by a chairman, Ma Ying-jeou, who
has had a tough attitude toward Japan on issues concerning historic
and territorial problems.</P>
      <P>The Japanese daily attributed the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's setback in the elections to a series of recent corruption
scandals involving high-ranking officials close to President Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The KMT's election victory has given a significant boost to KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's chances in the 2008 presidential election,
the editorial said. As Ma has been tough towards Tokyo on issues
concerning territorial disputes between the two countries, it is
necessary for the Japanese government to pay close attention to the
KMT's future moves.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMY SHOULD BE FOCUS FOLLOWING ELECTIONS: BUSINESS COMMUNITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should focus its efforts on
improving Taiwan's economy now that the emotionally charged
atmosphere of the elections has subsided, the business community
urged Monday. </P>
      <P>Now that Saturday's "three-in-one" local government elections
have ended smoothly, the government should immediately stop
campaigning and devote its energy to major economic issues, including
the much-expected easing in its China policy which is of vital
importance to Taiwan's economic development, business sources said.</P>
      <P>They also expressed the hope of seeing political reconciliation
at home, which they said is the key to fully reviving the economy.</P>
      <P>It is necessary for the government to re-assess its "pro-active
opening, effective management" policy regarding China-bound Taiwan
investment, and the government should swiftly respond to the call for
relaxed measures to further facilitate cross-Taiwan Strait trade and
economic exchanges and restore public confidence, they pointed out.</P>
      <P>A relaxation of a ban on relocation of certain categories of
manufacturing to China is the top issue of concern to the high-tech
sector, while traditional businesses are keenly hoping for the
opening of direct air and shipping links between Taiwan and China and
a full opening to Chinese tourists, they said.</P>
      <P>The value of the new Taiwan dollar against the Chinese yuan is
also another major issue to Taiwan's businesses, as the central
bank's monetary policy will also influence domestic companies'
competitiveness, they noted.</P>
      <P>The central bank has always placed more emphasis on
export-oriented businesses by keeping the local currency at a
relative low value, leading to greater outflows of local capital,
they pointed out.</P>
      <P>At a time when an expected further appreciation of the Chinese
yuan is just around the corner, the exchange rates among the New
Taiwan dollar, the Chinese currency and the U. S. dollar has become
a focal point for Taiwan enterprises, they said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said Monday he will
use an even-handed and rational manner to deal with the attacks on
him that were leveled during campaigning for his re-election.</P>
      <P>Hu said he does not intend to file a lawsuit against President
Chen Shui-bian for remarks he made alluding to the fact that Hu has
had a couple of what doctor's have said were mild strokes. Chen asked
Taichung residents to support Lin Chia-lung, the Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP) candidate for mayor, since Hu could "drop
dead at any time." Hu was re-elected Saturday.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lin Chin-hsin, a practicing physician, and 11
other doctors unveiled what they claimed was Hu's medical records at
a news conference during the last days of the campaigning in an
attempt to thwart Hu's re-election bid by saying that he might not be
healthy enough for the post. Hu said he would consult his lawyer over
this.</P>
      <P>"Since the election is over and I have won, some think that this
matter is over, " Hu said. "But I have to say that I am looking into
this not for myself, but to try to put a stop to this kind of
maliciousness.</P>
      <P>"I have the social responsibility to do so, and I cannot act like
a hypocrite," Hu added.</P>
      <P>The city's Department of Health said that initial investigations
showed that the alleged medical records may have been forged, and
that the 12 doctors might have violated their ethical vows by
infringing on the privacy of a patient.</P>
      <P>The department is scheduled to convene a disciplinary committee
meeting to handle the matter. Ironically, three of the 11 doctors
present at the news conference are also members of the committee;
therefore, they will not attend the meeting due an obvious conflict
of interest.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hu also said that his administrative team will
continue to work for the good of the city based on the principles of
"integrity, efficiency and making residents' lives as convenient as
possible."</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL BALANCE EXPECTED IN 2011: FINANCE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Under a Ministry of Finance plan, the
government's income and expenditures are expected to be balanced by
2011, Minister of Finance Lin Chuan said Monday.</P>
      <P>In a report to the Financial Committee of the Legislative Yuan,
Lin said his ministry is pushing forward with reforms in finance and
taxation, and is improving the management of the government's debts.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government will have a debt of NT$3.68 trillion
(US$109.87 billion) by the end of the 2005, the finance minister said
the government's annual outlay as a percentage of the gross domestic
product (GDP) has decreased from 17.3 percent in 2001 to 15.6 percent
in 2005, which represents an slowdown in the accumulation of
government debt.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the government's annual revenue as a percentage of the
GDP has decreased from 14.8 percent in 2001 to 12.4 percent in 2005.</P>
      <P>Also, the minister said, his ministry is pressing ahead with 60
programs aimed to better the country's finance in the short, middle
and long terms.</P>
      <P>Tax reforms include a controversial program to strip military
personnel and teachers of their tax-exempt privilege, which is still
mired in the Financial Committee of the legislature, and the launch
of a maximum tax system, which is pending final approval by the
legislature, Lin went on.</P>
      <P>He dismissed some lawmakers' concern that the plan to better the
government's finances could fizzle out if he is removed from his job
as the country's chief treasurer in a Cabinet reshuffle which seems
to be likely in the wake of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
losses in the Dec. 3 local elections, saying the plan to balance
finances will survive any personnel changes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DODGY ELECTED CANDIDATES COULD LOSE AFTER WINNING: JUSTICE OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will try to invalidate the
elections of successful candidates who have been charged or are under
investigation for involvement in vote-buying or other infractions, a
senior justice official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Deputy Justice Minister Wang Tien-sheng was commenting on the
elections of a number of candidates in the Dec. 3 "three-in-one"
elections who are under indictment or being investigated on suspicion
of violating the election law.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors are frustrated as their efforts to crack down on
election irregularities have failed to stop the suspects from getting
elected.</P>
      <P>Wang said his ministry has targeted 10 elected town heads and 20
city or county council members whose elections might be nullified
because of their suspected involvement in bribery or other
irregularities.</P>
      <P>In addition, he noted, prosecutors were continuing investigations
into scores of newly elected officials, some or all of whom may also
be indicted, he added.</P>
      <P>According to the law, the prosecution must indict elected
suspects within 15 days after the Central Election Commission
announces the official results on Dec. 9.</P>
      <P>Two examples are Chang Chi-hsun and Hsieh Wang-shan of Nantou
County. Both were elected while they were being detained on charges
of breaking the law -- Chang was charged with using violence and
Hsieh, vote-buying.</P>
      <P>The Nantou District Court's Prosecutor's Office said it will
formally indict these people and their elections will be null and
void.</P>
      <P>People First Party (PFP) Legislator Lin Teh-fu said the
prosecution seemed to have helped to promote those suspected
candidates with its investigations, increasing their chances of
getting elected.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor-General Wu Ying-chao said Taiwanese are rather
emotional when they cast their votes for detained or charged
candidates who appeal for their "sympathy."</P>
      <P>Another strange case in that of suspended KMT member running as
an independent Wu Chun-li, who was elected Taitung County magistrate
on Dec. 3-- when he was appealing the second trial ruling of
seven-and-a-half years in jail for forgery and embezzlement.</P>
      <P>In response to criticism as to why Wu was allowed to stand as a
candidate while he had already been sentenced, Justice Minister Shih
Mao-lin said he will talk with the Central Election Commission about
amending the relevant law.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Legislator Lee Ching-hua said that the government must
have been joking with Taitung residents by determining that Wu was
eligible to run in the elections but must be suspended from his job
after he is sworn in on Dec. 20.</P>
      <P>Wu said, according to local government law, a local government
leader must relinquish his job if he has been found guilty in the
first trial.</P>
      <P>However, whether or not to suspend Wu when he becomes magistrate
is up to the Ministry of the Interior, which governs the Central
Election Commission, Shih said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'I HAVE NO INTENTION OF SEEKING THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE DPP': CHANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chang
Chun-hsiung said Monday that he "is not planning and has no
intention" of serving as the chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks after reports tipped him as the most
likely person to take over the helm of the DPP after DPP Chairman Su
Tseng-chang resigned to take responsibility for the drubbing the
party took in Saturday's city and county chief elections. The DPP
managed to secure only six of 23 seats up for grabs, while the main
opposition Kuomintang took 14 seats, including the key Taipei County
magistrate position.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP charter, the party's central standing
committee will first nominate an acting chairman and then decide on a
date for members to elect a new chairman.</P>
      <P>Reports said that several other DPP heavyweights, including
Premier Frank Hsieh and Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu
Shyi-kun, had their reputations damaged by the party's lackluster
showing despite their strenuous stumping efforts, and that Chang,
with his credentials including serving multiple terms as a legislator
and premier, seems the most suitable person to take over the daunting
task.</P>
      <P>But in an interview with CNA Monday, Chang said, "I have no
intention to take over the chairmanship of the DPP at the present
time."</P>
      <P>Chang denied that he went to the Presidential Office to discuss
the possibility amid media reports that his limousine was spotted
entering the Presidential Office earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>He also praised Su's resignation as setting a good example for
politicians, although "he is not to be blamed for the loss."</P>
      <P>He attributed the DPP's losses to the party's betrayal of its
founding goals of integrity, reform and national identity, as well as
the effect of a corruption scandal involving a former top
Presidential Office aide.</P>
      <P>The DPP must respond to public expectations, face squarely the
results the poor showing in the elections, and engage in serious
soul- searching, Chang said, adding that this is the only possible
path for the DPP, and the only way to touch the hearts of the people.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead to cross-strait relations after the elections, he
said the government's stance is consistent, and will take into
consideration national security, national identity and current
cross-strait trade and social exchanges.</P>
      <P>He also said he hopes that a planned economic development
conference will forge a national consensus on cross-strait policy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACTIVISTS URGE CHEN TO WIPE OUT CORRUPTION TO RESTORE PUBLIC'S FAITH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of social activists urged President
Chen Shui-bian Monday to step up the campaign against official
corruption to regain the public's faith in government.</P>
      <P>The activists, led by Chien Hsi-chieh, convener of the Alliance
of Fairness and Justice, made the call after Chen's Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) suffered a drubbing in Saturday's local
government chief elections.</P>
      <P>Chien said the ruling party's poor showing in the "three-in-one"
elections could primarily be attributed to a recent string of
corruption scandals, including the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp.
scandal and the "vultures" insider-trading case.</P>
      <P>"President Chen should demonstrate his determination to stamp out
official corruption by pushing for a speedy and comprehensive inquiry
into all corruption charges now that the emotionally-charged
atmosphere has subsided with the conclusion of the elections, " Chien
said.</P>
      <P>He also urged President Chen to replace two top officials --
State Public Prosecutor-General Wu Ying-chao and Financial
Supervisory Commission Chairman Kong Jaw-sheng.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Wu was once involved in a Taiwan Pineapple Corp.
profiteering scandal, Chien said Wu is not suitable for the top
prosecutorial post.</P>
      <P>Even though Wu was not given any sentence in that case, Chien
claimed that the case has put Wu's integrity in question. "Moral
integrity is the fundamental qualification of law enforcement
officers," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Chien said he is hopeful that the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan can pass a draft package of revisions to the Court
Organic Law proposed by a local association of reform-minded
prosecutors as soon as possible to ensure prosecutorial neutrality
and independence.</P>
      <P>As to Kong, Chien claimed that Kong is versed in marketing and
public relations, not financial supervision.</P>
      <P>Given Kong's previous professional background as a partner of a
foreign financial group, Chien said he doubts that Kong has the guts
to stand up to big financial holding groups and strictly carry out
financial supervisory work, citing as proof the "vultures" stock
insider-trading scandal earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The DPP won just six of the 23 mayoral and magistrate posts up
for grabs in the Dec. 3 elections, while the main opposition
Kuomintang captured 14 seats, including the most populous Taipei
County and two constituencies that used to be the DPP's strongholds
-- Ilan County and Chiayi City.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEUTRAL MEDIA WOULD BOOST JUSTICE IN SOCIETY: CHEN CHU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Biased media seriously influences Taiwanese
politics and this should be rectified so that Taiwan becomes a just
society, Chen Chu, a former labor affairs chief said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the statement during a speech at Chang Jung Christian
University in the southern county of Tainan. She stepped down as the
head of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) after she was allegedly
involved in the Kaohisung mass rapid transit scandal when Thai
workers revolted against reported unreasonable management in August.</P>
      <P>"It is normal that media has a stance. I also support them to
keep on following government scandals. But media should remain
neutral. It should not excessively beautify or uglify anything. It's
not good for society if media is biased, influencing the country's
politics," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Mentioning the influence of media, she gave herself as an example
and said that some media outlets that have a particular stance
intentionally highlighted uncertain facts and make accusations using
falsehoods to please the audience.</P>
      <P>"The person accused will then have to spend even more effort in
clarifying his integrity. But this part is often ignored by the
public and the accused becomes the victim," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the recent elections, Chen said that as a member of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), she used to do all she
could to avert the combination of the three local-level elctions
because the more grass-roots elections there are, the more they reach
the basic-level voters, which favors the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>"Combined with elections for city mayors and county magistrates,
it can but be a burden to the DPP, " she said, but for the sake of
saving social costs, she still went along with the policy of the
Executive Yuan, the CLA's supervising authority.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANOTHER ACCIDENT HITS KAOHSIUNG RAPID TRANSIT RAILWAY PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung rapid transit railway
project was hit by another accident Sunday that could be described as
the "most serious" accident affecting public safety since
construction began in 2001, the chief executive officer of the
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) admitted Monday.</P>
      <P>KRTC President Fan Chen-po said no human error was involved in
the accident and that it will take about NT$500 million to resolve
the problem.</P>
      <P>According to Fan, construction workers digging a retention pond
33 meters underground in the O7 station on the project's Orange Line
apparently hit a high waterbed, causing water to spring up. A section
of the tunnel measuring about 100 meters was ruptured by the force of
the water.</P>
      <P>The water also caused a 30-meter-long section of pavement on
Kaohsiung's Chungcheng Road to cave in. As an emergency measure, KRTC
workers worked nonstop for more than 12 hours and poured some 8,000
cubic meters of gravel and soil into the hole. By noon Monday, the
water from the underground source had stopped.</P>
      <P>Fan said that Chungcheng Road will need to be cordoned off for
seven to 10 days for safety concerns because of the accident.</P>
      <P>The latest mishap is believed to be the eighth major accident of
the Kaohsiung rapid transit railway project that has affected public
safety. In 2004, the director of the Department of Rapid Transit
System under the Kaohsiung city government resigned to take
responsibility for a series of accidents.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>It is "unreasonable" to demand that
President Chen Shui-bian apologize for the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP) poor performance in Saturday's local
government elections, Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
claimed Monday.</P>
      <P>Rather, society should give the president kudos for his boldness
in reforming the election agenda by combining three elections in one
when he knew it would be to the disadvantage of his party, he said.</P>
      <P>He was responding to opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou's suggestion that it would help reconcile the nation's
ruling and opposition parties if the president could offer an
apology. Ma claimed that he made his suggestion for the sake of
improved communication between the DPP and the opposition.</P>
      <P>The DPP should do deep soul-searching after its ignominious
defeat at the hands of the KMT, he said. The DPP won only six against
the KMT's 14 of 23 city and county government seats.</P>
      <P>According to the foreign minister, a popularly elected president
"stands above party politics" and has no need to apologize for his
party's failure in elections.</P>
      <P>In Tainan City, Mayor Hsu Tien-tsai of the DPP said the party's
dismal performance shows that there are serious problems within the
party.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who succeeded in his re-election bid, said President Chen's
charisma has faded, but people should not blame him for his good
intentions to help boost the campaigns of DPP candidates.</P>
      <P>The effects of the president's stumping were "not so good as
imagined, " probably because there was a gap between what he said and
what the people wanted, said the mayor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGENTLY NEEDS TO FIND A NEW LEADER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The defeat of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) in the Dec. 3 elections has driven its
chairman Su Tseng-chang to resign and one of the party's most urgent
post-election tasks will be to find a new party chief at a time when
the party is seriously marred by a series of corruption scandals,
political watchers said Monday.</P>
      <P>Although the miserable election results have critically hurt the
DPP's power base, the party still needs to get back on its feet and
prepare itself for next year's Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral
elections, analysts said, pointing out that the party cannot turn
into a majority without a leader.</P>
      <P>The DPP took only six -- all in southern Taiwan -- of the 23 city
mayor and county magistrate seats in the local government elections,
the same result as its poor showing in the 1993 elections, when the
DPP was also at a low ebb.</P>
      <P>To date, no DPP stalwart has displayed an interest in taking over
the party's top post, although party insiders have that said there
should be no lack of hopefuls for the position. The analysts said
that this should provide a good platform from which the party can
undergo a power restructuring and forge strategies to face the coming
elections.</P>
      <P>Whoever takes the DPP chairmanship will have an impact on the
party's power center and its influence is expected to last through
the 2008 presidential election, which is set to be a duel between the
DPP and the main opposition Kuomintang, now led by the charismatic Ma
Ying-jeou, whose leadership was vital to the party's landslide
victory in the just-concluded local elections, analysts said.</P>

      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) candidates for next year's
elections for Taipei and Kaohsiung mayors will be decided by party
primaries, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Monday.</P>
      <P>Stressing that it is far too early to talk about the matter in
detail, Ma made it clear that the party's hopefuls for the mayoral
posts in the two special municipalities will be produced by party
primaries and that the selection process will have nothing to do with
his personal feelings.</P>
      <P>Ma claimed that he has not heard anything about People First
Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong's intention to run for Taipei mayor,
but he said that he will arrange a meeting with Soong as soon as
possible to clear up complex issues between the two leaders in the
opposition "pan-blue alliance."</P>
      <P>Ma also ruled out a reported plan to visit Washington, D.C. next
year, saying that he has not received any invitation from abroad.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman made the remarks after his party scored a
landslide victory in Saturday's local government elections by taking
14 of the 23 city mayor and county magistrate posts, well ahead of
the six -- all in southern Taiwan -- taken by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The KMT's win, the first in a nationwide election since Ma took
over the party's helm in August this year, heralds a comeback of the
party in future elections, watchers said, noting that Saturday's
election results are expected to influence the 2007 legislative
elections and the 2008 presidential election.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 13th Taiwan-Philippines ministerial
conference on economic cooperation kicked off Monday in Manila,
co-hosted by Taiwan Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh and
Philippines Secretary of Trade and Industry Peter B. Favila.</P>
      <P>The conference was transformed from a vice-ministerial economic
meeting between the two countries in 1992. Since then, it has been
held alternately in Taipei and Manila in an effort to promote trade
and economic relations between the two nations.</P>
      <P>Ho attended the two-day conference accompanied by Republic of
China Representative to the Philippines Wu Hsin-hsing, her deputy
Chen Ruey-lung, as well as officials from the Bureau of Foreign
Trade, the Export Zone Administration and ROC customs.</P>
      <P>Welcoming Ho and her group at the opening of the event, Favila
called Taiwan the Philippines' closest geographic neighbor and a
close trade partner, saying the close ties can be proved by the fact
that two-way trade registered an annual growth of 3 percent on
average in the past five years, that Taiwan is the fifth-largest
investor in the Philippines, and the signing of a memorandum on
agricultural cooperation ties.</P>
      <P>Ho said that Taiwan has invested around US$1.38 billion in the
Philippines, a far smaller figure than the US$10 billion it has
invested in Vietnam. In the future, efforts will be made to lobby
more Taiwanese high-tech companies to invest in the Philippines, she
said.</P>
      <P>Topics of the conference include an agreement on the avoidance of
double taxation, cooperation on personnel training and intellectual
property protection rights, as well as the formation of an "economic
corridor" between Taiwan and the Philippines that connects industrial
zones in Taiwan's southern port city of Kaohsiung with the
Philippines' Subic Bay and Clark industrial zones.</P>
      <P>Ho arrived in Manila Sunday at the head of a 70-member
delegation. She is scheduled to call on Philippines economic
officials as well as prominent members of the business community and
to inspect Subic Bay and Clark before returning to Taiwan Dec. 8.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will elect a new chairman in January at the earliest, party
sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP charter, if the incumbent president is a DPP
member, he should concurrently serve as party chairman, but President
Chen Shui-bian resigned from his post as party head in the wake of
the party's lackluster performance in the legislative elections of
late 2004.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang, who assumed the post in February
this year, stepped down after the party's crushing defeat in
Saturday's city and county elections. The DPP managed to take only
six seats out of 23 up for grabs, compared with 14 seats taken by the
main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>The DPP will select an acting chairman in Wednesday's meeting of
its Central Standing Committee. Possible acting chairman candidates
include Vice President Annette Lu, Presidential Office
Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun, Premier Frank Hsieh, acting Kaohsiung
Mayor Yeh Chu-lan and Legislator Trong Chai.</P>
      <P>The acting chairman will organize a bye-election for the party's
next chairman and the party members will vote for the new leader in
January at the earliest.</P>
      <P>No one has yet to come forward to express interest in taking the
helm of the party, although some DPP sources said Lu, Yu and former
DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung are all suitable candidates.</P>
      <P>Media reports said Monday that Straits Exchange Foundation
Chairman Chang Chun-hsiung is the most likely candidate, but Chang
dismissed the reports, saying that he "is neither planning nor
intending" to serve in that post.</P>

      <P>Since 1982, ORBIS, a DC-10 aircraft converted into a teaching

    <TEXT>New York Times: Sunni
Candidates in Iraq Find Enemies on All Sides

With just a little more than a week before
the vote on Dec. 15 for a full, four-year Iraqi 
government, the Bush administration sees Sunni
Arab participation as the most crucial aspect of
this final stage in the political process it
created after toppling Saddam Hussein. But
perhaps no one has more enemies than the Sunni
Arab politicians who have committed themselves
to taking part in the elections. Claiming to
speak for factions in the insurgency, they
campaign by denouncing the Shiite-led government
and American forces, yet are hounded by zealous
Sunni militants like Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who
reject any involvement in the political process
and brand the politicians as traitors.

Wall Street Journal: Health Crisis,
Chinese Doctors Tell Patients To Pay Upfront, or
No Treatment

The crisis in China's health-care system is 
already showing signs of holding the country 
back. Health-care costs are one of the main 
reasons Chinese save as much as 40 percent of
their incomes. Fewer than one-third of China's
1.3 billion people have health insurance. More
than half of all health spending is out of
pocket. Health care is an issue vexing the
world's most developed countries, including
the U.S., where people without insurance can
lose all their savings if they get sick. But in
worst-case scenarios, people who need urgent
care generally receive it. In the U.S., a poor
family would be eligible for Medicaid. Japan
and most European countries cover everyone
through universal health-insurance programs.
That's not the case in China, where patients are
routinely denied care if they cannot come up
with the money to pay for it in advance -- even
in emergencies.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>TEACHERS UNION SUGGESTS EVALUATION OF MOE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Teachers' Association (NTA)
suggested Monday that its members be given a chance to evaluate the
Ministry of Education (MOE) and its education policies.</P>
      <P>The NTA said teachers are responsible for just part of the
factors that decide a nation's quality of education, the other
factors being education policy, school organization, education
budget, size of the school and size of the class.</P>
      <P>Most of these key factors that make up the educational
environment are beyond the control of teachers, and therefore they
should not be held accountable for the poor environment that might
have been caused by poor policy, it said.</P>
      <P>The association made the proposal after the ministry launched a
program to evaluate teachers' professional performance, a program
that it fears will not achieve its purpose because it fails to set
clearly defined criteria for evaluating performance.</P>
      <P>The association is also worried that evaluators might not be
professional enough to assess teachers' performances and that
procedures have not been properly set up to implement the program.</P>
      <P>In fact, it said, a well-rounded "education evaluation system"
should include evaluations of the MOE and its policies, as well as
school administrations.</P>
      <P>As to the program for evaluating teachers' performance, which
requires those judged to be poor achievers to submit an "improvement
plan" within one month of receiving the judgment, NTA officials said
some of the problems leading to poor performance might not be caused
by the teachers themselves but by the teaching environment or outside
interference.</P>
      <P>If the problems have been caused by non-teacher factors such as
poor policy or inadequate administrative support, of which the
suspected teacher cannot request an improvement, then this means the
MOE is responsible for demanding performance from teachers without
ever having to be held responsible, NAT noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP WHIP PUSHING FOR PFP-KMT MERGER BEFORE LUNAR NEW YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A whip of the opposition People First
Party's (PFP) legislative caucus said Monday that he is seeking
support from PFP legislators to sponsor a proposal that the PFP and
its "pan-blue alliance" partner, the Kuomintang (KMT) , be merged
before the next Lunar New Year, which falls on Jan. 29.</P>
      <P>Sun Ta-chien, deputy convener of the PFP legislative caucus, told
reporters that the proposal will be presented to the PFP headquarters
to urge the party leadership to speed up the handling of the matter.</P>
      <P>He said he raised a similar proposal shortly after he was
re-elected legislator last year, but the party dismissed his proposal
because his view was at odds with the policy line at the time.</P>
      <P>Sun warned that the longer the merger is delayed, the more
difficult it will be for the issue to be resolved, because the rift
between the two parties will only become wider as a result of
election friction.</P>
      <P>He said that with the next mayoral elections for Taipei and
Kaohsiung only a year away, the PFP and the KMT must work out their
differences as soon as possible to allow enough time to prepare for
the elections.</P>
      <P>He also called on the KMT to demonstrate its sincerity for the
idea of a merger. He said both parties should not think only about
the benefits for themselves, or the issue will be trapped in a
vicious circle.</P>
      <P>The PFP was founded by James Soong in 2000 after he -- a member
of the KMT at the time -- ran as an independent in the presidential
election that year but failed. Like the KMT, the PFP is against
Taiwan independence and favors Taiwan's eventual reunification with
China.</P>
      <P>The party has maintained a close working relationship with the
KMT in the legislature, but the relationship is sometimes tense,
especially in election years, because they have to compete for
support from the same voters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RULING PARTY TO REFLECT UPON ITSELF FOR FRESH START</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major factions within the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Monday they will accept the electorate's
decision on the party with humility and engage in serious
"soul-searching" before making a fresh start.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks following the crushing defeat of the DPP in
Saturday's city and county chief elections during which the party
only managed to garner six seats out of 23 up for grabs, compared
with 14 seats taken by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Gao Jyh-peng, secretary-general of the Justice Alliance faction,
which is closely related to President Chen Shui-bian, said he
supports reforms and that everyone in the party should pool their
wisdom to try to bring the party out of the woods.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Cho-shui of the New Tide faction said that whether
the Cabinet is reshuffled or the premier changed, the party should
respect the power of the president, although he expressed the hope
that Chen will give the Cabinet a free hand to do what it sees fit so
that he will have time to think about long-term matters.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsu Kuo-yung of the Welfare State faction said a
Cabinet reshuffle should start after the Legislative Yuan completes
its review of the government budget, and that the scale of the
reshuffle should give the people a "fresh feeling" of the party.</P>
      <P>President Chen had yet to make public appearance since Saturday's
debacle. He canceled his scheduled itinerary Monday morning amid
reports that he was discussing the post-election situation with
high-ranking party and government officials.</P>
      <P>Responding to Legislator Lin Chung-mo's suggestion that
opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong serve as premier
after the elections, Gao said there is zero possibility of such an
outlandish proposal being made.</P>
      <P>Gao noted that KMT candidate Lu Kuo-hua trampled DPP candidate
Chen Ding-nan in the Ilan county magistrate election, breaking a DPP
stronghold of 24 years in the northeastern county.</P>
      <P>He said Chen Ding-nan garnered more votes than popular Ilan
County Magistrate Liu Shou-cheng when he sought another term four
years ago, but Chen still lost to Lu.</P>
      <P>He attributed Lu's performance to what he described as the "Ma
phenomenon, " referring to the new popular KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou,
whose presence created a frenzy whenever he stumped for KMT
candidates around the island.</P>
      <P>"The future rival of the DPP is Ma, and the party should consider
how to deal with this," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh offered to resign
immediately after the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
suffered a humiliating defeat in Saturday's local government
elections, but President Chen Shui-bian has rejected Hsieh's offer, a
government spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Pasuya Yao was responding
to a call from the DPP's "pan-green camp" ally -- the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) -- that Hsieh should step down to assume the
responsibility for the DPP administration's lackluster administrative
record, which the TSU said has been a critical factor in the
"pan-green camp's" drubbing in the elections.</P>
      <P>The DPP won just six of the 23 mayoral and magistrate posts up
for grabs, while the TSU came away empty-handed. DPP Chairman Su
Tseng-chang quit shortly after the electoral outcome became clear.</P>
      <P>"Hsieh informed Chen of his decision to resign no later than Su,
but the president rejected his offer. As keeping the administration
afloat and maintaining domestic political stability are as important
as taking the blame for the election defeat, Chen decided that the
premier needs to stay to round off the DPP's unaccomplished reform
initiatives," Yao said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh took a day off Monday to undergo a long-scheduled physical
checkup which gave him a clean bill of health, Yao said.</P>
      <P>The premier had a working dinner with his close aides, including
Cabinet Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai and Yao.</P>
      <P>According to Yao, Hsieh will return to work Tuesday. High on his

    <HEADLINE>PLAN TO BUILD FAST-ATTACK MISSILE BOATS MIGHT BE DELAYED: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A plan to build a fleet of 30 new fast
attack missile boats might be delayed due to complaint by a private
shipyard against the state-run China Ship Building Corporation
(CSBC), which was awarded the construction contract, the Ministry of
National Defense (MND) said Monday.</P>
      <P>To date, only one prototype boat has been built out of the
"Kuang-Hua Six" plan worth NT$13.2 billion (US$394 million) . The
CSBC, winner of the tender in which private shipbuilding companies
Jong Shyn and Ching Fu took part, was awarded a contract June 24 to
build the remaining platforms.</P>
      <P>However, Jong Shyn Shipbuilding contested the results of the
tender, claiming that the procurement committee favored the CSBC,
making the tender unfair. The plea was not accepted, so the company
further appealed to the Public Construction Commission under the
Executive Yuan, claiming that the decision attributing the contract
to the CSBC was defective.</P>
      <P>Navy Chief of Staff Vice Admiral Lee Hai-tung said the "Kuang-Hua
Six" plan might be delayed following the Jong Shyn Shipbuilding
company's contesting of the decision.</P>
      <P>Lee explained that the MND assigned the case to the Bureau of
Investigation under the Ministry of Justice (MJIB) in October, and
the MND asked the CSBC to suspend the contract in November.</P>
      <P>The MND's Procurement Center and Evaluation Committee evaluated
the CSBC as the best tender following discussions in mid-November,
Lee said.</P>
      <P>Under current regulations, Jong Shyn can still file complaints
with the procurement committee or the Public Construction Commission
or even file a law suit, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Lee said the plan may be delayed.</P>
      <P>The "Kuang-Hua Six" plan is to build 150-ton fast attack missile
that could be platforms for four Hsiungfung II surface-to-surface
missiles.</P>

preparation for joining the Kuomintang (KMT) following the KMT's
resounding success in Saturday's local government chiefs election.</P>
      <P>According to Ko, Soong stressed during their meeting that he is
not opposed to a merger between the PFP and the KMT. The two parties,
known locally the "pan-blue alliance, " jointly control the
Legislative Yuan and have boycotted the Democratic Progressive Party
administration's major policy initiatives at every turn.</P>
      <P>Soong also reaffirmed his commitment to a continued PFP-KMT

      <P>In his interview with Pio D'Emilia of Italian satellite TV RAI

would consider a removal of the arms embargo against China since
human rights conditions there have not made any improvements and even
deteriorated, citing as proof China's persecution against Falun Gong
followers.</P>
      <P>The European Union imposed the arms ban in 1989 over the
Tiananmen massacre in which Chinese troops brutally crushed a

      <P>Chen said the E.U.'s snub to Taiwan's popularly elected leader is
an insult not only to him but also to its 23 million people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PEOPLE WANT LEADERS TO PROMOTE CROSS-STRAIT PEACE: STATE DEP'T</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although it is too early to say what
impact the results of Taiwan's "three-in-one" elections will have on
cross-Taiwan relations, Taiwan voters will continue to request that
their elected leaders promote cross-strait peace and stability, a
U.S. State Department deputy spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>"As far as the elections go -- obviously, they're an internal
matter for Taiwan -- we certainly see in them a reflection of the
strength and vitality of democracy in Taiwan, " Adam Ereli also said
at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>In Saturday's local elections, the opposition Kuomintang won 14
of the 23 mayor and magistrate posts up for grabs, as well as a
majority of the seats in the council and township chief elections.</P>
      <P>In response to a question regarding what impact the election
results will have on cross-strait relations, Ereli said that it's a
little too early to tell.</P>
      <P>"But I would say that we certainly hope and are confident that
the people of Taiwan will continue to hold their elected leaders,
from whatever party, accountable for promoting peace and stability
across the strait in keeping with Taiwan's interests, " he added.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the United States is concerned about a possible
split within Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party in the wake
of the elections, Ereli declined to give any comment, saying only
that "the progress and process of internal Taiwanese politics is
something that we don't opine about, and it's a matter for the
Taiwanese people to decide."</P>

      <P>The United States affirms Taiwan's
"three-in-one" elections held Saturday as well as encourages both
sides of the Taiwan Strait to solve their problems through dialogue
and hopes the island will reinforce its determination to defend
itself, Taiwan's top envoy in Washington, D.C. said Monday.</P>
      <P>David Lee, the Republic of China's representative to the United
States, made the comments after exchanging views with relevant U.S.
State Department officials in the wake of the elections.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang claimed an overwhelming victory in the
islandwide local elections by winning 14 of the 23 mayor and
magistrate posts up for grabs as well as a majority of the seats in
the council and township chief elections.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that U.S. President George W. Bush had praised
Taiwan's freedom and democracy as a model which others, including
Beijing, could learn from in a speech he delivered during his visit
to Tokyo last month, Lee said that the U.S. officials think the
elections once again demonstrated the vitality of Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>The envoy, who will return to Taiwan soon to give a regular
report on his official work, also said that current U.S.-Taiwan
relations are relatively good and stable and that the channels of
communications between the two countries are also smooth and "quite
better than a year ago."</P>
      <P>Lee also said that there are three main issues that might affect
whether the relationship between Taiwan and the United States will
continue to be strengthened or not.</P>
      <P>The first is the arms procurement bill which has been stalled in
the Legislative Yuan for months. Washington has expressed concerns
about the bill's fate and hopes Taiwan will reinforce its
determination to defend itself, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>In addition, the U.S. side is also concerned about the
development of cross-strait relations and hopes Taipei and Beijing
can engage in a dialogue.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the United States hopes that Taiwan's Department of
Health experts can complete their examination work related to a
mad cow disease case in the U.S. and resume imports of American beef
as soon as possible. Taiwan suspended U.S. beef imports after a
second case of mad cow disease was confirmed in the U.S. in June of
this year.</P>

(By Jorge Liu and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ranking U.S. Trade Representative
Office (USTR) official said Tuesday it is not likely that the United
States and Taiwan will be able to reach a free trade agreement within
the next couple of years as talks on many bilateral trade issues have
yet to be completed.</P>
      <P>Matt Niemeyer, assistant U.S. trade representative, made the
remarks in response to a media question raised regarding the issue.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been working hard toward signing a free trade
agreement with the United States, and several U.S. congressmen have
requested recently that the Bush administration accelerate its steps
towards the establishment of a free trade accord with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For instance, Pete Sessions (R-Texas), a member of the U.S. House
of Representatives, urged in a letter sent to U.S. Trade
Representative Rob Portman last week that the administration should
establish a free trade relationship with Taiwan as soon as possible
as "the island is the United States' ninth largest trading partner
and a longstanding political ally whose democratic achievement is a
model for the international community."</P>
      <P>However, Portman said that Washington and Taipei are currently
holding talks on a series of issues related to intellectual property
rights and the opening of Taiwan's telecommunications and
pharmaceutical markets, stressing that the island must first resolve
these problems before it can be placed on the U.S. list for FTA
talks.</P>
      <P>The two countries resumed in November of last year their Trade
and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) talks, and they are set to
hold a similar meeting next month in Taipei to discuss issues
regarding further liberalization of the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>According to Portman, the TIFA talks are a prelude to the holding
of FTA negotiations between the two countries.</P>

its pursuit of high-quality urban planning and living space
development.</P>
      <P>CEPD Vice Chairman Chang Jing-sen said Taiwan hasn't adjusted its

land development plan. Over the past several years, Taiwan has
experienced rapid changes in many areas, including society, economy

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
threatened Tuesday to put to vote a bill regarding opening Sungshan
Airport in Taipei to flights to Macau and Hong Kong if all parties at
the legislature fail to come up with an agreement on the issue after
four months of negotiations.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Tina Pan Wei-kang, a whip of the
KMT legislative caucus, said that the KMT will seek to force the bill
through the Legislative Yuan with a vote if the various parties fall
short of an agreement on the issue in four months -- a grace period
requested by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its
ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , out of national security
concerns.</P>
      <P>Pan said that the KMT will do its best to negotiate with other
parties to have the bill clear the Legislative Yuan -- an issue
beneficial both to the people and the country, she claimed.</P>
      <P>It is a waste that the airport in Taipei has not been fully used,
as the airport only serves 285 flights per day compared to its full
daily capacity of 595 flights, KMT lawmaker John Chiang said.</P>
      <P>More than two million passengers from the greater Taipei area
would be able to use the domestic airport in Taipei to fly to China,
Hong Kong and Macau after it is opened to serve that end, Chiang
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers of the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP)
blocked the U.S. arms purchase and other major government bills at
the legislature's Procedures Committee Tuesday, triggering a ruling
party legislator's call on the opposition to show some modesty.</P>
      <P>Kuan Pi-ling of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which was
trounced in Saturday's local government elections, said the "pan-blue
alliance" won 660,000 more votes than in the previous election while
the "pan-green" camp of the DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
won 30,000 more.</P>
      <P>This means that KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou got a better score in
his "entrance exam" than President Chen Shui-bian in his "mid-term"
test, but the difference was just 630,000 votes, and the winner
should be a bit humbler, she said.</P>
      <P>Humility, apparently, was not in the opposition's vocabulary, as
"pan-blue" lawmakers continued to refuse President Chen's nominations
for the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" legislators also killed off a DPP
proposal to invite the president to make a national security report
to the legislature, knowing he would use the opportunity to lobby for
his government's military weapons procurement bill.</P>
      <P>Also blocked from being put on the legislative agenda were
20-some other DPP-proposed bills, including amendments to the
referendum law, a statute on political parties' "ill-gotten" assets,
and compensations for victims and bereaved families involved in the
Feb. 28, 1947 incident.</P>
      <P>Among the blocked bills was a TSU proposal that calls for the
legislature to set up a "files studying committee" to tackle party
assets that had been obtained through dubious means.</P>
      <P>What the DPP and KMT caucuses did agree to tackle at the Dec. 9
legislative meeting was amendments to the banking law concerning the
excessively high interest rates charged by banks on credit cards and
the issue of many young people overusing their credits, failing to
clear their debts and becoming so-called "slaves to credit cards."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The People First Party (PFP) will decide
before the end of the year whether to merge with the Kuomintang
(KMT) , or just keep cooperating with the party, PFP legislative
caucus whip Daniel Y. C. Huang said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, Huang said
that the issue has dragged on for a long time and that the Dec. 3
election results showed that the public wants the "pan blue alliance"
to keep the ruling party in check.</P>
      <P>"Now is the time to settle [the merger] issue," he added.</P>
      <P>Most PFP lawmakers are in favor of giving the party leadership 15
days to come up with concrete suggestions on the issue, and support
the idea of the party dealing with the matter through a democratic
process.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong will put himself above the fray to help
forge a consensus within the party, but the opinions of individual
lawmakers will be fully respected, Huang said, adding that if the PFP
opts for a merger, it may take from three to five months to
accomplish this through party-to-party negotiations.</P>
      <P>As to the question of when Soong plans to meet with KMT Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou, Huang said that Soong can meet Ma any time, any place.</P>
      <P>The "pan blue alliance" of the KMT, the PFP and the New Party won
16 out of the 23 city mayor and county magistrate posts up for grabs
in the weekend elections, while the ruling Democratic Progressive

defeat in Saturday's local elections in which the DPP managed only six
out of 23 seats up for grabs, while the main opposition Kuomintang
took 14 seats.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who assumed the premiership in February, said that a
Cabinet reshuffle is necessary in the wake of the major setback. "The
scale of the reshuffle will be decided by the president based on
considerations of the overall situation, " he added.</P>
      <P>If the president thinks that a major reshuffle is needed, and
even that the premier needs to be replaced, that "will be all right
with me," he said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh further said the DPP should seriously engage in
self-examination following its major setback in Saturday's elections.</P>
      <P>Noting that some people within the party have claimed that
combining the three sets of elections into one was one of the main
reasons for the DPP's poor showing Saturday, Hsieh said that he, as
premier, is willing to take responsibility as it was the Executive
Yuan which made the decision to combine the elections in order to
reduce costs.</P>
      <P>Combining the three local elections into a single day's vote is
generally considered to favor the KMT because of its traditional
grassroots support at the local level. Getting its supporters out on
the same day should have had a multiplier affect for the KMT
candidates' chances of winning.</P>
      <P>However, the president's major concern at the moment is
maintaining stability, and he will listen to views from all sides
before making any decisions, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>"We can't let defeat in the elections turn into defeat for Taiwan
or for Taiwan's economic fundamentals, " Hsieh stressed, adding that
"we still have to continue getting things done every day."</P>

    <HEADLINE>INCOME TAX LAW REVISED TO HIKE STANDARD DEDUCTION FOR MARRIED COUPLES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed an amendment to
the Income Tax Act Tuesday to increase the standard deduction for
married couples filing their income tax jointly from NT$60,000 to
NT$76,000.</P>
      <P>The hike is retroactive to Jan. 1, 2005. The actual deduction
will be NT$88,000 after it is adjusted in accordance with the rise in
consumer price index.</P>
      <P>The amendment was aimed at making the deduction for married
couples equal to double that of single taxpayers, which currently
stands at NT$38,000.</P>
      <P>According to opposition Kuomintang Legislator Fei Hung-tai, who
initiated the amendment, if the sum of the standard deduction for two
single persons is higher than that for a married couple, it will
penalize people who get married, which would not help the
government's goal of increasing the country's fertility rate.</P>
      <P>Last week, Premier Frank Hsieh also announced that the standard
deduction for married couples will be raised to NT$88,000, as part of
the government's measures to relieve the tax burden on taxpayers to

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN URGED TO JOINTLY INVEST IN INDIA OR SOUTHEAST ASIA WITH TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu
Shyi-kun on Tuesday urged Japan to jointly invest in India or
Southeast Asian countries with Taiwan to reduce the two countries's
dependence on the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Yu made the appeal while receiving on behalf of President Chen
Shui-bian a Japanese delegation, headed by Akio Kousai, which was
here to attend the 33rd East Asian Economic Conference to be held in
Taipei Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yu noted that although Taiwan and Japan have not maintained
diplomatic ties for years, both countries are each other's important
partner in economic, cultural, scientific, political and security
aspects.</P>
      <P>Noting that trade between Taiwan and Japan reached US$56.8
billion last year, accounting for 15 percent of Taiwan's total
foreign trade, Yu said Japan is now the third-largest trade partner
for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, Yu added, the Japanese government offered Taiwanese
tourists permanent visa-free treatment starting from this September.
So far this year, the number of Japanese tourists traveling to Taiwan
has topped one million in November, while the number of Taiwanese
travelers visiting Japan is expected to reach 1.4 million soon.</P>
      <P>In February, the United States and Japan decided to make Taiwan a
security concern for both countries, Yu said, stressing that these
things taken together are evidence that there exists a solid
partnership between the two countries.</P>
      <P>However, at a time of China's rapid economic rise, Taiwan and
Japan are facing severe challenges, Yu noted, and suggested that both
countries strengthen cooperative ties in diverse aspects.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, he suggested to the then-Japanese minister of
Economy, Trade and Industry Shoichi Nakagawa during his April visit
to Japan that both countries cooperate under the framework of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the World Trade
Organization by jointly investing in India or Southeast Asian
countries, such as the establishment of industrial zones, as part of
their global investment deployment, because this can also help them
reduce investment risks and over-dependence on the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Yu also urged both countries to resolve their own problems so
that they can sign a free trade agreement (FTA) as soon as possible,
which will greatly help strengthen bilateral economic and trade
exchanges in the future.</P>
      <P>For his part, Kousai said that the East Asian Economic Conference
has been held annually since 1973, with the meeting being organized
alternately in Taipei and Tokyo.</P>
      <P>At Wednesday's conference, the delegates of both countries are
expected to exchange views on general economic development in East
Asia, in addition to the economic and trade problems between Taiwan
and Japan, Kousai said, expressing hope that the conference will
result in more bilateral cooperation projects between Taiwan and
Japan.</P>
      <P>Concerning Japan's economy, Kousai said that Japan has seen
growth in domestic investment, housing construction and private
consumption recently and is expected to see booming exports in the
future, despite some unstable factors outside the country, including
high oil prices on the international market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MA SAYS HE HAS NO INTENTION TO BE DPP GOVERNMENT'S NEXT PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , said Tuesday that he will not consider serving as
the next premier in the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
government.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks to news media after a Taipei City Council
meeting when asked about suggestions that he may be the ideal person
to be the next premier, now that the DPP government may have to
reshuffle its Cabinet because of its humiliating defeat in the
"three-in-one" local government elections last weekend.</P>
      <P>KMT candidates and their "pan-blue alliance" allies have been
elected mayors and magistrates in 17 cities and counties against six
for DPP candidates.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is also mayor of Taipei, explained that he has promised
to his constituents in Taipei that he will finish his two terms
totaling eight years as Taipei mayor until the end of next year.</P>
      <P>"I don't like to leave things I have committed to half-done, " he
said.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman pointed out that the KMT does not by itself
enjoy a majority in the legislature and must rely on the cooperation
from the People First Party (PFP) caucus and independent legislators
to form a coalition to ensure a majority.</P>
      <P>However, he said, it would be meaningless to discuss the idea of
the DPP government appointing a premier from the "pan-blue alliance,"
because the DPP ruled out this possibility long ago.</P>
      <P>Ma said it was deplorable that the DPP has ignored the
constitutional spirit of the nation's "double government chief"
system, which means that when the ruling party does not have a
majority in the legislature, it should adopt a Cabinet system by
allowing the largest opposition party or the coalition with the
majority of seats to form the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Only when the ruling party enjoys a majority in the legislature,
can it practice the presidential system, allowing the president to
appoint the premier, who will form his Cabinet, he added.</P>
      <P>Ma explained that when switching to the Cabinet system, the
president should let the majority party in the legislature select the
premier and form the Cabinet, while the president himself only plays
the role of announcing the appointment.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the opposition Kuomintang
urged the government to take over the Kaohsiung rapid transit railway
construction project after a major accident triggered concerns over
public safety.</P>
      <P>On Monday, a massive earth collapse resulting from water seepage
occurred at a Kaohsiung MRT line construction site. It took Kaohsiung
Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) workers over 10 hours to fill a crater
measuring around 50 meters by 30 meters with several thousand cubic
meters of concrete and soil. It was estimated that some NT$500
million (US$14.94 million) are needed in the efforts to repair the
damage.</P>
      <P>The accident was the eighth major construction mishap of the MRT
project, and most of the accidents involving public safety have
occurred on the project's Orange Line that cuts through a sandstone
layer of earth.</P>
      <P>Legislator Pan Wei-kang said the Kaohsiung rapid transit railway
project needs to be entirely reviewed and examined, suggesting that
the Democratic Progressive Party government take over the project out
of public safety concerns.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, several lawmakers of opposition parties urged Premier
Frank Hsieh, who farmed out the construction of the Kaohsiung MRT
lines during his tenure as mayor of the southern city, to make a
public explanation of the latest accident, with some demanding for
the premier's resignation to shoulder responsibility.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he has instructed the Ministry of Economic Affairs to
address the problem.</P>
      <P>Asked if he will visit the scene of the collapse, Hsieh said: "If
it's necessary." He said he hasn't yet decided whether to go and that
he believes for the time being it's better for the authorities in
charge of the project to take care of the aftermath.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S CROSS-STRAIT POLICY NOT TO CHANGE AFTER ELECTIONS: MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  5  (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Mainland Affairs Council
Chairman Joseph Wu said Monday that Taiwan's cross-strait policy will
not be swayed by the outcome of the just-concluded local elections
which saw the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) suffer a
crushing defeat.</P>
      <P>On President Chen Shui-bian's remarks prior to Saturday's
elections that if the "pan-blue alliance" of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) won by a landslide,
cross-strait policy might be tightened, Wu said that one should know
the background of Chen's remarks.</P>
      <P>Wu said that a lot of people had expected cross-strait policy to
be relaxed and bilateral relations improve after the "pan-blue
alliance" won the legislative elections in late 2004. But in fact,
China passed an Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan in March. China
also feted Lien Chan, then KMT chairman, and James Soong, PFP
chairman, in the following two months and continued to ignore the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Wu said, resulting in the
retrogression of cross-strait relations. Chen's remarks should be
read in this context, he said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether cross-strait policy will change in the wake of the
DPP's drubbing in the elections, Wu said that "from the angle of the
government, it will not change, " adding that these are local
elections and not a referendum on cross-strait policy.</P>
      <P>The government is promoting and will continue to promote its
cross-strait policies, Wu said.</P>
      <P>He said that a planned national economic planning development
conference will probably review some cross-strait trade policies, and
if some consensus is forged, the government will surely follow
through.</P>
      <P>He noted that the government is currently promoting consultations
with Beijing on fully opening the nation to Chinese tourists, and
cross-strait charter flights. Future consultations could cover both
sides joining hands to crack down on crime, financial supervision,
and protecting Taiwan businessmen's investments, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Some Americans asked him while he was in the States whether the
government will continue to promote a full opening to Chinese
tourists to Taiwan. Wu told them that Taiwan has continued to promote
the policy since its partial opening to Chinese tourists in Jan.
2002.</P>
      <P>Wu said that Chinese National Tourism Administration Director
Shao Qiwei's visit to Taiwan in late October was a "positive
development in this respect."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 6 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) will expand the targets of its water inspections to include
housing communities with more than 100 households and food courts at
department stores starting next year, officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Of the reservoirs and water storage tanks at 11,094 nurseries,
schools, hospitals and government agencies sampled by the EPA this
year, 2 percent contained amounts of chlorine residues, E. coli and
coliform bacteria that are higher than the acceptable levels. It was
lower than the 5 percent of last year.</P>
      <P>According to Yuan Shao-ying, deputy director of the EPA's
Department of Environmental Sanitation and Toxic Substance
Management, most of the contaminated reservoirs and water storage
tanks are located underground, which makes it very easy for rain
water, sewage and oil to flow in or infiltrate from cracked reservoir
walls.</P>
      <P>In addition, mixing tap water with underground water and allowing
water reserves to last longer than two days will also make the
chlorine residues fade away and cause the multiplication of bacteria,
Yuan said.</P>
      <P>To better protect the quality of drinking water, the EPA will
funnel an extra NT$10.5 million to expand the inspections to food
courts at railway stations, airports, MRT stations, hotels,
department stores and shopping malls as well as housing communities
with more than 100 households next year, Yuan said.</P>
      <P>The EPA is expected to sample 12,000 establishments from this
category, he said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that people clean or maintain the reservoirs or
water storage tanks at their homes every six months to ensure the
safety of drinking water.</P>
      <P>As chlorine residues will be eliminated after water is treated,
water should be covered and stored in tightly sealed containers, he
said, adding that drinking water should be finished in a couple of
days to maintain its freshness.</P>

      <P>Detectives from the Criminal Investigation
Bureau (CIB), working with public prosecutors, conducted simultaneous
raids in Taipei, Taoyuan, Miaoli and Taichung Tuesday, arresting 13
fraud suspects on charges of cheating a number of banks in Southeast
Asia out of more than NT$10 million.</P>
      <P>A CIB spokesman said the operation was launched after a task
force spent four months tracing the suspects, including Wang
Fang-chu, who was in charge of loan affairs at the Taipei branch of
the Bank of East Asia of Hong Kong, and two of his accomplices.</P>
      <P>The police found that from July last year, the fraud ring began
to collect the information of dozens of customers from the National
Credit Card Center in Taipei, change the addresses of their accounts,
apply for new credit cards and debit cards, and then give them to
other members in the ring to withdraw cash from banks in various
Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>The suspects also managed to go through complicated application
processes and get loans on credit from banks, using the identities of
their victims.</P>
      <P>During Tuesday's operation, police took away large amounts of
transaction documents as evidence.</P>
      <P>The suspects will be referred to the Public Prosecutor's Office

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Japanese mass-circulation newspapers --
Asahi Shimbun and Mainichi Shimbun -- published editorials Tuesday
featuring concerns over Taiwan's political changes in the wake of its
just-concluded local elections.</P>
      <P>Results of the Dec. 3 "three-in-one" elections, which led to a
shift in the country's political landscape, could have a significant
impact on the region and on cross-Taiwan Strait relations, the
newspapers said.</P>
      <P>The Asahi said the elections were regarded as a precursor for the
2008 presidential election. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) suffered a setback by grabbing only six out of the 23 city and
county government seats while the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) took
14.</P>
      <P>The Asahi editorial stated that the DPP's defeat was mostly
attributed to a series of corruption scandals involving high-ranking
officials close to President Chen Shui-bian, Chen's poor performance
in dealing with economic and home affairs, and voters' discontent
with Chen's China policy.</P>
      <P>It said most Taiwan voters hope that the current cross-strait
state will be maintained and that Taiwan and China will cooperate
with each other in economic development.</P>
      <P>The Mainichi Shimbun said it expects China to boost its efforts
to unify with Taiwan now that the KMT has won the local elections.</P>
      <P>China's future moves are expected to have a big impact on
Taiwan's politics, the daily said.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, another influential Japanese newspaper, the Nihon
Keizai Shimbun, suggested in an editorial that the Japanese
government pay close attention to the KMT's future moves, since the
party's election victory has given a lift to its leader Ma
Ying-jeou's chances in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>It is also significant that Ma has been tough toward Tokyo on
issues concerning territorial disputes between the two countries, the
newspaper said.</P>

issue with the KMT, to be led by pro-merger lawmakers including
caucus whip Daniel Y.C. Huang, Lin Yu-fang and Sun Ta-chien, Hsieh
said, adding that the two parties should open talks on concrete
issues such as personnel placement and legal affairs.</P>
      <P>The PFP spokesman called on the KMT to quickly come up with
feasible measures to help with the merger, and he asked the KMT to
swiftly arrange a meeting between Soong and KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
to allow them to exchange opinions and ideas on the issue and on
continued bipartisan cooperation at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Calls have been mounting for the two parties to merge in the wake
of the Dec. 3 local elections. While the KMT overwhelmed the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , the PFP's poor showing reflects
the fact that it has come to the point of becoming a marginal party
on Taiwan's political map.</P>
      <P>The PFP splintered from the KMT in 2000 following the
presidential election of that year, but the two parties and the New
Party jointly formed the pro-unification "pan blue alliance" against
the pro-independence "pan green camp" of the DPP and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union prior to the 2004 presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, CHINA SEEM ON PATH OF INTERIM AGREEMENT: U.S. ACADEMIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Olive Lin and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China seem to be treading on
a path of a so-called "interim agreement" on improved bilateral ties,
a China expert claimed Monday.</P>
      <P>Giving a keynote speech on cross-Taiwan Strait relations at the
Elliott School of International Affairs at the George Washington
University, Dean Harry Harding said Taiwan and China seem to have
moved toward a path of an "interim agreement, " as both sides have
taken certain measures or been forced to do so to improve two-way
ties.</P>
      <P>In view of the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) big win in Taiwan's
Dec. 3 local government elections, Beijing will not make trouble
across the strait but instead will be willing to wait patiently until
2008, when the KMT is expected to win back power in next presidential
election, he speculated.</P>
      <P>After more than one year of confrontation since March 2004, when
President Chen Shui-bian decided to hold a controversial public
referendum along with the presidential poll and repeatedly called
Taiwan an independent sovereignty, Taiwan-China ties have stabilized
as both sides have sought not to step over the line drawn by the
other side and with the U.S. ready to step in in the event of a
potential conflict, according to Harding.</P>
      <P>Internal and external exchanges have made cross-strait relations
more amenable, he added.</P>
      <P>Beijing offered a series of overtures to Taiwan after the KMT and
People First Party chairmen visited China in spring this year, while
Taiwan also moved toward further opening up to China on the tourism,
academic, cultural and trade fronts.</P>
      <P>According to Harding, various Chinese officials visiting
Washington, D.C. last week told him that Beijing will put aside the
unification issue while focusing on containing Taiwan independence at
present. To some extent, Beijing is willing to hold talks with Chen's
administration, he claimed.</P>
      <P>The "interim agreement" to which he referred would be an accord
signed by Taiwan and China under which Taiwan would not declare
formal independence in exchange for a guarantee of no military attack
by China during the next 30-50 years.</P>
      <P>The interim agreement proposal was initiated by Kenneth
Lieberthal, a scholar at the University of Michigan, to help Taiwan
and China prevent a war.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT-CPC ECONOMIC FORUM IN TAIPEI STILL ON SCHEDULE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Kuomintang official said
Tuesday that the KMT's decision to hold an economic and trade forum
with the Communist Party of China in Taipei remained unchanged
despite reports that the venue may be shifted to Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, deputy executive director of the KMT's Policy
Committee, made the remarks following reports that a visit to Hong
Kong planned for Wednesday by Lien Chan, the KMT's honorary chairman,
is aimed at discussing with Chinese officials whether the venue for
the forum can be shifted to Hong Kong after the Taiwan government
rejected last month an application by Chen Yunlin, director of
China's Taiwan Affairs Office, to come to Taiwan in December for the
forum.</P>
      <P>The forum would be the first of its kind between the KMT and the
Communist Party of China (CPC) in more than 50 years after the CPC
defeated the KMT in a civil war in China that caused the KMT to flee
to Taiwan in 1949.</P>
      <P>The reports said Lien will meet Chen and Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region Chief Executive Donald Tseng in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Chang reaffirmed that the KMT still maintains its decision to
hold the forum in Taipei and expressed the hope that the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will realize the new mainstream
public opinion and political environment after its dismal performance
in the Dec. 3 local government elections, and will adopt a more
popular economic and trade policy toward China.</P>
      <P>Chang also urged the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) , which is
responsible for Taiwan's China policy, to reconsider its rejection of
Chen's application and those of other Chinese officials invited by
the KMT to come to Taiwan for the forum, claiming that by doing so it
would help stabilize cross-Taiwan Strait ties.</P>

A Texas judge dismissed one charge against Representative Tom
Delay on Monday but let stand two more serious charges, complicating
DeLay's hopes of regaining his post as House majority leader when
Congress resumes in January. The judge, Pat Priest of San Antonio,
handed DeLay and two co-defendants a partial victory in dismissing
charges of conspiracy to violate the election code, but left standing
charges of money laundering and conspiracy to launder money against
all three. The decision moves DeLay and his co-defendants, the
Republican fund-raisers John D. Colyandro and James W. Ellis, a big
step closer to facing trial - perhaps as soon as January - on felony
charges that carry long prison terms and fines.

      <P>Taiwan families hiring local caregivers to
look after sick or elderly family members will be paid a subsidy of
NT$5,000 to NT$10,000 per month for up to a year, according to a
draft plan unveiled Tuesday by the Council of Labor Affairs.</P>
      <P>While the subsidy for families requiring caregiving services
eight hours per day will be NT$5,000 per month, that for people
requiring caregiving services for 12 hours per day will be NT$10,000
per month, according to the plan.</P>
      <P>Employers will only be eligible for the subsidy if they hire
licensed caregivers recommended by local governments and if the
caregivers work for at least eight hours a day, 22 days a month, with
the term of employment lasting at least one month.</P>
      <P>However, the employers will not be subsidized if they hire their
spouses or relatives for the job.</P>
      <P>The policy is aimed at encouraging the hiring of local
caregivers, who are more expensive than foreign caregivers.</P>
      <P>From Jan. 1, Taiwan families that intend to hire foreign
caregivers to take care of sick or elderly family members will have
to first pass an assessment by medical institutions proving that
their wards require 24-hour care.</P>
      <P>Local social service authorities will then help these families
look for local workers who are willing to accept the jobs. A family
will only be permitted to hire a foreign worker if no local worker
can be found to fill the position.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WELCOMES TALKS WITH CHINA ON DIRECT AIR TRANSPORT LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking Taiwan official said
Monday that the opening of direct air transport links across the
Taiwan Strait is government policy and that Taiwan welcomes talks
without preconditions with China in this regard.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu made the
remarks during a meeting with Taiwanese reporters.</P>
      <P>Wu claimed it is wrong to think that his council has been
impeding the implementation of direct transport links across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet evaluation report unveiled Aug. 15, 2003 clearly
explained the government's positive stance regarding the opening of
direct transport links between the two sides of Taiwan Strait, he
said.</P>
      <P>To reach the goal, the government has been promoting cross-strait
charter flights for passengers during the Lunar New Year holiday as a
prelude to the full opening of regular direct transport links,
according to Wu.</P>
      <P>However, China has no intention of negotiating with Taiwan's
Democratic Progressive Party administration in this regard, so that
only charter flights between the two sides can be discussed, Wu
noted.</P>
      <P>Wu went on that the opening of cross-strait passenger charter
flights for the 2005 Lunar New Year has seen efforts from the
government to secure the flights, and negotiations for similar
charter flight services for the 2006 holiday have also been
completed.</P>
      <P>Both sides of the Taiwan Strait have been negotiating alternative
measures, such as talks on cross-strait cargo and passenger charter
flights, before the full opening of the direct transport links, Wu
said, expressing hope that the talks will soon bear fruit.</P>
      <P>"If China is willing to negotiate with us on the issue of direct

it," Wu added.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Yin-jeou would like to meet with People First Party (PFP) Chairman
James Soong before Dec. 14 to discuss a merger of the two parties and
hopefully combine them before the end of the year, KMT spokeswoman
Cheng Li-wen said Monday.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the KMT has long been looking forward to such a
merger, which was one of the goals laid down by the party's Central
Standing Committee last year.</P>
      <P>The unification of the two parties is not only the wish of the
two parties' authorities but also the sincere expectation of their
supporters and the KMT will do its best to make it happen, the
spokeswoman went on.</P>
      <P>Noting that the PFP suggested earlier the day a meeting between
Ma and Soong for this purpose, Cheng said Ma hopes the meeting will
take place before Dec. 14 in light of the fact that Soong is set to
make an overseas trip after Dec. 14.</P>
      <P>In a move matching the PFP's formation of a panel in charge of
talks with the KMT in this regard, Cheng said Ma has asked KMT Vice
Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung to lead a task force to deal with the PFP
panel. Also, Cheng said, the KMT will line up a meeting between the
PFP panel and Ma as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In order to unify the two parties, Cheng said, the KMT will treat
the PFP with the highest regard and hopefully the merger can be
completed before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The PFP, set up in 2000, is a splinter of the KMT, with its
founder James Soong a former KMT secretary-general and its members
former KMT members.</P>
      <P>However the PFP's strength declined after the 2004 presidential
elections in which Soong teamed up with then-KMT Chairman Lien Chan
only to be defeated by President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The party is now facing the risk of being sidelined after the
Dec. 3 local elections in which it won only one magistrate seat -- in
Kinmen -- out of 23 openings up for grabs, and that only thanks to
the courtesy of the KMT, which refrained from naming its own
candidate in that county.</P>
      <P>Many PFP lawmakers have called for a merger with the KMT, which
won 14 seats in the Dec. 3 race and is on the way for a showdown with
the DPP in the 2008 presidential race.</P>

Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung to lead a task force to deal with the PFP
panel. Also, Cheng said, the KMT will line up a meeting between the
PFP panel and Ma as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In order to unify the two parties, Cheng said, the KMT will treat
the PFP with the highest regard and hopefully the merger can be
completed before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The PFP, set up in 2000, is a splinter of the KMT, with its
founder James Soong a former KMT secretary-general and its members
former KMT members.</P>
      <P>However the PFP's strength declined after the 2004 presidential
elections in which Soong teamed up with then-KMT Chairman Lien Chan
only to be defeated by President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The party is now facing the risk of being sidelined after the
Dec. 3 local elections in which it won only one magistrate seat -- in
Kinmen -- out of 23 openings up for grabs, and that only thanks to
the courtesy of the KMT, which refrained from naming its own
candidate in that county.</P>
      <P>Many PFP lawmakers have called for a merger with the KMT, which
won 14 seats in the Dec. 3 race and is on the way for a showdown with
the DPP in the 2008 presidential race.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH TO HOLD MEETING TO DISCUSS U.S. REQUEST TO LIFT BEEF IMPORTS BAN</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will convene
a meeting later this month to discuss a request by Washington for
Taiwan to lift its ban on U.S. beef imports, a DOH official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Lu-hung, director general of the DOH's Bureau of Food
Safety, said that the United States has submitted a report confirming
the safety of its beef via the American Institute in Taiwan, the de
facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties
between the two countries, and expressing the hope that Taiwan will
re-open to U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>Chen said the experts taking part in the meeting will assess the
risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, 
cases in the United States as well as the safety of U.S. beef before
deciding whether to lift the ban.</P>
      <P>The participants of the meeting will review the report by the
AIT as well as domestic studies and express their own views, Chen
said.
If the experts are satisfied that U.S. beef is indeed safe, then
Taiwan will re-open to imports, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first banned imports of U.S. beef, live cattle and all
related products in December 2003 after the discovery in Washington
State of a single BSE case, the first U.S. case of mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>Taiwan purchased US$325 million-worth of U.S. beef and beef
products in 2003 and was the sixth-largest importer of U.S. beef
before imposing the ban. Taiwan lifted the ban on U.S. boneless beef
from animals under 30 months of age on April 16.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan reimposed the ban on June 25, one day after a
second BSE case in the United States was confirmed by a British
laboratory.</P>

The Lianhe Zaobao: Kelantan state's government may change after
BN won by-election.

The Barisan Nasional (BN) has wrestled this state constituency
from Islamic party of Malaysia (PAS) by a narrow margin of 129 votes,
and the victory signals a significant shift in the political
landscape of Kelantan.

That's meaning the Kelantan state's government may change any
time after PAS governed Kelantan 15 years.

BN candidate Hanafi Mamat was declared the winner at 9.22pm
yesterday securing 7,419 votes against Pas candidate Hanifa Ahmad's
7,290. Independent candidate Datuk Ibrahim Ali, the third contestant,
garnered a mere 414 votes.

The result has placed the PAS-led Kelantan Government in a very
delicate situation as its representation in the 45-seat State
Legislative Assembly has been reduced further and it is now hanging
on by a mere seat. The equation now is BN 22 and PAS 23.

BN wins but Hanafi's majority less than 2%; recount today from

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN CALLS FOR PARTY-TO-PARTY TALKS ON FORMING NEW CABINET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou called for President Chen Shui-bian Wednesday to consult
with the KMT before asking a KMT heavyweight to form a new Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Ma made the call following the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP's) defeat in last weekend's local elections.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he has no idea whether President Chen will ask
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin -pyng, a KMT heavyweight, to form a
new Cabinet as the media has speculated, but he added that if that is
the case, the matter should be discussed between the DPP and the KMT
in line with the constitutional spirit of the "double government
chief" system.</P>
      <P>According to the "double government chief" system, if the ruling
party does not have a majority in the Legislative Yuan, it should
allow the majority party or coalition in the legislature to form the
Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The media reported Wednesday that after three days of "soul
searching, " Chen may ask Wang to form a new Cabinet. A Cabinet
reshuffle is more than likely following the DPP's defeat in
Saturday's "three-in-one" elections in which the KMT and its
"pan-blue alliance" allies won 17 of the 23 city and magistrate posts
up for grabs and a majority of the council township chief elections.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that five and a half years ago, President Chen's
approval ratings rose to a record high after he appointed Tang Fei --
a KMT stalwart -- to the post of premier.</P>
      <P>However, Tang ended up serving only five months before being
sacked by Chen, Ma noted, attributing Tang's record-short stint to
the absence of party-to-party consultations prior to Tang's
appointment.</P>
      <P>Ma said that in order to prevent Wang from becoming another Tang,
the president should arrange for party-to-party talks for the
possible appointment of a "pan-blue alliance" politician to form the
next Cabinet in line with the spirit of the Constitution.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has saved NT$280 million in
election expenses by holding the elections for county and city
chiefs, county and city councilors, as well as township and village
heads simultaneously Dec. 3, Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the "three-in-one" elections also helped enhance voter
turnout.</P>
      <P>Hsieh pointed out that the turnout rate for the county and city
chief elections registered 66.22 percent this year, which was similar
to the 66.45 percent four years ago. However, the turnout rates for
the county and city councilor elections and township and village head
elections registered 66.25 percent and 67.04 percent this year, which
were much higher than the 55.59 percent and 57.07 percent in the
previous elections, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks in a weekly Cabinet meeting, during which
Central Election Commission and Ministry of Justice officials
delivered reports on the elections and on the government's
achievements in cracking down on vote-buying.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that when investigating alleged vote-buying cases,
prosecutors should maintain "a sense of proportion" so as not to
affect the outcome of the elections.</P>
      <P>Hsieh called the mud-slinging tactics adopted by many candidates
during the run-up to the elections practices that corrupted social
morality and decayed the foundation of democracy. He ordered the
Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Justice to study the
feasibility of amending election laws to raise the penalties for such
practices.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he asked the Ministry of Justice to review if it is
reasonable to define offering a gift worth more than NT$30 to voters

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER TO INVITE TEAM TO VINDICATE HIM IN MRT CORRUPTION SCANDAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday that he
will invite a five-man investigation team to vindicate his alleged
part in the mass rapid transit construction scandal in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The team, to be formed next week, will include private
individuals such as academic Chai Sunglin and lawyers C.V. Chen and
Wang Ching-feng who according to Hsieh have an image of integrity.</P>
      <P>The team will not include members of the "pan-green camp" of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, but might have members affiliated with the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First
Party, he added.
</P>
      <P>The team can conduct a no-holds-barred investigation on all
questions concerning him, including whether he has profited from the
MRT construction project, whether he violated the law while serving
as Kaohsiung mayor, and whether he condoned any unlawful practices
during his mayorship, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he will unveil his personal assets currently in
trust, as well as their changes over time, and he expressed the hope
that society will give him some time to help the MRT construction
system to be launched smoothly.</P>
      <P>"If the MRT project continues to be embroiled in controversy, it
will have an adverse effect on the construction work and the morale
of the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp., which is in charge of its
construction," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks during the first Executive Yuan
meeting following the crushing defeat of the DPP in Saturday's
elections. The MRT scandal involving a former top Presidential Office
aide was generally considered a major factor behind the major
setback.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who was Kaohsiung mayor before he assumed the premiership
in February, said that the elections are live-or-die games, but
people must work together for a better future after elections or
passions incited during the election campaigns will be a negative
force in society.</P>
      <P>"The ruling and opposition parties, as well as society, must cool
down and focus on economic development and public policies," he said.</P>
      <P>On controversy surrounding the MRT and himself during the
election campaigning, Hsieh claimed that during his 25 years in
politics, "integrity" has always been his bottom line and an
essential requirement.</P>
      <P>"I have maintained a strict discipline upon myself in terms of
money," Hsieh said, adding that he has kept a distance from influence
pedaling, extracting illegal loans or profiteering since he was first
elected.</P>
      <P>"I won past elections because the public was positive about my
integrity," he said.</P>
      <P>But he said that since he served as Kaohsiung mayor seven years
ago, he had been investigated several times, although he came out
unscathed every time after proving his innocence.</P>
      <P>"This was not because the president, or the DPP, or the national
security authorities were condoning my wrongdoings, " Hsieh said,
claiming that such a practice is "impossible" in the DPP system.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of Academia Sinica, the top
research institute in Taiwan, said Wednesday that voters sent a
strong message to the administration in the Dec. 3 islandwide local
elections and that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) now
needs to undergo some self-examination.</P>
      <P>Lee Yuan-tseh said that the DPP must indeed engage in some
soul-searching following its defeat in the "three-in-one" elections
in which the ruling party only won six of the city mayor and county
magistrate posts up for grabs while main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
and its "pan-blue alliance" allies won 17 posts.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that President Chen Shui-bian "seriously think
things over" following the strong message sent by voters.</P>
      <P>Lee, however, discounted the general view that the election
results represent an endorsement of the main opposition party,
pointing out that neither the DPP nor the KMT had a support rating
above 50 percent prior to the polls.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan's democracy has progressed by leaps and
bounds and that the people's expectations of the government have
risen dramatically at the same time, pointing out that the setback
for the DPP doesn't necessarily put the KMT in a more ideal position.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee expressed great disappointment with the
campaigning ahead of the elections, saying that there was too much
mud-slinging and too little debate on policies as well as a lack of
clear platforms put forward by candidates from either side.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee added that he's encouraged by the fact that
several DPP candidates who lost their races were gracious in defeat
by offering their congratulations and blessings to the victors.</P>
      <P>As to the future, Lee urged all the people and all the
politicians to try to set aside their differences and work together
for the sake of the national interest.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
described as "sheer speculation" a rumor Wednesday that President
Chen Shui-bian is pondering whether to ask him to form a new Cabinet
after the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) suffered a
punishing defeat in the "three-in-one" elections last weekend.</P>
      <P>Media speculation that day claimed that Chen might ask Wang to
form the next Cabinet in an effort to defuse confrontation between
the ruling DPP and the "pan-blue alliance" led by the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and break the stalemate in the legislature so as to
help smooth Chen's and his administration's governance in his last
two years in office.</P>
      <P>Wang appealed to "pan-blue alliance" supporters to be at ease
that he "is not a three-year-old" and that he "has his own stance and
judgment."</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he discounted views harbored by some "pan-blue
alliance" legislators that Chen, if he were to name Wang as the next
premier, would be aiming to use Wang as a pawn to deepen rifts within
the "pan-blue alliance, " which is gaining ever-greater influence in

    <HEADLINE>LICENSES TO BE REVOKED IF FISHING BOATS REFUSE TO RETURN TO PORT</HEADLINE>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The licenses of 42 tuna boats ordered to
return to Taiwan after the international community's cut in quotas
for Taiwan's bigeye tuna catch will be revoked if the ships refuse to
return to port, Fisheries Administration Deputy Director-General Sha
Chih-i said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Sha said the Fisheries Administration is poised to revoke the
licenses and will ask the international fishery community to treat
them as illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing vessels
whose catches will be banned from export.</P>
      <P>In addition, Sha said, ship owners who fail to bring their boats
back to Taiwan will also face prison terms of three to seven years in
line with a special punishment regulation after the measure being
drawn up by the administration has been approved at the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks after the Fisheries Administration announced
earlier in the day that it will subsidize NT$5.97 million
(US$178,700) per year to each of the 42 bigeye tuna boats that have
been told by the government to halt operations in the Atlantic and
sail back to Taiwan as a result of international sanctions due to
Taiwan ships' over-fishing in that area.</P>
      <P>The administration's subsidies to the fishing vessels have been
thoroughly assessed and are open to public scrutiny, although some
ship owners are not satisfied with the compensation offered by the
government, Sha said.</P>
      <P>The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic
Tuna (ICCAT) decided in November at its annual conference to slash
its annual quota for Taiwan's bigeye tuna catch to 4,600 metric tons
in 2006 from the current level of 149,000 metric tons, forcing Taiwan
to reduce the size of its bigeye fishing fleet to only 15 boats for
the coming year in the Atlantic.</P>

meeting since the party suffered a major setback in Saturday's

Su Tseng-chang stepped down from the DPP chairmanship to take

      <P>According to the DPP's charter, the acting chairman must organize
a by-election for the party's next chairman and the party members

    <HEADLINE>2006 ECONOMIC GROWTH TO HIT 4.25%: ACADEMIA SINICA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Academia Sinica's Institute of Economics
forecast Wednesday that Taiwan's economic growth rate will rise to
4.25 percent in 2006, with the international economy expected to
restore its growth momentum.</P>
      <P>According to Wu Chung-shu, a research fellow at the institute,
the growth momentum of the international economy diminished
significantly in 2005 because of soaring oil prices and interest rate
hikes by various countries to control inflation.</P>
      <P>Affected by the shrinking export volume and private investment,
Taiwan's economic growth rate for 2005 is expected to fall to 3.83
percent from the 6.07 percent of 2004, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu predicted that the implementation of minimum income tax rates
in 2006 will inhibit domestic demand temporarily. While the growth in
private spending is likely to decline to 3.02 percent in 2006 from
the 3.08 percent projected for 2005, the growth in private investment
is likely to slide to 3.35 percent in 2006 from the 4.08 percent
projected for 2005.</P>
      <P>Wu said the recovering international economy will help boost
Taiwan's external trade, with the export of goods and services
expected to rise to 9.87 percent in 2006 from the 6.5 percent of 2005
and imports to expand to 8.79 percent from 5.14 percent.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the average prices of oil exports by OPEC
countries will rise from US$52 per barrel in 2005 to US$56 per barrel
in 2006.</P>
      <P>He said the hike in oil prices has not jolted the international
economy this year mainly because the impact from the soaring oil
prices was partially offset by the low labor costs of China and
India.</P>
      <P>The average exchange rate of the new Taiwan dollar against the
U.S. dollar is likely to adjust from 32.19 in 2005 to 32.68 in 2006,
he went on.</P>
      <P>The wholesale price index is expected to rise 2.19 percent in
2006, compared with the 0.61 percent projected for 2005. The consumer
price index will increase 1.45 percent in 2006, compared with the
2.28 percent projected for 2005, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he predicted that there will not be a major change in
money supply in 2006, since the economic growth rate will only expand
slightly next year. The M1B money supply is expected to increase 8.98
percent in 2006, compared with the 7 percent in 2005, while the M2
money supply is expected to increase 6.71 percent in 2006, compared
with the 6.19 percent in 2005.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, Taiwan's economy in the coming year is subject
to uncertainties such as the momentum of international economic
recovery, the extent of U.S. economic growth, the domestic political
situation, cross-Taiwan Strait trade and economic exchanges and the
possibility of avian flu outbreaks.</P>
      <P>The launch of cross-strait chartered flight services during the
2006 Chinese New Year holiday and the government's policy of allowing
more Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan will be favorable to the
country's economic growth because these moves will help lower the
unemployment rate and stimulate investment and consumer spending, he
said.</P>

The designated chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke

biggest calamity to hit the U.S. and world economies." Bernanke's
fascination with the Great Depression never abated. He believes that
the issues raised by the Depression, and its lessons, are still
relevant today, and his interest in the Depression is a guide to the
evolution of his thinking. In particular, his groundbreaking research
on how mistakes by the Federal Reserve compounded the catastrophe is
likely to influence how he steers the economy once he succeeds Alan

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislators urged Wednesday a truly competitive election by members
in selecting the next party chairman and said that aspirants should
conduct policy debates.</P>
      <P>A by-election is necessary after Su Tseng-chang stepped down from
the DPP chairmanship to take responsibility for the major setback of
the party in Saturday's elections for city and county chiefs. The DPP
took only six out of the 23 seats up for grabs compared with the main
opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) 14 seats.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang Hsin-nan said that while the KMT is already
making headway since its party chairman election in August, the DPP
is still mired in problems such as "phantom" party members, factional
struggles and local chapters that do not always toe the party line.</P>
      <P>"The DPP chairman election should not be inferior to that of the
KMT," Wang said.</P>
      <P>His colleague Huang Wei-cher expressed the hope that chairman
aspirants will lay out their visions and conduct policy debates.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang Shu-hui echoed his views, saying that as the

should state their vision for the party.</P>

chairman must expound clearly on where he intends to lead the party.</P>
      <P>There should also be three presentations held in northern,
central and southern Taiwan, respectively, by the hopefuls so that
the members will have a clear picture of their visions, You said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT'S ADVISER CALLS FOR POSTPONEMENT ON ECONOMIC CONFERENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior Adviser to the President Wu Li-pei
said Wednesday he will recommend President Chen Shui-bian postpone
the proposed national economic development conference on the grounds
that it wouldn't serve the interests of the general public.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Wu said the conference which will be
the second of its kind in five years was recommended by the leaders
of the country's six commercial and industrial groups which are all
keen to explore the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>President Chen has promised on Nov. 22 to call for such a
conference, and Premier Frank Hsieh said afterward the conference
will be staged before the end of the January.</P>
      <P>"You can imagine what recommendations those groups as well as
their sympathizers in the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People
First Party (PFP) would come up with in the conference." Wu said.</P>
      <P>He predicted the second national economic development advisory
conference will downgrade itself into an occasion for big enterprises
to speak for their own interest and pressurize the government into
relaxing restrictions on exchanges with China which he claimed would
be to the detriment of the general public.</P>
      <P>Unless the conference is postponed, the government will find
itself placed between a rock and a hard place because it will either
hurt the overall interest of the people by accepting the conference'
recommendations as a whole or shot itself in the foot by convening
this conference but turning a deaf ear to its conclusions, Wu
claimed.</P>
      <P>In terms of the country's ties with China, Wu said the president
is quite firm in his stance against China, but the country's economy
depends on China too heavily which creates an impression that the
government is leaning toward China.</P>
      <P>Discontent with what they believe as the government's skewing
toward China, many pro-Taiwan voters denied the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party of their support in the Dec. 3 local government
elections and delivered the party a heavy blow, Wu claimed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is really painting itself into the corner by allowing its
businessmen invest in China which help China develop into an economic
power in the region and compete against Taiwan on the world market.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the island's declining exports this year, Wu said
that now the chickens are coming home to roost and the government has
to address the problem caused by its ill-thought-out China policy.</P>
      <P>He disputed businessmen's claims that the government should allow
the free movement of goods and capitals in line with the business
globalization rather than avoid contacts with China as much as
possible, arguing that globalization is more than venturing into
China.</P>
      <P>Too close trade relations with China will cost Taiwan its
economic independence and hinder its chance of globalization, Wu
warned.</P>
      <P>Instead of calling an national economic development conference,
he said the DPP administration should invite academics without
political affiliation to debate in public on the county's future and
consult them on the economic policy which should take into
consideration the general public's interest.</P>
      <P>As the ruling party, Wu said. the DPP should give leadership to
the country rather than play the opposition's game by echoing its
calls for direct transportation links with the mainland.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou and People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong will meet
next Monday amid expectations that a merger of the two parties is
imminent.</P>
      <P>Before the meeting of the two leaders of the "pan-blue alliance,"
Ma will first meet with a five-man PFP team in charge of negotiations
on a merger with the KMT.</P>
      <P>Asked about possible topics during the meeting, Ma said "anything
can be discussed, " including the merger, since the KMT passed a
resolution to merge with the PFP last year.</P>
      <P>As there will be Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral elections, as well
as city councilor elections of the two special municipalities next
year, the PFP councilors have expressed worry about the nominations
after such a merger, which Ma said will also be addressed during the
meeting.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the KMT has a set nomination procedure and that the
primary system must continue.</P>
      <P>KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen said earlier in the day that Ma and
Soong will meet for three hours and that it will be earlier than
expected because Soong is scheduled to attend an international
conference Dec. 14-18.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the PFP control a slim majority between them in the
Legislative Yuan, and have joined hands to block many bills initiated
by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in the legislature.</P>
      <P>The PFP is a KMT splinter party founded in 2000 after Soong lost
his presidential bid by a slim margin. Soong, who used to be the
KMT's all-powerful secretary-general, ran as an independent in the
2000 presidential race.</P>
      <P>The PFP saw its strength decline after the 2004 presidential
elections in which Soong teamed up with then-KMT Chairman Lien Chan,
only to be defeated a second time by President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The party is now facing the risk of being sidelined after the
Dec. 3 local elections in which it won only one magistrate seat -- in
Kinmen -- out of 23 openings up for grabs, and that only thanks to
the courtesy of the KMT, which refrained from naming its own
candidate in that county.</P>
      <P>Many PFP lawmakers have called for a merger with the KMT, which
won 14 seats in the Dec. 3 race and is on its way to a showdown with
the DPP in the 2008 presidential race.</P>

      <P>Honorary Chairman Lien Chan of Taiwan's
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) arrived in Hong Kong Wednesday for a
four-day visit.</P>
      <P>Lien will receive an honorary doctorate in law from Hong Kong
Chief Executive Donald Tseng at the Chinese University of Hong Kong
Thursday, and the two men are slated to meet for talks Friday.</P>
      <P>While answering questions on the Dec. 3 elections from local
reporters prior to his departure at Chiang Kei-shek International
Airport near Taipei, Lien expressed the hope that the KMT and its
"pan blue alliance" ally, the People First Party (PFP), will merge as
soon as possible and that the dual-head government system will be
implemented in line with the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The KMT overwhelmed the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
in the weekend local elections, re-drawing Taiwan's political map.
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou has been widely tipped by "pan blue"
supporters as the sole superstar in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Public calls have been mounting on a much-expected merger between
the KMT and the PFP in the wake of the PFP's poor showing in the

marginal party in Taiwan politics.</P>

Ma is slated to meet PFP Chairman James Soong next Monday to discuss
a host of issues related to the KMT-PFP merger after a PFP spokesman
said a day earlier that Soong will put himself above the fray and
remain fully open to the merger.</P>
      <P>The PFP splintered from the KMT in 2000 following the
presidential election that year, but the two parties and the New
Party teamed up to form the "pan blue alliance" to counter the "pan

      <P>Whether or not People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong will run for Taipei mayor next year will depend
on public opinion, PFP lawmaker Li Hong-jyun said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Li made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
after a local newspaper reported earlier the same day that it is "80

      <P>Should Soong run, it would be because the public wants him to, Li

Taiwan's largest city into a world-class cosmopolitan metropolis with
a high international profile since it is feared that Taiwan has lost
its luster on the world stage.</P>
      <P>However, Li said, a public mandate will be the decisive factor in

    <HEADLINE>INTERNATIONAL INDIGENOUS FILM FESTIVAL OPENS DEC. 12</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A film festival on Canada, New Zealand and
Taiwan's indigenous peoples will begin Dec. 12.</P>
      <P>Thirty-two films will be shown in university auditoriums around
the island free of charge until the end of next year.</P>
      <P>The non-profit film festival is part of the International
Indigenous Creativity Conference. The Council of Indigenous People
(CIP) , under the supervision of the Executive Yuan, signed a
memorandum of understanding with the Canadian government in 1994 and
an arrangement with New Zealand in 2004 to promote indigenous
peoples' issues, allowing the three countries to organize the
festival.</P>
      <P>The festival starts at Chung Yuan University in Chungli City.</P>
      <P>From there, the films will travel around Taiwan to Bunun tribes
in Taitung, eastern Taiwan, Chiayi University, Pingtung Aboriginal
Cultural Park, Shunyi Aboriginal Museum, Hualien Donghua University
and Taichung's Providence University.</P>
      <P>Other organizations and academic parties interested in showing
the films are still trying to get in touch with the authorities
concerned.</P>
      <P>Director of the General Relations Department of the Canadian
Trade Office David Hamilton said during a news conference that the 13
films from his country were selected by the National Film Board of
Canada among 450 made during the past 30 years.</P>
      <P>"Indigenous peoples' culture is boundless. Canadian indigenous
peoples are trying to tell their story to the world through these
movies. We hope to bring a new point of view for Taiwanese audiences
regarding indigenous peoples' issues," Hamilton said.</P>
      <P>Indigenous peoples represent 4 percent of Canada's total
population, while Taiwan's aborigines makes up 2 percent of the
island's residents.</P>
      <P>There are 14 films made by three Taiwanese indigenous directors.</P>
      <P>Among the films from Taiwan, one of the most controversial is the
one entitled, "What is your real name?" by Mayao Biho. The film talks
about the controversy of Taiwanese indigenous people and whether to
use their names in their ancestral tongue on identification cards.</P>
      <P>"Local regulations have for the last 11 years allowed indigenous
people here to use their names in their mother tongue. But as of the
end of September, there were only 890 indigenous people who rectified
their Chinese name into their "real name." But 65 of these apparently
regret having done so, " said Mayao, who also has his mother tongue
name on his ID card.</P>
      <P>The film director humorously compared the number of people who
rectified their name with the number of black-faced spoonbills, a
protected migratory bird that overwinters in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"There are also about 800 of them. Last year we were winners
because there were more of us than the birds. But this year we lost
because there were more than 900 birds," Mayao said.</P>
      <P>Mayao said that he was extremely surprised that his film was
chosen because the topics he usually tackles are unfriendly to the
government.</P>
      <P>Two of the Canadian films, "Kanehsatake" made by Alanis Obomsawin
and "No Turning Back" from Greg Coyes, report on violent armed
conflicts between indigenous peoples and governmental authorities
when the native people were striving for the right to own their
ancestral lands and to restore their civil rights.</P>
      <P>Mayao said that indigenous activities in Taiwan, such as
fighting for the right to put their names in their mother tongue,
the right to practice their own culture and to own their ancestors'
land are mostly following the trend of Canada.</P>
      <P>"If they didn't start, the indigenous people here wouldn't be
that aware and have a path to follow," Mayao said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IMPORTERS EAGER TO CASH IN ON POSSIBLE NEW ENTRY OF AMERICAN BEEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beef importers, restaurants and steakhouses
in Taiwan are eager to cash in on the possible re-entry of U.S. beef
now that the government has decided to convene an expert meeting to
decide whether to lift the ban on U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>Executives of these businesses said Wednesday that once the
government decides to allow American beef to re-enter Taiwan, they
will immediately launch orders for U.S. beef to serve local
customers, who consider American beef their best choice among the
various types of beef from around the world.</P>
      <P>U.S. beef imports account for more than 20 percent of Taiwan's</P>
      <P> total beef imports.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned imports of U.S. beef, live cattle and all related
products in December 2003 after the discovery in Washington State of
a single case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) , or mad cow
disease.</P>
      <P>The island lifted the ban on U.S. boneless beef from animals
under 30 months in April this year, which drew tremendous criticism
from opposition lawmakers after a second mad cow disease case was
confirmed in U.S. in June. The DOH then again suspended U.S. beef
imports on June 25.</P>
      <P>Tsai Hui-ju, deputy general manager responsible for public
relations of the Grand Formosa Regent Taipei, which made the first
importation of American beef in April shortly after the government
lifted the ban on U.S. beef the same month, said that the
government's short re-opening to U.S. beef earlier this year has made
the business in the hotel's steak and tepanyaki grill houses grow by
20 percent to 30 percent. "All our customers prefer American beef, "
Tsai added.</P>
      <P>Tsai expressed the hope that the government can present clear
proof that American beef is safe this time and not re-open the market
hastily. "Once the ban is lifted, we are prepared to resume
importing American beef."</P>
      <P>Lin Shih-chin, chairman of the well-known Noble Family Steak
House, said the re-opening of imports of American beef will help
reduce their costs in importing beef from other countries.</P>
      <P>Lin revealed that ever since American beef was banned in Taiwan
in June, the prices of beef from New Zealand and Australia have risen
more than 30 percent to 40 percent, the highest during the last 10
years.</P>
      <P>Although many people are still worried about mad cow disease, Lin
said he has much confidence in the re-entry of American beef, adding
that once U.S. beef is back, the customers will all return.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC OFFICIAL IN MANILA URGES CHINA TO STOP BULLYING TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila, Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By Emerson Lin and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman
Huang Wei-feng urged China Wednesday to stop bullying Taiwan in the
international community.</P>
      <P>Huang issued the call after giving a briefing in Manila on the
recent cross-Taiwan Strait situation to reporters from major
Philippine media outlets, in which diplomats from Taiwan stationed in
Manila also took part.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, China is way out of line in the way it views
Taiwan's pursuit of democracy and freedom as attempts to obtain
formal independence. The Republic of China was set up in 1911 and a
name change is not an issue for the ROC government now in Taiwan, he
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will not overhaul its China policy after the Dec. 3 local
government elections, and China should not continue to squeeze
Taiwan's international space by using checkbook diplomacy, he said,
pointing out, however, that China's military buildup at a
double-digit growth rate is the root cause of the threat to security
cross the strait and to the rest of the region.</P>
      <P>The MAC vice chairman also called on the member states of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to support Taiwan to
participate in an upcoming ASEAN summit meeting or to include
across-strait issues for discussions on the summit's agenda.</P>
      <P>Huang made a stopover in Manila on his way back to Taiwan from
Indonesia, where he took part in an activity sponsored by the Global
Alliance for Democracy and Peace.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THERE IS NO TIMETABLE FOR LIFTING OF U.S. BEEF IMPORT BAN: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking official from the Department
of Health (DOH) said Wednesday that the government has no timetable
regarding the lifting of its ban on U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>Chen Lu-hung, director-general of DOH's Bureau of Food Safety,
made the remarks in response to reports by evening newspapers that
the government may re-open it market to U.S. beef before the Chinese
Lunar New Year holiday as the DOH has decided to convene an expert
meeting later this month to decide whether to lift the ban on U.S.
beef.</P>
      <P>Chen said the DOH will convene an expert meeting on Dec. 19-23 to
evaluate the safety of U.S. beef, and whether Taiwan will re-open its
market to American beef will be decided by the experts participating
in the meeting. "There is no set timetable for the re-entry of
American beef," Chen added.</P>
      <P>However, Chen noted that once the U.S. beef ban is lifted, only
boneless beef from animals under 30 months of age and excluding those
high-risk parts of the animal such as internal organs, the brain and
the spinal cord will be allowed to be imported to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned imports of U.S. beef, live cattle and all related
products in December 2003 after the discovery in Washington State of
a single case of mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>The island lifted the ban on U.S. boneless beef from animals
under 30 months of age in April this year, but again suspended
American beef imports on June 25 after a second case of mad cow
disease was confirmed in the U.S. earlier the same month.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The newly passed Government Information
Release Law is an important step on the road to improving Taiwan's
freedom of speech and is also a guarantee for the rights of the
people, the Association of Taiwan Journalists (ATJ) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved the law Dec. 6, which allows people
to have more direct access to government information, to be a part of
public policy-making and to oversee government operations.</P>
      <P>The ATJ said that the law will help differentiate "national
security issues" and "freedom of the press issues." The legislature
will be in charge of arbitration whenever there is confusion in
telling the difference between these two issues.</P>
      <P>The ATJ suggested that the government review their regulations on
whether the range of definitions of "government secrets" is too wide,
a situation that might be in conflict with the new law.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG BOOTH AT UN CLIMATE CHANGE CONFAB DRAWS ATTENTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The presence of representatives from
Taiwan's southern city of Kaohsiung at the 2005 United Nations
Climate Change Conference taking place in Montreal, Canada drew
attention because it is one of a handful of cities opening exhibition
booths at the venue, officials of the city's department of
environmental protection said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung is the first Taiwan city to attend the U.N. conference
that opened Dec. 28 and will run through Dec. 9. At the Kaohsiung
city booth, complete information on Kaohsiung's efforts can be found
regarding air pollution control and the reduction greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>The conference is the 11th session of the Conference of Parties
to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change and the first
meeting of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol after the treaty came
into force in February. Over 10,000 representatives of government,
industry, business and the scientific community are at the
conference, including a group of Taiwan delegates headed by Wang
Chueh, deputy director of the Kaohsiung City environmental protection
department.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung, Taiwan's stronghold of the petrochemical and steel
industries, has the highest amount of greenhouse gas emissions on the
island, with the emission of carbon dioxide accounting for 20.52
percent of the nation's total amount, according to the department.</P>
      <P>In 2004, the carbon dioxide emissions per capita in the southern
port city reached 34.72 tons, almost a world record, the

    <HEADLINE>12 DOCTORS DISCIPLINED FOR REVEALING TAICHUNG MAYOR'S MEDICAL RECORDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Twelve local doctors, including ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Peter Lin, were
disciplined Wednesday for revealing Taichung Mayor Jason Hu's medical
records.</P>
      <P>Lin, a physician-turned-legislator who played a leading role in
unveiling Hu's medical records at a news conference ahead of the Dec.
3 local government chief elections in an attempt to thwart Hu's
re-election bid, got the harshest punishment, with his licence to
practice medicine being revoked.</P>
      <P>Under the current rules, Lin can appeal his case to the
Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) . If the DOH upholds the
ruling, Lin cannot apply for a new license within a year, meaning
that he will be banned from practicing medicine for one year.</P>
      <P>The Medical Doctor Disciplinary Committee under the Taichung City
Government in central Taiwan meted out penalties for Lin and 11 other
doctors present at the Nov. 25 news conference after a six-hour
meeting.</P>
      <P>Kao Chia-chun, who arranged for the news conference, had his
license suspended for one month, plus he must attend 32 hours of
medical ethics courses.</P>
      <P>The 10 remaining doctors were given a warning plus mandatory
attendance of medical ethics courses ranging from between eight and
24 hours.</P>
      <P>Lin Teng-chun, director of the public health department under the
Taichung City Government, said even though many of the disciplined
doctors didn't speak at the news conference, their presence on the
occasion and their failure to prevent Peter Lin from unveiling Hu's
medical records constituted a stark violation of ethical rules.</P>
      <P>As to the authenticity of Hu's medical records, Lin Teng-chun
said that is an issue to be investigated by prosecutorial
authorities.</P>
      <P>"The medical disciplinary committee is responsible for
supervising physicians' behavior, regardless of whether they are
legislator or not," he added.</P>
      <P>All of the disciplined can appeal their cases to the DOH's
disciplinary committee within 20 days. Peter Lin said at the
pre-election news conference that he believes Hu's health could
deteriorate and affect his mental health, causing him to be unfit to
serve as mayor. He further claimed that Hu is troubled by high blood
pressure and diabetes and that there is a 70 percent chance that Hu
might have a stroke within two years.</P>
      <P>Hu reportedly suffered a mild stroke on a trip to the United
States in August 2002, but he claims he only felt dizzy and suffered
from a severe headache, which forced him to undergo an intensive
health-check in the United States.</P>
      <P>Hu has insisted that those were only "pre-stroke symptoms," which
were not as serious as people thought.</P>
      <P>Before becoming Taichung mayor in 2001, Hu was a director of
the Government Information Office under the Cabinet, a National
Assembly member, a minister of foreign affairs, and a Republic of
China representative to the United States.</P>
      <P>Despite questions about his health, Hu was re-elected by a
landslide.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SU RULES OUT POSSIBILITY OF RETURNING AS DPP CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Su Tseng-chang said Wednesday he has no wish to return as
party chairman.</P>
      <P>Su stepped down from the top DPP post immediately after the party
suffered a humiliating defeat in the Dec. 3 mayoral/magistrate
elections in which the DPP secured a mere six of the 23 seats up for
grabs compared to the main opposition Kuomintang's 14.</P>
      <P>Su didn't attend the DPP's weekly Central Standing Committee
meeting and instead took a vacation in the northeastern county of
Ilan.</P>
      <P>Although Vice President Annette Lu came up with a proposal at the
DPP meeting that the party central persuade Su to continue leading
the party through its current crisis, Su rejected the offer.</P>
      <P>Su said he felt ashamed and guilty for the party's resounding
defeat. "I want to take a rest and refresh my mind by reading and
practicing calligraphy," he added.</P>
      <P>At this critical moment, Su said he is hopeful that all DPP
politicians can stand united and work even harder to revamp the party
through deep soul-searching and self-improvement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DPP Central Standing Committee decided Wednesday
to name Lu to serve as acting chairwoman until a new party chairman
is elected by all DPP members early next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO FORM PARTY DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) decided Wednesday to set up a party development commission to
draw up a comprehensive plan to improve the party following the DPP's
resounding defeat in last weekend's local government chief elections.</P>
      <P>The decision was made at the party's weekly Central Standing
Committee.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, party heavyweights spoke their minds on the
humiliating defeat. They attributed the major causes to Kaohsiung MRT
scandals and the combining of the three grassroots elections into a
single day, which they claimed made it easier for the Kuomintang
(KMT) to woo voters with illegal cash handouts.</P>
      <P>They also said that having the elections together made it easier
and cheaper for the KMT to rally their supporters to vote. In a
sense, they said, the "three-in-one" elections were fertile ground
for the growth of the KMT's "black gold" politics. "Black gold"
refers to the corrupt practice of influence peddling and vote-buying.</P>
      <P>Another factor was the actions of a few DPP supporters who
overstepped the bounds of reasonableness, such as in the case of a
party legislator who, along with 11 doctors, revealed what they
claimed to be the medical records of Taichung Mayor Jason Hu to try
to say that his past history of having a mild stroke made him unfit
to run for re-election. A medical review committee has already
disciplined all of the doctors and the legislator, who is also a
licensed physician.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the fact that the party was unable to monitor and rein
in these people contributed to the party's image being tarnished in
the eyes of the public, DPP heavyweights said.</P>
      <P>They also blamed the party's failure to come up with appeals or
reform initiatives that could touch voters' hearts in run-up to the
elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SAYS HE WILL TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ELECTION DEFEAT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After four days of silence, President Chen
Shui-bian said Thursday that he accepts the people's decision in
Saturday's "three-in-one" local government elections and that he will
take full responsibility for the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP) defeat by the main opposition Kuomitang (KMT) in the
vote.</P>
      <P>The president chose not a live TV broadcast but his "President
A-Bian's electronic newspaper" to express his "not good feelings"
about a rare crushing defeat for him. He also quoted a Chinese saying
that "only those who know shame can be called brave" to show that he
will engage in some serious soul searching in an effort to "walk out
of the shadows of a big setback."</P>
      <P>He emphasized that he will use "the highest and strictest
standards" to examine all members in his ruling team, including
himself, demanding that they work together to reinstall the
government's "reputation of integrity, diligence, and love of our
native land, " an effort that he believes will regain the people's
trust and support.</P>
      <P>In order to regain the people's support, he said, the ruling team
must first "listen to their voices and review its image in the minds
of the general public."</P>
      <P>"There have been many shortcomings that have disappointed the
people, " he said, adding that he will face the fact, take
responsibility for that, and "thoroughly review and seek ways to make
improvements."</P>
      <P>"I will respond to the people's expectations of me and of my team
with concrete actions." he stressed.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that "integrity, diligence and love of our
native land" has been the unswerving motto of his ruling team over
the past five years which, however, some members of the team have
failed to achieve, becoming a minus for the team's overall image and
saddening him.</P>
      <P>He said the people's choice in the Dec. 3 elections of city,
county and town government heads and council members "must be
accepted by all candidates because we are a democracy. It is that
simple. It is the people who are the most powerful; only they are the
real masters."</P>
      <P>The DPP won only six of the 23 city and county government seats
up for grabs, versus the KMT's 14, with the other three going to
independents or minor party candidates.</P>
      <P>Chen quoted Buddhist Master Sheng Yen, a well-respected
scholar-monk, as saying when facing adversity, "we should try to face
it, accept it, handle it and then move on." He said these four
"attitudes" are good advice.</P>
      <P>What is precious about democracy is that no one will be a winner
forever and no one will be a loser forever; those who know how to
learn from their failures will have a chance to make a comeback, he
said.</P>
      <P>Trying to be a historian, the president said that history is a
mirror that reflects the past in the present and that it also
envisions the future from the present. "In fact, the people are even
more like a mirror that truthfully reflects the performance of a
politician or a political party," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT TO SHOW MAXIMUM SINCERITY TO REACH MERGER DEAL WITH PFP: MA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said
Thursday that his party will demonstrate "the maximum sincerity and
the greatest good will" to reach a deal with the People First Party
(PFP) on merging the two "pan-blue alliance" parties.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in reply to media questions after meeting
with a delegation sent by PFP Chairman James Soong, who is scheduled
to meet Ma Monday, to explore Ma's ideas about the merger project.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman met with PFP legislative caucus convener Huang
Yi-chiao and PFP Legislators Sun Ta-chien and Chang Hsien-yao to
discuss the merger plan which Ma said his party hopes to see
completed by the end of this year. The KMT's Central Standing
Committee passed a resolution on May 19, 2004 approving the plan to
merge the KMT with the PFP.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the PFP will make the nomination of Sung as the
"pan-blue alliance" candidate in next year's Taipei mayoral election
one of the conditions of the merger, Ma said that the matter was not
raised by the PFP representatives with whom he met.</P>
      <P>Ma, whose term as Taipei City mayor will end next year, had
mentioned earlier that he has no personal preference regarding who
should replace him. He also had said that a candidate should be
chosen according to the party's rules, which stipulate that primaries
must be held.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT
stalwart, reiterated his lack of interest in becoming premier in the
event that President Chen Shui-bian decides to reshuffle the current
Cabinet led by Frank Hsieh, who has offered to resign in the wake of
last week's election defeat suffered by his ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Wang, who lost the party chairmanship race to Ma in July, told
KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan that no one has discussed the matter
with him and that he does not intend to become premier. "I simply
want to remain as the speaker of the legislature," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in the "pan-green camp, " Vice President Annette Lu
said Thursday she's still recovering from the surprise of being
catapulted to the post of acting chairwoman of the DPP the previous
day and has not thought about whether she will run for the post of
chairwoman of the party next year.</P>
      <P>If Lu were to run and win, one possible scenario would have her
pitted against another Harvard graduate, the KMT's Ma, when the next
presidential election rolls around in 2008.</P>
      <P>However, Lu advised the media not to speculate about 2008 which
she said is still too far off. She pointed out that she hasn't even
had a chance to give thought to what the new DPP lineup will be
following the party's major setback in the local elections.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>International groups from more than 20
countries who sent representatives to observe Taiwan's "three-in-one"
elections said they were impressed by the island's democratic
development, citing especially that there were no incidents of
violence before, during or after the polls.</P>
      <P>Michel Lu, a spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA),
made the remarks Thursday when he reported on the findings of the
international observers of the just-concluded elections for city and
county chiefs, city and county councilors, and village and township
heads.</P>
      <P>Lu said that the groups were very positive about the deepening of
democracy in Taiwan as demonstrated by the successful elections and
that they "lauded Taiwan as being an advanced country."</P>
      <P>A lot of these observers also expressed concerns about whether
there will be any major changes in cross-strait relations in the wake
of the elections in which the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
experienced a major defeat, Lu said, adding that there are unlikely
to be any abrupt changes.</P>
      <P>As for the release of the Taichung mayor's medical records during
the campaign in an attempt to thwart his re-election bid and as for
the distribution of a video disc allegedly defaming the Taoyuan
County magistrate for the same reason, Lu said such incidents during
the heated campaign gave the observers "novel" feelings. Both
incumbents ended up winning their respective races.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LONG WORK HOURS AFFECT TAIWAN WORK FORCE'S WELL-BEING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwanese are a nation of workaholics,
working 2,282 hours a year, or 6.25 hours per day all year round
without counting days off, resulting in a whopping 84 percent of them
claiming that long hours have negatively affected their health or
quality of life.</P>
      <P>This is one of the findings by Winner magazine and 1111 Jobs
Bank, which jointly surveyed 1,654 people between Nov. 22 and Dec. 5
with a margin of error of 2.4 percent. The results were released
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Previous surveys have found that 57 percent of Taiwan workers
fear death from overwork, that 35 percent of white-collar workers
regularly stay late at the office, that high-tech workers have low
quality of life in spite of higher income, and that 80 percent of the
workers would be willing to accept temporary employment, as temporary
staffing has become a trend among local businesses.</P>
      <P>In the latest survey, more than 70 percent said they work an
average of more than eight hours per day, meaning the extra hours
have become routine, with many enjoying fewer holidays than legally
allowed.</P>
      <P>Of all the respondents, 41 percent said they are concerned about
the negative impact of long work hours on their health, 24 percent
worry that they are losing their leisure time and 19 percent worry
that they are enjoying less time with their families.</P>
      <P>As to why they cannot complete their work even with extra hours
and days, 26 percent each said their companies are under-staffed and
that they simply do not know how to tackle a host of the issues that
confront them.</P>
      <P>These two complaints were followed by "colleagues not being
cooperative enough" (18 percent) and "executives demanding too much
from them" (13 percent).</P>
      <P>In order to surmount the time pressure at work and increase
efficiency, 71 percent of Taiwan workers are coming to rely more and
more on the latest gadgets, such as notebook computers and personal
digital assistants (PDA) to help improve their time management.</P>
      <P>The most popular work assisting device is the notebook, with 48
percent of working people using them, followed by traditional
notebooks, used by 22 percent, and PDA cell phones, adopted by 17

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CAN PILOT DEMOCRACY THROUGH HONG KONG, CHINA: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   8  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian expressed
confidence Thursday that Taiwan will eventually lead democracy to
prevail in Hong Kong and China, laying a solid foundation for
perpetual peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen said that compared with Hong Kong and China, Taiwan is a
trailblazer among ethnic Chinese communities in Asia in terms of its
democratic development.</P>
      <P>"Although China has a strong magnetic effect on the world
economy, Taiwan can be an exemplar as a lighthouse of democracy, "
Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks in the latest edition of his
online newsletter, in which he commented on the Dec. 4 mass
demonstration staged by 250,000 Hong Kong residents demanding
universal suffrage to elect the region's chief executive and
Legislative Council.</P>
      <P>Chen recalled that more than 500,000 Hong Kong people took to the
streets July 1, 2003 in protest against a proposed anti-subversion
law, which shocked Beijing and drew global attention.</P>
      <P>On July 13 the same year, more than 20,000 people protested
outside the Legislative Council to ask for a popular election for the
chief executive in 2007 and for the Legislative Council in 2008, Chen
pointed out.</P>
      <P>However, these calls for democracy were negated by the government
of the special administrative region, which only agreed to increase
the members of the electoral college eligible to elect the chief
executive and the seats in the Legislative Council, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>"The Hong Kong people are still deprived of the right to elect
their chief executive and members of the Legislative Council, which
remains democracy in a bird cage," he said.</P>
      <P>By claiming that political parties in Hong Kong are not mature
enough to handle popular elections, Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald
Tsang was using the same excuse that had been employed by the past
authoritarian rulers in Taiwan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"Before they actually lose power, no dictators will admit the
conditions for democracy are ripe, because they themselves are the
biggest barricade to democracy," he said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, democracy is a universal value and a basic
right that every person should be entitled to regardless of his
cultural background, ethnic identity or religious belief.</P>
      <P>While no government should arbitrarily deprive its people of such
a right, history has proven that the development of democracy is like
drops of water converging slowly to become a big river that flows
eventually into the sea -- a course that no-one can block or reverse,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>The demonstration by the Hong Kong people for universal suffrage
also proves that the democratic development of Taiwan is not an
isolated case, he said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that in the past, the authoritarian rulers in
Taiwan refused to allow the people to be their own masters, on the
grounds that the democratic system was incompatible with the Chinese,
that people did not have enough education to make democracy work, and
that democracy would affect the country's economic development.</P>
      <P>"But it has been proven by facts that these lies and excuses
could not withstand the test of time," he said.</P>
      <P>Citing the Dec. 3 "three-in-one" elections in Taiwan as an
example of democracy, Chen said all parties must accept the choices
of the people unconditionally because only the people are the true
masters of the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT-PFP NEGOTIATION MECHANISM FOR MERGER DUE BY LATE JANUARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and its
"pan blue alliance" ally the People First Party (PFP) agreed Thursday
to move toward a merger in two phases, with the first phase slated to
be completed by the end of January next year, according to KMT
officials and PFP lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The conclusion was reached between KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and
a five-member task force of PFP lawmakers during a closed-door
meeting of more than two hours at KMT headquarters.</P>
      <P>The two parties agreed initially to jointly iron out a
negotiation mechanism for nominating candidates to run for all levels
of public office by the end of January 2006, and for the
establishment of a negotiating platform to deal with personnel and
legal affairs, members of which will be announced by the two parties'
chairmen next Monday following a further meeting, PFP Legislator
Daniel Y.C. Huang said.</P>
      <P>During the process toward an eventual merger, the two parties
will continue collaborating based on the principles of respecting
public opinion, building mutual trust, establishing a sound system
and sharpening competitive edges, Huang added.</P>
      <P>The PFP will carry out the merger with the KMT through a
democratic process, and the opinions and options of individual
lawmakers will be fully respected, he noted.</P>
      <P>KMT spokeswoman Cheng Lee-wen said that future negotiation
mechanisms will be clearly laid out after Ma and PFP Chairman James
Soong meet Dec. 12, and that officials of the two parties will meet
periodically afterwards until the merger has been accomplished.</P>
      <P>The two parties in the "pan blue alliance" have accelerated their
pace of pushing for a much talked-about merger in the wake of the
Dec. 3 local government elections, in which the KMT strongly outshone
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Although Soong has repeatedly claimed that the PFP will walk its
own path regardless of pressure from the KMT, the PFP's miserable
showing in last weekend's elections has prompted grave concern among
supporters that the party might disappear from Taiwan's political
map.</P>
      <P>The KMT, the PFP and the New Party formed the "pan blue alliance"
prior to the presidential election in March 2004, in which the
KMT-PFP ticket lost by a razor-thin margin to the DPP ticket that was
seeking re-election.</P>
      <P>Soong set up the PFP in 2000 after losing his bid for presidency
in the presidential race to President Chen Shui-bian in March that
year. Soong, who used to be an all-powerful KMT secretary-general,
had defected from the party and ran as an independent in the 2000
presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO CONVENE MEETING ON PARTY DEVELOPMENT AFTER ELECTION SETBACK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will convene a meeting to discuss the future of the party's
development after its setback in last Saturday's city and county
chief elections, a DPP official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The DPP decided at its central standing committee meeting a day
earlier that it will set up a party development commission
exclusively responsible for the issue.</P>
      <P>The date of convening the conference and the formation of the
commission will be decided at next week's central standing committee
meeting, the official added.</P>
      <P>As Su Tseng-chang stepped down from the DPP chairmanship to take
responsibility for the party's defeat in last Saturday's
"three-in-one" elections, Vice President Annette Lu was named to
serve as the acting chairwoman of the DPP during the central standing
committee meeting, the first of its kind since the elections, in
which the DPP only garnered six of the 23 city mayor and county
magistrate posts, far behind the 14 seized by the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Some DPP candidates for city mayor and magistrate posts have
attributed the party's setback to the combination of three grassroots
elections in a single day, which they claimed made it easier for the
KMT to buy votes due to its long grip on grassroots constituencies.
The KMT ruled Taiwan for more than 50 years until it was defeated by
the DPP in the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>It is expected that a review of the nomination system for future
elections and the interaction between the party and the government
will be high on the agenda of the party development meeting, the DPP
official said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAICHUNG MAYOR UNDECIDED WHETHER TO SUE 12 DOCTORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Dec.  8 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Re-elected Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said
Thursday that he is still undecided as to whether he will sue the 12
doctors who released what they claimed to be his medical records
before the Dec. 3 election in an attempt to diminish his chances of
winning.</P>
      <P>Hu, who looked quite healthy despite reports that he suffered a
stroke on a trip to the United States in August 2002, made the
remarks when asked to comment on the penalties meted out to the 12
doctors by the Medical Doctor Disciplinary Committee under the
Taichung city government's health authorities Wednesday.</P>
      <P>One of the doctors -- Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Legislator Peter Lin, who played a leading role in disclosing what he
claimed were Hu's medical records at a news conference in Taichung --
received the harshest punishment, with his licence to practice
medicine suspended for one year.</P>
      <P>Another was banned from practicing medicine for one month and
ordered to attend 32 hours of re-education classes on medical ethics.
The others were given warnings and must attend mandatory classes on
medical ethics totalling from eight to 24 hours.</P>
      <P>Hu, of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), said he respects the
rulings by the city government's health authorities and said he did
not interfere in any way in their decisions.</P>
      <P>Hu added that the outcome is not yet final, because health
authorities at a higher level might still have a say on the issue. He
said he will not rule out any possibility at this stage, but will
wait and see the final result before deciding whether it is necessary
to sue the 12 doctors.</P>
      <P>At a press conference at the legislature in Taipei Thursday, Lin
challenged the ruling on the grounds that his hospital is located in
Kaohsiung and is therefore not under the jurisdiction of the health
authorities of the Taichung city government.</P>
      <P>He also attempted to defend his integrity, claiming that he was
"doing the right thing" by revealing the alleged medical records, as
he thought Hu was "not fit" to serve a second term.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislator also said that he will push for legislation to
require candidates for public office to disclose their health
information.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT legislative caucus urged Lin to withdraw from
the legislature's Sanitation, Environment and Social Welfare
Committee to avoid a conflict of interests.</P>
      <P>Caucus whips pointed out that Lin has another case pending
against him. In October the Bureau of National Health Insurance
charged that his hospital used forged records of overnight patients
to get reimbursements from the bureau.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on the dispute over the ruling by the Taichung
health authorities, a spokesman for the Department of Health (DOH)
under the Cabinet said the health authority under the Kaohsiung city
government will have to either enforce the ruling of the Taichung
health authority or hold a hearing of its own to hear Lin defend
himself.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also said that Lin can appeal his case to the DOH's
disciplinary committee within 20 days and that if the DOH upholds the
ruling, he will be banned from practicing medicine for one year.</P>

      <P>Taiwan would be the 11th most popular
destination in Asia for American travelers if they were to choose a
place for sightseeing during the first half of next year, according
to a recent survey by the prestigious Conde Nast Travelers magazine.</P>
      <P>Results of the poll of 29,000 American travelers show that Taiwan
is in 11th place after Thailand, Hong Kong, China, Japan, Vietnam,
India, Malaysia, Singapore, Laos and Cambodia, but ahead of South
Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and
Myanmar.</P>
      <P>Among the American people who have visited countries in Asia this
year, 39 percent of the respondents visited Hong Kong, ahead of 33
percent who opted for China and 29 percent who traveled to Thailand,
the poll results show.</P>
      <P>Lisa Hughes, an executive at the Conde Nast Traveler research

    <HEADLINE>8 OF TAIWAN'S TOP 20 COMPANIES INVESTING IN CHINA: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eight out of Taiwan's top 20 corporations
have investments in China, according to the results of a business
survey published Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai topped the list as the largest Taiwan conglomerate
maintaining the biggest Taiwan-invested company in China, according
to the recent survey jointly conducted by the Taipei-based Commercial
Times and the China Credit Information Service (CCIS).</P>
      <P>Hon Hai, which is also the largest company in Taiwan, is followed
by seven other Taiwan companies that are also among the top 20
companies in Taiwan and the top 20 Taiwanese companies in China. They
are: Quanta Computer, Compal, AU Optronics, BenQ, Inventec, Acer and
Chunghwa Picture Tubes, in that order, the poll found.</P>
      <P>All these eight top-ranking Taiwanese companies are in the
high-technology business, the poll found.</P>
      <P>Commercial Times and CCIS published a list of the top 1,000
Taiwanese companies in China Thursday after a 10-month survey, the
first of its kind. CCIS defines the size of a company by gauging its
business turnover, pre-tax net profit, authorized capital, issued
shares and net value.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, all top 10 Taiwanese companies in China
are in the hi-tech sector and 67 of the top 100 Taiwanese companies
in China are in the same sector.</P>
      <P>However, the poll found that nearly 70 percent of the top 1,000
Taiwanese companies in China are in traditional industries, with the
types of businesses varying greatly.</P>
      <P>Of them, Cheng Shin Tire, which sells automobile tires under the
brand name Maxxis in Taiwan, is one of the Taiwanese companies that
relocated their manufacturing operations to China the earliest. Cheng
Shin was the 56th-largest Taiwanese company in China in 2004 with
annual transactions there totaling 1.944 billion yuan. The company
ranked 9th among all Taiwanese companies in China last year in terms
of pre-tax net profit.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, business transactions of the 1,000
leading Taiwanese companies in China totaled some 733.6 billion yuan
(US$22.23 billion) in 2004, roughly equivalent to 25 percent of
Taiwan's gross domestic product in that year.</P>
      <P>CCIS conducted the survey via telephone and fax between February
and November this year and obtained 1,350 valid responses. It had a
margin of error of 2 percent.</P>

will try to do a good job as long as he remains premier, amid public
speculation that he might be replaced in an upcoming Cabinet
reshuffle.</P>
      <P>Hsieh offered to resign early this week in the wake of the ruling

      <P>In his speech, Hsieh said Taiwan's economy remains sound, with
export orders amounting to US$207.2 billion in the first 10 months of
this year, up 18.03 percent from the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>While the unemployment rate has fallen, foreign investors have
continued to invest in Taiwan's stock market and have made a lot of
money, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He expressed his disapproval of a plan by some legislators to
enact a law to control the interest rates on credit cards and cash
cards to below 10 percent.</P>
      <P>On cross-Taiwan Strait relations, he said that although a more

      <P>A Department of Health (DOH) official said
Thursday that there is still room for convenience store staff to
strengthen their techniques for refusing to sell cigarettes to
teenagers.</P>
      <P>Chao Kun-yu, deputy director-general of the DOH Bureau of Health
Promotion, made the remarks after inspecting a training program for
convenience store staff to improve their knowledge of the Tobacco
Hazard Control Act and to learn techniques for refusing to sell
cigarettes to people under the age of 18.</P>
      <P>Chao noted that the DOH has presented proposals for an amendment
to the Tobacco Hazard Control Act to the legislature for screening,
which will include some changes to the way stores are allowed to
exhibit their tobacco products.</P>
      <P>Once the proposals are approved by the legislature, stores will
be prohibited from showing their cigarettes in open shelves and
should carry anti-smoking warning signs in their stores.</P>
      <P>According to the existing Tobacco Hazard Control Act, people
under 18 are prohibited from smoking, while people who sell tobacco
products to teenagers under 18 can be fined between NT$3,000 (US$89)
and NT$10,000.</P>
      <P>The DOH statistics show that as of November, the number of
teenagers caught smoking had reached 2,976, while that of stores

    <HEADLINE>TUNA FISHING OPERATORS WANT NAME LIST PRODUCED BY 'FAIR' SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tuna fishing operators in the southern port
city of Kaohsiung called Thursday for a "fair and just" mechanism for
the selection of the 15 fishing vessels that will be allowed to
continue fishing for bigeye tuna in the Atlantic.</P>
      <P>Tuna boat operators made the appeal to the Fisheries
Administration under the Council of Agriculture and the Taiwan Tuna
Association as they are preparing to provide a list of names of
those allowed to continue operation to the International Commission
for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) by Dec. 20.</P>
      <P>They said they had asked the Fisheries Administration to
elaborate on the screening situation, but had yet to receive any
response, and expressed the hope that the fishery officials has no
preset name list, as this would be "very unfair."</P>
      <P>One tuna boat operator noted that a big tuna vessel can cost up
to NT$100 million (US$2.98 million) and that sometimes one fishing
company is only able to own one fishing vessel. If the vessel cannot
continue to operate, then the company faces closure.</P>
      <P>Tuna boat operators also complained about the amount of subsidies
to be provided by the government for more than 40 soon-to-be-grounded
fishing vessels.</P>
      <P>The COA decided to subsidize NT$5.97 million for each of the
Taiwanese fishing vessels currently operating in the Atlantic Ocean
but which will have to return to Taiwan after new catch quotas are
put into practice.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Tuna Association officials said the subsidies will in no
way make up for the losses caused by the quota cut.
</P>
      <P>Association officials estimated that fuel, loans and crew
salaries will cost more than NT$16 million, which is a far cry from
the subsidy promised by the government.</P>
      <P>The ICCAT decided last month to slash Taiwan's total allowable
catch of bigeye tuna for 2006 by almost 70 percent to 4,600 tons from
the 2005 quota of 14,900 tons, as a punishment for indiscriminate
overfishing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan presently has 76 deep-sea fishing vessels specializing in
catching bigeye tuna in the Atlantic. In the face of an almost 70
percent quota cut, only 15 of those vessels will be allowed to
operate in the Atlantic in the coming year. Twenty of the ships will
be used to fish for longfin tuna and the remaining 41 will be taken
out of operation.</P>
      <P>Fishery authorities estimated that the quota cut will cause a
loss of NT$1.92 billion in revenue per year, but the fishing industry
claim that the total losses could top NT$10 billion.</P>

      <P>Eating hot pot with family or friends is the
"in" thing again, with the mercury dropping sharply in Taiwan over
the past week, but doctors caution that not knowing how to eat hot
pot properly could cause a headache or high blood pressure.</P>
      <P>Ho Yi-chen, a doctor at the Department of Family Medicine at the

Thursday that eating hot pot and drinking ice water alternately
without at least a three-minute interval could cause the diner to
have a spasmodic pain in the head and elevate his blood pressure.</P>
      <P>He said he had recently treated a 30-year-old patient who
complained about these symptoms after he kept drinking ice water to

season when their problems could get worse.</P>
      <P>The doctor advised that it is important to keep the internal
organs warm during winter and that after eating a hot bowl of soup, a
diner should wait at lease three minutes before drinking anything
cold.</P>

pot, he should visit a doctor as soon as possible to find out if he

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite China's incessant attempts
to choke off Taiwan in the international community, Taiwan still has
the good faith to promote peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks while giving a keynote speech titled,
"Taiwanese efforts for Peace and Stability across the Strait" at a
seminar sponsored by the Washington-based Center for National Policy
-- a non-profit and non-partisan think tank devoted to the transfer
of ideas and information from experts to public officials.</P>
      <P>Saying that China is seeking to push Taiwan off the world stage
with missiles and checkbook diplomacy, Wu pointed out that this
Chinese mindset has stirred strong resentment among Taiwan people and
have seriously restricted cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Beijing should take concrete measures to reduce the hostilities
felt by the people in Taiwan, he urged.</P>
      <P>He claimed that China has often misinterpreted Taiwan's
democratization efforts as attempts to pursue de-jure independence,
and said that opinion polls have repeatedly showed that most of
Taiwan people are in favor of maintaining the cross-strait status quo
and would not like to change the country's official title, national
flag or territorial boundaries as stipulated in the Republic of China
Constitution.</P>
      <P>The government on Taiwan is also open to holding political talks
with China as long as the Taiwan people reach a consensus on allowing
it to do so, he said, adding that Taiwan would not rule out any forms
of political relations with China but that it can never accept
Beijing's "one China" precondition for opening bilateral talks, he
stressed.</P>
      <P>The MAC also thanked the United States for its long-standing

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's entrance into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in 2002 has been positive for the nation's
economy, and it has contributed 2.2 percent to Taiwan's per capita
income because of increased trade with other nations, an academic
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Tzeung-che, an associate researcher from the Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research, made the remarks at a seminar on
issues related to the upcoming WTO ministerial meeting in Hong Kong.
The seminar was presided over by Ko Cheng-en, president of the think
tank.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics has
estimated that the per capita income in Taiwan will be US$15,659 this
year.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that looking at the economic performance of Taiwan
between 2002 and 2004, it was better than predicted before joining
the WTO, with the gross domestic product (GDP) growth exceeding 3
percent, and the average growth of imports and exports registering
16.63 percent and 12.46 percent, respectively. The jobless rate was
more than 5 percent since 2002, but fell to 4.07 percent in October
this year.</P>
      <P>Though Taiwan's population in the agriculture sector was cut
slightly after entering the WTO, the production value of agriculture
has increased to NT$600,000 from NT$500,000 per capita due to
increased exports of rice and tea.</P>
      <P>In terms of individual sectors, Hsu said that the production
value of such sectors as automobiles, heavy electric and machinery as
well as electronics for local demand has grown, while export sectors
such as machinery, electronics and information as well as plastic
products have also grown.</P>
      <P>Motorcycles, textiles, garments, and food sectors are showing a

      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), said Thursday that the KMT has received no proposal
from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government to let the
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party (PFP)
nominate the next premier and form the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Asked to clarify media reports that the DPP has contacted
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, asking him to be the next
premier, Ma said that no one from the DPP government has approached
the KMT about the matter, and nor has the KMT made any request to the
DPP in this regard.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is also Taipei mayor, said the KMT position on the issue
is very clear: The KMT is willing to accept such a proposal if
President Chen Shui-bian abides by the Republic of China Constitution
and allows the government to operate under the "double-government
head" system.</P>
      <P>He explained that if the "pan-blue alliance" is to form the
Cabinet, the premier must be designated by the alliance rather than
by the president, who will only announce the appointment in his
capacity as head of state.</P>
      <P>Pressed again on whether Wang could become the next premier, Ma
said what has been said in news report are not necessarily true.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang told reporters that Lien Chan, honorary chairman
of the KMT, had queried him twice about the reported DPP proposal.</P>
      <P>However, Wang said, his reply to Lien was that no one from the
DPP has approached him, that he has no intention of serving as a
premier in the DPP government, and that he wants to continue to be

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  8  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou should make clear his stance on the country's sovereignty
and national security if he wants to be the country's leader in the
future, a high-ranking ROC official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), which
is responsible for Taiwan's policy toward China, made the remarks
after delivering a speech on Capital Hill about Taiwan's efforts in
promoting cross-Taiwan Strait peace at the invitation of the Center
for National Policy, a Washington-based organization dedicated to
policy debate on issues of U.S. national interest.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that many important political leaders in Taiwan have
stated that Taiwan is a sovereign country with its official name
being the "Republic of China, " and only the 23 million people of the
island have the right to decide whether to change the political
status of the country.</P>
      <P>Ma is considered by many to be a serious contender for the next
presidential race in 2008. However, Wu added, Ma still has not made
public his views on the issues related to Taiwan's sovereignty or
national security, which are of great concern to the U.S. government.</P>
      <P>It is natural that different political parties have different
views on internal affairs, but there should be a consensus within the
country regarding issues such as national security, Wu said. He
apparently was referring to the arms procurement package from the
United States that is still pending the approval of the legislature.</P>
      <P>The arms package, which includes eight diesel-electric
submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six
Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries from the United States, has
been blocked from being screened in the opposition-controlled
legislature.</P>
      <P>With the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) dismal
performance in last Saturday's city and county chief elections, many
are concerned that it will be harder for the arms package to pass the
legislature as the opposition "pan-blue alliance" will have a
stronger grip on the country's new political panorama.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the DPP government will continue communicating
with the opposition parties on the arms procurement budget.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RECORD HAUL OF COUNTERFEIT MEDICINES SEIZED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A big haul of counterfeit medicines -- more
than 550,000 capsules and pills with a street value of around NT$300
million (US$9.09 million) -- has been seized in Taipei County, the
Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The seized counterfeit medicines, including the well-known
weight-loss drug Reductil (Sibutramine) and drugs for the treatment
of erectile dysfunction -- Viagra and Cialis -- marked the largest
seizure of smuggled bootleg medicines in Taiwan in recent years, CIB
officials said. </P>
      <P>CIB investigators raided a warehouse in Hsichih, Taipei County
Wednesday night and seized the drugs, which included 50,000 tablets
of the anti-obesity medicine Reductil (Sibutramine), more than 50,000
tablets of Viagra, over 70,000 tablets of Cialis, more than 100,000
tablets of medicine for colds, 20,000 tablets of the gastrointestinal
medicine Zantac, 70,000 tablets of controlled hypnotics Stilnox, and
some 210,000 unknown pills.</P>
      <P>The investigators learned that the medicines were counterfeited
in China and smuggled into Taiwan in parcels mailed via either air
mail or sea mail.</P>
      <P>The police also learned that the drug smugglers have sold the
counterfeit medicines at lower-than-normal prices to local
pharmacies. For example, they said, a 30-tablet pack of Reductil,
worth NT$3,500 over the counter if authentic, was sold for only
NT$1,000.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Keng-feng, a suspect nabbed during the raid,
dealers of these counterfeit medicines have distributed the fake
drugs to pharmacies around northern Taiwan, adding that seven out of
every 10 pharmacies in northern Taiwan are believed to have sold
bootleg pharmaceuticals.</P>

Wall Street Journal: Storm Front, Local and
Federal Authorities Battle to Control Disaster
Relief

The power struggle that unfolded in Florida 
during Hurricane Wilma is shaping a debate 
about how the country should respond to 
disasters, both natural and man-made. The big 
question: Should state or federal authorities 
be in control of recovery efforts? Giving the 
debate more urgency are growing concerns about 
a possible flu outbreak and experts' warnings 
that next year's hurricane season may be even 
deadlier than this summer's record-breaking 
series. The Bush administration says Katrina
showed that some states can't deal with
large-scale disasters. The Department of
Homeland Security, which oversees the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, wants to intervene
in response efforts and is pressing local
officials to vet their emergency plans. It's
also looking to equip locally based federal
employees with cameras and communications gear
to provide Washington with real-time disaster
information.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. SHOULD RECONSIDER 'ONE CHINA' POLICY: TKACIK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. government's "one China" policy is
a failure and the U.S. should reconsider it by having a clear outline
of what it wants East Asia to be in the coming decades, John Tkacik,
a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said in Taipei
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tkacik, a keen observer on issues concerning Taiwan, China and
Mongolia, had a book published Dec. 8 entitled, "Rethinking 'One
China,'" aimed at reminding the U.S. government to reshape its policy
towards Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The words 'one China' are very easily misunderstood by people
who see them. They might think that the U.S. government supports the
'reunification' of China and that Taiwan is part of China, " Tkacik
said.</P>
      <P>Tkacik considers the "one China" policy a failed one because it
is exactly the opposite of the abbreviated name that is used to
describe it.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. government should clearly explain what 'one China ' is
about. The U.S. should recognize the fact that Taiwan is practically
a nation, and Taiwan must have a clear idea of the path it wants to
take," he said.</P>
      <P>Tkacik said that both the U.S. and Taiwan should be stronger in
their policy-making, and the U.S. must have a clearer idea on what it
wants East Asia to be in the coming decades.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. government should make sure what its interests are in
Taiwan. It should also clearly define Taiwan's status as to
international law. The bureaucracy should consider overall long term
interests in East Asia and make sure about its policy toward Taiwan,
and promote those interests," Tkacik said.</P>
      <P>"If the U.S. doesn't have a policy compass, then every way could
be the way. It has to make a decision on what it wants Asia to be. If
it does nothing, then I guarantee that Asia will soon be dominated by
authoritarian China. At that time, the U.S. might lose control of
Asia," Tkacik said.</P>
      <P>According to the senior research fellow, Capitol Hill thinks that
China is an increasing challenge to the U.S. in terms of economy,
trade, military, finance and politics.</P>
      <P>"Although the U.S. doesn't support Taiwan declaring independence,
it didn't say it opposes it. Following the 1972 Shanghai Comunique,
the U.S. government did not recognize Taiwan as part of China, "
Tkacik said.</P>
      <P>According to Tkacik, Taiwan is the U.S.'s 10th-largest trading
partner. If Taiwan were under China, the two countries obviously
could not go on with their trade and business, he said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan declaring independence cannot be a reason for war because
it would just be words on paper. It will bring no change to the
situation because very few countries in the world recognize Taiwan as
an independent nation," Tkacik said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOI TO SET UP CAMPAIGN AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, CHILD ABUSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 8 (CNA)

      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) will set
up a special task force to deal with issues regarding domestic
violence and child abuse, a senior official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the official, Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyuan
made the announcement at an MOI department chiefs meeting a day
earlier on prevention of domestic violence and child abuse.</P>
      <P>Su said MOI Vice Minister Lin Chung-sen will serve as convener of
the soon-to-be-formed task force to better cope with domestic
violence and child abuse issues.</P>
      <P>The special task force will invite police, civil affairs
officials, social workers, educators and public health experts to a
brainstorming meeting to discuss effective strategies to rescue
domestic violence victims and abused children, Su said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Su said, the task force will craft a viable
mechanism to encourage reporting of cases involving domestic violence
and child abuse.</P>
      <P>"We should consider cash incentives to encourage reporting of
those cases. It would be worthwhile so long as we can save more young
lives and their childhoods," Su said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su said, the MOI will direct city/county governments
to push for formation of more civic groups to help with reporting of
child abuse and domestic violence cases.</P>
      <P>According to MOI tallies, 7,800 cases involving child/adolescent
abuse were reported in 2004 and as of the end of September this year,
7,500 such cases had already been reported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO KIDD-CLASS DESTROYERS ARRIVE AT  SUAO NAVAL BASE FROM THE U.S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two of the four Kidd-class destroyers that
Taiwan purchased from the United States in 2003 arrived at the
northeastern military base of Suao Thursday.</P>
      <P>Republic of China Navy Commander-in-Chief Adm. Chen Pang-chih
directed the whole port-entrance maneuvering of the two destroyers,
named the Keelung and the Suao, which were delivered to the ROC Navy
Oct. 29 from a shipyard in Charleston, South Carolina.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is expected to travel to Suao in
mid-December to officiate at a ceremony marking the commissioning of
the two destroyers in his capacity as the commander-in-chief of the
ROC armed forces.</P>
      <P>Navy officers and seed instructors, as well as repair and
maintenance technicians have received training in the United States
to prepare for the delivery of the two de-mothballed destroyers,
which have also undergone sea trials and weaponry systems tests over
the past month, the navy authorities said.</P>
      <P>The other two destroyers are expected by March 2007.</P>
      <P>Taiwan purchased the four then-mothballed destroyers, built in
the late 1970s, at a cost of NT$24 billion (US$0.73 billion) in June
2003.</P>
      <P>The navy authorities said that after the two Kidd-class
destroyers are commissioned, they will form the outer periphery of a
naval defensive fleet, while the Perry-class, Knox-class and
Lafayette-class frigates will play an inner circle role.</P>
      <P>The Kidd-class destroyers will target enemy planes that have
fired missiles, allowing other vessels to deal with the incoming
missiles, they said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan submitted a shopping list in 2001 that included
top-of-the-line U.S. destroyers of the Arleigh Burke-class equipped
with the Aegis radar system, but the Bush administration later
approved the sale of only the much older Kidd-class destroyers.</P>
      <P>The purchase was embroiled in a fierce debate. Opponents of the
purchase included members of the legislature's powerful defense
committee, which made several attempts to block the sale. Critics
cited the age of the ships and their high cost and suggested that
Taiwan should push the U.S. to release the Aegis system sooner.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ENVOY EXPRESSES THE HOPE THAT ROC PREMIER CAN VISIT FRANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Dec.  8 (CNA)
(By Lo Yuan-shao and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Representative to France
Yang Tzu-pao on Thursday expressed the hope that France can also
welcome a visit by the ROC's premier as it did to Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao.</P>
      <P>Yang made the remarks in response to French reporters' questions
about his opinion regarding Wen's recent visit to France, in which
the Chinese premier placed orders for 150 Airbus jets. France was the
first leg of Wen's European trip.</P>
      <P>Yang welcomed China's purchase of Airbus planes, saying that at
least they are not buying missiles.</P>
      <P>Noting that it is a good thing that China intends to join and
participate in the international community, Yang said that the latter
should allow China to understand that being a superpower comes with
many responsibilities, such as environmental protection and treating
other Asian countries well, including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yang also said he hopes that while welcoming Wen's visit, the
French government can also extend an invitation to the ROC's premier
for a visit.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan and France do not have diplomatic relations, most ROC
officials' France visits are private in nature..</P>
      <P>ROC Minister of Transportation and Communications Lin Ling-san
managed to visit Toulouse, headquarters of Airbus, in June to
participate in the delivery ceremony of the fourth of eight A330-300s
that China Airlines (CAL) ordered from the airplane giant in his
capacity as CAL chairman; Lin later visited his French counterpart in
Paris, while the ROC foreign minister, Tan Sun Chen, was allowed to

    <TEXT>
      <P>Investigation by any civic group into the
corruption scandal involving the Kaohsiung rapid transit railway
project would be in vain because its members do not have the
necessary power under the current law, a university professor said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chai Song-lin, professor at National Chengchi University, said in
a statement that without legal authorization to do the job, a civic
team is unlikely to achieve results in the investigation.</P>
      <P>Chai is one of five civic leaders recommended by Premier Frank
Hsien as possible members of a team to investigate whether he played
a role in the corruption scandal while he was Kaohsiung mayor before
becoming premier.</P>
      <P>Other would-be members Hsieh suggested include lawyers C.V. Chen
and Wang Ching-feng, both respected for their integrity.</P>
      <P>Chai said that even if the named civic team does manage to
unearth some truths, the findings may not be accepted by all sectors,
because society in Taiwan is divided and people of different
political persuasions do not trust each other.</P>
      <P>The premier's proposal to form a civic team to conduct
no-holds-barred investigations on whether he profited from the
construction project, whether he violated the law while serving as
Kaohsiung mayor, and whether he condoned any unlawful practices
during his mayorship, is seen as a move to clear the shadow over his
name and consolidate his position as premier after the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party government suffered a humiliating defeat
in the Dec. 3 local government elections.</P>

      <P>Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu
Shyi-kun is "carefully assessing" whether to run for the chairmanship

later in the day.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang stepped down after the party was
soundly defeated by the opposition Kuomintang in the Dec. 3
"three-in-one" local elections.</P>

its members.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, several DPP legislators have advised Yu

TWO KIDD-CLASS DESTROYERS ARRIVE AT SUAO NAVAL BASE FROM THE U.S.

Taipei, Dec. 8 (CNA) Two of the four Kidd-class destroyers that
Taiwan purchased from the United States in 2003 arrived at the
northeastern military base of Suao Thursday.

Republic of China Navy Commander-in-Chief Adm. Chen Pang-chih
directed the whole port-entrance maneuvering of the two destroyers,
named the Keelung and the Suao, which were delivered to the ROC Navy
Oct. 29 from a shipyard in Charleston, South Carolina.

President Chen Shui-bian is expected to travel to Suao in
mid-December to officiate at a ceremony marking the commissioning of
the two destroyers in his capacity as the commander-in-chief of the
ROC armed forces.

Navy officers and seed instructors, as well as repair and
maintenance technicians have received training in the United States
to prepare for the delivery of the two de-mothballed destroyers,
which have also undergone sea trials and weaponry systems tests over
the past month, the navy authorities said.

The other two destroyers are expected to be delivered by the end
of 2006.

Taiwan purchased the four then-mothballed destroyers, built in
the late 1970s, at a cost of NT$24 billion (US$0.73 billion) in June
2003.

The navy authorities said that after the two Kidd-class
destroyers are commissioned, they will form the outer periphery of a
naval defensive fleet, while the Perry-class, Knox-class and
Lafayette-class frigates will play an inner circle role.

The Kidd-class destroyers will target enemy planes that have

Taiwan submitted a shopping list in 2001 that included

    <TEXT>
      <P>The three-day selection of members of the
National Communications Commission (NCC) began Friday with the
reviewing process being opened to the public.</P>
      <P>Eleven members of the NCC Member Review Committee -- named by
parties across Taiwan's political spectrum -- began Friday to
interview 18 candidates -- recommended by political parties and the
Executive Yuan -- for future nomination to become NCC members.</P>
      <P>The 11 interviewers are expected to vote on the last day of the
review on the 18 candidates, 13 of whom will become NCC members.</P>
      <P>The final list of successful candidates will be sent to the
Executive Yuan for nomination by the premier and then to the
Legislature for approval.</P>
      <P>To be successful, nominees must win more than 60 percent of the
review committee ballots. If fewer than 13 pass that threshold in the
first round of balloting, a second vote will be held to choose those
who get more than half of the votes.</P>
      <P>People interested in watching the question-and-answer sessions
can do so on close-circuit camera in a room adjoining the hearing
room.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of
the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP), who sponsored
the NCC organization bill, expressed the hope last month that the NCC
could be inaugurated Jan. 1, 2006.</P>
      <P>The opposition lawmakers made the call Nov. 10, one day after
President Chen Shui-bian promulgated the bill into law. The KMT and
PFP lawmakers have touted the enactment as a milestone in the
country's history, claiming that it offers the best guarantee of
freedom of the press.</P>
      <P>Under the NCC law, 15 members will be nominated by the
legislature according to the share of seats held by each political
party, and the Executive Yuan will recommend three. The commission's
13 members will then be selected from among the 18 nominees by an
11-member review committee, all of them professional experts and
scholars recommended by political parties based on proportional
representation, through open votes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION REGRESSES IN 2005: SURVEY</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's overall human rights situation has
regressed in 2005, with the judiciary being the only area that meets
the benchmark, according to the results of a survey released Friday
by the Chinese Association for Human Rights (CAHR).</P>
      <P>The survey measured the human rights situation in a total of 10
areas on a five-point scale, with a score of three points or above
representing a passing grade.</P>
      <P>The judiciary received a score of 3.12 points, the economy 2.91
points, culture and education 2.87, politics 2.81, and treatment of
senior citizens 2.86 points, of women 2.78, of children 2.66, of the
physically and mentally challenged 2.62, the environment 2.51 and
workers 2.41, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>CAHR President Lee Yung-jang said the judiciary got the top score
because the judicial reforms carried out by the government have won
widespread public approval.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the score for treatment of workers was so low
because the government has failed to strictly enforce labor
protection regulations and because local employers tend to dismiss
workers arbitrarily without offering them reasonable compensation,
Lee said.</P>
      <P>He said the unstable economy in Taiwan and the government's
failure to handle the human rights issue positively have caused the
country's overall human rights situation to regress compared with
that of last year.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Environmental Protection Union

installation of electromagnetic-radioactive facilities near schools
and residences.</P>
      <P>According to TEPU Chairwoman Chen Shu-hua, long-time exposure to
electromagnetic radiation can reduce human immunity and lead to
cancer.</P>
      <P>Inspections conducted by the TEPU recently in more than 10 local
schools show that electromagnetic radiation is excessively high in
many of these schools because they are located near high-voltage
electrical transmission towers, Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>In addition to keeping electromagnetic radiation away from
schools and residences, the government should also require electrical
appliance manufacturers to label the electromagnetic radiation
emission levels of their products, Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JUSTICE MINISTRY TO REVIEW NT$30 GIFTS AS VOTE-BUYING REGULATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ministry of Justice (MOJ) will review
the regulation which stipulates that the distribution of gifts worth
more than NT$30 (US$0.89) during election campaign constitutes
vote-buying, Justice Minister Shih Mao-lin said Friday.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks when he and Wu Ying-chao, state public
prosecutor-general, were invited by the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union's legislative caucus to report on the crackdown on vote-buying
in last Saturday's "three-in-one" elections.</P>
      <P>Shih said that whether the feting of campaign staff, as well as
the caps or other souvenirs distributed by candidates, constitute
vote-buying should be reviewed.</P>
      <P>The ministry will take stock of the approach of Japan in
reviewing the regulation and add it to the Election and Recall Law,
Shih said.</P>
      <P>Chen Ding-nan, the vanquished candidate for Ilan county
magistrate in the just concluded elections, set the strict regulation
that any gifts worth more than NT$30 are regarded as vote-buying when
he was justice minister in 2001.</P>
      <P>When Chen set NT$30 as the threshold, even some with the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party said the amount set would become a
"joke."</P>
      <P>But the strict regulations seemed to backfire during Chen's own 
campaign when he was questioned for feting voters, although throwing
lavish banquets for constituents during election campaigns are seen
as common practice in Taiwan elections.</P>
      <P>Shih said that since a crackdown on vote-buying was launched in
June, local district courts have handled 13,161 alleged bribery
cases. Prosecutors had indicted 22 people involved in the city and
county chief elections, 554 people involved in the city and county
councilor elections, and 564 people involved in the village and
township elections as of Thursday.</P>
      <P>During the legislative elections at the end of last year,
prosecutors indicted 835 people, and the result this year should be
better than the previous year, he said.</P>
      <P>Wu said prosecutors will make indictments as long as there is
solid evidence, and that this year, they have made progress in the
most thorny parts -- vote-buying with cash or candidates directly
involved in bribery.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that 43 candidates for village and townships were
prosecuted, while 69 candidates for city and county councilors were
also indicted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERNATIONAL EVALUATIONS SHOW TAIWAN CORRUPTION WORSENING: KMT HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Nov.  9 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou cited foreign evaluation reports Friday showing that
corruption in Taiwan has worsened since the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) came to power in 2000.</P>
      <P>He said Transparency International published its first annual
evaluation report when he was justice minister, ranking Taiwan 25th
in terms of government integrity.</P>
      <P>In 1996, when he quit the ministerial post, Taiwan's ranking
slipped to 29th. After 2000, when the DPP came to power, Taiwan's
rankings have ranged between 32nd and 35th, an indication that
corruption has worsened, he said.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is also mayor of Taipei, told a city government seminar
that Hong Kong's Political and Economic Risk Consultancy has also
raised Taiwan's "corruption ranking" from 9th in March to 7th in
December, basing its rankings on observations by foreign business
communities in 12 countries and areas in Asia.</P>
      <P>Ma said he cited the foreign evaluations not to criticize the
central government but to check the city government he leads, which
is "part of the government." He also expressed hope that foreign
businessmen can gain a better understanding of government
transparency and the business environment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that when he was justice minister, he set a rule banning
officials from taking gifts, being treated or lobbying for special
interest groups. A gift worth more than NT$3,000 must be returned,
and no more than NT$5,000 in gifts can be accepted in a year.</P>
      <P>The rule was forwarded to the Executive Yuan under the
then-ruling KMT, which ignored it on the grounds that it was
"impractical," he noted.</P>
      <P>Although the central government refused to accept his
recommendation, he took the rule to the Taipei city government when
he took over as mayor.</P>
      <P>He said corruption was rampant in other Chinese societies like
Hong Kong and Singapore before they set up the Independent Commission
Against Corruption (ICAC) and Corruption Practices Investigation
Bureau (CPIB), respectively.</P>
      <P>The situation in those two societies have "entirely changed, "
because they were "dead serious about fighting corruption," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He said that in his city government, six principles were adopted
to fight corruption -- uncovering such practices, handling them
decisively, cooperating with judicial authorities in investigations,
making public all investigation results, not fearing opening up the
cupboard, and never being lenient toward "our own guys."</P>
      <P>All these steps, plus good pay scales and strict laws and rules,
are aimed at preventing graft and other illegal profit-taking
practices so that the government can keep the greatest asset it can
have with the people -- trust, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CERN TO HELP BUILD ASIA'S 1ST COMPUTING GRID CENTER IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica, Taiwan's top research
institute, will cooperate with the European Organization for Nuclear
Research (CERN) to build a Large Hadron Collider (LHC) computing grid
maintenance center in Taiwan that will be the first of its kind in
all Asia.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tse and CERN Deputy Director
Jos Engelen jointly signed a memorandum Friday on the establishment
of a Tier-1 LHC computing grid maintenance center to be located in
Academia Sinica's Institute of Physics.</P>
      <P>CERN is the world's largest particle physics laboratory and the
LHC Computing Grid Project is CERN's flagship project. The LHC,
currently being built at CERN near Geneva, is the largest scientific
instrument on the planet. When it begins operations in 2007, it will
produce roughly 15 petabytes (15 million gigabytes) of data annually,
which thousands of scientists around the world will be able to access
and analyse.</P>
      <P>The mission of the LHC Computing Grid Project (LCG) is to build
and maintain a data storage and analysis infrastructure for the
entire high energy physics community that will use the LHC.</P>
      <P>The LHC is a particle accelerator which will probe deeper into
matter than ever before. Due to be switched on in 2007, it will
ultimately collide beams of protons at an energy of 14 TeV. Beams of
lead nuclei will be also accelerated, smashing together with a
collision energy of 1150 TeV.</P>
      <P>A TeV is a unit of energy used in particle physics. 1 TeV is
about the energy of motion of a flying mosquito. What makes the LHC
so extraordinary is that it squeezes that energy into a space about a
million million times smaller than a mosquito.</P>
      <P>Once Taiwan's Tier-1 LHC computing grid maintenance center is
established, it will ally with 10 other Tier-1 centers around the
world to share and integrate resources and provide services in the
high energy physics field. The 10 other Tier-1 centers include
Canada's TRIUMF, France's CC-IN2P3, Germany's GridKa, Italy's CNAF,
the Netherland's NIKHEF/SARA, Spain's PIC, Britain's RAL, the United
States' BNL and FNAL, as well as the NDGF in Scandinavia.</P>
      <P>In addition, Academia Sinica is also joining five other centers,
including CC-IN2P3, CNAF and RAL, to be jointly responsible for
consultation services of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) ,
which is a sub project under the LHC Project.</P>
      <P>According to S.P. Li, director of the Academia Sinica Institute
of Physics, CERN began in 2001 to integrate computing resources from
around the world to boost the computing regime of high energy
physics.</P>
      <P>In the future, the functions of the Tier-1 LHC computing grid
maintenance centers worldwide can be further strengthened under the
Enabling Grid for E-science (EGEE) project so as to expand computing
capabilities to other fields such as digital storage, atmospheric
sciences and biological information, Li said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER URGES UNITY FOR VICTORY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday that the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) must address the "Ma
Ying-jeou phenomenon" squarely, saying that only unity will give the
party a chance of winning.</P>
      <P>The premier was referring to main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
chairman Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who led the party to a resounding
victory in the just-concluded local elections, grabbing 14 out of 23
seats up for grabs in the city and county chief elections, compared
with the dismal six seats taken by the DPP.</P>
      <P>The premier, in his first remarks about the DPP debacle, said
that after Ma took the helm of the party in August, the KMT has
integrated smoothly with its ally the People First Party, and
that those who identity with the party have also increased in number.</P>
      <P>This was a major reason why the KMT fared so well in the
elections, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He said that the leadership of the DPP should realize the "Ma
Ying-jeou phenomenon."</P>
      <P>He said there should not be too much strife within the party,
adding that "one does not necessarily win if there is unity, but one
will definitely lose if there is no unity."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's semiconductor sector is expected to
post a growth rate of 10.1 percent in 2006 compared with the 1.5
percent in 2005, thanks to increased demand, the Industrial
Technology Research Institute (ITRI) forecast Friday.</P>
      <P>Tan Yu-hua, an analyst at the ITRI's Industrial Economics and
Knowledge Center (IEK) , pointed out that sales in Asia's
semiconductor sector amounted to US$27.3 billion in the third quarter
of this year, up 12.1 percent from the previous quarter and up 16.9
percent from the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the production value of the semiconductor sector rose
18.3 percent from the second quarter to NT$292.5 billion in the third
quarter, while the output is expected to further increase 15.4
percent to NT$337.6 billion in the fourth quarter owing to robust
seasonal demand, Tan said.</P>
      <P>On the packaging and testing industry, Tan said the climate of
the industry is improving, with major packaging and testing companies
posting significantly better sales in the third quarter compared with
the previous quarter.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the IC design industry is likely to register a growth
rate of 19.5 percent in the fourth quarter, Tan said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hsu Chin-hsiang, a Kinmen Red Cross
volunteer, has been elected this year's "Good Samaritan" for his
long-time contributions to the needy in Kinmen, China and Taiwan and
will be awarded a Pa-Teh (Eight Virtues) medal in Taipei Dec. 12.</P>
      <P>Before his departure for Taiwan, Fujian Provincial Governor Yen
Chung-cheng and Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng received Hsu
Friday and presented him with money to cover his travel expenses.</P>
      <P>They said Hsu's humanitarian services have been a big plus in
promoting cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Hsu is a founding member of the Kinmen Red Cross Society, which
was established in 1990. He has been hired as its secretary general
while retaining the title of volunteer.</P>
      <P>Over the years, he has helped 579 Chinese in 48 groups return
safely to China after they had been caught smuggling, poaching fish,
or engaging in other illegal activities by the Taiwan authorities.</P>
      <P>He has also helped form emergency medical teams in China, Kinmen
and Taiwan so that Taiwan businessmen or travelers with urgent
medical needs could receive proper medical attention or return to
Taiwan to be hospitalized.</P>
      <P>For that work, Hsu often has to visit Xiamen, just across the
Taiwan Strait from Kinmen. Many family members and relatives of
Taiwan businessmen and visitors are grateful for his assistance.</P>
      <P>In Kinmen, he has organized volunteer groups trained to give home
care to lonely seniors or disabled people. Other groups are dedicated
to comforting and encouraging prisoners.</P>
      <P>When the Kinmen Blood Donation Center was established in 1994,
Hsu drafted a project to gather donated blood every three months and
he has since been the first to donate blood whenever such activities
have been staged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRO-INDEPENDENCE DPP STALWART TO RUN FOR PARTY CHAIRMANSHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Legislator Trong Chai announced Friday his intention to enter the
race for the DPP chairman position.</P>
      <P>In a written statement, Chai, a pro-independence DPP stalwart,
said that it is his mission to enter the chairmanship race to
"safeguard the DPP's founding causes and ensure that the DPP will
continue to be in power after 2008."</P>
      <P>Noting that he will enter the chairmanship race to "call the
people back and let Taiwan's identity stand tall, " Chai attributed
the DPP's debacle in the "three-in-one" elections last week to
political fallout from a series corruption scandals and the DPP's
failure to champion Taiwan's identity.</P>
      <P>Chai touted his superb "organizational ability," claiming that if
he is elected DPP chairman, he will be able to win back some 600,000
former DPP supporters who turned from the party in the just-concluded
elections.</P>
      <P>DPP sources said recently that the party will elect a new
chairman in January at the earliest, as Chairman Su Tseng-chang, who
assumed the post in February this year, stepped down after the
party's crushing defeat in the Dec. 3 city and county elections. The
DPP managed to take only six seats out of 23 up for grabs, compared
with 14 seats taken by the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP charter, if the incumbent president is a DPP
member, he should concurrently serve as party chairman, but President
Chen Shui-bian resigned from his post as party head in the wake of
the party's lackluster performance in the legislative elections of
late 2004.</P>
      <P>There have also been rumors that Vice President Annette Lu,
Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun and former DPP
Legislator Luo Wen-jia, who lost the Taipei county chief election,
are also interested in entering the DPP chairmanship race.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will defend its interests by asking
for more flexibility in lowering its tariffs for various products in
the forthcoming World Trade Organization ministerial meeting in Hong
Kong, Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh said Friday.</P>
      <P>In a news conference called to unveil the government's position
on the meeting which is slated to open in Hong Kong Dec. 13, Ho said
Taiwan adopts an aggressive opening strategy in the field of
non-agricultural products and will call for the adoption by the WTO
of a formula under which the higher tariffs a member state employs,
the deeper cut in tariffs they should take.</P>
      <P>Ho said Taiwan will lower its tariffs in return for easier access
to the markets of the United States, Europe, China, Southeast Asia,
India and Brazil.</P>
      <P>As a result, Ho said, tariffs on products the country can produce
at competitive cost, such as musical instruments, dyes, hand tools,
sportsware, watches and jewelry will be lowered to zero.</P>
      <P>As to the agricultural and fishery products in which Taiwan has
difficulty competing with foreign imports, the minister said Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>SPECIAL FACILITY SET UP FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A national center for suicide prevention was
inaugurated Friday as part of the government's efforts to curb the
increasing suicide rate in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by the Rheumatology Association
(RA) under the commission of the Department of Health (DOH), around 7
percent of Taiwan residents aged above 17 who responded to the poll
said they had considered suicide.</P>
      <P>A total of 8,835 households around the country apart from the
outlying islands were interviewed for the survey over the course of
the past year. The results show that around 1.7 percent of the
respondents had thought of committing suicide in the past year, some
0.3 percent had planned to take their own lives, and about 0.2
percent had attempted to kill or injure themselves.</P>
      <P>The ongoing survey will be completed by next spring.</P>
      <P>Lee Ming-pin, the RA chairman who doubles as director of the new
facility, said the survey shows there are more female respondents
than male who had thought, planned, or attempted to commit suicide,
and that there's a trend of decline in the age of the people who have
thought about or tried to end their own lives.</P>
      <P>Lee suggested humanitarian efforts be made to find out the
reasons for the findings.</P>
      <P>He announced the opening of the new center for suicide prevention
with DOH Minister Hou Sheng-mao, National Taiwan University Hospital
President Lin Fang-yu, United Microelectronics Corp. Chairman Robert
Tsao, and Taiwan Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation Chairman
Hsieh Po-sheng. The inauguration ceremony was also attended by many
representatives of the political, medical and entertainment sectors.</P>
      <P>Suicide ranked ninth in Taiwan's top 10 causes of death last
year, with over 3,000 people taking their own lives. This year, the
suicides of comedian Ni Min-jan and noted psychiatrist Chen Kuo-hua
shook society, prompting the DOH to take more action to control

    <HEADLINE>KMT-PFP MERGER NOT LINKED TO TAIPEI MAYORAL RACE: PFP LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A planned merger between the opposition
People First Party (PFP) and the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
will not be linked to the Taipei mayoral election slated for next
year, PFP lawmaker Sun Ta-chien said Friday.</P>
      <P>Sun, one of a five-member task force of PFP lawmakers in charge
of holding merger talks with the KMT, said that they made it clear
during a meeting with KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou a day earlier that
the merger issue should not be linked to the election.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong has never revealed his intention that he
might run for Taipei mayor in 2006 and there should not be
speculation over the issue, Sun said. Some newspapers have reported
that the PFP lawmakers told Ma in the meeting that Soong would like
to take part in the 2006 Taipei mayoral election in accordance with
the model on which Ma participated in the race in 1998, he explained.</P>
      <P>But Ma was reported as replying that the so-called "Ma model"
refers to a negotiation mechanism within the party prior to resorting
to party primaries, rather than croynism.</P>
      <P>According to Sun, they made the PFP stance clear to Ma that the
two issues should be dealt with separately, and that no one mentioned
job exchanges during the meeting.</P>
      <P>Calls from opposition "pan blue alliance" supporters have been
mounting for the two parties to merge after the Dec. 3 local
government elections, in which the KMT overwhelmed the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) . The PFP gained only 1.1 percent
of the popular vote, prompting deep concern over its possible
disappearance from Taiwan's political map.</P>
      <P>In response to high public expectations, the five-member PFP task
force visited Ma for merger talks Thursday -- a sign that the two
parties in the "pan blue alliance" have accelerated their pace of
moving toward a merger.</P>
      <P>The two parties have initially come to an agreement that they
will jointly iron out a negotiation mechanism for nominating
candidates to run for all levels of public office by the end of
January next year, including the Taipei and Kaohsiung mayor
positions, before achieving a full merger by 2007.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, PFP spokesman Hsieh Kung-ping thanked Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng for his concern about the rights and interests
of PFP members in the KMT after the two parties have fully merged.</P>
      <P>During a meeting Friday, Wang told Ma that the KMT-PFP merger
must be carried out with mutual respect and on an equal footing, and
he reminded Ma that the newly merged party may have to elect a new
leader in the future.</P>
      <P>While some PFP lawmakers contended that a new KMT leader should
be produced in line with the party's platform, others were reluctant
to comment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SHOULD ENACT SPECIAL LAW FOR DEALING WITH TAIWAN: KMT HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong Kong, Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By M.N. Wang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou urged Beijing during a recent interview with
Yazhou Zhoukan to enact a special law to deal with the delicate
cross-Taiwan Strait ties.</P>
      <P>In the weekly's latest edition to be issued this weekend, Ma said
that Beijing should draw up a law similar to Taiwan's Statute
Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area to handle cross-strait affairs in view of the lack of
government-to-government contacts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Saying that he favors the "1992 consensus that allows respective
interpretations of the one China" model -- a tacit agreement vaguely
reached by officials from the two sides in 1992 in Hong Kong -- to
explain Taiwan's sovereignty in its relations with China, Ma pointed
out, however, that Taiwan and Beijing differ a lot in their
interpretations of the meaning of the so-called "one China."</P>
      <P>In line with the Republic of China Constitution, "one China"
refers to the ROC, he said, noting that Taiwan cannot accept
Beijing's insistence that "one China" means the People's Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>Now that there is no way to resolve the dispute at present,
Taiwan and China should put aside the "one China" controversy, and
what counts now is that the two sides should further bolster
bilateral cultural and economic exchanges, he said.</P>
      <P>The KMT does not favor a permanent split between the two sides of
the strait, neither it is the time for discussions on unification, he
said.</P>
      <P>Ma hailed former KMT Chairman Lien Chan's efforts in advocating a
"cross-strait common market" proposal during a landmark visit to
mainland China in spring this year, and he claimed that he was
surprised that Lien and Communist Party of China General Secretary Hu
Jintao were able to forge a common perspective in this regard.</P>
      <P>The "cross-strait common market" goal should be well underpinned
by a solid base, such as a closer economic partnership arrangement
(CEPA) or a free trade agreement (FTA), upon which to build, he said.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Lien brought back a lot of assets to Taiwan from
mainland China, the KMT incumbent chairman said he is in no rush to
visit the Chinese mainland for the time being. Instead, he called for
creating positive conditions by both sides to expand two-way
exchanges, which he said is the top priority at the present stage.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing does not recognize Taiwan as an independent
country, he pointed out, it is an undeniable fact that there is an
independent government in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIN APOLOGIZES TO TAICHUNG MAYOR FOR DISCLOSING HIS MEDICAL RECORDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The doctor who played a leading role in
disclosing Taichung Mayor Jason Hu's medical records in an attempt to
diminish his chances of re-election in the Dec. 3 local elections
formally apologized to Hu at a news conference Friday and wished him
"increasingly good health."</P>
      <P>Bowing apparently to mounting pressure and condemnation from all
sectors for his lack of ethics, Peter Lin, a legislator of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), drove from Taipei to the central
Taiwan city of Taichung after failing to reach Hu on the phone.</P>
      <P>At the news conference, Hu shook Lin's hand warmly and accepted
his apology in a congenial mood.</P>
      <P>However, Lin continued to dodge media queries on who provided him
with Hu's medical records. Pressed again by reporters after the news
conference, he said the records were mailed to his office by an
undisclosed source, and that disclosing the information was purely
his personal behavior.</P>
      <P>Some participants in Thursday's TV call-in programs urged the
Cabinet's Taichung office and the National Security Council to
clarify whether they played a part in obtaining Hu's medical records
from the Taichung Veterans General Hospital.</P>
      <P>The dispute arose after the DPP legislator and 11 other doctors
appeared at a news conference in Taichung prior to the Dec. 3
elections and released what they claimed was Hu's medical history,
insisting that he could be paralyzed by a stroke in the next two
years and therefore was unfit to serve a second term.</P>
      <P>In a Dec. 7 ruling, the Medical Disciplinary Committee under the
Taichung city government's health authority meted out varying
penalties to the 12 doctors, with Lin receiving the harshest
punishment of revocation for one year of his license to practice. He
can appeal his case within 20 days to the Department of Health under
the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>In their initial reactions to the ruling, all but one of the 12
doctors remained defiant. Their attitudes again met strong criticism
from medical circles, the DPP and the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Breaking his silence on the issue, Chen Ding-shinn, dean of the
National Taiwan University College of Medicine, said categorically
Friday that doctors should not disclose the medical records of any
patient under any circumstances, and that the incident shows that
education on medical ethics in Taiwan needs to be strengthened.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wang Shih-chien was more blunt and said he wanted
the 11 unrepentant doctors to stop talking nonsense and accept the
ruling if they had any conscience left.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu, who had just taken over as DPP party
chairwoman, also said it was extremely inappropriate to disclose
someone's medical records, and that she deeply regretted the conduct
of the doctors.</P>
      <P>Lu said the DPP Central Standing Committee will discuss the issue
in its Dec. 14 meeting and decide whether Lin should be referred to
the party's Central Advisory Committee for disciplinary measures.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislature approved a government
proposal Friday to remove tariffs on 141 products imported from
Afghanistan and 49 other less-developed countries.</P>
      <P>The move responds to a World Trade Organization resolution
adopted at the Doha Round of ministerial talks calling for duty free
treatment for products exported by less-developed countries.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan said the WTO follows the definition of the
United Nations of less-developed countries -- those whose per capital
GDP over the past three years averaged less than US$750, that are
short of human resources, or have a fragile economy.</P>
      <P>Under the new rule, which passed the Legislative Yuan in a second
reading, imports from Angola, Bangladesh, the Republic of Benin,
Bhutan, Burkina Faso, the Republic of Burundi, Cambodia, the Republic
of Cape Verde, Central Africa, Chad, the Union of the Camoros, Congo,
the Republic of Djiboudi, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea and
others will enjoy import duty free treatment.</P>
      <P>These others are Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, the Republic of

    <HEADLINE>AIR LINKS IMPORTANT TO TOURISM BOOM: CEPD CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Convenient air links are vital to the
government's bid to boost Taiwan tourism if the country wants to sell
its tourist spots to the world, Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng said Friday.</P>
      <P>Pointing to South Korea as an example, Hu said that Seoul has
direct flights to more than 100 cities around the world and that this
is the major reason behind South Korea's booming tourism.</P>
      <P>Taiwan needs to build a more convenient air transport network to
bring in more foreign visitors, Hu stressed, noting that the number
of Austrian tourists to Taiwan has more than doubled after direct
flights were opened between Taipei and Vienna.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hu pointed out that South Korea's popular TV soap
operas in the international market also help in its tourism boom.</P>
      <P>Last year, over 710,000 local and foreign tourists visited sites
in South Korea where various popular TV series were filmed, and the
neighboring country provides a good example of how a country's
creative industry can benefit its tourism, the CEPA chairman said.</P>
      <P>More than 2.46 million foreign visitors traveled to Taiwan for
the first three quarters of this year, according to government

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has not
seen any new application from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) on the
planned Taiwan visit by a high-ranking Chinese official, MAC vice
Chairman Huang Wei-feng said Friday.</P>
      <P>Huang was responding to a media report that the KMT has decided
to renew its application with the government for the visit by Chen
Yunlin, director of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, after the party's
overwhelming victory in the Dec. 3 "three-in-one" elections.</P>
      <P>The KMT has invited Chen to visit Taiwan to attend an economic
and trade forum between the KMT and the Communist Party of China. The
KMT had previously filed an application with the Bureau of
Immigration for Chen's visit but it was rejected.</P>
      <P>Huang said there is no way for him to predict how the government
will handle the case since the KMT has not submitted a second
application.</P>
      <P>However, Huang said, the outcome of the elections will not change
the government's policy towards China.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the government has always insisted that
cross-strait exchanges be conducted based on the principles of
parity, dignity and reciprocity.</P>
      <P>The MAC had previously requested consultations with Beijing over
Chen's trip, but the request was ignored by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party legislators have said that
they would oppose Chen's Taiwan visit unless Beijing invites MAC

    <HEADLINE>2007 LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS FULCRUM FOR KMT-PFP MERGER: KMT SPOKESWOMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will
fully merge with the People First Party (PFP) after the current 
legislative term expires in 2007, and it is "too early to talk about a
new party chairman now," a KMT spokeswoman said Friday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Li-wen made the remarks after KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
called on Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Wang mentioned to Ma during the meeting about the possible
re-election of the party's new chairman after a merger, according to
Cheng.</P>
      <P>In theory, Cheng said, the merger between the two parties will be
completed in 2007 due to the consideration of the seats of the PFP
legislators-at-large, which are allotted according to the seats a
party garners in elections.</P>
      <P>To avoid the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP from
losing its majority in the legislature, the PFP legislators-at-large
will continue to cling to the party until the 2007 legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>Cheng reaffirmed that after Ma and PFP Chairman James Soong hold
a scheduled meeting next Monday to establish a communication
mechanism between the two parties, the process of a merger between
the two parties can begin.</P>
      <P>On reports that President Chen Shui-bian is keen on inviting Wang
to serve as premier, Ma and Wang also exchanged views on this matter,
Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Both agreed that if the president wants to invite someone from
the opposition to serve as premier, he should do so through
party-to-party consultations.</P>
      <P>The president should also turn over the right to name a premier
to conform to the dual leadership system of the ROC Constitution. The
right to form a Cabinet should also be given to the "pan-blue
alliance," which enjoys a slim majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Ma again invited Wang to serve as the first vice chairman of the
KMT, stressing that "Wang is welcome to have the post any time he
wishes," according to Cheng.</P>
      <P>Wang quit as a KMT vice chairman after he lost to Ma in the KMT
chairmanship election in late July, saying that although he had left
the post, he will continue to serve the party as a life-long
volunteer.</P>
      <P>The PFP is a KMT splinter party founded in 2000 after Soong lost
his presidential bid by a slim margin. Soong, who used to be the
KMT's all-powerful secretary-general, ran as an independent in the
2000 presidential race.</P>
      <P>The PFP saw its strength decline after the 2004 presidential
elections in which Soong teamed up with then-KMT Chairman Lien Chan,
only to be defeated a second time by President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The party is now facing the risk of being sidelined after the
Dec. 3 local elections in which it won only one magistrate seat -- in
Kinmen -- out of 23 openings up for grabs, and that only thanks to
the courtesy of the KMT, which refrained from naming its own
candidate in that county.</P>
      <P>Many PFP lawmakers have called for a merger with the KMT, which
won 14 seats in the Dec. 3 race and is on its way to a showdown with
the DPP in the 2008 presidential race.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DRIVERS FAILING TO STOP FOR PEOPLE IN CROSSWALKS FACE FINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Drivers failing to stop for pedestrians in
crosswalks will now face fines of between NT$1,200 and NT$3,600
(US$108) after the Legislative Yuan passed the third reading of the
amended Road Traffic Regulations and Penalties Ordinance Friday.</P>
      <P>Also, making a right turn on a red light could cost drivers
between NT$600 and NT$1,800, which was lowered from the previous fine
of NT$1,800 to NT$5,400 when the infraction was considered equivalent
to running a red light.</P>
      <P>However, speeders who hope to beat fines by using radar detectors
have a new lease on life. Under the old ordinance, drivers found
using radar detectors were subject to fines between NT$1,200 and
NT$2,400 and had their units confiscated.</P>
      <P>The new revisions make using a radar detector legal.</P>
      <P>Ironically, another addition to the ordinance provides for a fine
of NT$6,000 to NT$20,000 for any motorist who exceeds the maximum
speed limit by 60 kph or more. The offender's licence will be revoked
on the spot.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW  MINIMUM TAX CODE WILL TAX OVERSEAS INCOME IN FUTURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The reach of the taxman just got longer as
the legislature passed the Basic Income Tax Code Friday that
stipulates that overseas income will be subject to taxation in
several years.</P>
      <P>Commonly known as the "minimum tax code, " the new law requires
that a company that earns more than NT$2 million a year will have to
pay between 10 percent and 20 percent in corporate income tax.</P>
      <P>High-income individuals, meanwhile, are obligated to pay at least
20 percent of their income that exceeds NT$6 million per year.
Minister of Finance Lin Chuan said this new provision will affect
between 15,000 and 16,000 ROC citizens.</P>
      <P>He estimated that the new law, which will go into effect next
year, will bring in some NT$11 billion in increased government
revenues in the first year.</P>
      <P>Another key provision in the new minimum tax code is that non-ROC
sourced income, which currently is not taxed, will be counted as
taxable income.</P>
      <P>This includes income from Hong Kong, Macau and China; this income
enjoys an exemption threshold of NT$1 million.</P>
      <P>Taxpayers must declare their overseas income, but the "overseas
income" clause will not take effect until 2009 or even 2010, as the
Executive Yuan has been authorized to decide when to begin taxing
overseas income, depending on the nation's economic health.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid double taxation, individuals can get exemptions
for their income that has been taxed by foreign governments if they
produce proof that is certified by Taiwan officials based abroad.</P>
      <P>Regarding the so-called "trust and protection" principle that
affects tax privileges for high-tech investors, a principle that the
Ministry of Economic Affairs has fought hard to retain, the
Legislative Yuan consented to the ministry's request.</P>
      <P>That means some investors will have 12 more years for which they
don't have to be bound by the new tax code if they have already
signed an investment contract eligible for tax holidays or other
privileges.</P>
      <P>The preferential tax treatments are accorded under a government
regulation as incentives to investors who put money into some
"strategic industries."</P>
      <P>The new code stipulates that the economics ministry should review
the regulation within one year and seek to stop investors from
enjoying both "five-year tax exemptions" and "tax exemptible
investments."</P>

advice of KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and refrain from punishing those
city government officials who had sided with his opponents from other
political parties in the election campaign.</P>
      <P>News reports in the past few days said Hsu was launching a drive
to settle scores with officials who did not maintain a neutral stand
in the period leading up to the Dec. 3 election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, legislators of the opposition People First Party (PFP)
-- the KMT's partner in the "pan-blue alliance" -- also complained
that at least four department heads of the Keelung City Government
were facing possible demotion because they had supported a PFP
candidate during the election campaign.</P>
      <P>These PFP lawmakers warned that the Keelung mayor's behavior may
become an obstacle to the effort between the KMT and the PFP for a
merger of the two parties.</P>
      <P>Concerned about the post-election developments in Keelung, the
KMT chairman, who is also Taipei mayor, spoke to Hsu on the phone and
asked him to be "as great as he is tolerant."</P>

Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun to be the party's next chairman.</P>
      <P>Su Tseng-chang stepped down to take political responsibility for
the poor showing of the DPP in the recent elections for local

the Welfare State Alliance, both said Friday that Yu would be a
reasonable choice since he is qualified for the post.</P>
      <P>According to one of Yu's staff members, Yu will talk to President

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) legislative caucus said Friday it welcomes more reform-minded
party members to run for party chairman.</P>
      <P>William Lai, a DPP caucus whip, made the remarks after Trong
Chai, a veteran DPP legislator, announced earlier in the day that he
is entering the race for the top DPP post.</P>
      <P>The DPP is scheduled to hold a chairmanship by-election early
next year after Su Tseng-chang stepped down from the post last
weekend to shoulder the responsibility for the party's rout in the
just-concluded local government chief elections.</P>
      <P>Following the electoral debacle, Lai said, the DPP must reform
and regroup in order to regain the public's trust. "We must turn
challenges into opportunities," he added.</P>
      <P>At this critical juncture, Lai said, the party needs a capable
leader who can help the DPP get back on its feet.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the party has a deep talent pool, Lai said the DPP
legislative caucus hopes to see a diverse array of aspirants join the
chairmanship race to reflect the party's diversity and vitality.</P>
      <P>"Only through a truly competitive democratic election can we
choose a new party leader who can win the support and trust of the
majority of the public, " Lai said, adding he believes that having
hopefuls from various intraparty factions or subgroups enter the race
would contribute to the party's future development.</P>
      <P>In addition to Chai, several other DPP politicians, including Yu
Shyi-kun, President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff, and Luo Wen-jia,
a former legislator who just lost his bid for Taipei County
magistrate, are reportedly mulling the possibility of joining the
chairmanship race.</P>
      <P>Media reports said Vice President Annette Lu, who has been named
to serve as the party's interim chairwoman until a new chairman is
elected by all party member, is likely to run as well.
But Lu categorically ruled out the possibility during an informal

    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior officials of three local governments
in southern Taiwan -- Kaohsiung County, Kaohsiung City and Pingtung
County -- on Friday held an activity aimed at soliciting investments.</P>
      <P>The activity was held at Neimen Junior High School in Kaohsiung
County, with the participation of Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) Chairman Hsu Chih-jen, Kaohsiung County Magistrate
Yang Chiu-hsing, Kaohsiung City Deputy Mayor Tan Chin-chuan, and Jen
Wen-hua, director of Pingtung County's Research, Development and
Evaluation Office.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that this was the second time that TAITRA has been
commissioned to be responsible for soliciting investments for the
three local governments. The first time was three years ago, and the
project successfully attracted investments worth NT$120 billion
(US$3.58 billion).</P>
      <P>Noting that southern Taiwan has a solid industrial base, with
plentiful supplies of water and electricity, in addition to its
abundant tourist resources, Hsu said the people in southern Taiwan
are very friendly and the three local governments boast of very
diligent chiefs.</P>
      <P>"Kaohsiung County, Kaohsiung City and Pingtung County are hi-tech
and have lots of tourist attractions, " Hsu stressed.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, the three counties and cities can complement
each other economically, as Taiwan's first environmental protection
park, a multi-functional economic and trade park, and an agricultural
biotech park are all located in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stressing that southern Taiwan has plentiful supplies of water
and electricity, Yang said several hot springs hotel construction
projects will probably begin next year.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Kaohsiung Science Park, Kaohsiung has a solid
base in the metal industry, Yang said, adding that once the Taiwan
High-speed Railway is completed, northern and southern Taiwan will be
better linked.</P>
      <P>By that time, travel from the north to the south will be
extremely quick, Yang said. He welcomed investments from enterprises
in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At the event, Jen strongly recommended the fruits from Pingtung
County, a traditional agricultural area.</P>
      <P>Noting that agriculture and livestock sectors are the two major
lucrative industries in Pingtung County, Jen said that the country's
first agricultural biotechnology park is located in the county.</P>
      <P>Jen stressed that Pingtung County is set to develop itself as a
county dedicated to environmental protection, high technology and
tourism.</P>
      <P>Excited by the large amount of investments they lured from the
previous project, TAITRA officials expressed confidence that this
project will give a boost to southern Taiwan's economy by offering

city of Panama received a batch of Taiwan-donated supplements -- baby
clothes and appliances.</P>
      <P>Including toys, clothes and shoes, contained in 10 cargo
containers, the shipment was donated by the Taiwan government last
month. In the upcoming months, more Taiwan donations will arrive in
Panama, ROC Ambassador Hou Ping-fu said Friday, noting that besides
toys, clothes and shoes, Taiwan will also continue to send
wheelchairs.</P>
      <P>Saint Thomas General Hospital is Panama's largest medical
facility for the poor, which provides free medical treatment for
people living in poverty. Its obstetrics and gynecology department
building was constructed under financial aid from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A department official said that over 10,000 babies are born
at the hospital on average every year, and that most of the mothers
come from poor families without insurance, and who were not charged
for hospital services.</P>
      <P>Hou said that Taiwan believes providing ally countries
humanitarian aid helps bilateral relations, and that there are many
practicing physicians in Taiwan who are willing to give free medical
services to the poor in countries struggling to develop economically.</P>
      <P>With several local government chiefs in Panama having applied for
the free medical service, he is now making contact with the Taiwan
doctors' association to arrange for the service in Panama some time
in March and April, the ambassador said.</P>

new phase now that the bitterly contested "three-in-one" local chief

    <TEXT>New York Times: Qaeda
-Iraq Link U.S. Cited Is Tied to Coercion Claim 

The Bush administration based a crucial
prewar assertion about ties between Iraq and Al
Qaeda on detailed statements made by a prisoner
while in Egyptian custody who later said he had
fabricated them to escape harsh treatment,
according to current and former government
officials. The officials said the captive, Ibn a
l-Shaykh al-Libi, provided his most specific and
elaborate accounts about ties between Iraq and
Al Qaeda only after he was secretly handed over
to Egypt by the United States in January 2002,
in a process known as rendition. The Bush
administration used Libi' s accounts as the
basis for its prewar claims that ties between
Iraq and Al Qaeda included training in
explosives and chemical weapons.

Wall Street Journal: Long Well-Known in
Europe, Celiac Disease May Affect Up to 3
Million Americans 

Only in the past few years has it become 
evident that celiac disease may be widespread in
the United States. A report last year by experts
convened by the National Institutes of Health
declared that the disease affects 0.5 percent
to 1 percent of the U.S. population, or roughly
1.5 million to 3 million Americans. They may
have varied symptoms or none at all. The NIH
estimate emerged after expatriate European and
Australian researchers pushed to study the
disease more aggressively in the U.S. Celiac
disease, a condition in which so-called gluten
proteins in grains such as wheat and barley
trigger an immune-system attack on the
small-intestine lining, has a clong history in
Europe. Doctors there are trained to look
routinely for the condition. In the U.S., by
contrast, doctors have long assumed the disease
was a rare childhood disorder.</TEXT>

to spare, after the performance of those duties, he should then
employ them in literary pursuits."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HOPES TO REINFORCE FRIENDSHIP WITH JAPAN: VICE CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec.  10 (CNA)
(By P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) firmly
supports sustainable development in the Republic of China on Taiwan
and also hopes that the country can reinforce its friendship with
Japan, a KMT leader said in Tokyo Saturday.</P>
      <P>KMT Vice Chairman Chiang Pin-kung made the remarks while meeting
with local Taiwanese reporters after concluding a four-day visit to
Japan.</P>
      <P>Chiang, at the head of a 11-member KMT delegation, said that the
visit was aimed at explaining such issues as the party's victory in
Taiwan's Dec. 3 local elections as well as former KMT Chairman Lien
Chan's China visit and new KMT head Ma Ying-jeou's stance on various
matters to Japanese political figures and organizations.</P>
      <P>Expressing his satisfaction with the visit, the vice chairman
also said that during their stay, the delegation met with leaders
from both the Japanese ruling and leading opposition political
parties as well as a former Japanese prime minister and members of a
non-partisan pro-Taiwan organization in order to allay their concerns
and clear up any misunderstandings regarding the KMT's stance on
certain domestic and foreign policy issues.</P>
      <P>Noting that maintaining a peaceful and stable mechanism of
development between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is very
important to Taiwan's economy and that more than 85 percent of the
Taiwan people favor maintaining the current cross-strait status quo,
Chiang said that "these are the policies that the KMT wants to
promote" and that "the victory claimed by the party in the local
elections reflects the public opinion."</P>
      <P>Lien's visit to mainland China in April of this year has been
helpful toward reducing tensions between Taipei and Beijing, he
further said, adding that it has also been beneficial to Taiwan's
economy.</P>
      <P>"The KMT also hopes that Japan and China, the two economic
powerhouses in Asia, can cooperate with each other as they take on
the responsibility of establishing a peaceful and prosperous future
in the region," he continued.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, a KMT legislator, also said that during the
visit, he told members of Japanese political circles why the KMT has
blocked passage of the arms procurement bill in the Legislative Yuan,
stressing that the KMT only supports "a reasonable arms procurement
project" and that its legislative caucus will deal with the matter in
a practical way in the wake of the local elections.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>It is only natural for the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) to elect a new
chairman after the two parties merge, a PFP legislator said Saturday.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Chang Hsien-yao made the comment while touching on
the issue of the two parties' future in a meeting with reporters
after he listened to the opinions expressed earlier in the day on the
matter by PFP grass-roots supports in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>According to the legislator, the opinions will be used as a
reference by KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and PFP Chairman James Soong
who are set to meet Dec. 12 to discuss the merger plan.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the PFP might be merged when the next legislative
elections in 2007 roll around, Chang said, adding that Ma's campaign
for the 2008 presidential election will make him unable to continue
to serve as the chairman of the new party that is formed by the
merger.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, it is natural for the two parties to elect a new
chairman after the merger," Chang said.</P>
      <P>"Just like two companies or two financial holding firms, it is
quite correct for the two political parties to elect new leadership
and management after they merge," he added.</P>
      <P>Chang further said that the new party can be called the
"Kuomintang, " but he added that it should be "a brand new
Kuomintang."</P>
      <P>Talking about the upcoming Ma-Soong meeting, Chang said that Ma

    <HEADLINE>83% OF OFFICE WORKERS UNDER FINANCIAL PRESSURE: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 83.41 percent of office workers
in Taiwan are under financial pressure, with approximately 22 percent
of these workers having thought about committing suicide, according
to the results of a survey released Saturday by an online employment
service provider.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the 1111 Job Bank between Nov. 18 and
Dec. 2 on 1,242 office workers. The survey has a margin of error of
plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that the salary of office workers averages
NT$31,231 per month. While 24.64 percent of these workers make
NT$20,001 to NT$25,000 per month, 19.97 percent earn NT$15,840 to
NT$20,000 per month, and 17.23 percent make NT$25,001 to NT$30,000
per month.</P>
      <P>The sources of financial pressure mentioned by the respondents
included general living expenses (64.25 percent) , mortgages or rent
(39.94 percent), and other liabilities (29.31 percent).</P>
      <P>When faced with financial pressure, 51.85 percent of the
respondents said they tell their friends, 34.78 percent said they
tell their spouses, and 39.61 percent said they deal with it alone.</P>
      <P>A total of 21.9 percent of the respondents said they have thought
about killing themselves because of heavy financial pressure,
compared with 78.1 percent who have not. Meanwhile, 87.76 percent of
the respondents said they believe financial pressure is one of the
possible causes of depression.</P>
      <P>According to data from the Department of Health, 70 percent to 90
percent of Taiwan people who killed themselves had suffered from a
mental disease, with depression being the most common. While 75
percent of those who have attempted suicide had visited a doctor
within one year of their suicide attempt, 45 percent did so within
one month. However, only approximately two percent of those who have
attempted suicide had any contact with psychological healthcare
workers within one month of trying to kill themselves.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, statistics from the Taiwan Lifeline International show
that 8.36 percent of the people who have sought the help of the

which is the third most common problem after relationship problems
(37.5 percent) and mental or psychological problems (28 percent).</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANALYST SAYS THERE'S STILL ROOM FOR FURTHER APPRECIATION OF YUAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's adoption in July of a more flexible
yuan exchange rate mechanism, bringing a 2-percent appreciation in
its currency in the process, has not had a negative effect on the
country's economy, showing that there is still room for further
appreciation of the yuan, an economist said in a report published
Saturday by Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Kao Charng, head of the Hualien-based National Dong Hwa
University's College of Humanities and Social Science, conducted an
analysis on the factors affecting the value of the yuan after Beijing
released in mid-November a report on its currency policy in the third
quarter.</P>
      <P>The Beijing report cities statistics as showing that China's
total domestic output registered growth of 9.4 percent in the first
three quarters of the year.</P>
      <P>China's exports saw year-on-year growth of 31.3 percent for the
first three quarters, with the country registering a trade surplus of
US$68.3 billion for the period, the report said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, foreign exchange reserves rose to US$769 billion by
the end of the third quarter, up by US$153 billion in comparison with
the level at the beginning of this year, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Kao noted that the yuan appreciation led to a loss of some 130
million yuan (US$16.1 million) in trade for the July-October period,
but the figure represents only a miniscule 0.013 percent of the total
trade revenue of enterprises in China for the period.</P>
      <P>Moreover, as nearly half of the enterprises in China had taken
precautions, such as boosting production efficiency, upgrading
product quality, or maintaining the price value of exports, to
cushion the impact of a yuan appreciation, only a handful of
companies were seriously affected by the 2-percent revaluation, Kao
said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Beijing report showed that the revaluation only
had a limited affect on foreign trade, with only 6.6 percent of
surveyed enterprises choosing to decrease exports and merely 13.7
percent choosing to try to boost sales in the domestic market to deal
with the currency appreciation.</P>
      <P>However, Kao said, Chinese enterprises don't really have the
option to lower their prices to offset the effects of the
appreciations in the value of the yuan as their profit margins are
already so slim due to intense competition at home. According to a
survey by China's central bank, about 85.9 percent of polled
enterprises in China said that 3 percent is the maximum amount that
they could cut their prices.</P>

      <P>The president, who has yet to make public appearance since the
DPP's crushing defeat in the Dec. 3 local elections, kept a low
profile during the visit.</P>
      <P>After burning incense and bowing before the late Huang's tomb,
the president chatted with Huang's family members for 20 minutes,
according to Ma Yung-cheng, deputy secretary-general of the
Presidential Office. The president made no public statement, but he
prayed that Huang's spirit will give him strength and guidance to
continue on the path of reform, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma also quoted the president as saying that he couldn't come to
Huang's cemetery earlier because he was in southern Taiwan stumping
for DPP candidates, so he decided to come on Saturday, which marked
the 26th anniversary of the Kaohsiung Incident, generally recognized
as an important turning point in the island's transition to
democracy, when police cracked down on a peaceful rally to mark Human
Rights Day on Dec. 10, 1979.</P>
      <P>President Chen said Huang, a former DPP chairman, is the
perennial spiritual leader of the party, which stands for the pursuit
of the ideals of democracy, freedom, human rights, social justice,
protection of the disadvantaged, as well as Taiwan first, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The president has engaged in self-examination and reflected upon
the domestic situation after the elections over the past week, he
said.</P>
      <P>On questions regarding the administration's lineup after Su
Tseng-chang stepped down as DPP chairman to take responsibility for
the party's major setback in the elections and on questions
concerning a possible Cabinet reshuffle, Ma said that the president
will reveal his ideas after an overall consideration.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lan said President Chen has visited the late Huang's
tomb every year to pay his respects since Huang passed away on Dec.
30, 1999.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP is in disarray after the Dec. 3 elections,
Lan said, however, that the president shouldn't shoulder the
responsibility alone, saying that the president has worked hard
enough during the election campaign and that the party should
continue on the path of reform.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu reiterated
Saturday that she has no plan to vie for the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Lu was appointed acting chairwoman of the DPP earlier this week
after Su Tseng-chang stepped down from the chairmanship to take
responsibility for the DPP's drubbing in the Dec. 3 "three-in-one"
elections. The party won only six of the 23 city mayor and county
magistrate posts up for grabs in the elections, compared with the 14
won by the opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Lu said that she is taking care of the ruling party temporarily
on behalf of President Chen Shui-bian and that it is good that many
DPP members have shown an interest in running for the chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Lu said that during next week's Central Standing Committee
meeting of the DPP, she will put forward a proposal to set up an
anti-corruption committee within the party to monitor DPP public
office holders and restore the DPP's image as an incorruptible party.</P>
      <P>During Wednesday's Central Standing Committee meeting, the DPP is
expected to set the date for the chairmanship election, which will
probably be held some time before the Chinese New Year holiday at the
end of January.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Trong Chai has announced his decision to vie for

    <HEADLINE>EXECUTIVE YUAN APPEALS FOR CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR TAX REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan hopes that the public
will continue to support tax reforms that aim at an equitable
distribution of wealth, Executive Yuan Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>His remarks came one day after the Legislative Yuan passed the
basic tax statute, or the "minimum tax code." According to the
bill, a company that earns more than NT$2 million (US$59,700) a year
will have to pay between 10 percent and 20 percent in corporate
income tax, while high-income individuals will be obligated to pay at
least 20 percent of their income that exceeds NT$6 million per year.</P>
      <P>The premier expressed his appreciation to the legislature for the
passage of the minimum tax code, which he said is a great step toward
major tax reforms.</P>
      <P>The premier has listed tax reform as one of his major goals since
assuming his post in February, Cho said, adding that in order to
improve the government's finances, it has for the first time put
forward a budget with less spending than the previous year.</P>
      <P>Now that the minimum tax system, which takes into consideration
economic development, social justice and sustainable development, has
received the support of the legislature and the people, the premier
is "gratified," Cho said.</P>
      <P>Cho noted that South Korea and Taiwan have changed positions in
various fields in recent years, although Taiwan's economic
development is still superior.</P>
      <P>He said that foreign investment in Taiwan has exceeded that of
any other Asian country recently, and that the economic fundamentals
in Taiwan are still solid, but the people have not acutely felt the
improvement in their lives.</P>
      <P>"This means that there is great room for improvement in terms of
a more equitable distribution of wealth," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE, POLITICAL PARTIES MOST CORRUPT: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A majority of Taiwan people responding to a
recent opinion poll have singled out the legislature as the most
corrupt agency in the country, according to the results of a survey
released by the Transparency International's Taiwan chapter.</P>
      <P>The poll was part of a global survey released by the Berlin-based
anti-graft group Transparency International (TI) in celebration of
Dec. 9 United Nations Anti-Corruption Day, said Yu Chih-li, chief
executive of the TI's Taiwan chapter.</P>
      <P>Up to 78 percent of those responding to the Taiwan chapter's
survey said they feel that the Legislative Yuan is most corrupt, and
69 percent said political parties are corrupt. The least corrupt
institutions cited by local respondents are religious groups, non
government organizations and household registration agencies.</P>
      <P>Thirty-five percent of those surveyed said they believe that
corruption will increase in the next three years, Hsu said. He
suggested that the government pushes for law revisions to make senior
public officials' assets from unknown sources as incriminating
evidence to avert corruption and establish clean politics.</P>
      <P>According to TI's 2005 Global Barometer survey, corruption is on
the increase in most countries and poor people are often the hardest
hit.</P>
      <P>Nearly 55,000 people in 69 countries were surveyed for the
Corruption Barometer as part of a Gallup poll conducted between May
and October 2005.</P>
      <P>The poll found a majority of people in 48 out of 69 countries
surv eyed thought the problem had got worse over the past three
years.</P>
      <P>"Today's survey shows that people believe corruption is deeply
embedded in their countries, " said TI Chairwoman Huguette Labelle.
"When a poor young mother believes that her government places its own
interests above her child's, or that securing services like that
child's basic health requires a hand under the table, her hope for
the future is dampened."</P>
      <P>Overall, people rated political parties as the most corrupt
institutions. But customs officials were seen as the most corrupt in
many Central and Eastern European states while the police and legal
systems often came top of the poll in Africa.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed paying bribes was not confined to specific
regions but was particularly prevalent in Central and Eastern Europe,
Africa and Latin America.</P>
      <P>Transparency International, a non-governmental group based in
Berlin with branches in more than 90 countries, said leaders could
combat corruption if they made a determined effort.</P>
      <P>A U.N. Convention against Corruption, signed by 137 nations,
enters into force on Dec. 14 and the group said systems must be put
in place to ensure governments stick to their commitments.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TEACHERS, RETIRED TEACHERS FROM AROUND TAIWAN STAGE PROTEST IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thousands of teachers and retired teachers
from around Taiwan took part in a parade in Taipei City Saturday to
protest against the government's decision to amend the pension
payment scheme for retired civil servants, military personnel and
teachers.</P>
      <P>The National Teachers' Association and a league of retired
teachers organized the parade which began at the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall complex and ended in front of the Presidential Office
on Ketagalan Avenue.</P>
      <P>The protestors staged a sit-in in front of the Presidential
Office, demanding an apology from President Chen Shui-bian for
scrapping the 18-percent preferential interest rate given to retired
teachers, civil servants and military personnel as a "campaign tool"
ahead of the Dec. 3 "three-in-one" elections.</P>
      <P>The protestors also demanded that Examination Yuan President Chu
Wu-hsien step down, claiming that he had given false information on
the pension payment scheme which led the government to adopt a
"tough" stance by making the amendment without taking the lives of
hundreds of thousands of retirees into consideration.</P>
      <P>The Examination Yuan, which is responsible for the civil service
system, adopted a new pension payment plan in early November to cut
the "unfair amount" in retirement benefits for teachers, civil
servants and military personnel.</P>
      <P>Prior to the changes to the pension payment program, some retired
civil servant received pensions that were higher than what they
earned before retirement, due in part to the preferential 18-percent
savings interest rate, according to the Examination Yuan.</P>
      <P>In the new pension payment scheme which will soon be put into
practice, the retirement income for middle-and lower-ranking civil
servants will not exceed 90 percent of their salary at the time of
their retirement. For higher-ranking civil servants, the ceiling will
be between 75 percent and 80 percent.</P>
      <P>The same principle will be applied to retired teachers and
military personnel.</P>
      <P>The protest organizers said that their pension replacement rate
of pre-retirement income has never exceeded 90 percent, rebuking the
government for giving what they called "wrong data."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The most important thing for President Chen
Shui-bian to do now is to tell the people clearly where he intends to
lead the country in his remaining two years in office, a senior
presidential adviser said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Koo Kuan-min made the remarks after calls for President Chen to
apologize following the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)
humiliating defeat in the Dec. 3 local elections.</P>
      <P>"The elections are over, and there is no need for the president
to apologize," Koo said.</P>
      <P>Wu Li-pei, another senior presidential adviser, echoed Koo's
views, saying that "the elections have ended, and now it is time for
serious self-examination."</P>
      <P>The president's focus in the next two years should be to deliver
on his promises made during the presidential campaign, Wu said,
adding that this is the only way for him to live up to the
expectations of his supporters.</P>
      <P>President Chen has often been criticized for wavering in his
policies, Wu said, adding, however, that the problem lies not in the
president's policies, but in his being too compromising in the people
he appoints.</P>
      <P>The president's future appointees should not be distributed among
the factions, Wu said, but should instead be chosen based on their
ability to carry out the policies.</P>
      <P>Koo also said that new breakthroughs in the stalled cross-strait
term, mainly because of the resounding victory by the main opposition
relations are unlikely to be achieved during the remainder of Chen's
Kuomintang in the Dec. 3 elections, which Beijing will view as a
success in its policy toward Taiwan and will therefore not alter its
policy.</P>
      <P>On constitutional reform, Koo noted that former President Lee
Teng-hui orchestrated six constitutional reforms during his 12 years
in office but couldn't achieve a creditable outcome. For this reason,
Koo said, Taiwan should craft a new Constitution.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ALLIANCE SEEKS TO IMPROVE HUMAN RIGHTS IN NEXT CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local alliance promoting constitutional
reform unveiled Saturday a list of human rights issues that the group
believes should be addressed in the next phase of reforms.</P>
      <P>The list, released on Human Rights Day, covers areas such as
equality rights, liberty rights, social rights, collective rights,
rights of political participation, basic procedural rights, asylum
rights for foreigners, and the right to resistance.</P>
      <P>Alliance convener Hung Yu-hung said the list was compiled by
constitutional law professors based on suggestions put forth by more
than 50 member organizations of the alliance.</P>
      <P>According to Hung, the sovereignty of the country belongs to all
its people, rather than political parties, and the movement promoted
by the alliance will provide the people with the chance to think
about the direction of national development.</P>
      <P>The alliance will try to improve the list and release a second
and even third version of the list in the future, he said.</P>
      <P>In response, Lee Chun-yi, head of the constitutional reforms
office at the Presidential Office, said he welcomes the efforts made
by the alliance and hopes that the public will offer their support
for the reforms.</P>
      <P>Lee said the release of the list indicates that human rights are
not sufficiently protected under the existing Constitution and
represents the anxious aspirations of private citizens and
organizations to make improvements.</P>
      <P>In addition, it echoes the idea of developing "a country based
upon human rights" by President Chen Shui-bian, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee said the Presidential Office does not take any predetermined
stand towards the next phase of constitutional reforms and will
listen to the opinions of the public.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the existing Constitution only covers 14
kinds of human rights, which he said displays a wide gap with most
modern constitutions drafted after World War II.</P>
      <P>Although seven rounds of constitutional amendments have been
launched, none of them have concerned changes to the chapter
governing the rights and obligations of the people, he noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIRING OF FOREIGN WORKERS A TANGLED WEB THAT KEEPS LABORERS OPPRESSEDBy Taijing Wu</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> CNA Staff Reporter</P>
      <P>Taipei, Dec. 10 (CNA) Each Sunday afternoon the sidewalk by Saint
Christopher's Church on Taipei's Chungshan Road becomes a "Little
Manila, " with hawkers selling discount clothing, jewelry, toys and
prepaid phone cards amid the titter of laughter and gossip in Tagalog
as overseas Filipino workers, mostly women, congregate on their one
day off a week.</P>
      <P>Joining in the weekly street fair-like atmosphere are a
smattering of Thais and Indonesians, adding an exotic aspect to the
capital city.</P>
      <P>This is the time when caregivers and blue-collar workers can mix
and compare notes on the week's goings on. But not everyone has
glowing reviews to give.</P>
      <P>A Filipina caregiver complains to her friends about the absurd
amount of extra time she has to work, before suddenly bursting into
tears. Her Thai friend, who works at a construction site, says that
his labor management agency forces him to pay excessive broker's
fees. Their other friend, a woman, says in a frightened tone that her
employer behaves strangely with her when his wife is out of the
house.</P>
      <P>Roughly 300,000 foreign migrant workers live in Taiwan. Their
working conditions are sometimes less than ideal. Stories have
surfaced of ill-treatment by their Taiwanese employers or persecution
by their management agencies. These people have come from afar,
although most of them would rather be in their home countries with
their loved ones. But they have chosen to roll the dice in Taiwan in
the hopes that the money they earn will provide a better living for
those they leave behind.</P>
      <P>And they hope that their new employers will treat them with the
respect they know they are due.</P>
      <P>However, dreams of leading a simple life helping an elderly
person or caring for the children of busy Taiwanese parents often
turns into a nightmare with foreign workers being mistreated or
exploited in inhumane conditions. Some are required to work overtime
without additional pay and others must pay unexpected sums to their
labor brokers in their home countries or face losing their jobs and
being deported.</P>
      <P>True, migrant workers have a variety of places where they can
work, from Hong Kong to Singapore, and workers have a variety of
reasons for ending up in a strange land.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's overseas workers often come to the island because of
what they perceive as good working conditions and a competitive
salary. But although Taiwan was once known for its low-cost labor,
the situation now has changed, and tough jobs are reserved mainly for
foreign migrant workers where the bottom line is money, with many
willing to take on the most dangerous and often backbreaking work --
all to help their families back home.</P>
      <P>But many workers and local observers realize that something is
wrong with the system of recruitment in Taiwan, not least of which
was brought to light on Aug. 21 when roughly 100 Thai manual laborers
rebelled against a litany of unfair and inhumane conditions and
rioted in the southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>One aspect of the system that many point to as being out of sync
with established norms is the way the country allows agencies to be
the intermediary between an employer and laborers. A lucrative
partnership forms between the Taiwanese employer and the agencies of
both countries, with the hapless foreign worker left out in the cold,
both in terms of workers' rights and financial protection.</P>
      <P>In theory, the way foreign laborers should make their way into
the country is fairly straightforward. A Taiwanese employer in need
of overseas workers contacts a local foreign labor agency after the
employer gets the go-ahead from the Council of Labor Affair (CLA) to
hire a certain number of foreign workers. That agency then contacts
overseas agencies who being the recruitment process.</P>
      <P>But in Taiwan, the actual situation is far more complicated.
Instead of the employers seeking out agents for their workers, it is
the agents who seek out potential employers, with offers of payments
to them for each worker that they hire. Labor brokers in Taiwan will
even apply to the CLA for workers before even having a place for them
to work. Labor brokers in Taiwan are so willing to bend over
backwards to entice prospective employers that they will pay them
NT$30,000 to NT$50,000 for each overseas worker that they agree to
hire through their agency.</P>
      <P>These "commissions" are then passed on to the foreign brokers,
generally in Thailand, the Philippines or Indonesia, but not after
the Taiwanese side doubles the figure. Not to be outdone, the foreign
agency then passes this charge on to each worker that wishes to come
to Taiwan, but not without increasing the sum further so that the
worker, before even leaving his home country, has a debt of about
three times the initial "commission" from the Taiwanese broker. By
this time the front money has risen to roughly NT$140,000, a small
fortune for someone who might make the equivalent of NT$5,000 a month
in his own country.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, with an eye on working in Taiwan for a number of
years, and thus finally getting back into the black, workers will do
whatever they can to raise the money, by borrowing from their
families, selling their belongings or giving over their land to their
local agent as collateral.</P>
      <P>Sometimes the money paid by a foreign migrant worker is split
into equal parts, one going to the Taiwanese agency, the other to the
foreign one.</P>
      <P>Adding more confusion to an already muddy situation is the move
by the CLA four years ago to allow employers to withhold NT$4,000 per
month from their foreign employees' salaries as "meal expenses."
Local agencies were also given the right by the CLA to take from the
workers NT$1,800 a month during the first year, NT$1,700 the second
and NT$1,500 the third in "broker's fees."</P>
      <P>And in a move reminiscent of the saying that there is no honor
among thieves, some employers even demand a cut from this money that
the overseas workers are forced to pay to their brokers.</P>
      <P>Reynaldo Gopez, the labor representative of the Manila Economic
and Cultural Office (MECO) , says that the best way to fight this
phenomenon is to use direct, country to country hiring, which would
cut out labor brokers altogether.</P>
      <P>"The Philippine government allows the Filipino agencies to
collect one month's salary from a worker once he starts working in
Taiwan. But this isn't the way it happens. They in fact collect two
to three times this amount, which is more than NT$50,000. It's a big
financial burden for our workers since they come to work here because
they need money," Gopez says.</P>
      <P>"We are actually working hard with the Taiwanese authorities in
order to make country to country direct hiring work better and avoid
the [current] mechanism with the agencies. But it is hard to make
this work properly even though direct hiring was approved eight to 10
years ago. Taiwanese employers are often small- or medium-sized
enterprises, and they do not have a department in charge of human
resources.</P>
      <P>"Since paperwork to apply for one foreign worker is already
annoying, the employer requests the agency to deal with the CLA and
complete the procedure for him for more workers. This saves him much
work, time and money," he said.</P>
      <P>However, getting employers to hire directly from overseas is a
hard sell given that this would mean the loss of the "commissions"
from local brokers.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan International Workers' Association (TIWA) advocates
direct hiring. Ku Yu-ling, the TIWA's secretary-general says, "The
best way to get rid of agencies is for countries to get directly in
touch. But the CLA won't prohibit the agencies system."</P>
      <P>Ku said that current laws are insufficient to protect foreign
workers, and the workers are vulnerable to becoming virtual slaves
unless they find a reasonable employer.</P>
      <P>In a high-profile attempt to bring this situation to the
attention of authorities, the TIWA will hold a rally on Sunday, Dec.
11 at the Taipei Train Station.</P>
      <P>"First, we demand the abolishment of the agency system. Second,
we request that a worker should have the right to change employers.
Third, the limit to how long a worker can stay in the country should
be lifted. Fourth, laws should be made specifically for the welfare
of caregivers, and finally, foreign workers should have the right to
form labor unions," Ku said.</P>
      <P>Around 500 foreign workers attended a similar rally held by the
TIWA two years ago. Ku said that local workers, foreign brides,
employers and above all, white collar foreign workers have been
invited to support these less-protected individuals at the rally this
year.

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN WORKERS BEGINNING TO KNOW THEIR RIGHTSBy Taijing WuCNA Staff Reporter</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 10 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign workers are becoming more familiar
with their rights in Taiwan, and armed with this knowledge are coming
forward and filing grievances with their representative offices,
according to a labor representative.</P>
      <P>Thai and Philippine representative offices agree that the
increase in complaints over the last few years is due to the fact
that there are more channels available for workers to make their
appeals known.</P>
      <P>Reynaldo Gopez, the labor representative of the Manila Economic
and Cultural Office (MECO) said, "The complaints and queries we
received this year are more than those we received last year. This is
because MECO reaches out to get in touch with the workers, and more
and more workers are conscious about their rights."</P>
      <P>Every week, MECO staff takes the initiative to meet Filipinos at
the place they most often frequent on Sundays - St. Christopher's
Church on Chungshan Road in Taipei, distributing flyers and talking
to them directly. Foreign officials said that this direct contact
allows them to have a clearer idea of what the workers' problems are.</P>
      <P>"Most Taiwanese employers are reasonable. But there are still
problems. In that case, we try our best to reach both the employer
and the worker to resolve the problem. If it doesn't work, we follow
the procedure and file a plea to the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA),"
Gopez said.</P>
      <P>Among the numerous problems that foreign workers encounter, the
"broker's fee" that a worker has to pay their agency is considered
the most controversial.</P>
      <P>According to a CLA mandate passed four years ago, employers have
the right to withhold NT$4,000 from their foreign workers' monthly
salaries to pay for the workers' daily meals.</P>
      <P>On top of this is the NT$1,800 broker's fee that a foreign worker
has to give his broker each month during his first year of stay. The
amount is NT$1,700 the second year and NT$1,500 the third year.</P>
      <P>"Normally, these should be separately collected over three years.
But unscrupulous agencies often collect them in just 10 months,
making a worker pay NT$6,000 per month. This financial burden is too
great for them. You can't imagine the burden in the minds of the
workers. Many of them borrowed large sums of money in Manila at very
high interest [to come to Taiwan]," Gopez said.</P>
      <P>Although the Filipino and ROC governments are working on getting
employers to use direct hiring, Gopez is still pessimist about it
ever happening. The direct hiring program has been available to
employers for eight to 10 years, but its effect is not obvious.</P>
      <P>For this to work, an employer wishing to hire foreign workers
must contact the CLA, which will issue him a permit. With this, the
employer then contacts MECO, who will play the role of the middle man
that reaches the Philippines Overseas Employment Administration
(POEA) in Manila. The POEA then recruits workers locally.</P>
      <P>This avoids labor agencies' interference in the process.</P>
      <P>"The employer has to choose if he wishes to hire through this
channel. We are striving to promote this direct hiring program by
letting more and more employers know about it. Most of them are even
not aware that such a program exists and the first thing they think
about is agencies," Gopez said.</P>
      <P>"The Filipino and Taiwanese governments are continuously making
efforts to better the conditions of our workers and implement the
direct hiring program," he said.</P>
      <P>"Unfortunately, you can't really avoid agencies with this
approach. Direct hiring is just an alternative. The employer needs a
middle man to do all the paperwork with the CLA to apply for a
worker. Besides that, the workers' management and discipline is also
assigned to the agencies, this explains why agencies cannot be
omitted from this circle," he added.</P>
      <P>Both Thai and Filipino labor representatives have urged companies
in Taiwan to follow the example of Formosa Group's Nanya and Inotera,
which hire foreign workers through country to country direct hiring.</P>
      <P>"We're trying to convince other companies to follow this example.
They don' t withhold extra money from their foreign workers, plus,
they feed and lodge them. They have kept their foreign workers from
being exploited by agencies. Under this working environment, workers
perform better and produce more; most important of all, they do not
have this big financial burden," Gopez said.</P>
      <P>South Korea, which is currently in need of infrastructure
construction, also imports foreign workers from the Philippines and
Thailand through a channel similar to country to country direct
hiring, which has been shown to be more efficient.</P>
      <P>Thai workers are considered to be the most passive and
hard-working. Nevertheless, they still rioted on Aug. 21 this year in
an incident that attracted international media attention to Taiwan --
a place that so values its human rights and democracy.</P>
      <P>Thais are normally able to reimburse their agencies after working
one or two years almost for "free, " if they meet a reasonable
employer. If their employer maltreats them, they can only try and
endure.</P>
      <P>If things go very wrong for a worker, he may be sent back home;
or sensing the worst, he may abscond. In that case, they will not be
able to pay back their agency the large amount of money, which could
lead to more problems down the line.</P>
      <P>Asoke Srichantr of Radio Taiwan International's Thai Service
(RTI) said, "In our daily program, we tell our Thai audience here
that they must not run away if they are maltreated by their
employers. When they have a problem with their employer, we tell them
to cool down and appeal through normal channels.</P>
      <P>"Thai workers used to run away most often from factories, as
there are more than 80,000 people in the manufacture sector. But now,
they are less likely to do so and they are really appreciated among
employers for their hard-working attitude," Srichantr said.</P>
      <P>Srichantr said that Taiwan has lots of laws regarding foreign
migrant workers, but problems mostly lie in language and cultural
differences. Added to these two is the unscrupulous exploitation by
agencies that makes workers' lives miserable.</P>
      <P>The executive director of the Taiwan International Workers'
Association (TIWA) , Ku Yu-ling, says that foreign workers lack
adequate protection in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"There must be a law for them, and they must be treated as
people," Ku said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VEEP CALLS FOR PRIVATE SUPERVISORY ALLIANCE ON KAOHSIUNG MRT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday she
will organize a private supervisory alliance to ensure good quality
and safety of the mass rapid transit (MRT) system now under
construction in the southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Lu made the announcement while presiding over an informal meeting
with members of the Presidential Office Human Rights Advisory
Commission to mark the commission's fifth anniversary. Lu
concurrently heads the advisory group.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Kaohsiung MRT project has been hit by a spate of
serious accidents since construction began in 2001, Lu said the
planned supervisory alliance will review the MRT railway's design,
construction methods and groundwater hydrology at the construction
site and come up with improvement proposals.</P>
      <P>Lu traveled to Kaohsiung early Saturday morning in the company of
a group of engineering experts to inspect an MRT construction site
where a serious accident happened Monday.</P>
      <P>"Today is Human Rights Day. Public safety is basic human rights.
Repeated cave-in accidents at the MRT construction site form a threat
to Kaohsiung citizens' human rights. They are entitled to be free of
fears," Lu said.</P>
      <P>During her inspection tour, Lu said she discovered that the MRT
contractor might have misjudged the groundwater hydrology beneath
certain construction sites.</P>
      <P>To ensure public safety and project quality, Lu said she will
form a private supervisory alliance to make an overall technical
review and oversee the whole construction process. The alliance will
be composed of major civil engineering associations, structure
engineering associations, transportation technologists associations,
bar association representatives and respected university professors
in southern Taiwan.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's pension reform program is
aimed at achieving social justice and fairness, Presidential Office
spokesman Chen Wen-tzung said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after thousands of school teachers and
retired educators took to the streets earlier in the day to protest
the government's decision to cut pension perquisites for retired
civil servants, military personnel and teachers.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the government has not decided to phase out the
18 percent preferential interest rate for retirees' pension deposits,
Chen said what the government intends to do is just to set a ceiling
on the postretirement income replacement rates to rationalize the
nation's pension system.</P>
      <P>Under the existing scheme, some retirees receive more money per
month than they actually earned prior to retirement, due mainly to
the preferential 18-percent deposit interest rate available to
retired civil servants, military personnel and teachers.</P>
      <P>"This unreasonable phenomenon should be changed because it has
become a bone of contention for the general public and a heavy
financial burden for the government," Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to a reform scheme adopted by the Examination Yuan, for
retirees who have worked as civil servants for 25 years, the
postretirement income -- including monthly pension, the preferential
deposit interest and year-end bonus money -- will not be more than 85
percent of the pay they were receiving at the time of their
retirement. The ratio will be no more than 95 percent for those who
have worked for 35 years. Slightly more than 80,000 incumbent and
retired civil servants will see their pensions reduced under the new
scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition to civil servants, the new scheme will also be
applied to military personnel and school teachers.</P>
      <P>Even after the new scheme is implemented, Chen said the
85-to-95-percent postretirement income replacement rates remain the
highest in the world.</P>
      <P>"Public opinion poll results have consistently shown that more
than 60 percent of local people give a thumbs-up to the new scheme.
We hope civil servants, military personnel and school teachers can
support this program to uphold social justice," Chen added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA SHOULD BE CONDEMNED IF PROTESTER DEATHS CONFIRMED: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China should be harshly condemned if media
reports about Chinese police shootings of protesters in a Chinese
village in the southern province of Guangdong is confirmed, a
mainland affairs official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, Chinese police killed
up to 20 people Tuesday when they fired on demonstrators in Guangdong
province's Dongzhou township, northeast of Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The reports also quoted villagers as having said that dozens of
others were still missing. The villagers had been protesting
allegedly inadequate payments for land taken by Chinese authorities
for a power plant.</P>
      <P>After Tuesday's incident, villagers said a tense standoff
prevailed as thousands of troops patrolled the perimeter, and
frightened villagers either hunkered in their homes or argued with
police over relatives' bodies.</P>
      <P>If 20 are confirmed dead, it would be Chinese security forces'
deadliest known use of force against civilians since the killings
around Tiananmen Square in 1989, and underscore rising tension in
rural China over land seizures for projects like factories, power
plants and shopping malls.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Huang Wei-feng said no
government in the world should use brute force against unarmed
civilian people. If the report about police shootings of Dongzhou
villagers is true, the Chinese government should be subject to the
severest censure.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, chief executive of the Foundation on International
and Cross-Strait Studies, said the incident signals the graveness of
social unrest in China.</P>
      <P>Noting that the latest conflict between villagers and police is
the result of official corruption, Lin said, Chinese President Hu
Jintao should face up to the grim situation squarely. If Hu fails to
launch fundamental political reform, he warned, China's future will
be doomed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MA AND SOONG TO MEET MONDAY TO DISCUSS KMT-PFP MERGER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The leaders of Taiwan's two largest
opposition parties -- the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party
(PFP) -- will meet Monday evening in Taipei to discuss how to merge
the two "pan-blue alliance" parties and other related issues.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and PFP Chairman James Soong are to
have a closed-door, three-hour meeting at the Taipei Armed Forces
Hero House, with only the secretaries-general of the two parties
present to record their discussions.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Chan Chuen-po said Sunday that he and his
PFP counterpart, Chin Chin-sheng, will jointly brief the media on the
results following the meeting.</P>
      <P>The meeting was originally scheduled to take place at KMT
headquarters, but the venue was later changed to a neutral place at
the PFP's request.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is also Taipei mayor, told reporters on a trip to Tainan
Sunday that a merger with the PFP was agreed upon by a consensus
reached at a meeting of the KMT Central Standing Committee on May 19,
2004, and that he will demonstrate "the maximum sincerity and the
greatest good will" during his meeting with Soong.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman added that all topics will be open to discussion
at the meeting.</P>
      <P>At separate occasions Sunday, the KMT and PFP secretaries-general
tacitly acknowledged that the meeting between Ma and Soong might
touch upon such sensitive issues as whether an election should be
held to elect a new party chairman after the merger and whether Soong
should run for mayor of Taipei as the "pan-blue alliance" candidate
at the end of 2006.</P>
      <P>Chan said it is too early to discuss the issue of electing a new
party chairman after the merger because the KMT just elected its
chairman in July.</P>
      <P>While recognizing the merger as an urgent matter, Chan said the
merger must come naturally and at the right time when all the
conditions are right.</P>
      <P>PFP Secretary-General Chin said the first step toward a KMT-PFP
merger will be possible only when the two parties treat each other
with mutual respect and good will on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>The PFP was founded by Soong in 2000 after he -- a member of the
KMT at the time -- ran as an independent in the presidential election
that year but failed.</P>
      <P>Like the KMT, the PFP is against Taiwan independence and favors
Taiwan's eventual unification with China. The party has maintained a
close working relationship with the KMT in the legislature, but the
relationship has sometimes been strained, especially in election
years, because they have to compete for support from the same voter
pool.</P>
      <P>Prompting the merger is the fact that he PFP has more and more
been marginalized as part of the "pan-blue alliance, " and this was
underscored in the Dec. 3 elections for local chiefs when the KMT won
in 14 of the 23 mayor and county magistrate elections and the PFP
managed only one seat.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER RESPONDS CAUTIOUSLY TO LU'S KAOHSIUNG MRT SUPERVISORY PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh responded cautiously
Sunday to Vice President Annette Lu's plan to organize a private
supervisory alliance to ensure good quality and safety of the
Kaohsiung mass rapid transit (MRT) system, whose construction is
suffering both political scandals and cave-ins.</P>
      <P>The planned supervisory alliance would review the MRT railway's
design, construction methods and groundwater hydrology before coming
up with improvement proposals. Lu said Saturday the alliance would
also oversee the whole construction process.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who started awarding the building contracts and
construction while he was mayor of the southern port city, made two
comments Sunday in response to Lu's private supervisory alliance
proposal.</P>
      <P>First, Hsieh said he welcomed supervision by professionals, even
though the Kaohsiung City Government already has a mechanism for that
purpose.</P>
      <P>He then cautioned that the Kaohsiung MRT issue should not be
politicized as he fears political interference of the MRT
construction process would affect professionalism.</P>
      <P>He said the responsibility for the MRT problems should be shared
by "all, irrespective of party affiliation." It should not be shifted
to one person alone in an attempt to "kill me with one shot, " he
added.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made his comments while attending a Hakka festival in
Kaohsiung with Lee Yung-teh, chairman of the Hakka Affairs Council,
and Yeh Chu-lan, acting Kaohsiung mayor.</P>
      <P>In response to reports that his ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , which suffered a great setback in the Dec. 3 local
government elections, will form a "political integrity committee"
next week to investigate whether Hsieh had been involved in the
Kaohsiung MRT troubles, the premier said he was unconcerned.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung MRT scandal that broke out after Thai workers
working on the project rioted in late August was cited by analysts as
one of the reasons for the DPP's election fiasco as investigations
into it brought to light the involvement of Chen Min-hsien and Chen
Che-nan.</P>
      <P>Chen Min-hsien became the powerful vice chairman of the Kaohsiung
Rapid Transit Corp. while Hsieh was Kaohsiung mayor. Chen Che-nan,
who hails from Kaohsiung, served as a key aide to President Chen
Shui-bian. Chen Che-nan is also suspected of playing the stock market
while working at the Presidential Office.</P>

rate forecasts for the two economies for 2006 are 3.3 percent and 6
percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Chen ascribed the changes to South Korea's fast technological
progress thanks to its innovation and name-building strategies that
have led to an advantage in product quality enjoyed by South Korea.</P>
      <P>Handsets, LCDs and video games produced by South Korean firms
have swept through the entire world, Chen said, adding that its
automobiles and home appliances have also begun to win international
acclaim.</P>
      <P>The South Korean government's effort to promote innovate
technologies is the major driving force behind the country's
astonishing progress after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Chen
pointed out, noting that its research and development budgets
increased by 14.7 percent in 2002.</P>
      <P>In the face of China's fast rise, South Korea has made it clear
that it will continue investing in hi-tech research and upgrading
production efficiency, he said.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Taiwan's performance in product quality improvement
and branding has been lackluster, he noted.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, South Korea already has its own core
technologies to manufacture DRAMs and has seen his handsets sell
extremely well around the world, while Taiwan's cell phone makers
remain as contractors for foreign conglomerates due to a lack of key
technologies.</P>
      <P>The big difference lies in the fact that some leading South
Korean companies have successfully built their own distinguished
names, and this is the leading factor that has driven the two
economies to have traveled down divergent paths, he concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO DEFEND ITS RIGHTS AT GLOBAL FISHERIES MEETING: OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is ready to defend its rights in the
global fisheries community at an international meeting to be held
Monday in Micronesia, Fisheries Administration officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Fisheries Administration Director-General Hsieh Ta-wen, Taiwan's
chief delegate, will detail a management program on Taiwan's efforts
to regulate its deep-sea fishing industry during the second annual
meeting of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission
(WCPFC) in anticipation that Japan will make fresh allegations about
Taiwan's fishing practices on the high seas, according to the
officials.</P>
      <P>Owing to pressure from Japan, which complained about Taiwan's
overfishing, the International Commission for the Conservation of
Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) agreed during its Nov. 20 annual meeting to cap
the annual quota for Taiwan's bigeye tuna catch in the Atlantic at
4,600 metric tons for 2006 -- a large reduction from the current
level of 14,900 metric tons.</P>
      <P>As Japan is expected to raise new protests against Taiwan in the
Monday WCPFC annual meeting since it already put forth documents last
week to a WCPFC committee accusing Taiwan of "fish laundering, " the
WCPFC annual conference chair has agreed to allow Taiwan to elaborate
on its fishing boat reduction plan to other members in the Monday
meeting after Taiwan delegates gave an initial explanation to the
chair, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the WCPFC will approve resolutions to limit
the catches of various types of tuna in its annual conference,
forcing members to reduce the number of their fishing vessels, the
officials said, stressing that Taiwan must support universal and
non-discriminatory rules to protect fishing resources in
international waters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RESEARCHER HELPS DEVELOP WAY TO GROW ARTIFICIAL CARTILAGEBy Staff Writer Maubo ChangWith Photos</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A casual chat and the application of
crossover technology were the seeds that grew into a career for Dr.
Li Wan-ju, culminating in the discovery of a way to create artificial
cartilage, a technique that promises to help millions of patients
around the world who suffer from damaged joints.</P>
      <P>Currently, for those who have serious joint damage caused by
arthritis or injury, physiotherapy or artificial joint replacement
are the only options, with replacement surgeries being expensive and
painful.</P>
      <P>However, a "nanofiber scaffold" developed by Li and his
colleagues at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland
has succeeded in generating cartilage that offers a new option for
patients.</P>
      <P>The story began in 1997, when the Taiwan-born Li was studying for
his master's degree at the Biomedical Engineering Graduate School at
Drexel University in Philadelphia.</P>
      <P>The graduate from Taiwan's Chung Yuan University in Chungli was
told by ateacher in a chat that the potential use of a
largely-ignored patent from 1938 had not been fully explored.</P>
      <P>The patent concerning the generation of a fine fibers produced
from a solution of gel-like particles under heavy electrical voltage.</P>
      <P>The teacher said the spinning applied in the technique, which
produces fibers with diameters measured in nanometers, had been
widely used in textile manufacture, particularly in screen-making,
but had not been studied for its possible use in medicine, although
the fibers the process produces look like collagen fibrils --
analogous to the structures that support cells that produce bone and
cartilage.</P>
      <P>Li's interest was piqued and he assembled his own equipment with
components bought with his own money at a local hardware store and
began to electrospin fibers that lasted longer than those in previous
experiments.</P>
      <P>Lee told the Central News Agency that his preliminary work
focused on trying to control the diameter of the fibers he spun until
1998 when he formed fibers with diameters of between 300 nanometers
and 500 nanometers and began using them to fabricate scaffolds on
which to grow human cells.</P>
      <P>His study was presented at the Sixth Annual World BioMaterials
Conference in Kamuela, Hawaii in 2000, and has been cited more than
180 times by scientists around the world since it was published in a
periodical in 2002.</P>
      <P>After entering the doctorate program at Thomas Jefferson
University in Philadelphia, Li began to study the ways that cells
implanted on electrospun nanofiber scaffolds grow.</P>
      <P>His study continued when he joined the National Institutes of
Health. He and his colleagues at the center's Cartilage Biology and
Orthopedics Branch immersed human mesenchymal stem cells in an
electrospun polymer scaffold and induced cells to grow.</P>
      <P>Stem cells, derived from the spinal cord, were chosen for the
experiment because they can differentiate into a variety of
specialized cell types, such as adipose, cartilage and bone cells.</P>
      <P>The scaffold is effective because its 700-nanometer diameter
fibers imitate the collagen fibrils that support cells in the body.
The fine fibers also degrade at an acceptably slow rate. They
dissolve slowly enough to give the cells time to secrete collagen
which replaces the scaffold.</P>
      <P>The difficulty is in balancing the pace that the scaffold
degrades with the pace the collagen is produced by the cells. Li and
the other team members had preliminary success in testing the
tissue-engineered constructs in vivo.</P>
      <P>In 2002, Li cooperated with a surgeon at National Taiwan
University Hospital in Taipei and cartilage Li produced on the
polymer nanofiber scaffold was implanted into the foot of a pig.</P>
      <P>Six months after the operation, they cut into the pig's foot and
found that the graft had grown as if it were a part of the pig foot,
with no rejection at all.</P>
      <P>The success of the experiment suggested that patients whose
joints are worn out because of age might be treated by being
implanted with artificial cartilage rather than having artificial
replacements.</P>
      <P>Creating cartilage for human beings in the laboratory is still
some years down the road, but Li believes this day will come, and
even more applications for the technology will be discovered over
time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SECOND KAOHSIUNG CAVE-IN CAUSED BY IDLE SHIELD MACHINE: KRTC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec.  11 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The second cave-in Saturday on the
city's rapid transit construction site in a week was caused by a
shield machine sitting idle too long, the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit
Corp. (KRTC) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The road cave-in, near Hsinhsing Police Station on Chungcheng
Road, started out as a 1.5 meter by one meter depression in the road;
later it became a seven meter by five meter hole three meters deep.
Another MRT site cave-in happened just one week ago.</P>
      <P>Soon after the second incident, the KRTC said a shield machine,
which is used to bore the passage for the rail line underground, had
passed the site two days earlier. When the cave-in occurred, the
machine, 20 meters away, was not working.</P>
      <P>After further investigation, the KRTC said Sunday that a shield
machine, if idle for too long and then abruptly called into duty,
cannot precisely calibrate the amount of earth removed and cement
applied. As a result, the road support was not firm, causing the
accident, the KRTC said.</P>
      <P>The machine had not been in use for a month before it was started
on Dec. 8, according to the KRTC.</P>
      <P>KRTC Chief Executive Officer Fan Chen-po said engineers will use
radar to monitor all the sites to be worked on to ensure road safety.</P>
      <P>He also used the second incident as an example to refute calls
for a suspension of the construction for safety reasons, claiming
that long suspension is in fact counterproductive and increases risk.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus said there
have been nine cave-ins since 2004 along the MRT lines. It called for
the suspension of all construction work pending a safety review
report, and said that the work should be taken over by the Ministry
of Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>Chou Yung-hui, an MOTC official, said suspending all construction
work is not normal and the MOTC is not responsible for taking over
the job.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Huang Chao-shun, chairman of the party's KRTC
Scandal Committee, blamed former Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh for
urging the KRTC to move fast on the construction work as part of his
campaign to win the ruling party's nomination for president in 2008.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Legislator Luo Chih-ming said legal
disputes will arise if the MOTC decides to take over the KRTC's
construction job. The MRT is being built under the "build, operate
and transfer" (BOT) model.</P>
      <P>What is more practical is for the MOTC and the Public
Construction Commission to organize a special monitoring team to
"strictly oversee the construction," he said.</P>
      <P>Tseng Tsan-teng, another TSU lawmaker, said building MRT systems
is not difficult at all since the technology has been in place for
more than 100 years. However, Tseng added: "If accidents like these
happen over and over, I don't think that I'd dare to ride on the
Kaohsiung MRT, assuming the project can even be completed."</P>
      <P>The TSU's legislative caucus called for a quick fix to all
technical problems while "the blaming job can wait."</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh, who visited the site Saturday, said the
problem was not serious. "Worse things happened with Taipei's MRT
project, and so we don't have to worry too much," he added.</P>

      <P>World-renowned tenor Luciano Pavarotti,
scheduled to arrive in Taichung on a chartered jet Sunday night, has
chosen Taichung to conclude the Asia leg of his farewell world tour
that began early this year.</P>
      <P>The 70-year-old opera legend will be greeted by Taichung Mayor
Jason Hu and his wife with flowers at Taichung's Chingchuankang
Airport. Hu told reporters Sunday that he has prepared a "mysterious
gift" that is expected to leave a deep impression in the opera
singer's mind about Taichung.</P>
      <P>Pavarotti will sing at the Taichung Stadium on Dec. 14 to an
audience of more than 20,000 people. Organizers said nearly all the
seats have been sold, with all the seats priced at NT$1,000 and lower
sold out.</P>
      <P>He will begin with three Neapolitan folk songs, followed by opera
songs that have made him famous, including Che Gelida Manina (Your
Tiny Hand Is Frozen) from Giacomo Puccini's opera La Boheme (The
Bohemian), and Recondita Armonia (Strange Harmony) and E lucevan le
Stelle (The Stars were Shining), both from Puccini's opera "Tosca."</P>
      <P>The Taichung concert will be Pavarotti's only performance in
Taiwan and the last one in his Asia tour, which also includes
concerts in South Korea and China.</P>
      <P>Pavarotti is widely acclaimed as one of three "tenors of the

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN WORKERS RALLY FOR BETTER WORKING CONDITIONSBy Taijing WuCNA Staff Reporter</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 11 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Around 500 foreign workers marched in the
rain in a rally Sunday in Taipei demanding that the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) give them better working conditions and employment
laws.</P>
      <P>There are roughly 300,000 foreign migrant workers from Thailand,
the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam in Taiwan. They are sometimes
reported to be victims of poor treatment from their employers.</P>
      <P>The rally, staged by the Taiwan International Workers Association
(TIWA), marched from the Taipei Main Station to the CLA offices. The
TIWA requested the ROC government to abolish the current broker
system, allow workers to form unions, cancel the six-year working
right limit, ease the procedure for workers in transferring to other
employers and establish laws protecting household caregivers. The
last is seen as their main request.</P>
      <P>Professor Wako Asato, research fellow of the Japan Society for
the Promotion of Science (JSPS) specialized in migration said Dec. 11
that foreign laborers working as caregivers will increase in the
coming years.</P>
      <P>Asato has observed foreign migrant workers' migration in Japan,
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Asato explained that Taiwan's need
for foreign workers has switched from economic to demographic.</P>
      <P>"There is a growing need for caregivers in Taiwan because there
are more and more old people. More than half of aged people here are
taken care of by foreign caretakers," Asato said.</P>
      <P>Asato said that in the past, Taiwan needed large numbers of
infrastructure construction workers for economic development, thus it
imported foreign migrant workers.</P>
      <P>"However, the need for foreign workers has changed. They are now
more needed in households because one foreign caregiver costs half
the price of a Taiwanese one," Asato said.</P>
      <P>Asato suggested redefining foreign migrant workers's role in an
aging society, since there are so many foreigners working as
caregivers, they should be included in some elderly care system which
could protect them from possible exploitation.</P>
      <P>Long-time workers' right activist, Father Peter O'Neill from
Chungli, a city 70 kilometers south of Taipei, said that caregivers
are often work intensively, and are deprived of their own life.</P>
      <P>"They sometimes only have two days off a month," O'Neill said.</P>
      <P>Father O'Neill said that he intended to bring as many as 350 Thai
and Filipino workers to the march, but only 200 came in the end
because of bad weather.</P>

      <P>After more than three years of hard work,
engineers and workers have succeeded in boring a four-kilometer
tunnel under Taipei's Sungshan Airport and a ceremony will be held
Monday to mark a big step toward launching train services of the
14.8-kilometer rapid transit line.</P>
      <P>The city's Department of Rapid Transit Systems said the shield
tunnel, that passes through the airport, the No. 1 national
expressway and the Keelung River, has been an enormous challenge
because construction could not affect airport operation.</P>
      <P>As a result of the extraordinary control of construction quality,
it noted, the tunnel caused a mere 0.3-centimeter subsidence for the
airport runway. The special explosion-proof structure of the tunnel
further ensures airport safety, the department added.</P>
      <P>The Neihu Line was approved by the Cabinet on August 7, 1993 as
an elevated medium capacity transit system. Starting from the north
end of the Mucha line, just north of Chungshan Junior High School
Station, the route runs elevated along Fuhsing North Road and turns
right at Mintzu East Road heading for the Sungshan Airport. It then
goes underground on the southern side of the airport.</P>
      <P>When completed, the route will end at the Nangang Software Park.
Its total length will be approximately 14.8 kilometers with 12
stations and one maintenance depot. The construction budget is over
NT$6.6 billion.</P>

      <P>Doing so may be in your own interest, as in the example the
National Tax Administration cited Sunday to explain the details about
a tax return.</P>
      <P>A foreigner was hired to teach English on a two-year contract but
decided to leave for another job after staying in Taiwan 190 days
from May to November.</P>
      <P>Anyone who has stayed in Taiwan for 183 days or more a year is
called a "resident" who must pay tax. If his or her spouse stays, she
or he has to file their joint tax return in May next year.</P>
      <P>Now this gentleman's employer has deducted 10 percent from his
monthly salary as pre-paid income tax, totalling NT$19,032.</P>
      <P>According to the government rules, an income tax payer enjoys
full deductible amount of NT$75,000 for the 2004 income. He is
entitled to other deductibles that are calculated by the percentage of
190/365, which amounted to NT$6,1424.</P>
      <P>After deducting NT$6,1424 and NT$75,000 from his total income of
NT$190,320, his taxable income is NT$53,209. The tax rate for that
level of income is 6 percent, so he needs just to pay NT$3,234 in
income tax to the Taiwan government.</P>
      <P>Since his employer has deducted NT$19,032 from his pay check, he
is eligible for a NT$15,798 refund. In this case, then, it pays to
file a tax return.</P>

      <P>Hualien police found two naked female
corpses on a river bed Dec. 11. The police suspects these two cases
to be relevant, and were both strangled before towed to the place
they were left.</P>
      <P>A first corpse was discovered around six in the morning by an old

second one was discovered by the police around ten o'clock in less

underpants.</P>
      <P>The police suspects that the two female were first strangled to
death, then taken to the river bed and left there. No indication

    <HEADLINE>DPP SHOULD DUMP IDEA OF NEW ECONOMIC MEETING AFTER ELECTION LOSS: LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration should scrap the idea of organizing another national
economic development conference in light of its poor performance in
the Dec. 3 local government elections, former President Lee Teng-hui
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>In a news conference called by a pro-independence group, the
Northern Taiwan Society, Lee asserted that the message sent out by
voters in the DPP's drubbing is to stop the wrongfooted policy of
engagement with China in economics, and to focus on Taiwan's identity
and the strengthening of the country's defenses.</P>
      <P>The proposed national economic development conference may provide
local businessmen a springboard to pressure the government to further
soften its restrictions on economic ties with China. Given that the
DPP is still licking its wounds from the defeat and could cave in to
this appeal, the party should just deep-six the whole idea of having
the conference, Lee maintained.</P>
      <P>At the request of local industrial groups, President Chen
Shui-bian promised on Nov. 22 to organize such a conference on an as
yet unspecified date.</P>
      <P>Lee said, the ruling party lost the elections because it deviated
from its core principles and not because of other, unrelated issues.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP campaigned on a promise to rename the country
as Taiwan during the 2004 legislative elections, Lee said the ruling
party has disappointed its supporters by never trying to fulfill its
promise after the elections.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, Lee said, the DPP administration contradicted
its promise. Citing as evidence, the former president named President
Chen Shui-bian's promises of not altering the country's status quo
during his 2000 inaugural speech, and Premier Frank Hsieh's
acknowledgement that there is only China according to the country's
Constitution.</P>
      <P>He urged President Chen to stop flip-flopping on policy towards
China and win back the people's confidence by placing a premium on
Taiwan's interest while laying down any policy.</P>
      <P>In the Dec. 3 elections, the DPP has seen the number of counties
and cities it controls decreased from 9 before the elections to six.</P>

laws and maintain order by enforcing those laws by punishments, you
can also make the people keep away from wrongdoing, but they will
lose the sense of shame for wrongdoing. If, on the other hand, in
government you depend upon moral sentiment and maintain order by
encouraging education and good manners, the people will have a sense
of shame for wrongdoing and, moreover, will emulate what is good."</TEXT>

      <P>The series of cave-ins at Kaohsiung's rapid
transit construction sites were partly the result of the Kaohsiung
Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) ignoring its own professional report
alerting it to quite a number of missteps, an opposition lawmaker
claimed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chiu Yi, an independent legislator elected in Kaohsiung, quoted a
Taiwan Construction Research Institute (TCRI) report, which was
completed in May, as saying that underground hydraulic data was not
taken into account by designers of the MRT routes and that the
quality of construction work was questionable.</P>
      <P>The report, which was commissioned by the KRTC, further pointed
out that the KRTC had not made a good evaluation of subsidence
incidents, had not monitored well the work done by shield machines,
and had not been able to prevent water leakage in underground
connecting routes.</P>
      <P>All these "defective" construction records seem to have
originated from a poor building plan and the lack of a geological
improvement plan, according to the TCRI report.</P>
      <P>The TCRI is a non-profit organization that aims to promote
advanced construction ideas and technology and to improve
construction standards in Taiwan. It also plays a key coordination
role between foreign and local construction agencies.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the report had recommended forming an ad hoc group of
experts to monitor the whole process of building the Kaohsiung MRT
system but the ruling Democratic Progressive party (DPP) opposed the
idea.</P>
      <P>He said the KRTC has ignored the TCRI's safety alerts and refused
to suspend construction work for a comprehensive safety check-up,
eventually leading to a series of site cave-ins. Two such incidents
occurred within the last week.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin, Jorge Liu and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Representative Office in the
United States refused Monday to comment on a case related to the
guilty plea made in U.S. federal court by a former ranking U.S.
official, stressing that the island's relations with the United
States will not be affected by the case.</P>
      <P>The office made the remarks after learning that Donald W. Keyser,
former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state, had entered a guilty
plea in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia.</P>
      <P>Keyser, who was arrested last year by U.S. justice authorities,
admitted in court to deliberately concealing from his superiors that
he had taken a trip to Taiwan last September and that he had
maintained an intimate personal relationship with a female Taiwanese
intelligence officer. The former official also admitted that he had
taken confidential State Department documents without authorization.</P>
      <P>The court document did not mention whether Keyser had passed on
classified files to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Even though Stanley Kao, Taiwan's deputy representative to the
United States, refused to comment on the Keyser's case, a spokesman 
of Taiwan's representative office said that relations between the 
island and the United States will continue to be promoted through 
the current channels and will not be affected by the case.</P>
      <P>David Lee, Taiwan's representative to the United States, is
currently in Taiwan to report in person his official duties.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a high-ranking official of the office who wished to
remain anonymous said that he was shocked by Keyser's sudden guilty
plea as the former U.S. official had consistently maintained his
innocence.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the Taiwan official said that Keyser's personal
relationship with the intelligence officer had nothing to do with
their work and did not compromise Taiwan or the United States in any
way, adding that Taiwan's National Security Bureau has never
requested that its staff do anything in an inappropriate way.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taiwan should work to further strengthen its
communications with the United States instead of trying to obtain
intelligence information from the country, pointing out that the
United States is a close ally and that nothing should be done in a
surreptitious manner.</P>
      <P>Keyser faces a possible prison sentence of up to 13 years and a
maximum fine of US$500,000. The federal court is set to issue its
ruling on the case Feb. 24.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, State Department Adam Ereli said, the department

      <P>Yang said in the statement that he hopes the WTO ministers
meeting will do something to improve farmers' fortunes.</P>
      <P>Yang Tzu-chun, an assistant professor at Chinese Culture
University and spokeswoman for the support-Yang Ju-men coalition,
said the "rice-bomber" was engaging in the hunger strike to protest
"the WTO's exploitation of the disadvantaged."</P>
      <P>Yang said she is worried that the detention center authorities
will force-feed the hunger striker and prevent people from visiting
him.</P>
      <P>At the Taipei Detention Center, officials have alerted doctors to
give Yang "necessary nutrition" and take "necessary steps" to save
his life.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Peng Ming-hui, another Tsinghua University professor,
read the three appeals of the coalition:</P>
      <P>--The government should help farmers use non-toxic pesticides,
fertilizers and technology in farming;</P>
      <P>--Stop imports of sub-quality farm products in order to protect
Taiwan farmers and consumers;</P>
      <P>--Abolish the exploitation mechanism working at the upstream and
downstream areas of agricultural production so as to reinvigorate
Taiwan's farming industry.</P>
      <P>At the coalition's press conference, quite a number of university
students wore masks of Yang Ju-men, who is appealing his seven-year
sentence, chanting slogans in support of him and of saving Taiwan's
agriculture.</P>
      <P>Yang was sentenced in the first trial on charges of threatening
public security for placing bombs at several public locations. Yang
had said he did so in order to raise public awareness of the plight
of Taiwan's farmers.</P>
      <P>The students pledged to "become more Yang Ju-mens in fighting for
the younger generation and for farmers" if the government does not
respond quickly to their demands.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking official of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Tuesday that the party's
legislative caucus will set up a panel to review the party's failure
in last Saturday's city and county chief elections in order to win
back the support of the public.</P>
      <P>William Lai, a DPP caucus whip in legislature, made the remarks
in the wake of the party's setback in last week's elections in which
it only garnered six of the 23 city mayor and county magistrate posts
up for grabs. The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) won 14 of the posts.</P>
      <P>Those present at the caucus's meeting held at the Legislative
Yuan included Interior Minister Shih Mao-lin and Investigation Bureau
Director Yiia Shan-mao.</P>
      <P>Lai said after the meeting that he was glad to see that members
of the caucus were demonstrating the spirit of democracy by
presenting both criticisms and suggestions regarding the elections.</P>
      <P>Noting that democracy, reform, and integrity have been the DPP's
core values since its founding, Lai stressed that the party will keep
walking along this path, adding that future policies for the country
will also be discussed by the panel.</P>
      <P>Chao Yung-ching, another DPP whip in the legislature, while
hailing law enforcement authorities for their efforts in cracking
down on vote-buying and maintaining social order during the campaign
period for the elections, expressed the hope that the police and
investigation authorities can play a more active role in future
elections.</P>
      <P>According to Chao, the DPP caucus will put a premium on the
intra-ministerial investigations into vote-buying and make the issue
"a movement of all the people."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ALLOWANCE FOR ELDERLY FARMERS TO BE HIKED TO NT$5,000 PER MONTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed a revised
statute Tuesday to raise the monthly allowance for elderly farmers to
T$5,000 (US$149.25) from the present NT$4,000 starting Jan. 1, 2006.</P>
      <P>The move to hike the monthly allowance for elderly farmers by
NT$1,000 has been stalled in the legislature for some time because of
financing problems.</P>
      <P>Legislative speaker Wang Jin-pyng invited legislators from across
the political spectrum for consultations Tuesday and the revised bill
was able to clear the legislature after lawmakers reached a consensus
that the central government would shoulder the additional cost of
NT$1,000 for each farmer in 2006.</P>
      <P>The legislators also agreed that after 2006, the central
government and the municipalities will each shoulder half of the
costs of the monthly allowance for elderly farmers, while the budgets
for elderly farmers in each city and county will be entirely
shouldered by the central government.</P>
      <P>The legislators also passed a resolution requesting that the
government establish a farmers' pension system to take care of
elderly farmers in the same fashion as the pension program for
retired military personnel, civil servants and teachers, as well as
laborers.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture said that the number of elderly
farmers eligible for the monthly allowance is around 700,000 this
year, and the money distributed as of Nov. 30 has hit NT$30.43
billion (US$908.45 million).</P>
      <P>The government estimates that there will be 10,000 additional
seniors on the roll next year and it has already appropriated a
budget of around NT$34.2 billion for the monthly allowance payments.
After the hike, the payments will be increased to around NT$42.8
billion, or an additional NT$8.6 billion, which will be entirely
financed by the central government.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior will issue new
forgery-proof identification cards to approximately 19 million
citizens from Dec. 21 until Dec. 31, 2006, ministry officials said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The officials urged the public to renew their ID cards according
to the time and venue given them by local household registration
offices to shorten their waiting time.</P>
      <P>Similar to credit cards in size, the new ID cards will have 21
forgery-proof features, they said. For example, the shape of Jade
Mountain and Taiwan as well as the MOI emblem are imbedded images on
the card, while a butterfly pattern can be seen by slanting the ID
cards.</P>
      <P>The name column of the new identification cards will have enough
room for up to 15 Chinese characters or 20 Roman letters, which will
make it easier for aboriginal people to use their traditional names
on their new ID cards, they said.</P>
      <P>To make it convenient for the public to renew their ID cards,
local household registration staff will collect the photos and
deliver the ID cards for disabled people who cannot apply for their
new ID cards in person, they said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, photo-taking services will be provided free of charge
to citizens from low or medium-low income families, they added.</P>
      <P>According to Interior Minister Su Jia-chyuan, the government has
before this renewed ID cards in 1947, 1954, 1966, 1976 and 1986.</P>
      <P>The MOI had initially planned to renew the ID cards starting July
1 this year and to require fingerprinting from all applicants, but
the plan was postponed until December after some ruling Democratic
Progressive Party legislators requested a constitutional
interpretation by the Council of Grand Justices over the
controversial policy, Su pointed out.</P>
      <P>The Council of Grand Justices ruled on Sept. 28 that the
fingerprinting policy was unconstitutional, prompting the MOI to drop
it.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Scholars from China and Taiwan will gather
in Taipei next April to discuss ways to promote "exchanges" of the
simplified and traditional Chinese characters that are used on each
side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Liao Hsien-hao, director of the city's Department of Cultural
Affairs, said Tuesday that some Chinese scholars are calling for
"restoring" the use of traditional Chinese characters in China since
the historical backgrounds have changed for adopting the simplified
characters.</P>
      <P>In the face of rapid changes in information technology, he said,
both sides of the Strait should take a practical and scientific
attitude toward Chinese characters, a key component of Chinese
culture.</P>
      <P>During the upcoming "Chinese Character Cultural Festival, " he
noted, academics will discuss the issue from the perspectives of
information dissemination, language teaching and cultural
inheritance.</P>
      <P>Some attention will be focused on problems with teaching the
Chinese characters and difficulties in learning the traditional or
simplified Chinese characters, Liao added.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan and China develop their own information platforms,
efforts could be made to facilitate reading of both styles of Chinese
characters by, for example, developing software that can easily
"switch" between the two, which would be a big breakthrough in
cross-strait cultural exchanges, department officials said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
Tuesday lauded the historic meeting between the leaders of Taiwan's
two largest opposition parties, saying that their pledge to continue
cooperating will ensure a majority for the "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) in the legislature.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and PFP Chairman James Soong had a
four-hour meeting behind closed doors Monday night to discuss a
possible merger of the two parties. They told news media after the
meeting that the KMT and the PFP will strengthen their cooperation in
the run-up to an eventual merger, possibly in 2007.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the meeting failed to achieve its intended purpose,
Wang said that he felt it was a very good thing for the two parties
to step up cooperation because this would ensure that the "pan-blue
alliance" will continue to enjoy a majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Wang, however, declined to comment on a timetable for the KMT-PFP
merger, saying that he was not in a position to offer an opinion.</P>
      <P>According to the secretaries-general of the KMT and the PFP, who
briefed the media Monday night, there are legal problems that need to
be sorted out before the merger. They said that one of the
conclusions reached at the meeting was that Ma and Soong pledged to
maintain the "pan-blue alliance's" majority in the legislature
before the final merger.</P>
      <P>The merger issue was brought forth again by some PFP legislators
after the Dec. 3 local government elections, in which PFP candidates
saw an increasing trend of their party being marginalized in Taiwan's
politics.</P>
      <P>The PFP was founded by Soong in 2000 after he -- a member of the
KMT at the time -- ran as an independent in the presidential election
that year but failed.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT and the PFP have worked closely, as they are
both against Taiwan independence and favor Taiwan's eventual
unification with China, their relationship has sometimes become
strained, especially in election years, because they have to compete
for support from the same voter pool.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An ROC diplomat admitted on Wednesday that
the case concerning a former ranking U.S. official, who admitted
Tuesday in court his guilt on three charges in connection with
Taiwan's intelligence personnel, affects Taiwan-U.S. relations, but
the damage is under control.</P>
      <P>David Lee, Taiwan's representative to the U.S., made the remarks
at the Legislative Yuan. He returned to Taipei from Washington, D.C.
to give a report.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he believes Donald W. Keyser, former U.S. deputy
assistant secretary of state in charge of East Asian affairs, entered
a guilty plea in exchange for a reduction in sentencing.</P>
      <P>His lawyer must have negotiated with the court, since the U.S.
government would not want details of the case to become public to
protect state secrets, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Keyser, who was arrested last year by U.S. justice authorities,
admitted in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, to deliberately
concealing from his superiors that he had taken a trip to Taiwan last
September, and that he had maintained an "undisclosed personnel
relationship" with a female Taiwanese intelligence officer since
September 2002.</P>
      <P>The former official also admitted that he had taken confidential
documents away from the State Department without authorization. He
confessed that his actions had made him vulnerable.</P>
      <P>Keyser, 62, was arrested Sept. 15, 2004 as he was delivering
documents to two officials of Taiwan's National Security Bureau at a
riverbank restaurant in a suburban of Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he had contacted the U.S. State Department many
times since Keyser was arrested to declare that the last thing the
Republic of China government would do was to illegally collect
intelligence on U.S soil.</P>
      <P>"So far, the communication channel [between the U.S. and Taiwan]
is still open," he noted.</P>
      <P>Keyser faces a possible prison sentence of up to 13 years and a
maximum fine of US$500,000. The federal court is set to issue its
ruling on the case Feb. 24.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) is currently revising a law to allow the
private sector to run airports, an MOTC official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Billy K.C. Chang, director-general of the ministry's Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA) , noted that some have suggested
privatizing airports, as only government agencies or local
governments are allowed to run airports under current civil aviation
law.</P>
      <P>Under a planned revised law, the private sector, including
foreign investors, will be allowed to operate airports, Chang said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the revision of the law still must be approved
by the Legislative and Executive Yuans.</P>
      <P>The CAA estimated that there are currently 18 air terminals in
Taiwan, and among them, only CKS International Airport makes money
and the others are losing money.</P>
      <P>If the private sector is allowed to run CKS International
Airport, the CAA estimated that its yearly revenues should reach at
least NT$12 billion (US$358.2 million). Among them, NT$6 billion will
be given to the CAA to finance the expenses of related agencies.

    <HEADLINE>RESOLUTION PASSED TO CLAMP DOWN ON ILLEGAL FISHING PRACTICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan adopted a resolution
Tuesday demanding that prosecution and investigation authorities look
into the matter of local tuna fishing ships' use of flags of
convenience in order to clear Taiwan's name after the country was
accused of overfishing and poaching by the international community.</P>
      <P>The resolution calls for the authorities to comprehensively
investigate all the local fishing boats flying a flag of a third
country that have allegedly overfished on the high seas or
intentionally under reported their catch.</P>
      <P>Ships found to have engaged in such illegal practices must be
punished in accordance with the law, including revocation of their
fishing licenses, lawmakers said in the resolution.</P>
      <P>The resolution was passed at a time when the Western and Central
Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), of which Taiwan is a member, is
holding its annual meeting in Micronesia Dec. 12-16.</P>
      <P>The WCPFC conference is the second such international fisheries
meeting in a month. The International Commission of the Conservation
of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) held a meeting on Nov. 20 during which it
decided to cut Taiwan's annual bigeye tuna catch quota in the
Atlantic, from 149,000 metric tons to 4,600 metric tons for 2006,
following complaints by Japan about Taiwan's overfishing.</P>
      <P>Many in Taiwan's deep-sea fishing sector fear that further
punishments may be meted out against the country at the ongoing WCPFC
meeting.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) introduced the resolution in order to display Taiwan's
determination to wipe out illegal fishing practices by local boats in
international waters.</P>
      <P>The resolution, which calls for a strict crack down on "illegal,
unreported and unregulated (IUU) " fishing practices, also urges the
government to ensure that the domestic deep-sea fishing industry to
abide by the ICCAT decision on reducing Taiwan's bigeye tuna fishing
fleet in the Atlantic.</P>
      <P>Earnings from illegitimate practices by local fishing boats in
international waters must be dealt with in line with international
norms, the resolution further urges.</P>
      <P>Fisheries Administration officials commented later the same day
that what the legislative resolution has pointed out is correct and
that the administration has been working on a draft aimed at
regulating Taiwan fishing boats' practices on the high seas.
Violators could be sentenced to jail terms from three to seven years.</P>
      <P>The resolution would compel the government to step up its pace in
dealing with the IUU fishing vessels, the officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN AND CHINA URGED TO INCREASE INTERDEPENDENCE IN TRADE, ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China should strive toward
increasing mutual dependency in trade and economy while Taiwan adopts
a more open attitude to China, aiming at creating better economic
benefit, scholars suggested Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Asia Foundation in Taiwan (AFIT) and the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) organized the 2005 International Forum on Prospects in
Asia that was held Dec. 13. The forum initiated discussions by
scholars coming from the United States, Japan, Indonesia, Hong Kong,
South Korea, Singapore and Macau. Talks were about "The Rise of China
and the Future of the Asia-Pacific Region."</P>
      <P>Professor Ishihara Kyoichi of the Graduate School of Humanities
and Social Sciences from Japan's Kobe University said that China has
a great influence on Japan regarding economy and trade despite the
tense diplomatic relations they currently have.</P>
      <P>"Chinese products flow into Japan and cause our small and medium
enterprises to go bankrupt and the unemployment rate to rise. But
this doesn't interfere in the economic and trade relation between the
two countries. Both will strive to deepen cooperation in terms of
exchanges on technology and industry in the future, " Ishihara said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on coping with China's threat caused by its growing
economy, military and political power, Ishihara said, "We have to
excel in the high-tech domain and develop each of our small and
medium enterprises' characteristics. Each enterprise or industry
should have its own specialty."</P>
      <P>Ishihara said that with the specialty that each enterprise owns,
more economical benefits can be created when conducting exchanges
with China.</P>
      <P>"Mutual dependency on trade and economy with China is important
for both Taiwan and Japan," he added.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan should make efforts to change China by increasing
exchanges with it in all aspects. China is already following the
steps toward a free market, but it is still not democratized.
Countries around it such as Taiwan might propose that it should adopt
a democratic system as well," Ishihara said.</P>
      <P>Ishihara said that in the distant future, the Taiwan-China
relationship could become "two countries, one system," then transform
to "one country, one system."</P>
      <P>Shafiah Fifi Muhibat, a researcher at the Centre for Strategic
and International Studies (CSIS) in Jakarta said that the countries
of the Association of South East Asian Countries (ASEAN) cope with
China's growing power by moving as a group to gather more bargaining
power.</P>
      <P>ASEAN now counts 10 countries: Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam and
Thailand.</P>
      <P>"ASEAN does not only see China as a threat. It tries to include
it in their framework and they cooperate in terms of economy and
security. China is especially interested in security cooperation
under the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) , and it is aware that ASEAN
takes the driver's seat in that domain," Muhibat said.</P>
      <P>The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) is the principal forum for
dialogue regarding security issues in Asia.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Investment in China carries both risk and
opportunity, Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council,
said Tuesday while promoting a new book on the subject.</P>
      <P>The MAC commissioned eight scholars to co-author the new book,
which assess the risks in China from the aspects of social stability,
business investment, tourism, overseas studies as well as the living
environment. The 197-page book is a compilation of 44 articles.</P>
      <P>Wu said that as MAC chairman he has the responsibility to remind
the public of the inherent social risks in the mainland amid close
cross-strait trade exchanges. Taiwan's businessmen have invested
billions of dollars in the mainland.</P>
      <P>"I'm not deliberately speaking ill of China, " Wu said, adding
that the inherent risks in China "have become so big that they are
not to be overlooked."</P>
      <P>Wu cited the recent shooting of villagers of Dongzhou, Shanwei
City in southern Guangdong province by Chinese security forces. The
people were protesting construction of a local wind power plant.</P>
      <P>A series of local clashes with the authorities in China have
highlighted the problems within China, saying that China needs to
establish a political system that will make the government
accountable to its people, Wu said.</P>
      <P>"We have reason to believe that the clashes in Dongzhou were the
result of political strife within the Chinese leadership, resulting
in a loss of control at the local level," he said.</P>
      <P>He cited the statistics revealed in international meetings as
saying that similar clashes in China totaled more than 74,000 last
year, and a large number of them have had to do with farmland,
highlighting the problems within China's system.</P>
      <P>Wu also pointed to the recent benzene spill in the Sunghua River
in northeastern China, the growing number of AIDS patients as well as
the existence of avian flu outbreaks in China to highlight the risks
there.</P>

Wall Street Journal: Global Standoff In Trade Talks, Western
Farmers Hold Their Ground

As trade ministers from the 149-member World Trade Organization
meet this week in Hong Kong, the bargain is running into resistance
from western farmers as well as multinationals - from banks to auto
makers. So far, Western farmers are prevailing over the corporate
behemoths, even though agriculture accounts for a tiny fraction of
economic output in developed economies. The pain for agriculture from
any deal would be far more concentrated than the gain for service and
manufacturing companies. Farmers, with their very livelihoods at
stake, have been far more aggressive and effective in moving to
thwart the trade round than the multinationals have been lobbying to
advance it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Water supply is expected to remain stable
in the first half of 2006 in Taiwan, in light of the satisfactory
water reserves at local reservoirs and water flow in rivers
islandwide, Water Resources Agency (WRA) officials forecast on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In the northern region, water supply in the Taipei area will be
sufficient, with the reserves at the Feitsui Reservoir currently
amounting to 87.47 percent and water flow in the Keelung River
maintaining normal levels, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The reserves at Shihmen Reservoir, which mainly supplies water to
the Taoyuan area, is at 83.83 percent, they said, adding that they
expect no water shortages in the spring next year but fear shortages
might occur if rainfall fails to appear after March.</P>
      <P>Water supply in the Hsinchu area will also be sufficient, as the
water flow in the Touchien River is normal and the reserves at the
Paoshan Reservoir are at 95.48 percent, they said.</P>
      <P>In the central region, the reserves at the Yungheshan, Liyutan,
Tehchi, Wushe, Sun Moon Lake Reservoirs are all at more than 70
percent, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In the southern region, the reserves at the the Lantan and Jenyi
Reservoirs together are at 80 percent; that of the Nanhua Reservoir
is at 80 percent; and the reserves at Tsengwen and Wushantou
Reservoirs are also at 70 percent, they said.</P>
      <P>On outlying islands, there will be no water shortages in Kinmen
in the first half of next year, while water supply is a little tight
on Penghu, the officials said. However, they said water will be
sufficient before March in Penghu and that water treatment at
Penghu's desalination plant will be increased in case of a water
shortage.</P>
      <P>While first-stage water restriction measures have been imposed in
Matsu, the WRA will transport water there from Taiwan proper if
reserves at local reservoirs drop below 80,000 tons, they said.</P>

      <P>Hualien police have arrested one man
accused of murdering a teenaged girl while three of his friends
allegedly strangled the girl's friend as she was made to watch her
friend's death in an apparent act by a spurred lover.</P>
      <P>Police said Tuesday that the three men are still at large.</P>
      <P>The bodies of the two girls, aged 13 and 15, were found in a
riverbed near the Shueiyuan Bridge in Hualien on Dec. 11 wearing only
their underwear. Police originally suspected that one or both of them
might have been sexually assaulted, but subsequent investigations
discounted this theory.</P>
      <P>Police confirmed that the 13-year-old victim, surnamed Lee, was
strangled to death as she was made to watch her friend, surnamed
Chen, who was hit with a rock wrapped in cloth and then strangled.</P>
      <P>According to police, the suspect, surnamed Kuo, 21, was Chen's
former boyfriend. Kuo, who confessed to the murder, plotted to kill
Chen after her parents strongly opposed their relationship and had
him brought up on charges of statutory rape. While the civil side of
the case was settled out of court by having Kuo pay NT$100,000 in
compensation, the criminal verdict was pending in court.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 11, Kuo and his three friends asked Chen to take a walk
and talk over the case, as Kuo was hoping that the girl would
intervene and end the criminal case against him.</P>
      <P>In the end, things did not go Kuo's way and he smashed her in the
head with a rock wrapped in an article of clothing, which he then
used to suffocate her.</P>
      <P>During this, according to police, Chen's younger friend was also
strangled by one or more Kuo's accomplices.</P>
      <P>The four men then dumped the two bodies in the riverbed.</P>

      <P>Chen Chi-min, convener of the the Prosecutors' Reform
Association, said the appointment of the public prosecutor-general by
the president should be subject to the approval by the legislature so
that the nation's highest law enforcement official may become more
neutral when executing his public duties.</P>
      <P>As a measure to make him less susceptible to influence from the
president, the public prosecutor-general should serve a guaranteed
one six-year term, which should not overlap fully with the tenure of

      <P>He urged that all local governments, as well as the central
government, should refrain from intervening in any investigation by
public prosecutors.</P>
      <P>The Alliance of Fairness and Justice pointed out that Taiwan has

    <TEXT>
      <P>A former senior official at the State
Department admitted in court Monday that he had a personal
relationship with a Taiwanese woman intelligence official stationed
in Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>While pleading guilty to several charges to a court in Alexandra,
Virginia, Donald Keyser, former deputy assistant secretary of state
for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said he felt sorry for concealing
from his superiors at the State Department his trip to Taiwan in 2003
for a secret meeting with Taiwan intelligence official Isabelle
Cheng, with whom he said he developed a personal relationship in the
course of his official duties in the State Department.</P>
      <P>Keyser said he didn't report his Taiwan trip because he didn't
want to disclose the extent of this personal relationship with Cheng
to others, particularly his wife.</P>
      <P>Although the 62-year-old veteran diplomat said he knew his
relationship with the 31-year-old Cheng might make him vulnerable to
coercion, or exploitation from a foreign government, he claimed no
effort to exploit him was ever made.</P>
      <P>In his guilty plea, Keyser also admitted that he unlawfully
removed classified documents from the State Department but claimed
that he didn't disclosed them to anyone, and none of this had
anything to do with Cheng.</P>
      <P>Keyser who faces up to 13 years in prison, will be sentenced on
Feb. 24, 2006.</P>
      <P>FBI agents trailed Keyser in the summer of 2004 and found him
meeting with Cheng frequently at restaurants around Washington, D.C.
and exchanging papers with her.</P>
      <P>He was charged with lying about his trip to Taiwan on Sept. 15,
2004 and retired from the State Department 15 days later.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who works for Taiwan's National Security Bureau, was
called back by Taiwan authorities after the incident. The National
Security Bureau has refused to comment on the case from the
beginning, and has not disclosed Cheng's whereabouts.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Minister of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) Ho Mei-yueh on Tuesday attended the World Trade
Organization (WTO) Doha round ministerial-level meeting in Hong Kong,
and exchanged views with ministers of several countries on a variety
of topics.</P>
      <P>According to ROC Vice Economics Minister Chen Ruey-lung, who also
formed part of the ROC delegation, Ho met two of the WTO's deputy
secretaries-general -- Harsha V. Singh and Alejandyo JARA -- to
exchange views regarding the ministerial meetings scheduled for Dec.
13-18, after arriving in Hong Kong Monday.</P>
      <P>Ho and the WTO's two deputy secretaries-general expressed hope
that the ministers of WTO member states can reach consensus on
agricultural, non-agricultural and service sectors so that the
conclusions can be included in the declaration of the Hong Kong
ministerial meeting.</P>
      <P>At a lunch held after the opening ceremony of the meeting, Ho had
the chance to talk with her Canadian and Singaporean counterparts,
with Ho exchanging views with the Canadian minister about the further
liberalization of Canada's forest products, and discussing with the
Singaporean minister the further opening of service industries around
the world.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Taiwan, which has just implemented several
opening measures of its markets that it promised upon entering the
WTO, hopes that it can enjoy more flexible policies given to new
members.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, all the agricultural product importers of the
WTO expressed hope that they can reach consensus as soon as possible
to push for agricultural reforms, so that they can complete the Doha
round of talks by 2006.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs will
levy a supply fee on hot springs water suppliers starting Jan. 1,
officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The supply fee will be NT$9 per ton, but it will be halved to
NT$4.5 during the first two years of the policy's implementation,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>The Water Resources Agency currently only has the records of
245 suppliers, with more than 50 percent of the suppliers who
actually make a profit by selling the natural resource to hot springs
bathhouse operators yet to be identified, they said. They estimated
that the government will be able to collect NT$50 million to NT$60
million in supply fees next year.</P>
      <P>Also starting Jan. 1, the ministry will levy a water resources
preservation fee of approximately NT$0.5 per cubic meter on water
companies, which will be used to maintain 107 restricted water
reserve areas islandwide, the officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAN ARRESTED IN MURDER OF 2 GIRLS IN HUALIEN(repeat)</HEADLINE>

      <P>Hualien police have arrested one man
accused of murdering a teenaged girl while three of his friends
allegedly strangled the girl's friend as she was made to watch her
friend's death in an apparent act by a spurred lover.</P>
      <P>Police said Tuesday that the three men are still at large.</P>
      <P>The bodies of the two girls, aged 13 and 15, were found in a
riverbed near the Shueiyuan Bridge in Hualien on Dec. 11 wearing only
their underwear. Police originally suspected that one or both of them
might have been sexually assaulted, but subsequent investigations
discounted this theory.</P>
      <P>Police confirmed that the 13-year-old victim, surnamed Lee, was
strangled to death as she was made to watch her friend, surnamed
Chen, who was hit with a rock wrapped in cloth and then strangled.</P>
      <P>According to police, the suspect, surnamed Kuo, 21, was Chen's
former boyfriend. Kuo, who confessed to the murder, plotted to kill
Chen after her parents strongly opposed their relationship and had
him brought up on charges of statutory rape. While the civil side of
the case was settled out of court by having Kuo pay NT$100,000 in
compensation, the criminal verdict was pending in court.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 11, Kuo and his three friends asked Chen to take a walk
and talk over the case, as Kuo was hoping that the girl would
intervene and end the criminal case against him.</P>
      <P>In the end, things did not go Kuo's way and he smashed her in the
head with a rock wrapped in an article of clothing, which he then
used to suffocate her.</P>
      <P>During this, according to police, Chen's younger friend was also
strangled by one or more Kuo's accomplices.</P>
      <P>The four men then dumped the two bodies in the riverbed.</P>
      <P>Police have also yet to recover the murder weapon or the missing
clothing.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former senior official at the State
Department admitted in court Monday that he had a personal
relationship with a Taiwanese woman intelligence official stationed
in Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>While pleading guilty to several charges to a court in Alexandra,
Virginia, Donald Keyser, former deputy assistant secretary of state
for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said he felt sorry for concealing
from his superiors at the State Department his trip to Taiwan in 2003
for a secret meeting with Taiwan intelligence official Isabelle
Cheng, with whom he said he developed a personal relationship in the
course of his official duties in the State Department.</P>
      <P>Keyser said he didn't report his Taiwan trip because he didn't
want to disclose the extent of this personal relationship with Cheng
to others, particularly his wife.</P>
      <P>Although the 62-year-old veteran diplomat said he knew his
relationship with the 31-year-old Cheng might make him vulnerable to
coercion, or exploitation from a foreign government, he claimed no
effort to exploit him was ever made.</P>
      <P>In his guilty plea, Keyser also admitted that he unlawfully
removed classified documents from the State Department but claimed
that he didn't disclosed them to anyone, and none of this had
anything to do with Cheng.</P>
      <P>Keyser who faces up to 13 years in prison, will be sentenced on
Feb. 24, 2006.</P>
      <P>FBI agents trailed Keyser in the summer of 2004 and found him
meeting with Cheng frequently at restaurants around Washington, D.C.
and exchanging papers with her.</P>
      <P>He was charged with lying about his trip to Taiwan on Sept. 15,
2004 and retired from the State Department 15 days later.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who works for Taiwan's National Security Bureau, was
called back by Taiwan authorities after the incident. The National
Security Bureau has refused to comment on the case from the
beginning, and has not disclosed Cheng's whereabouts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUCCESS OF WEAPONS PROCUREMENT BILL HINGES ON ADMINISTRATION: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The success of the arms procurement bill
hinges on the decisions made by the administration rather than on
U.S. opinions, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>After the bill was once again blocked in the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan Tuesday -- the 41st time since
it was presented to the legislature in 2004 -- Ma said that it is
unclear whether the Executive Yuan will make changes to the bill or
not, but one thing that is clear is that the issue of the NT$480
billion (US$14.55 billion) arms procurment package is a matter for
the government to decide on, and not the United States.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in reponse to media reports that quoted
sources in Washington as saying that the procurement bill for the
three major U.S. weaponry items -- six PAC III Patriot anti-missile
batteries, eight diesel-fueled submarines and 12 anti-submarine
aircraft -- would be more workable and pragmatic if the budget for
the whole package were included in the Ministry of National Defense's
regular annual budget rather financed by a special budget as proposed
by the Democratic Progressive Party government.</P>
      <P>The current Executive Yuan-proposed bill calls for the first item
to be included in the ministry's regular annual budget and the other
two items to be financed through a special budget.</P>
      <P>Asked by reporters whether the KMT -- the main opposition party
in the Legislative Yuan -- would support the bill if all the items in
the package were included in the defense ministry's regular annual
budget, Ma said that the bill would be acceptable to all the parties
that are currently opposing the bill because of the special budget.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma, who has been advocating a speedy handling of the
KMT-held assets issue since he took the KMT helm in August this year,
said that the proposed liquidation of the KMT's shares in China
Television Co. and the China Broadcasting Corp. as well as other
KMT-run companies has been intensely discussed and that the KMT
headqurters will inform the public as soon as concrete plans are
worked out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOONG CRITICIZES REMARKS MADE BY PFP MEMBERS WANTING TO LEAVE PARTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taoyuan,  Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong on Wednesday criticized what he called the
inappropriate remarks made recently by those PFP members who want to
leave the party and join the Kuomintang (KMT), saying that they don't
have to describe the PFP as such an unbearable party.</P>
      <P>The criticism came after several PFP members said Tuesday that if
the PFP really wants to merge with its "pan-blue" ally the KMT, it is
best to do so as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Soong, who made the criticism prior to his departure for Malaysia
to attend a "Global Peace Forum" being held by former Malaysian
Premier Mahathir Mohamad, said that the nature of the PFP is quite
different from that of the KMT, adding that the PFP is a party that
has its own ideas and an insistence on rationality and a "midway
concept."</P>
      <P>According to Soong, the KMT's rule in Taiwan for nearly 50 years,
including the period when Lee Teng-hui was president, had many
negative impacts on the island.</P>
      <P>He further said that during his meeting with KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou Monday, he mentioned to Ma that certain policies adopted by
the KMT during Lee's presidency, including Lee's "state-to-state"
theory and the freezing of the Taiwan Provincial Government's
operations, contributed to the end of Taiwan's "golden age," and that
the KMT should engage in some self-examination regarding these
matters.</P>
      <P>Soong also said that the two parties should insist on the pathway
toward building peace across the Taiwan Strait for the sake of the
people's welfare.</P>
      <P>Regarding the several PFP members who intend to leave the party,
Soong said that leaving earlier or later is not a problem as he
already made it clear while meeting with Ma that the PFP and the KMT
will do all they can to cooperate with each other in the Legislative
Yuan and that, as Ma said, they cannot stop members from leaving the
party if they want to do so.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the PFP has more than 80 members working in the
Legislative Yuan and in legislative bodies of local governments, as
well as many more in the civil service, Soong said that "the PFP must
respect their will."</P>
      <P>Soong also said that he knows the Taiwan people want to see the
PFP and KMT merge as this will give Taiwan better prospects.</P>
      <P>He also advised those PFP members who made the "senseless
remarks" Tuesday that they should think of the Taiwan people and work
to create a better future for them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER URGES LEGISLATURE TO PASS MAJOR BILLS ASAP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh on Wednesday urged the
Legislative Yuan to pass major bills, including the arms procurement
bill, as soon as possible as the current legislative session is set
to draw to an end at the end of this month.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks during a Cabinet meeting, noting
that although the legislature has passed several major bills,
including a minimum tax system and a revised statute to raise the
monthly allowance for elderly farmers, there are still many urgent
bills that need to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>He cited the long-stalled arms procurement bill as well as the
organic bill of the Executive Yuan as examples, saying
that if the legislators have different views, they can revise the
bills, instead of simply boycotting them.</P>
      <P>The arms procurement package -- which includes six PAC III
Patriot anti-missile batteries, eight diesel-fueled submarines and 12
anti-submarine aircraft from the United States -- has been blocked in
the legislature for more than a year by the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party which
holds a slight legislative majority.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Legislative Yuan dramatically cut the central
government's budgets for next year during its initial review, the
premier also asked for consultations between the ruling and the
opposition parties to reinstate the budgets so as not to affect the
operations of government agencies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the premier said that the Cabinet will continue to
push for its ongoing reform programs in the wake of the Dec. 3 local
elections. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) suffered a
humiliating defeat in the islandwide elections, managing only six of
the 23 city mayor and county magistrate posts up for grabs. The KMT
won 14 posts.</P>
      <P>"There are winners and losers in elections, but the ongoing
reforms will not stop as a result of the elections outcome, " Hsieh
said, urging the public not to lose faith in the Executive Yuan and
the ruling party.</P>
      <P>The reform programs promoted before the elections will continue,
he said, including the changes to the pension system for retired
military personnel, civil servants and teachers, and the crackdown on
the illegal practice of retired civil servants including their years
serving in the KMT in filing for their pension payments.</P>
      <P>Also, although several cities and counties will have new chiefs
following the elections, the partnership relations between the
central and local governments will remain unchanged, the premier
said.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet will take the initiative in providing assistance in
the implementation of the platforms of newly elected mayors and
magistrates if necessary, Hsieh said, adding that the administration
should serve the people irrespective of party affiliation.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also expressed the hope that the outgoing mayors and
magistrates, who now are basically serving caretaker roles following
their election defeats, will not make decisions on major development
projects.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. WOULD LIKE TO SEE BEIJING OFFICIAL VISIT TAIWAN: ROC REP</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. government would like to see
Beijing's top official in charge of Taiwan affairs visit Taiwan, but
it also thinks that the Beijing official should meet with his Taiwan
counterpart, Taiwan's representative in the United States said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan Foreign Affairs
Committee meeting, David Lee said that as far as he knows, Washington
favors a visit to Taiwan by Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan
Affairs Office under China's State Council, this month at the
invitation of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) for an economic forum
between the KMT and the Communist Party of China.</P>
      <P>Lee added, however, that U.S. authorities have also hinted that
during his visit in Taiwan, Chen should also meet with Joseph Wu,
minister of the Mainland Affairs Council, to engage in official
dialogue.</P>
      <P>Lee further said that it is Washington's set policy to encourage
China and Taiwan to engage in peaceful dialogue as part of efforts to
address differences between the two sides.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. thinks that it would be good if Chen could visit
Taiwan, but it would be undesirable if Chen failed to meet with Wu
during his visit," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he conveyed this message clearly to the Democratic
Progressive Party government prior to the Dec. 3 "three-in-one"
elections, in which the KMT won a sweeping victory.</P>
      <P>The KMT has applied to the MAC for a permit for Chen's proposed
visit to Taiwan, but the MAC authorities have said that the holding
of official negotiations is a precondition to them granting approval.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SHAPES POSITIVE IMPRESSIONS OF TAIWAN: GALLUP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,   Dec.   13  (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic achievements,
especially its technological development, may have helped shape
positive global impressions of the country, the Gallup Organization
said in a report posted Tuesday on its Web site.</P>
      <P>The study was conducted by Gallup for the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in New York based on a survey carried out in May and
June in the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, France and
Germany. The targets included 1,500 members of the general public and
200 opinion leaders in each country.</P>
      <P>Although only 15 percent to 44 percent of the general public in
these countries know "some" or "a great deal" about Taiwan, most of
them have "very favorable" or "favorable" impressions of Taiwan, the
survey shows. In particular, the impressions of Taiwan are
"favorable" among 76 percent of the respondents in Japan, 73 percent
in the United States and 68 percent in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>The survey also discovered that the favorability ratings of
Taiwan are generally higher than those of China and South Korea, but
lower than those of Japan.</P>
      <P>The survey indicates that opinion leaders were more likely than
the general public to know something about Taiwan and view it
favorably, with more than 90 percent of those surveyed in Japan and
the United States having a very favorable or favorable impression of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While most of the respondents have obtained information about
Taiwan from media sources such as television, newspapers and
magazines, 68 percent in the United Kingdom, 58 percent in France and
54 percent in the United States have learned about Taiwan through its
products.</P>
      <P>The study says that it does not seem likely that the contrast
between democratic Taiwan and communist China has boosted positivity
toward Taiwan, in light of the fact that only 29 percent of the
general public in the United States, 27 percent in the United
Kingdom, 23 percent in France, and 33 percent in Germany are aware
that Taiwan has a democratic political system.</P>
      <P>However, many members of the general public agree that Taiwan is
"technologically developed" and "has good food, interesting
attractions and beautiful scenery."</P>
      <P>By comparison, higher percentages of opinion leaders are aware of
Taiwan's democratic status and describe Taiwan as a technologically
developed and economically strong country and a good place for
business investment, according to the survey.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ENVOY EXPECTS PROGRESS IN TRADE TALKS WITH U.S.  NEXT SPRING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Progress in Taiwan's efforts to engage in
free trade talks with the United States is expected next spring when
the two sides negotiate on a trade and investment framework agreement
if Taiwan seriously addresses the various issues of great concern to
the U.S. side, David Lee, Taiwan's representative to Washington, said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a report to the Foreign Relations Committee of the Legislative
Yuan, Lee said that Taiwan has to respond appropriately to U.S.
concerns about the island's trade practices in an effort to persuade
Washington to begin FTA talks.</P>
      <P>Noting that the United States is one of Taiwan's most important
trade partners, with two-way trade amounting to US$56 billion last
year, Lee said a free trade agreement would not only benefit both
parties, it would also encourage other countries to follow
Washington's lead and conclude similar pacts with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Washington prioritizes the countries with which it wants to
engage in FTA talks based on considerations of the country's
strategic significance and trade importance to the United States, as
well as U.S. public opinion and the country's contribution to
advancing the World Trade Organization's Doha round of trade talks.</P>
      <P>In formulating its strategy in dealing with the United States on
pushing for FTA talks, Lee said Taiwan should take into consideration
the effects on Washington's position of Beijing's opposition to such
an agreement and of the fact that the U.S. Trade Promotion Act is set
to expire July 1, 2007.</P>
      <P>Lee predicted that successful talks with the United States on the
trade and investment framework next spring will certainly encourage
Washington to move on the path toward a free trade agreement with
Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKER OPPOSES EXTENSION OF STATUTE ON TPG STREAMLINING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By Lilina Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A statute concerning the streamlining of
the Taiwan Provincial Government should not be extended until the end
of next year, since doing so would waste further money, a lawmaker
from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wu Fu-kuei and former members of the now-abolished
National Assembly Wang Chin-shan and Chuang Sheng-jung, as well as
Taiwan Solidarity Union Deputy Secretary-General Liu Yi-teh called a
news conference to call attention to the issue after the Executive
Yuan asked the Legislative Yuan to extend the statute for another
year.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the original plan to downsize the Taiwan Provincial
Government called for its completion in three stages over a period of
two years.</P>
      <P>The statute should have become invalid on Jan. 1, 2001 at the
latest, Wu said. After that, the organization, functions, and
administrative affairs of local-level governments would have returned
to normal, in accordance with regulations in the Law on the Local
Government System.</P>
      <P>But he said that the Executive Yuan has for the sixth consecutive
year asked for an extension of the statute, and has continued to
appropriate a large sum of money for the Taiwan Provincial Government
to continue operations.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that since the start of the downsizing project of
the Taiwan Provincial Government six years ago, the nation has spent
NT$6.3 billion on it and NT$975.63 million for the Taiwan Provincial
Consultative Council.</P>
      <P>He also said that before the streamlining of the Taiwan
Provincial Government, it still had NT$7.6 billion allocated by the
central government left at its disposal, but only NT$1 billion is
left now, and that no one knows the whereabouts of the remaining sum.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the Taiwan provincial government is not really
needed and that the purpose of retaining it is simply to arrange
people to serve in the posts.</P>
      <P>On July 1, 1999, the Taiwan Provincial Government was downsized
and divided into six sections, five offices, two committees and 13
affiliated organizations. The 149 administrative units, 36 health
care organizations and 170 provincial high schools originally listed
under the provincial administration have been re-categorized as units
of the Central Government.</P>
      <P>Also, 58 organizations were either eliminated or merged.
Altogether, 16 former Taiwan Provincial Government departments were
transformed into regional offices of the ministries and agencies
under the Executive Yuan and three under the Examination Yuan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
heavyweights convinced Vice President Annette Lu Wednesday to stay on
as acting head of the party.</P>
      <P>Lu was named as the acting chair of the party on Dec. 7 after the
former chairman, Su Tseng-chang, quit on Dec. 3 to take
responsibility for the party's poor showing in the local elections
the same day.</P>
      <P>Lu wanted to take a leading role in re-constructing the party
after the DPP took only six of the 23 local chief seats up for grabs,
but was admonished by the Central Standing Committee, which told her
that as a caretaker of the party, her only job was to preside over
the election of a new chairman.</P>
      <P>Lu took this a sign from President Chen Shui-bian that he
disapproved of her doubling as the DPP's acting chief, so she
resigned.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh, a member of the DPP's Central Standing
Committee, said at the end of the weekly meeting of the committee
Wednesday that Lu had been persuaded by members to withdraw her
resignation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LU THANKS ORGAN DONOR WHILE MAKING VEILED COMMENT ON POLITICAL ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu honored the
memory of a deceased 18-year-old university student and praised his
family Wednesday for showing their "great love" by donating his
organs to help others, but apparently couldn't stop from mixing in a
bit of politics along the way.</P>
      <P>Lu made her remarks after attending the memorial service for
Hsiao Chih-chien, a Chinese Culture University student who died Nov.
26 in a traffic accident and became the first organ donor to the Tzu
Chi Hospital in Taipei.</P>
      <P>At least six people have benefited from operations using Hsiao's
liver, heart, kidneys and corneas. His bones are being kept at
another Tzu Chi Hospital, ready for marrow transplants for the
benefit of more patients.</P>
      <P>Lu said Hsiao and his family made the decision out of "compassion
and wisdom." On the other hand, she said, "The man in charge -- the
one that wields power -- to our regret, has ignored the value of life
as he concentrates on immediate power, probably because of
short-sightedness."</P>
      <P>Lu's remarks taken alone would be nothing short of bizarre, which
is why political observers said that she was most likely using
not-so-veiled language to take a jab at the current speculation about
her relations being somewhat rocky with the president.</P>
      <P>Asked by a journalist, "Are you feeling a sense of frustration?"
Lu said: "Hsiao's great love and great compassion [to let go of
everything] was exemplary; however, I cannot but help feel a strong
sense of ridiculousness about the recent political commotion."</P>
      <P>Her apparently tense relations with President Chen Shui-bian and
other Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) heavyweights in the days
leading up to her quitting the post of acting chairwoman of the
ruling party have been closely watched by political pundits.</P>
      <P>However, in a Wednesday meeting of the DPP Central Standing
Committee, Lu agreed to stay on as acting chairwoman of the party,
according to Premier Frank Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Even opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou came forward to
urge the two top leaders to stop issuing statements through the media
to criticize each other, claiming that "it is not in the best
interests of the country."</P>
      <P>Chang Chun-hsiung, a former premier and DPP chairman, said both
Chen and Lu are "outstanding political figures" who, he believes,
"have the wisdom to solve their problems."</P>
      <P>Premier Hsieh said he hopes the ruling party's internal squabbles
regarding the acting chairmanship will not affect the ruling team's
normal administrative work.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also tried to take some pressure off the president,
claiming that Lu was not specifically referring to President Chen and
could be referring to himself as premier, since the Cabinet leader is
also "the man in charge."</P>
      <P>Hsieh said all members of the ruling team are reflecting on what
they did wrong leading up to the election defeat on Dec. 3, and he
would like to thank Lu for her "instruction."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must do more so that U.S. Congress
members can understand the real issues and not be swayed by the
intense lobbying efforts by China, ROC representative to the United
States David Ta-wei Lee said in Taipei Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Reporting to the Legislative Yuan's Foreign and Overseas Chinese
Affairs Committee, Lee pointed out that Beijing has been advancing
its lobbying efforts towards the U.S. Congress and the public in
recent years.</P>
      <P>For example, the Chinese Embassy in the United States has
assigned staff specifically to contact members of the U.S. Congress,
and the National People's Congress of China has also enhanced
exchanges with the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, Lee
noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, Beijing has also contracted with several U.S. public
relations firms to help improve China's image and conduct political
lobbying on behalf of China, Lee said.</P>
      <P>In terms of cultural and artistic exchanges, he continued,
China's Ministry of Culture held a one-month "Festival of China" in
October in cooperation with the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. to carry out intensive soft and
public diplomacy.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Beijing's lobbying efforts have given the
people a " romanticized version" of China, something Taiwan ought to
be concerned about.</P>
      <P>Also in recent years, the United States has been paying extra
attention to issues surrounding the rise of China, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Although overall relations between Beijing and Washington are
getting closer and closer, conservatives and liberals alike are
having misgivings about the Chinese Communist regime, he said.</P>
      <P>While conservatives are concerned about China's military buildup,
the lack of religious freedom in China and its efforts to seek energy
sources from other countries, liberals are critical of the lack of
transparency in China's system as well as the country's failure to
uphold social justice and human rights and to protect the
environment, he said.</P>
      <P>However, he predicted that bickering will be unavoidable between
Beijing and Washington, which will limit the effects of China's
lobbying efforts because China is unlikely to improve its major
defects in the political, economic and social aspects in the near
future.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, he suggested that Taipei try to
enhance its relations with Washington by strengthening the values of
democracy and freedom that are shared by Taiwan and the United
States, maintaining friendly relations with the U.S. government,
reinforcing Taiwan's resolve to defend itself and promoting the
signing of a Taiwan-U.S. free trade agreement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AT-LARGE LEGISLATIVE SEATS AN ISSUE WITHIN 'PAN-BLUE' MERGER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A merger by the two opposition "pan-blue"
alliance parties --- the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party
(PFP) --- would not necessarily mean that the number of seats of
legislators-at-large would be reduced, KMT Legislator Lee Ching-hua
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the Ministry of the Interior has informed him that
should a merger take place, the "pan-blue" alliance's at-large seats
would not be cut, and the subsidies given to the resulting party can
be lumped together. Lee said there should be a good reason to justify
opposition to merger.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, PFP Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung said that his
party would lose seven seats once the KMT and PFP merges unless
legislation pending is passed, according to a document the Central
Election Commission (CEC) gave the party in June 2004.</P>
      <P>The CEC said that the Public Officials Election and Recall Law
and a Council of Grand Justice's ruling both stated that if a
legislator elected according to the proportional representation
system loses his party registration, he loses at the same time his
position as a legislator.</P>
      <P>But the CEC also pointed out that the Political Party Law which
the Executive Yuan proposed to the Legislative Yuan on Sep. 13, 2002,
states that in the case of a merger between parties, the legislators
elected according to the proportional representation system will not
be affected. However, this law has yet to be approved by the

    <HEADLINE>MAC TO STUDY KMT THINK TANK PETITION ON BEIJING OFFICIAL'S VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will
study a petition by an opposition Kuomintang (KMT) think tank
advocating allowing a top Beijing official to visit Taiwan to take
part in an economic conference, MAC Vice Chairman Johnnason Liu said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Saying that the MAC just learned of the petition from the Bureau
of Immigration, Liu said that the MAC will give a clear explanation
of the issue after having gained a better understanding of the
petition submitted by the KMT think tank. The petition asks the
government to rethink its decision to disallow Chen Yunlin, director
of the Taiwan Affairs Office under the State Council in Beijing, from
coming to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu's remarks came after a Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman
reiterated at a regular news briefing in Beijing earlier the same day
that the KMT and the Communist Party of China (CPC) would hold an
economic forum as planned in Taipei and he asked relevant Taiwan
authorities to provide necessary assistance.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the CPC were slated to hold the economic forum in
Taipei on Dec. 15, but Chen's visa application, filed by the KMT, was
turned down on Nov. 18 during a screening meeting held by the Bureau
of Immigration. Chen is Beijing's No. 1 official responsible for
Taiwan affairs.</P>
      <P>The KMT-CPC forum would be the first of its kind after Taiwan

a follow-up activity after former KMT Chairman Lien Chan paid a
landmark visit to China in spring this year -- hailed by many as one
of the most significant steps toward improving relations across the
Taiwan Strait in more than 50 years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and
Communications Lin Ling-san said Wednesday his ministry will
carefully inspect every aspect of the Kaohsiung rapid transit system
before giving it the go-ahead to open.</P>
      <P>"We will also move ahead our schedules for examining the work on
the rapid transit routes to ensure that no one will ever have to be
concerned about the safety while taking the MRT, " he told lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Huang Chao-shun asked him
during a legislative committee meeting to suspend the construction of
the southern port city's MRT lines in the wake of a series of
cave-ins.</P>
      <P>Lin said the cave-in must be filled in but the building job
cannot stop; one reason being that six shield machines were still
working on underground tunnels. "If they are stopped immediately,
they might sink into the earth," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang, not satisfied with Lin's replies, threatened to freeze the
NT$70 billion budget earmarked for the remaining work on the MRT
project if the Ministry of Transportation and Communications does not
halt the construction and begin comprehensive inspections.</P>
      <P>Lin said the ministry has already sent a senior technician, Liao
Ching-lung, to act as leader of the Kaohsiung City Government's MRT
Examination Team, which will monitor the building process.</P>
      <P>He pledged to look into all aspects of the MRT system once the
construction has been completed as well as do some advance checks to
ensure complete safety for passengers.</P>
      <P>Huang asked committee chairman Legislator Lin Teh-fu of the
People First Party to invite all Transportation and Communications
Committee members to inspect the building sites next week along with
safety experts and engineering specialists in the company of Lin.</P>
      <P>If Lin does not even allow that, the NT$70 billion budget should

    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic growth this year should be 3.8
percent, lower than the original goal of 4 percent, the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The officials attributed the failure to reach the goal to
weaker-than-expected exports in the first half of the year, resulting
in only 2.73 percent economic growth in the first six months.
Economic growth in the latter half of the year should climb to 4.83
percent, they said. The officials also said that the jobless rate
should be 4.1 percent this year in the wake of various job-creation
programs promoted by the government.</P>
      <P>They also said that because of soaring oil prices as well as the
the sharp increase of fruit and vegetable prices, the consumer price
index increase for this year should reach 2.23 percent, higher than
the original estimate of 2 percent.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, the officials said that the economic growth next

    <HEADLINE>DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT TRANSPORTATION LINKS MUST PROCEED GRADUALLY: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that direct "three links" between Taiwan and China should be pursued
in a gradual manner, with sea links coming before air links and cargo
shipments coming before passenger transportation.</P>
      <P>Meeting a group of visitors from the Atlantic Council of the
United States, Chen repeated his administration's position with
regard to launching postal, air and sea links across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>"If government-to-government negotiations cannot start, and if
China insists on dealing with the opposition in disregard of Taiwan's
government, it would be extremely difficult to expect any progress
[in advancing the 'three links']," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen said a breakthrough was reached early this year for charter
flights during the lunar new year holidays, but China immediately
wanted to follow suit with a proposal for opening up direct air
services across the Strait, a proposal that is "regrettable."</P>
      <P>He promised that to deal with trade and economic exchanges across
the Strait, the government will "do its best in every aspect" in
promoting the "three links." However, he stressed that things must go
forward gradually.</P>
      <P>The reason is that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have a very
special relationship, which dictates that Taiwan must not rush in
doing many things because it must safeguard its national security and
the people's overall interests, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Under that logic, he noted, the "three links" must not be carried
out without a precedent within the "mini three links" as have been
carried out between Kinmen and Xiamen, and full passenger flights
must not be provided without a successful experience in charter cargo
flights.</P>
      <P>He repeated his basic stance on cross-strait affairs -- stand
firm but go forward practically. Based on that principle, he said the
government will not dance to China's tune because "Taiwan is a
sovereign country with its own government whose public authorities
must not be downgraded."</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Tuna Association does not
want to see a domino effect take place at the current meeting of the
Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) regarding
overfishing by Taiwan's fishing boats, an association spokesman said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Out of a fear that the WCPFC might also sanction Taiwan over its
fishing practices in international waters during its current annual
conference being held in Micronesia through Friday, the association
has thoroughly assessed the situation and has sent personnel to the
WCPFC meeting to explain Taiwan's efforts and measures.</P>
      <P>Experts at the meeting will immediately relay the latest
developments to the association to allow it to swiftly draw up
countermeasures amid grave concerns that the WCPFC, of which Taiwan
is a member, will also punish Taiwan, following in the footstep of
the International Commission of the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna
(ICCAT), the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>As the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) is slated to call its
annual meeting in February next year, the association has repeatedly
asked more than 300 Taiwan fishing boats currently operating in the
Pacific and the Indian Ocean to be extremely self-disciplined, he
noted.</P>
      <P>Due to Taiwan's failure to bring its illegal, unreported and
unregulated fishing boats under control, the ICCAT decided to impose
a cut in its quota for Taiwan's bigeye tuna fish catch by around 70
percent during its annual conference last month, forcing Taiwan to
reduce the number of its bigeye tuna fishing boats operating in the
Atlantic to 15 for 2006.</P>
      <P>The ICCAT punishment is expected to deal a serious blow to the
domestic deep-sea fishing industry, which has some 520 fishing
vessels operating in the world's major fishing grounds.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has not used women as bait to obtain
intelligence information, an official of the National Security Bureau
(NSB) said Wednesday, because it is "not a permissible practice."</P>
      <P>Huang Kuang-hsun, deputy head of the NSC, made the remarks when
he and other officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) were
invited by the legislative caucus of the opposition People First
Party to report on a case concerning a former senior official of the
U.S. State Department.</P>
      <P>Media reports said that Donald W. Keyser, former deputy assistant
secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, pleaded guilty
Monday after being released in September 2004 and later released on
bail to unlawfully removing classified United States documents from
the Department of State and to two counts of making false official
statements -- concealing his Taiwan trip as well as "close ties of
affection" with Isabelle Cheng, an intelligence official of the NSB
stationed in Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Keyser who faces up to 13 years in prison, will be sentenced on
Feb. 24, 2006.</P>
      <P>FBI agents trailed Keyser in the summer of 2004 and found him
meeting with Cheng frequently at restaurants around Washington, D.C.
and exchanging papers with her.</P>
      <P>He was charged with lying about his trip to Taiwan on Sept. 15,
2004 and retired from the State Department 15 days later.</P>
      <P>Huang, who was a former NSB representative to the U.S. before
transferring to his present post in August 2005, said that he has
reported the case to David Ta-wei Lee, the Republic of China
representative to the U.S.</P>
      <P>Lee asked him to cooperate fully with the United States to help
clarify the case.</P>
      <P>Lee, after communicating with the U.S. State Department and
lawyers, believed that communication between nations was essential
and this is why Taiwan handed over to the U.S. the records of
Keyser's talks with Taiwan officials, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the U.S. only has the information that Taiwan's
Representative Office has supplied it.</P>
      <P>It is very unlikely that the U.S. court displayed the copies of
the top secret documents from Taiwan as reports have said, Huang
said, adding that the U.S. has also not taken the initiative to ask
Taiwan to supply information.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Wu-chiao, deputy director-general of the Department of
North American Affairs, said that MOFA's stance is that it is not
appropriate for it to comment on the case, which is a judicial case
in the U.S.</P>
      <P>The bottom line of the ministry is that this entire affair will
not be detrimental to bilateral relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POPE CALLS FOR NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Rome,  Dec.  13 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Pope Benedict XVI callled for nuclear
disarmament Tuesday, stressing that in a nuclear war there would be
no victors, only victims.</P>
      <P>In his message for the World Day of Peace, the Pope said that the
truth of peace requires that all, whether those governments which
openly or secretly possess nuclear arms, or those planning to acquire
them, agree to change their course by clear and firm decisions, and
strive for a progressive and concerted nuclear disarmament.</P>
      <P>The resources which would be saved from the disarmament could
then be employed in projects of development capable of benefiting all
their people, specially the poor, he added.</P>
      <P>Those governments which count on nuclear arms as a means of
ensuring the security of their countries are erroneous, he
criticized.</P>
      <P>The Pope also expressed his worries about a continuing growth in
military expenditure and the flourishing arms trade. "How can there
ever be a future of peace when investments are still made in the
production of arms and in research aimed at developing new ones? " he
asked.</P>
      <P>It can only be hoped that the international community will find
the wisdom and courage to take up once more, jointly and with renewed
conviction, the process of disarmament, and thus concretely ensure
the right to peace enjoyed by every individual and every people, the
Pope noted.</P>
      <P>Referring to the terrorism, the Pope condemned the terrorists for
their senseless and deadly strategies. Nowadays, he said, the truth
of peace continues to be dramatically compromised and rejected by
terrorism, whose criminal threats and attacks leave the world in a
state of fear and insecurity.</P>
      <P>The nihilism and the religious fanaticism or the fundamentalism
can inspire and encourage terrorist thinking and activity, he pointed
out, adding that despite of their different origins and cultural
backgrounds, both show a dangerous contempt for human beings and
human life, and utimately for God himself.</P>
      <P>In analyzing the causes of the contemporary phenomenon of
terrorism, consideration should be given not only to its political
and social causes, but also to its deeper cultural, religious and
ideological motivations.</P>
      <P>The Pope also expressed his support for the creation of an
international humanitarian law as a means of limiting the devastating
consequences of war as much as possible. "The international
humanitarian law ought to be considered as one of the finest and most
effective expressions of the intrinsic demands of the truth of
peace," he noted.</P>
      <P>The Pope urged all Catholics to place themselves at the service
of peace in broad cooperation with other Christians, the followers of
other religions and with all men and women of good will.</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will
respect the due authority's handling of a planned visit to Taiwan by

statement.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Beijing-based Taiwan Affairs Office Director Chen
Yunlin's plan to take part in an economic forum in Taipei with main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) officials, the MAC said that it will
leave the case to be decided in compliance with the law by the
authority in charge.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Immigration under the Ministry of the Interior
decided on Nov. 18 to turn down Chen's visa application, filed by the
KMT's National Policy Foundation, in a screening meeting out of
consideration of the current state of cross-Taiwan Strait relations
and international norms.</P>
      <P>As Chen's visit to Taiwan would carry a great deal of political
connotation, Taiwan had made it clear that official negotiations
between the two sides were indispensable to adequately deal with the
case, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman called on Taiwan authorities
earlier the same day to provide necessary assistance to make Chen's
visit possible, as the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the KMT
would hold the economic forum as scheduled in Taipei.</P>
      <P>A report saying that the forum would be held in another place is
incorrect, and Beijing has learned that a KMT thinktank has submitted
an admistrative petition asking the government on Taiwan to rethink
its refusal of Chen's visit, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>At the head of scores of Taiwan Affairs Office officials, Chen
was previously slated to participate in the forum in Taipei on Dec.
15 -- an agreement reached between the KMT and the CPC early this

      <P>Officials of the Taiwan Tuna Association
said Wednesday that they will bite the bullet and accept the
compensation proposed by the government for the tuna fishing boats
forced to suspend their operations, although they are not satisfied
with the arrangement.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks following the decision made by the
Legislative Yuan that the government should pay each tuna fishing
boat which is forced to suspend their operations an annual
compensation of NT$7.5 million (US$224,820) , up from the original
NT$5.97 million.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan made the decision after the International
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) decided in
its annual meeting in November that Taiwan's bigeye tuna fishing
quota in the Atlantic Ocean be cut from 14,900 tons in 2005 to 4,600
tons for next year, under the proposal by Japan who claimed that
Taiwanese tuna fishing boats are overfishing.</P>
      <P>Under the new ICCAT regulations, only 15 of Taiwan's tuna fishing
boats operating in the Atlantic Ocean will be allowed to continue
their operations.</P>
      <P>An additional 20 of the vessels will fish for longfin tuna
instead, and the remaining 42 should suspend operations or have their
boats dismantled.</P>
      <P>According to the Taiwan Tuna Association, approximately NT$14
million or NT$15 million would be sufficient to compensate the tuna
fishing boats affected by the new international regulations.</P>
      <P>Huang Chao-chin, chief of Taiwan Tuna Association, said that now
that the government has made the decision, boat owners can do little
but accept the situation.</P>
      <P>Noting that many tuna fishing companies just own one boat each,
Huang said the new ruling will affect their livelihood, stressing
that it will be the coldest winter ever for the domestic tuna

      <P>The long-stalled U.S. arms procurement
package could be put forward in a regular annual military budget
instead of a special one, two opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Ting Shou-chung said that it would be acceptable
for the annual military budget to be increased to 3 percent of GDP,
and the planned special military budget for the long-stalled arms
procurement package could be integrated into the military's regular
budget plan.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Shuai Hua-Ming said that he would also be happy to
see the annual military budget be increased to 3 percent of GDP.</P>
      <P>"We have had a shortfall in our annual military budget for a long
time. It would have been better if the budget money was spent on
national defense rather than on elections," he said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. weapons procurement package has yet to even be reviewed
in a legislative committee because of opposition by the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party, 
which has a slight majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>It was reported that the U.S. government is no longer asking that
the military procurement pass the legislature as an entire package,
adding that Taiwan should increase its annual military budget to more
than 3 percent of GDP as a substitute plan.</P>
      <P>However, two other KMT legislators, Pan Wei-Kang and Su Chi, were
cool about the proposal.</P>
      <P>Pan said that it will be up to the Executive Yuan to decide on
the ratio of increased spending if the special military budget is to
be changed to an annual conventional budget.</P>
      <P>Su doubted that the U.S. would interfere that much in Taiwan's
internal affairs and he suspects that some people are bluffing on
this issue. He said that a U.S. official he met in October this year
briefed him on the background of the procurement plan and he thinks
that the U.S. respects Taiwan's decision on the issue.</P>

Wall Street Journal: Cold War Echo,
U.S. Weighs Whether to Build Some New Nuclear
Warheads

Some 15 years after the Cold War, and at a
time when the U.S. is demanding others restrain
their nuclear ambitions, the Bush administration
thinks that the U.S. needs new nuclear weapons.
With little notice, it has been pressing
Congress to fund research into a new generation
of nuclear weapons. awmakers have twice turned
down proposals to design a new nuclear
"bunker-buster" bomb, to blow up buried caches
of weapons. But last month, with little debate,
Congress approved US$25 million for research
into what is supposed to be a sturdier, more
reliable warhead than those designed during the
Cold War. If the work is successful, the U.S.
could someday spend billions of dollars
replacing much of the current arsenal.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>WITH PUBLIC MANDATE, ANY FORM OF CROSS-STRAIT TIES POSSIBLE: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  14  (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reiterated
Wednesday that with public mandate, the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait could develop any form of relations in the future.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with a delegation from the
Atlantic Council of the United States.</P>
      <P>Reiterating that Taiwan is an independent sovereign state and by
no means subject to the jurisdiction of China, Chen said that with
the consent of the 23 million Taiwan people, any form of cross-strait
ties is possible in the future.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chen also emphasized the importance of
democracy, saying that if Taiwan were to accept the "one country, two
systems" formula, it could lose its hard-fought liberal democracy.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years, Chen said he has on numerous occasions
held out olive branches in hopes of normalizing bilateral ties. Past
experiences showed that it's extremely difficult to push for
normalization of cross-strait ties, Chen said, because the Chinese
people have traditionally attached great importance to the name or
designation.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government in Beijing would not recognize that Taiwan
is a sovereign state officially named as the Republic of China, Chen
said, adding that for China, the ROC has been annihilated and Taiwan
is part of the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Beijing cherished "one China" principle is
unacceptable because it denies the ROC's continued existence as an
independent sovereign country in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN NEVER USED WOMEN AS BAIT TO OBTAIN INFORMATION: NSB(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has not used women as bait to obtain
intelligence information, an official of the National Security Bureau
(NSB) said Wednesday, because it is "not a permissible practice."</P>
      <P>Huang Kuang-hsun, deputy head of the NSC, made the remarks when
he and other officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) were
invited by the legislative caucus of the opposition People First
Party to report on a case concerning a former senior official of the
U.S. State Department.</P>
      <P>Media reports said that Donald W. Keyser, former deputy assistant
secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, pleaded guilty
Monday after being released in September 2004 and later released on
bail to unlawfully removing classified United States documents from
the Department of State and to two counts of making false official
statements -- concealing his Taiwan trip as well as "close ties of
affection" with Isabelle Cheng, an intelligence official of the NSB
stationed in Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Keyser who faces up to 13 years in prison, will be sentenced on
Feb. 24, 2006.</P>
      <P>FBI agents trailed Keyser in the summer of 2004 and found him
meeting with Cheng frequently at restaurants around Washington, D.C.
and exchanging papers with her.</P>
      <P>He was charged with lying about his trip to Taiwan on Sept. 15,
2004 and retired from the State Department 15 days later.</P>
      <P>Huang, who was a former NSB representative to the U.S. before
transferring to his present post in August 2005, said that he has
reported the case to David Ta-wei Lee, the Republic of China
representative to the U.S.</P>
      <P>Lee asked him to cooperate fully with the United States to help
clarify the case.</P>
      <P>Lee, after communicating with the U.S. State Department and
lawyers, believed that communication between nations was essential
and this is why Taiwan handed over to the U.S. the records of
Keyser's talks with Taiwan officials, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the U.S. only has the information that Taiwan's
Representative Office has supplied it.</P>
      <P>It is very unlikely that the U.S. court displayed the copies of
the top secret documents from Taiwan as reports have said, Huang
said, adding that the U.S. has also not taken the initiative to ask
Taiwan to supply information.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Wu-chiao, deputy director-general of the Department of
North American Affairs, said that MOFA's stance is that it is not
appropriate for it to comment on the case, which is a judicial case
in the U.S.</P>
      <P>The bottom line of the ministry is that this entire affair will
not be detrimental to bilateral relations.</P>

      <P>Independent Legislator Chiu Yi on Thursday

chairwoman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) a day
earlier, to make good on her "five commitments to the people."</P>
      <P>Chiu said Lu had promised to the people that she would form a
private-sector alliance to investigate alleged corruption in
connection with the construction of Kaohsiung's rapid transit system,
hold a public hearing on the controversy about "unusual DVDs"
allegedly aimed at besmirching Chu Li-lun, the Kuomintang's (KMT's)

the KMT's candidate for Taichung mayor in the elections.</P>
      <P>Lu has also promised to investigate "stock playing" at the
Presidential Office led by former deputy chief of staff to the

    <HEADLINE>DPP RULES DON'T BAN ACTING CHAIR FROM RUNNING: DPP SECRETARY-GENERAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>All eyes are on Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Acting Chairwoman Annette Lu to see whether she runs for
the party's chairmanship in the Jan. 15 election.</P>
      <P>Precedents suggest that she won't run, but DPP Secretary-General
Lee Yi-yang said Thursday that the party's rules do not prohibit an
acting chief from doing so.</P>
      <P>Lee said that those who are interested in running for the DPP
chairmanship must register Dec. 16-20 after depositing a registration
fee of NT$1.5 million.</P>
      <P>Lee said he believes the upcoming chairmanship election will be a
multiple-candidate race, unlike the previous election in January,
2005 when Su Tseng-chang ran uncontested. Su stepped down as chairman
after the DPP was defeated in the Dec. 3 local government elections.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chai Trong-rong, who is also a DPP Central Standing
Committee member, has expressed a definite interest in running, while
Legislator Lin Chung-mo has not "excluded the possibility" of joining
the race. Another possible candidate, according to media reports, is
Presidential Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun, but he has yet to make
clear his intentions.</P>
      <P>As for Vice President Lu, she has openly said that she has no
intention of running. However, many people are not ruling her out as
a possible candidate. After all, she had clearly stated Wednesday
prior to the DPP Central Standing Committee (CSC) meeting that she
would quit as acting chairwoman but then later emerged from the
meeting and confirmed that she had accepted the CSC's invitation to
stay on in the post.</P>
      <P>Lee said the DPP is the most democratic party in Taiwan, noting
that it began the tradition of electing a chairman through a direct
vote by party members.</P>
      <P>Expecting quite a heated race, Lee said the party will hold
televised debates to give party members a clear picture of each of
the candidates' platforms and personal styles before voting day.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An aide to Presidential Office
Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun confirmed Thursday that Yu will quit
his current job and run for the chairmanship of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Yu will tender his resignation to President Chen Shui-bian and
announce his candidacy in the coming days, the aide said. Candidates
must register between Dec. 16-20.</P>
      <P>The aide, who asked not to be named, said Yu made the decision
after being persuaded by party heaviwieghts that his personal
qualities, including tolerance, will give the DPP a boost at a time
when party members are feeling low as a result of the party's recent
defeat in the local government elections.</P>
      <P>After a lot of thought, Yu has decided to work to rebuild the
DPP's image as a party of "political integrity and hard work" that
symbolizes the Taiwan people's love of their native land, according
to the aide.</P>
      <P>Yu, who was the longest serving premier in the Chen Shui-bian
government, thinks he is fit to serve in the chairman post which
calls for an unselfish dedication to uniting the party in order to
push ahead reform programs, the aide said.</P>
      <P>The party is scheduled to hold a vote among party members Jan. 15
to elect the new leader. Vice President Annette Lu is currently

    <TEXT>
      <P>People First Party (PFP) Legislator
Christina Y. Liu asked the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp. Thursday to
look into alleged "unfair disclosing of information" by United
Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) in Taiwan and in the United States.</P>
      <P>Liu said UMC had been asked by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission to restate its financial reports for 2002-2004 but did not
disclose the information to Taiwan investors. "What is the TSE going
to do about this?" she asked.</P>
      <P>If the TSE does nothing, then it will have a hard time explaining
itself to Taiwan investors, she added.</P>
      <P>In response, TSE said it will make a decision on the matter
within one week.</P>
      <P>UMC, the world's second-largest contract chip maker by revenue,
had been asked by the U.S. regulator to make adjustments to its
earnings reports with regard to non-cash goodwill charges, derivative
instruments, and employee stock bonuses.</P>
      <P>UMC said before the market opened in Taiwan Wednesday that its
financial reports of the previous three years comply with the U.S.
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) but that there are
errors in parts of the footnotes, so the company will restate them.</P>
      <P>TSE Vice President Chiu Chin-ting said UMC could have taken
greater initiative to make this known in Taiwan earlier and faster.
"We will discuss this with UMC," he added.</P>
      <P>Market analysts said UMC has confirmed that the changes in the
three years' earnings reports will not affect its reports to Taiwan's
regulator, nor will they affect future earnings.</P>
      <P>However, the analysts noted that UMC had issued press releases
only in the United States to explain the matter, without telling
Taiwan investors anything about it.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that UMC's ADR (American Depositary Receipts)
price fell in the wake of the announcement, which in turn could
affect its stock price listed on the Taiwan market, closer scrutiny
of UMC's integrity and trustworthiness is warranted, they added.</P>
      <P>UMC stock closed at NT$18.10 Thursday, up NT$0.2 from the

National Defense (MND) will assist by sending soldiers there for the
construction work.</P>
      <P>According to Hou, the airport will only be equipped with simple
facilities, including a 1,150-meter runway and a control tower.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the airport will only be capable of handling
the takeoff and landing of C130 aircraft, and not other military
aircraft, fighters or anti-submarine aircraft, so the airport will
not pose any military threat to the surrounding islets.</P>
      <P>The Spratly Islands, which consist of more than 100 small islands
or reefs surrounded by rich fishing grounds and oil deposits, are
claimed either entirely or partially by Taiwan, China, Vietnam,
Malaysia and the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, China, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam have
stationed small numbers of military forces on some of the islands.</P>
      <P>Expressing his disapproval with the government's plan to build an
airport on Taiping Island, opposition Kuomintang Legislator Su Chi
said the move is unnecessary because it is likely to trigger an
international dispute in light of the sensitive strategic and
political implications involving the Spratlys.</P>
      <P>Su said he will demand that the MND deliver a special report on
the issue to the legislature and that he will also investigate
whether the true purpose behind building the airport is different
from that stated by the MND and whether the plan is being financed by
a secret budget.</P>
      <P>During a separate meeting of the legislature's Home and Nations
Committee, CGA Director-General Shi Hwei-yow said that it is
necessary for the government to build the airport to serve practical
needs and to defend Taiwan's sovereignty claim over the Spratlys and
its fishing rights in waters near the islands.</P>
      <P>Shi pointed out that the government currently has 200 Coast Guard
officers stationed on Taiping Island, which is located 861 nautical
miles from Taiwan, and that it takes eight days and costs NT$40
million in fuel expenses for the Coast Guard to carry out one
resupplying mission by sea between Taiwan and Taiping Island.</P>
      <P>Although there is a landing pad for helicopters on the 0.49
square-kilometer Taiping Island, helicopters cannot fly the long
distance between Taiwan and the island, Shi said.</P>
      <P>He said the plan to build the airport was first included in the
Ministry of the Interior's policy guidelines on the Spratlys in 1993,
adding that China and Malaysia have competed to build airports on
islands or reefs of the Spratlys in recent years to affirm their
sovereignty claims.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT'S MA CALLS FOR 'BENEVOLENT COMPETITION' AMONG MAJOR PARTIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou Thursday said Taiwan's two major political parties
should work to unite their respective members and then engage in a
fair competition with each other so that party politics will develop
in a healthy environment.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while urging President Chen Shui-bian and
Vice President Annette Lu to show self-restraint and stop their war
of words for the sake of the country.</P>
      <P>The nation has been taken aback over the past few days as the two
top leaders issued one statement after another taking jabs at each
other in the wake of their party's election defeat on Dec. 3.</P>
      <P>Some observers, who saw a rare chance of redirecting Taiwan's
party politics on the road of healthy development, said if parties
can engage in "benevolent competition" in Taiwan, it will also be
able to engage in a "benevolent cycle" of interactions with China.
Otherwise, they worried cross-strait exchanges will fall into a
vicious circle.</P>
      <P>Ma said the ruling party has a duty to create a good environment
to develop party politics in the nation, and if the DPP leadership
does not know the Chinese saying that a harmonious family will thrive
and begin to do some real soul-searching about why they failed in the
latest elections, people will be disappointed.</P>
      <P>He said he would not make any comment on the commotion inside the
ruling camp but he noted that the KMT, as the main opposition party,
must stand firm and take the initiative in putting forward good
policy proposals that, if enacted into law, will benefit all of the
people.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that he was not gloating over the ruling party's
troubles, adding that he was just making his suggestions in his
capacity as an opposition leader and a private citizen.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks after attending a meeting of the KMT's
legislative caucus, the first such meeting after the elections in
which his party won 14 out of 23 county and city government seats
against the DPP's six.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHIEF HOLDS OUT HOPE OF NEW STRATEGY FOR LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said
Thursday he expects the party's legislative caucus to take a new
strategy during the rest of the legislative session to avoid the
repeat of fierce partisan fighting which brought the legislature
grinding to a halt.</P>
      <P>After a meeting with the KMT legislative caucus in the
Legislative Yuan, Ma told waiting journalists that the domestic
political landscape is changed somewhat after the Dec. 3 elections in
which the KMT won 14 of the 23 posts of county and city chiefs up for
grabs, and the KMT caucus should adjust their approach in its
dealings with bills at the legislature accordingly.</P>
      <P>The KMT chief said he hopes KMT lawmakers will deal with bills on
their merits and compete with other parties in the legislature to
better serve the people, adding that partisan bickering with the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party should be avoided.</P>
      <P>Given the party's overwhelming victory in the Dec. 3 elections,
Ma said the KMT must live up to the mandate its voters gave them by
giving leadership both at the level of the local governments and in
the legislature despite the fierce in-fighting in the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party after the elections.</P>
      <P>He urged the KMT caucus to work together with its political
allies in the Legislative Yuan in initiating bills needed by the
people and help shape the country's policy.</P>
      <P>The priority for the time being, Ma said, is a revision of the
act governing the relations between the peoples of Taiwan and the
mainland, and the submission of the party's own version of revisions
to the pension system for civil servants, including the
controversial 18 percent interest rate on civil servants' bank
savings.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou Thursday called for strengthened unity within the "pan-blue
alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party (PFP) , because the
alliance's majority in the legislature has become very flimsy after
four KMT legislators were elected local government heads in the Dec.
3 elections.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at his first meeting with members of the KMT
legislative caucus after the KMT's landslide victory over the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the elections.</P>
      <P>He said that although the KMT's victory in the elections cost the
party four seats in the legislature, the win was worthwhile because
the four KMT lawmakers-turned local government heads -- three county
magistrates and one mayor -- will have 5.8 million people under their
jurisdiction, accounting for 26 percent of Taiwan's population.</P>
      <P>The four outgoing KMT legislators who will be sworn in Dec. 20 to
assume their new posts are: Chou Hsi-wei, who will become Taipei
County magistrate; Liu Cheng-hung, who will be Miaoli County
magistrate; Cho Po-yuan, who will serve as Changhua County
magistrate; and Huang Min-hui, who will be mayor of Chiayi City.</P>
      <P>Ma also said that he agreed with PFP Chairman James Soong in
their Dec. 12 meeting that the priorities for "pan-blue alliance"
cooperation in the legislature will be to push for legislation to
promote people-to-people relations across the Taiwan Strait, seek
membership for Taiwan in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
and introduce a reformed plan to offer a favorable interest rate to
retired servicemen, public servants and public school teachers for
their pension savings.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reiterated
Thursday Taiwan's separate identity, democratic reform and clean
governance as the core values of his administration.</P>
      <P>Speaking to a group of former political prisoners who were jailed
during the period of martial law from 1949 to 1987 when the
Kuomintang was in power, Chen vowed to stick to the above three
principles.</P>
      <P>The president, whose Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) performed
poorly in the Dec. 3 local government elections, said his whole
ruling team, including "the administration, the DPP and myself",
should re-examine their performance, learn lessons from the defeat
and mend their ways.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said, the ruling team will not be daunted by the
elections failure and will not deviate from its core values.</P>
      <P>Chen said it is the common belief among the 23 million of Taiwan
that their country is sovereign and has its own identity separate
from that of China.</P>
      <P>"Only by stressing Taiwan's identity can we get on our feet,
move forward in politics, economy and society, and break the
political stalemate with Beijing and look forward to the
normalization of ties with China," the president said.</P>
      <P>On sticking with democratic reform, the president urged the
people in Taiwan not to look down upon the island's hard-earned
democracy which serves as a beacon for the mainland Chinese people,
noting that U.S. President George W. Bush said in a speech in Kyoto,
Japan Nov. 16 that Taiwan can be held up as a model of democracy for
China.</P>
      <P>Chen also stressed that he won't relax his insistence on clean
governance by his administration which he said is one of the most
urgent demands of the people.</P>
      <P>"There may be some people in the ruling team who had failed to
live up to the people's expectations, but the DPP and the ruling team
are capable of self-examination and are not afraid of mending their
ways by facing up to their mistakes." the president said.</P>
      <P>He promised to make restoring the administration's clean image a
priority in any Cabinet reshuffle in the future.</P>

      <P>Embroiled in a hostile standoff with the DPP, the KMT and its

      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Legislator Chen Chao-jong asked the government Thursday to maintain
the ban on all beef imports from the United States.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, Chen also
asked Department of Health (DOH) officials to sign a four-point
pledge vowing not to allow such imports from countries affected by
mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that more than 60 countries around the world,
including Japan and South Korea, have banned U.S. beef imports since
the first case of locally acquired mad cow disease in that country in
2003, Chen said that the government still decided to lift the ban on
U.S. beef imports in April this year before reimposing it in June
after a second case of mad cow disease was detected in the United
States.</P>
      <P>Chen accused the government of being extremely rash in the
decision-making process, totally ignoring professional assessments
and lacking risk management.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government, like Japan, send veterinary
officials to collect information in mad cow disease affected areas
and strictly restrict all beef and beef product imports from affected
countries. He also called for a full crackdown on smuggling.</P>
      <P>The PFP lawmaker asked the DOH to stand up against political
pressure from the United States and evaluate whether to re-open the

"professionalism, safety and health. " He claimed that any person in

develop mad cow disease after eating U.S. beef.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CALLS PUBLIC'S ATTENTION TO CHINA'S POOR HUMAN RIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the public
Thursday not to overly romanticize China's economic growth and
overlook Beijing's inferior human rights record while engaging in
exchange activities with China.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, China has jailed the largest number of
journalists, and the recent shooting of protesters by armed police
near Shanwei, Guangdong province is definitely not an isolated
incident.</P>
      <P>"Although it remains unclear as to how many casualties there
were, international media generally believes this is the most serious
human rights violation in which violence was used openly to crack
down on the public since the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, " Chen
said.</P>
      <P>"This is evidence of China's brutal and unstable nature against
democracy and human rights," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen said the incident has also raised an alarm for democracies
around the world that the rise of China is shadowed by the
persecution of human rights and suppression of democracy.</P>
      <P>The president was speaking to a group of victims of political
persecution during the martial law era who were invited to the
Presidential Office to watch a documentary on the so-called "white
terror" period.</P>
      <P>Chen said economic prosperity and human rights protection should
be equally essential.</P>
      <P>Taiwan created the world-acclaimed economic miracle during the
past authoritarian rule, but behind the splendid economic
achievements, many people were leading a miserable life and had to
fight the authoritarian rulers with their tears and blood, he said.</P>
      <P>He said no civilized society can tolerate such a situation, which
became the strongest momentum driving the people in Taiwan to pursue
freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 3, the Taiwan people again exercised their right as the
masters of the country with their votes, and every individual and
political party must accept the outcome of the elections
unconditionally regardless of whether they are happy about it or not,
he said.</P>
      <P>While the elections held regularly in Taiwan are taken for
granted by the people here, the right to elect their leaders and
representatives remains unreachable to the people in some countries
today, he noted.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, 250,000 Hong Kong residents took to the
streets on Dec. 4 to demand universal suffrage to elect the chief
executive and Legislative Council of the Special Administrative
Region.</P>
      <P>"By comparison, Taiwan's people should feel fortunate and proud
to be able to enjoy freedom and democracy, " he said. "The biggest
difference between Taiwan and Hong Kong and China does not lie in the
extent of their economic development but in the respect paid to the
dignity and rights that people deserve," he added.</P>
      <P>While the power of the government is derived from the people's
approval in Taiwan, the rights of the people are granted by the
government in Hong Kong and China, he said, adding that the gap
between Taiwan and China will widen further if the situation is not
changed.</P>
      <P>Having made many economic achievements since adopting a policy of
openness in the 1980s, Beijing, however, has not relaxed its
suppression against the pursuit of freedom, democracy and human
rights by its people, who thus far do not enjoy the freedom to choose
their leader or freedom of speech, assembly and religion, Chen said.</P>

Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, PFP Chairman James Soong
said that as new economic and political blocs in Asia take shape with
China playing increasingly important roles, the only option for
Taiwan to avoid being relegated to the sidelines is to improve
cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which has in the past maintained closed economic and
trade ties with member states of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), particularly Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, is
finding it has fewer and fewer bargain chips in its maneuvering space
in the region after China's rise and the growth of Chinese influence,
Soong said.</P>
      <P>In the past, Soong said, many Asian countries sought at meetings
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to engage in
bilateral consultations with Taiwan for closer economic and trade
ties, but nowadays they have turned to China.</P>
      <P>Taking Malaysia as an example, Soong said, when he visited the
country two years ago, then-outgoing Prime Minister Mahathir and his
deputy, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who is now prime minister, both told
him that it was impossible for Malaysia to recognize Taiwan or the
Republic of China politically, but stressed their hope that Taiwan-
Malaysia economic and trade relations would grow.</P>
      <P>Given that much has changed over the past two years, Soong said,
China has become the world's factory and the world's market and has
attracted many Asian countries because of its economy. Malaysia's
two-way trade with Taiwan used to be larger than that with China, but
now Malaysia is trading with China in volumes much bigger than those
with Taiwan now, he added.</P>
      <P>This situation is quite worrisome for Taiwan, Soong stressed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will face even more serious problems once the "ASEAN plus
China, Japan and South Korea" process is materialized, Soong said,
adding that tariffs will be the first problem for Taiwan as all the
member states in the new bloc will have duty free privileges.
Taiwan's competitiveness will automatically slide since its exported
products to the "ASEAN plus three" member states will be much more
expensive with tariffs, he said.</P>
      <P>Soong maintained that the Taiwan authorities should seek to be on
better terms with the Beijing leadership, who, he claimed, told him
during his visit in Beijing this past summer that so long as Taiwan
does not seek de jure independence, China would allow Taiwan to enjoy
"a certain extent of maneuvering space" in the international
community.</P>
      <P>He called for member states of the "ASEAN plus three" to allow
Taiwan to participate in the proposed free trade bloc in a formula
similar to that of the World Trade Organization so that Taiwan will
not be marginalized in the region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FLAT PANEL DISPLAYS INDUSTRY BOOMING: IEK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The output value of Taiwan's flat panel
displays is estimated at NT$840.6 billion for 2005, up by 17.6
percent over the 2004 figure, according to the Industrial Economics
and Knowledge Center (IEK) under the Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI).</P>
      <P>The figure for 2006 is forecast to grow over the NT$1 trillion
(US$30.1 billion) mark, beating the government's target of turning
the industry into one of Taiwan's hi-tech business with an annual
production value over the NT$1 trillion level, ITRI officials said.</P>
      <P>According to DisplaySearch statistics, Taiwan's flat panel
display industry will see its production volume in the fourth quarter
exceed South Korea's level for the first time, giving it the largest
share in the world market.</P>
      <P>Amid high expectations that the domestic industry will continue
expanding, foreign-based material and equipment suppliers are
flocking to invest in the science parks in central and southern
Taiwan to directly provide local firms with what they need.</P>
      <P>With increased integration between upstream and downstream
companies at home, the domestic industry is expected to further
flourish in 2006 on strong global demand for notebook computers, LCD
TVs and portable electronic devices, a DisplaySearch executive said.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has managed to outshine South Korea in flat panel
display production capability, the domestic industry lacks core
manufacturing technologies -- a bottleneck that it must overcome,
industry sources said.</P>
      <P>Experts suggest Taiwan companies build their own distinguished
brand names, engage in research and development and improve
post-sales services to sharpen their competitive edges in the face of
fierce competition from Japan and South Korea.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2005 European Film Festival will be
held in Taipei's Majestic Theater Dec. 16-19, showing 10 recent
award-winning films, each from a different country.</P>
      <P>The 2005 European Film Festival is co-organized by the European
Economic and Trade Office (EETO) , and coordinated by Infine Art and
Culture Exchange and sponsored by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) as well as the Taipei City Government's Cultural Affairs
Department.</P>
      <P>Since 2003, the European Association of Film Festivals based in
Brussels, Belgium, has launched the "Window on Europe" project aimed
at promoting a new generation of talented young European directors.
The project selected more than 200 films all over Europe. However,
French movies are not on the show list this year.</P>
      <P>Director-General of the MOFA's Department of European Affairs
Larry Wang Yu-yuan said during a speech at the festival's opening
ceremony that more and more people in Taiwan are applying for visas
to European countries, which, in a sense, brings Europe closer to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"In the past, it was very difficult to watch European movies in
Taiwan. But now, they have become quite popular as the DVDs can
easily be bought here," Wang said.</P>
      <P>According to Infine Art and Culture, 20 percent to 30 percent of
the tickets have already been sold online. "We are targeting a rather
young audience aged between 20 and 35. They are more likely to accept
these kind of films," a spokesman of Infine said.</P>
      <P>The 10 films, featuring a wide range of topics, will be shown in
20 sessions during the four days of the festival. They were produced
in Italy, Slovenia, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Ireland, Belgium,
Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Hungary. They will be subtitled
in Chinese and English.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice has purchased
hi-tech equipment to monitor and track sex offenders, a ministry
spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the ministry is slated to fully
implement the program in June 2006 to better protect women from
sexual attacks.</P>
      <P>The 150 sets of devices, which use automatic Radio Frequency
IDentification (RFID) that are placed in ordinary objects like a
wrist watch or a bracelet, will be the first batch of its kind in
Taiwan, the spokesman explained.</P>
      <P>A law amendment approved in February this year allows for those
convicted of sex crimes to be released on bail or parole if they are
wearing RFID monitoring devices under certain circumstances and with
a permit granted by prosecution authorities, the spokesman said,
noting that a watch-like or bracelet-like object is designed not to
label the criminals in public.</P>
      <P>The devices are locally developed and the ministry has acquired
them through a public bidding process that began in February and
wrapped up two days ago, he noted, adding that the products have not
yet been mass produced for the time being.</P>
      <P>The ministry may also upgrade the RFID equipment by combining GPS
technologies, which would enable long distance monitoring. This would
first be tested to gauge its effect on human rights and personal
safety, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Yang Ju-men, also known as the "rice
bomber" for planting explosive devises around northern Taiwan in
protest of rice imports, showed no ill effects Thursday, halfway
through his planned six-day hunger strike at the Taipei Detention
Center, an official with the Ministry of Justice said.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, Yang has been energetic and even played
badminton with another inmate Thursday, said Cheng An-hsiung,
director-general of the ministry's department of corrections.</P>
      <P>Yang chose to begin his six-day hunger strike Tuesday as
representatives from the World Trade Organization (WTO) met in Hong
Kong to show his displeasure with the WTO's "exploitation of the
disadvantaged."</P>
      <P>Detention center authorities told Cheng that they are closely
monitoring Yang's condition and if necessary, they will force-feed
him.</P>
      <P>Professor Fang Sheng-ping of National Tsinghua University read a
statement by Yang Tuesday that said the 144-hour hunger strike is to
show that Yang is concerned about the current uncertainties
surrounding Taiwan's agriculture sector.</P>
      <P>Yang told detention center authorities Thursday he was only
expressing his fear for Taiwan farmers, and did not mean to make
trouble for the employees of the detention facility. He also asked
that the media not sensationalize his hunger strike.</P>
      <P>Yang's supporters announced Tuesday they will launch a "save
Taiwan's agriculture" campaign in Taipei Dec. 16-17. Yang was
convicted in his first trial on charges of threatening public
security for placing bombs at several public locations. Yang admitted
to the crime, saying that he wanted to raise public awareness of the
plight of Taiwan's farmers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WCPFC VETOES JAPANESE PROPOSAL TO CUT TAIWAN'S TUNA QUOTA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,   Dec.  15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Western and Central Pacific
Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) vetoed a Japanese proposal Thursday to
cut Taiwan's annual tuna fishing quota in the Central and Western
Pacific Ocean, fishery sources said.</P>
      <P>After successfully pushing the International Commission of the
Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) in mid-November to drastically
slash Taiwan's bigeye tuna fishing quota for 2006, Japan proposed
a similar cut into Taiwan's 2006 tuna fishing quota in the Central and
Western Pacific at the ongoing WCPFC annual meeting in Micronesia
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The Japanese proposal was vetoed after our delegates
convincingly explained our fishing operations in the region at the
WCPFC session, " said Wang Shun-lung, president of the Taiwan Tuna
Association (TTA).</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted in 2000, Taiwan had only seven or
eight tuna fishing vessels operated in the Western and Central
Pacific that year, with a total catch of slightly more than 1,100
tons. The quantity was far less than that taken by American, Japanese
and South Korean fishing vessels during the same period.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, our delegates stressed that it would be
unfair and unreasonable to trim Taiwan's tuna fishing quota in the
region, " Wang said, adding that the delegates also took the
opportunity to brief other WCPFC member states on Taiwan's fishery
resources conservation policies and measures.</P>
      <P>In line with the principles of sustainable development and
fishery ecology protection, Wang said the annual tuna fishing quota
will have to be cut by 15 percent in the future. But the base year
for the quota calculation has yet to be determined, he noted.</P>
      <P>Wang said the association will see to it that all TTA members
fully abide by the quota regulations and other fishery resources
conservation norms.</P>
      <P>Acting on Japan's proposal, the ICCAT decided to impose a cut in
its quota for Taiwan's bigeye tuna fish catch by around 70 percent,
from 14,900 tons to 4,600 tons, during its annual conference last
month, forcing Taiwan to reduce the number of its bigeye tuna fishing
boats operating in the Atlantic to 15 for 2006.</P>

Wall Street Journal: Bush Concedes
Intelligence Flaws Played Part in War

U.S. President Bush bluntly acknowledged
responsibility for leading the country to war
partly based on inaccurate intelligence, a nod
to critics and the latest move in a new White
House campaign to rally public support for
American efforts in Iraq. President Bush
defended his war policy to an audience at the
Woodrow Wilson International Center. He said
that "It is true that much of the intelligence 
turned out to be wrong," adding that "As
president, I'm responsible for the decision to
go into Iraq." While President Bush has
previously conceded such errors and has always
taken responsibility for going to war, his
comments were unusual for their candid linkage
of the two issues, barely a year after a 2004
campaign in which he admitted to no significant
first-term mistakes when asked if he had made
any.</TEXT>

opportunity to brief other WCPFC member states on Taiwan's fishery
resources conservation policies and measures.</P>
      <P>In line with the principles of sustainable development and
fishery ecology protection, Wang said the annual tuna fishing quota
will have to be cut by 15 percent in the future. But the base year
for the quota calculation has yet to be determined, he noted.</P>
      <P>Wang said the association will see to it that all TTA members
fully abide by the quota regulations and other fishery resources
conservation norms.</P>
      <P>Acting on Japan's proposal, the ICCAT decided to impose a cut in
its quota for Taiwan's bigeye tuna fish catch by around 70 percent,
from 14,900 tons to 4,600 tons, during its annual conference last
month, forcing Taiwan to reduce the number of its bigeye tuna fishing
boats operating in the Atlantic to 15 for 2006.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Speaking on a possible Cabinet reshuffle,
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday that the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) needs to think over the matter

      <P>Ma made the comments in response to media question during a short

      <P>He said that in a Cabinet reshuffle, the key is policy, not
personnel, stressing that only switching individuals around to new
positions won't accomplish anything.</P>
      <P>Ma also said that the biggest problem with the DPP's current
policy is that it doesn't address the major issues facing Taiwan,
such as cross-strait and economic problems. For instance, he said
that the lack of a direct transportation link between Taiwan and the
Chinese mainland has meant a lost opportunity for Kaohsiung to become
a major transit point for mainland Chinese cargo.</P>
      <P>He added that if the current administration does not deal with
these major issues during its remaining two-and-a-half years in
power, Taiwan will be in an even worse position.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRO-INDEPENDENCE LAWMAKER FIRST TO REGISTER FOR DPP CHAIRMANSHIP RACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A pro-Taiwan independence legislator became
the first person to come forward to register for the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) chairmanship by-election set for
Jan. 15.</P>
      <P>Trong Chai, accompanied by DPP Legislators Wang Hsin-nan, You
Ching, Wang Shih-chien and Kao Chien-chih, filled out the
registration form and made the required NT$1.5 million (US$44,776)
deposit at the party's headquarters.</P>
      <P>The by-election became necessary after Su Tseng-chang stepped
down to take responsibility for the party's humiliating defeat in the
Dec. 3 local elections. The DPP managed to win only six of the 23
city mayor and county magistrate posts up for grabs. The main
opposition Kuomintang won 14 posts.</P>
      <P>Chai said the DPP suffered the major setback in the elections
because it failed to insist on the ideals of "Taiwan first" and
"integrity first."</P>
      <P>"Both the ruling party and Taiwan face a critical period, " Chai
said, pointing out that this is why he has decided to come forward to
fight for a better future for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chai noted that he helped found the World United Formosans for
Independence in 1970 which is an organization dedicated to the
establishment of a free, democratic and independent Republic of
Taiwan in accordance with the self-determination principle of the
people, and the Formosan Association for Public Affairs in 1982
which also aims to promote international support for the right of the
people of Taiwan to establish an independent and democratic country
and to join the international community.</P>
      <P>Also, Chai said that during his years as a legislator, he has
never used his position for influence peddling or been involved in
any corruption, which he claimed makes him "the best qualified to
talk about 'Taiwan first' and 'integrity first.'"</P>
      <P>He was referring to the corruption scandal regarding the
construction of the mass rapid transit system in Kaohsiung, southern
Taiwan. The involvement of a former ranking Presidential Office aide
in the scandal dealt a serious blow to the image of the DPP in the
run-up to the elections.</P>
      <P>Despite reports that said several DPP heavyweights are keen on
running for the party chairmanship, including Yu Shyi-kun, who
announced his resignation as Presidential Office secretary-general
Thursday in order to join the race, Chai said that he would stick to
his decision to run for the post.</P>
      <P>Chai also signed a "pledge of self-discipline" for DPP
chairmanship candidates that he drafted himself, expressing the hope
that all the candidates will sign similar pledges to help make the
upcoming election a paragon of clean elections for the party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT RULES OUT RUNNING FOR DPP CHAIRMANSHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu, who also
currently serves as acting chairwoman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , on Friday ruled out the possibility of
running for the party's chairmanship in the Jan. 15 by-election.</P>
      <P>In a written statement issued from the DPP's Culture and
Publicity Department, Lu said that she has never had any intention of
entering the DPP chairmanship race but that she is keen on helping
DPP members conduct a "fair election with style."</P>
      <P>"I am eager to see that via this by-election, the DPP will
produce a new leader who is not only capable of leading the party to
a rebirth, accelerating democratic reforms and deepening the Taiwan
identity, but who is also capable of helping Taiwan meet the
challenges brought by globalization," Lu said in the statement.</P>
      <P>"During my stint as acting chairwoman, I will strive concertedly
with party members to jointly elevate the DPP's discipline, integrity
and spirit," she said.</P>
      <P>Lu was nominated as the interim party chairwoman during a regular
meeting of the DPP Central Standing Committee Dec. 6 after Su
Tseng-chang stepped down to take responsibility for the DPP's
humiliating defeat in the Dec. 3 city and county chief elections.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Trong Chai, who is also a DPP Central
Standing Committee member, on Friday registered as a candidate in the
by-election and deposited the required registration fee of NT$1.5
million, becoming the first person to enter the chairmanship race,
which is expected to be a hotly-contested, multiple-candidate race.</P>
      <P>Chai appealed to all DPP members to vote for him, saying that he
is the only one capable of leading the DPP to push forward and thrive
while maintaining the Taiwan identity and the party's integrity --
two elements whose absence he claimed were the root of the party's
defeat in the Dec. 3 local government elections.</P>
      <P>Several DPP heavyweights are reportedly interested in vying for
the DPP chairmanship post, including Yu Shyi-kun, who announced his
resignation as Presidential Office secretary-general Friday in order
to join the race.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER URGES RIGOROUS IMPLEMENTATION OF PET REGISTRATION SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Huang Wei-cher of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party on Friday urged the government to
rigorously implement its registration policy for household pets.</P>
      <P>Huang, who called a press conference at the Legislative Yuan to
call attention to the problem, said that the government currently
only requires pet registration for dogs but that an increasing
variety of pets are being kept by Taiwan people, including cats,
lizards and snakes.</P>
      <P>He expressed concerns that such pets could represent a hole in
the public health network, saying that if any such pets are carriers
of an infectious disease and are lost by their owners, they could
pose a threat to public health.</P>
      <P>Noting that currently, the total number of cat owners in Taiwan
is not necessarily lower than the total number of dog owners, he also
urged the government to require that cat owners register their pets.</P>
      <P>In addition, he called for the standardization of the
specifications for chip implants for pets, pointing out that the
government has given approval to two chip manufacturers to produce
such chips but that the specifications of the two firms' chips are
not compatible, which he said could pose problems if pets get lost or
if owners decide to change their pet registration information.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the same press conference, Chu Ching-cheng, a section
chief of the Animal Industry Department under the Council of
Agriculture, said that around 1.1 million domestic dogs are currently
implanted with chips, but he added that the implanting of chips in
dogs in rural areas still has to be stepped up.</P>
      <P>Chu also said that although cats have yet to be included in the
compulsory registration, cat owners are urged to get chip implants
for their pets.</P>

      <P>A pair of Kidd-class destroyers purchased
from the United States and delivered to Taiwan near the start of this
month are scheduled to be commissioned at the northeastern military
base of Keelung Saturday, Republic of China Navy sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is expected to travel to Keelung
Saturday to officiate, as the commander in chief of the ROC armed
forces, at a ceremony marking the commissioning of the "1801 Keelung"
and the "1802 Suao" destroyers.</P>
      <P>The "1801 Keelung" and the "1802 Suao, " two of the four
Kidd-class destroyers purchased from the United States in 2003,
arrived at the northeastern military base of Suao Dec. 8 from a
shipyard in Charleston, South Carolina after a month-long voyage
which also included logistics stops at U.S. Navy bases in Hawaii and
Guam.</P>
      <P>ROC Navy authorities said that after the two Kidd-class
destroyers are commissioned, they will form the outer periphery of a
naval defensive fleet, while the Perry-class, Knox-class and
Lafayette-class frigates will play an "inner circle" role. The
Kidd-class destroyers will target enemy planes that have fired
missiles, allowing the other frigates to deal with the incoming
missiles, they said.</P>
      <P>Both Capt. Chen Hsin-fa, skipper of the "1801 Keelung," and Capt.
Shen Yi-teh, skipper of the "1802 Suao, " have previously served as
captains aboard Perry-class frigates.</P>
      <P>Navy officers and seed instructors, as well as repair and
maintenance technicians had received training in the United States to
prepare for the delivery of the two de-mothballed destroyers, which
have also undergone sea trials and weaponry systems tests over the
past month, the Navy authorities said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan purchased the four destroyers, built in the late 1970s, at
a cost of NT$24 billion (US$0.73 billion) in June 2003.</P>
      <P>The other two destroyers are expected to be delivered by the end

    <HEADLINE>CIVIC GROUPS OPPOSE INCREASING DEFENSE SPENDING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two local civic organizations opposing the
government's arms procurement plan expressed their objections Friday
to a U.S. proposal that Taiwan raise its annual defense spending to 3
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) from the current 2.4 percent.</P>
      <P>They claimed the hike in defense spending would encourage an
endless arms race across the Taiwan Strait, in which they said
"Taiwan would definitely lose."</P>
      <P>Reporting to the Legislative Yuan's Foreign and Overseas Chinese
Affairs Committee on Wednesday, ROC Representative to the United
States David Ta-wei Lee confirmed that Washington has suggested that
Taiwan increase its annual defense spending to 3 percent of GDP so as
to accommodate the latest arms procurement package from the United
States in its regular annual budget.</P>
      <P>Legislators from the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , who have
been blocking the arms procurement bill mainly because they are
against the government's plan to finance the procurement with a
special budget, have expressed their support for the U.S. proposal.</P>
      <P>However, Huang Kuang-kuo, convener of the Democratic Action
Alliance, said he is disappointed that the KMT is ready to "yield to
U.S. pressure."</P>
      <P>Huang pointed out that Taiwan's annual defense spending as a
ratio of GDP is already higher than neighboring South Korea's 2.10
percent and Japan's 2.01 percent.</P>
      <P>Chang Ya-chung, convener of the Anti-Arms Procurement Alliance,
said that regardless of whether the arms procurement is funded by an
annual budget or by a special budget, it is still the "hard-earned
money" of the people that will be spent.</P>
      <P>Chang accused the United States of asking Taiwan to purchase the
P-3C anti-submarine aircraft, Patriot PAC-III anti-missile systems
and diesel-electric submarines just to facilitate its own strategic
planning in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>He urged politicians not to fool the people and to instead
explain in detail to the public the efficacy of the weapons in
protecting Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>Also on Friday, KMT Legislator Hsieh Wen-cheng said it is a good
idea to increase the country's annual defense spending to 3 percent
of GDP.</P>
      <P>Hsieh claimed that the KMT has never objected to the arms
procurement and that the party is only asking that the procurement be
carried out in a reasonable manner.</P>

Vote in Large Numbers on Calm Day

Millions of Iraqis cast ballots across this war-torn country on
Thursday to elect a Parliament to a four-year term, with Sunni Arabs
turning out in what appeared to be heavy numbers and guerrillas
staging relatively few attacks. Iraqi officials said that initial
indications were that as many as 11 million people cast ballots,
which, if the estimate holds, would put the overall turnout at more
than 70 percent.

Taipei has posted total revenues of NT$1.5 trillion (US$45.22
million) so far this year, marking a three-fold increase over the
level for the whole of 1999, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Friday.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the presence of the park, the population of the Neihu

said while addressing the inauguration of new buildings at Pinchiang
Elementary School.</P>
      <P>The Neihu Technology Park, with more than 7,000 employees at

published Nov. 22, 2004, opened a flagship store in Taipei's upmarket
Hsinyi District Friday, hoping for an annual turnover of NT$3 billion

      <P>Eslite Books founder Wu Ching-yu said during a news conference
marking the inauguration of the flagship store that Eslite Books may
open up new markets in mainland China in two to three years to allow
Chinese readers access to the "jewel in the crown of Taiwan's

    <HEADLINE>BIOLOGIST SAYS GOVERNMENT MUST BE ECOLOGICALLY MINDED WITH SPRATLYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local biologist urged the government
Friday to strengthen its management of the Spratly Islands to assert
its sovereignty claim over the disputed archipelago in the South
China Sea.</P>
      <P>Jeng Ming-shiou, a research fellow at the Academia Sinica's
Research Center for Biodiversity, noted that Taiwan, which currently
occupies Taiping Island -- one of the biggest islets of the Spratlys,
is the country that first stationed forces in the island group but
that the government has done virtually nothing besides that.</P>
      <P>Unlike Taiwan, Malaysia has turned Swallow Reef that it occupies
into a tourist attraction by developing a holiday resort,
desalination plant and wind power plant there, Jeng pointed out.</P>
      <P>With the large number of beautiful marine creatures and coral
reefs around the Spratlys, the government should value the tourist
potential of Taiping Island and conduct a comprehensive environmental
impact assessment before going ahead with its plan to build an
airport on the island so as not to damage its plants and marine
resources.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of National Defense Huo Shou-yeh confirmed Thursday
that the government will build an airport on Taiping Island but
emphasized that the airport is not intended for military use but
instead for humanitarian purposes such as emergency rescue efforts by
the Coast Guard for sick or injured sailors or fishermen.</P>
      <P>The Spratly Islands, which consist of more than 100 small islands
or reefs surrounded by rich fishing grounds and oil deposits, are
claimed either entirely or partially by Taiwan, China, Vietnam,
Malaysia and the Philippines.</P>
      <P>The claimants have stationed small numbers of military forces on
some of the islands.</P>
      <P>According to Jeng, the government and people of Taiwan have not
paid enough attention to the country's maritime sovereignty and the
importance of the sustainable development of maritime resources.</P>
      <P>For example, Jeng said, the Spratly Islands and Pratas Islands
are home to some of the world's most precious and biodiverse coral
reefs, but they are very often left out in the government's
policy-making process.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government step up its marine life survey
in the South China Sea and establish a ministry of maritime affairs
to promote cooperation with other countries to conserve the maritime
resources in the Spratly Islands.</P>

      <P>China Airlines (CAL) , Taiwan's largest
carrier, is expected to post revenues of over NT$100 billion (US$3
billion) for 2005, making it one of the few profitable carriers in
the world, CAL Chairman Wei Hsing-hsiung said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a celebration party marking the carrier's 46th
anniversary, Wei said that CAL hopes to post revenues of over NT$120
billion for 2006, although avian flu and fuel prices remain top
concerns for the company's operations. He added that the company
might not make a profit next year if oil prices maintain at a high
level.</P>
      <P>In order to maintain its profitability, CAL has adopted various
cost-effective measures, including re-routing its Europe-bound and
India-bound flights to pass through China's airspace and reducing the
number of unprofitable flights, Wei said. CAL and EVA Airways,
Taiwan's second-largest carrier, also cooperate in plane maintenance
and repairs operations at some foreign airports.</P>
      <P>CAL will increase the number of its profitable passenger flights
to Hiroshima, Japan to seven per week from January next year, and it
has opened all-cargo flights to Vienna, Austria and the Japanese city

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If an epidemic of human-transmittable avian
flu hits Taiwan, the island's gross domestic product (GDP) could fall
up to 2 percent as a result, an economist predicted Friday.</P>
      <P>Wang Chien-chuan, a researcher at the Chung-Hua Institution for
Economic Research, said in an article posted on the Web site of the
Investment Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, that he
based his prediction on the economic impacts caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in 2003.</P>
      <P>Should an avian flu epidemic take place on the island, the
economic toll would come from the costs of culling poultry flocks and
the drop in exports associated with the poultry industry. In
addition, monitoring and treating the disease would be costly, not to
mention the possibly destructive effect of people being too sick to
work.</P>
      <P>SARS first came to light in Taiwan in December 2002 and the
country was listed as an infected area by the World Health
Organization until July 2003. During 2003, the economic growth rate
fell by 0.35 percent to 3.24 percent, and Wang predicted that
human-transmittable avian flu in Taiwan would negatively impact GDP
by two to five times that amount.</P>
      <P>Should this be the case, Wang said the country's exports would
decline by between US$1 billion and US$5 billion.</P>

      <P>About half of the people answering a recent

China should be expanded in a reasonable manner, the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>This compares with 19. 6 percent who favor a complete opening of
Kinmen and Matsu as transit points for people traveling across the
Taiwan Strait without setting any restrictions.</P>
      <P>While 52. 5 percent of the people think that Taiwan should be in

expanded immediately.</P>
      <P>If the links are opened completely, 50. 1 percent of the people
think this will jeopardize national security, and 71.8 percent
believe that this will hamper the government's effort to control

      <P> Taipei, Dec. 16 (CAN) Visiting Peking University President Xu
Zhihong called on his counterpart at National Taiwan University
(NTU), Lee Si-chen, Friday to compare notes on budgets for advanced
studies Friday.</P>
      <P>In comparing the budgets for advanced studies across the Taiwan 
Strait, Lee said that if special budgets are not included, the NTU
has an annual budget of around 2.8 billion yuan (US$346.81
million), compared with Peking University's two billion yuan. But
taking into consideration the standard of living, consumer price
index, and the number of enrolled students, NTU's budget is
comparatively lower.</P>
      <P>Xu noted that China appropriated a special budget of 1.8 billion
yuan to Peking University between 1999 and 2001. It has funneled
another 1.8 billion yuan into the school between 2004 and 2007.</P>
      <P>Amid complaints by some Taiwan universities who have failed to
get any funds from the government's "five-year, NT$50 billion"
project to upgrade schools to the level of world-class universities,
Xu said that Chinese have an entrenched idea of "equality," resulting
in complaints by those who have not received additional budgets.</P>
      <P>What Peking University does is to prove with substantial results
that the money the government has spent was not in vain, Xu said.</P>
      <P>This is Xu's first trip to NTU since assuming the post in 1999.
Xu also gave a speech at the university.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The current president and vice president,
as well as past premiers or party chairmen should not serve as the
next Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) chairman so that there can be
a new generation of leaders, former DPP chairman Lin I-hsiung said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin, who served as party chairman between 1998 and 2000, made the
remarks when he delivered an open letter to DPP members at a news
conference.</P>
      <P>Lin said that if any of these people intend to run for chairman,
"I will do my best to dissuade them. If they persist, I will publish
my reasons for trying to talk them out of their decision."</P>
      <P>He also said that the next DPP chairman should not run for Taipei
or Kaohsiung mayor at the end of the 2006 or be a candidate in the
2008 presidential election because he or she must concentrate on
party and election campaign affairs.</P>
      <P>"If the way in which the upcoming election for DPP chairman is
run or if the party's candidate for the 2008 presidential election
does not live up to public expectations, the party may have no more
reason to exist, and it has to accept its fate of being annihilated,"
said the respected former DPP chairman, who in recent years has
focused on a nuclear-free Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the letter titled, "Genuine self-reflection will open up a
window of opportunity for success, " Lin said the DPP suffered an
unprecedented defeat in the Dec. 3 local elections. The DPP managed
to win only six mayoral and magistrate seats out of 23 up for grabs,
while the main opposition Kuomintang captured 14.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP is in disarray and Su Tseng-chang stepped
down as DPP chairman to take responsibility for the major setback, he
offered his ideas on who the next party chairman could be. The party
will vote for a new chairman on Jan. 15.</P>
      <P>"It is the responsibility of the chairman to focus on party
matters as well as campaign preparations for the 2008 presidential
election," Lin said.</P>
      <P>"Because of this, the person at the head of the party must not be
a candidate for Taipei or Kaohsiung mayor in 2006, and he or she
should also not run for president or vice president in 2008, " he
said.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that the term of the new party chairman should run
until May 20, 2008 when the next president is inaugurated, and he or
she should not leave the post for any other reason than being
recalled or in seriously ill health.</P>
      <P>Lin's remarks apparently preclude Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general
to the Presidential Office and a former premier, who announced his
resignation from the top aide post Thursday to run for the DPP
chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the party must go past the election defeat and
seriously reflect on its policies and strategies so that it can make
a fresh start and seize the next chance for success.</P>
      <P>Moreover, this evaluation of the party must be conducted from the
top down, starting with the president, the vice president, past
premiers and party chairmen and then to local party leaders, Lin
said, adding that they should reflect deeply upon their performance,
their words and deeds, and put down their conclusions and views in
writing.</P>
      <P>A team of fair-minded people will then assess the reports and
give their comments to the DPP's Central Standing Committee, which
will then invite those who submitted the reports and those who
assessed them to explain their respective views before making an
overall finding.</P>
      <P>"If there are major flaws in the party machine, then all ranking
party members should apologize to grassroots supporters and the
public," he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hong Kong, Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Semy Chen &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When Taiwan is completely sure that U.S.
beef is safe for consumption, it will re-open its markets to imports,
Taiwan's economics minister said Friday.</P>
      <P>Ho Mei-yueh made the remarks on the sideline of the sixth
ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO) , which is
being held at the Hong Kong Convention Center Dec. 13-18, after Japan
announced it would lift its ban against the import of U.S. beef a few
days ago.</P>
      <P>Ho said it is only a technical problem to re-open Taiwan to U.S.
beef, noting that the Department of Health will use an open and
transparent procedure for testing and examining to ensure that beef
from the United States is absolutely safe, and that no new cases of
mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) , have
appeared in the U.S. since its second case of the disease in June.</P>
      <P>Japan re-opened its market for the import after ensuring the
safety of U.S. beef following strict tests and examinations, Ho said,
adding Taiwan is conducting similar tests. Japan was the world's
largest market for U.S. beef, which was closed in 2003 after the U.S.
discovered a single case of mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>After negotiations lasting two years, Japan decided on Dec. 12 to
resume imports of U.S. beef from cattle aged under 20 months.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, listed as the world's sixth-largest U.S. beef market,
banned imports of U.S. beef, live cattle and all related products in
December, 2003 after the discovery in Washington State of a single
case of mad cow disease. In April this year, it lifted the ban on
U.S. boneless beef from animals under 30 months of age, but again
suspended American beef imports on June 25 after a second case of mad
cow disease was confirmed in the U.S. earlier the same month.</P>
      <P>U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johannes, who is now in Hong
Kong attending the WTO meeting, on Friday urged Taiwan, South Korea,
China, Hong Kong and Singapore to follow Japan and lift their bans on
U.S. beef as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Taipei City Government will hold a 
two-day international forum on "Creative City: The Birth of 
Creativity" from Saturday at the Chinese Culture University's
international conference room in Taipei in an attempt to encourage
the development of creative and cultural industries in Taiwan's
largest city.</P>
      <P>The forum is organized by the city government's Department of
Cultural Affairs and is co-sponsored by the British Council.</P>
      <P>In addition to local academics, five experts from the United
Kingdom, including former British Culture Secretary Chris Smith, will

Kingdom's experiences in developing creative industries.</P>
      <P>The discussions at the forum will cover five major areas: 
national policies, city planning, education, alternative cultures, 
and science and technology.</P>
      <P>Liao Hsien-hao, head of the Department of Cultural Affairs under 
the Taipei City Government, acknowledged at a news conference Friday 
that in promoting cultural industries, Taiwan has often neglected 
creativity, which should be at the core of these industries.</P>
      <P>He said that the Taipei City Government will try to provide a 
friendly environment for creative industries to develop in the city.</P>
      <P>The emerging creative industries have become an increasingly

    <TEXT>
      <P>Just over 510,000 people in Taiwan 15 years
old and over are illiterate, 2.84 percent of Taiwan's total
population as of the end of last year, an official with the Ministry
of Education said Friday.</P>
      <P>The official at the ministry's Social Education Department said
an overwhelming majority of the illiterate are elderly citizens who
grew up during Japanese colonial rule or the early years of the
Kuomintang administration.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's illiteracy rate remains higher than the
internationally acceptable norm of 2 percent, the official said the
ministry continues to promote various adult education programs to
address this problem.</P>
      <P>Apart from elderly illiterate citizens, the official said a new
group of the illiterate is being seen. They are the ever-increasing
foreign spouses of local citizens. Illiterate foreign spouses are not
included in the illiteracy tallies until they obtain Taiwan
citizenship.</P>
      <P>In the future, he said, the ministry will put more emphasis on
organizing adult education programs for illiterate foreign spouses
through cooperation with city and county governments and private
non-profit foundations.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China should allow its citizens to
regularly tour Taiwan's outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu via the
"three mini links" as a way to promote cross-strait exchanges, Vice
Chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council Liu Te-shun said Friday.</P>
      <P>A news reports said that Beijing will allow 600 citizens to visit
Kinmen for sightseeing during the 2006 New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>The report said that Chinese authorities have planned Kinmen tour
packages for Jan. 1-3. </P>
      <P>Calling for regular tourist visits by Chinese people to Kinmen
and Matsu, Liu said limiting the number of tourists and restricting
the time they can visit does little to boost cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>China did not allowed people from Fujian province in southern
China to make sightseeing visits to Kinmen and Matsu until September,
2004. In December that year, only 55 Chinese tourists visited Kinmen
because of China's reluctance to encourage tourist visits to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has since 2003 prepared Kinmen to receive about 600
Chinese people per day. However, this year the outlying island has
only seen about 300 Chinese tourists on average per month.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health Friday declared
Gerber's baby carrot food in Taiwan's stores safe after tests
conducted by the Bureau of Food and Drug Analysis showed that the
cadmium content in the product is well below the maximum allowed
level.</P>
      <P>Four days ago, the health department ordered that all carrot baby
food in jars produced by Gerber's Products Co. of the United States
be removed from shelves in Taiwan's stores after news reports said
that 300 cases of Gerber's Stage One pureed carrots in Israel were
found to contain 30 to 40 times more than allowed levels of cadmium.</P>
      <P>Tests done by the Bureau of Food and Drug Analysis showed that
Gerber's Stage Two carrot baby food -- for babies who are
six-month-old or over -- sold in Taiwan has a cadmium level of 0.013
ppm, much lower than the safe standard of 0.1 ppm.</P>
      <P>Chen Lu-hung, a senior DOH official in charge of food sanitation,
confirmed that Gerber's carrot baby food sold in Taiwan is not only
different from that in Israel, which is for four- to six-month-old

      <P>The official also said that sales of the Gerber product in Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SUCCEEDS IN PROTECTING PACIFIC TUNA FISHING RIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has succeeded in protecting its
bigeye tuna fishing rights in the Central and Western Pacific at a
just-concluded regional fishery meeting, the Fisheries Administration
under the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to a resolution adopted at the Dec. 12-16 annual
conference of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission
(WCPFC) in Micronesia, the bigeye tuna fishing catch for each member
state or non-member cooperative partner for the next three years
(2006-2008) should be capped at the average of their catch between
2001 and 2004.</P>
      <P>COA officials said this means that Taiwan will be able to catch
up to 15,000 tons of bigeye tuna in the region annually in the next
three years, more than Taiwan's 2004 tuna catch in the region.</P>
      <P>"The WCPFC conference decision is favorable to us, " a Fisheries
Administration official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's delegation to the 2005 WCPFC conference was headed by
Hsieh Ta-wen, director of the Fisheries Administration.</P>
      <P>The delegation was originally afraid that Japan might propose a
drastic cut in Taiwan's bigeye tuna fishing quota in the Central and
Western Pacific following its success in having Taiwan's quota in the
Atlantic slashed to a mere 4,600 tons for 2006 from this year's
14,900 tons.</P>
      <P>To avert any possible domino effect, the delegation took pains to
explain Taiwan's strenuous efforts at protecting fishery ecology and
its marine resources management achievements before the formal onset
of the conference.</P>
      <P>"Our delegation also made it clear that we would not accept any
resolution specifically targeting Taiwan but would support universal
and non-discriminatory resolutions, " the official said. </P>
      <P>Japan proposed at the WCPFC meeting that the bigeye tuna fishing
quota for the coming three years be capped at the 2000 catch. Such a
proposal was unfavorable to Taiwan because Taiwan only had seven or
eight fishing vessels operating in the region that year, with a total
catch of about 7,000 tons. Fortunately, the Japanese proposal was
vetoed.</P>
      <P>It was also decided at the WCPFC meeting that the catch ceilings
for other tuna species, such as longfin tuna, for the coming three
years should not exceed each member state's 2004 catch.</P>
      <P>The participants also discussed many practical law enforcement
measures, including monitoring systems for fishing boats and observer
dispatch programs, to better conserve fishery resources.</P>
      <P>The fishery official said local fishing vessels should refrain
from all illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities to
ensure the fishing industry's sustainable development.</P>
      <P>Acting on Japan's proposal, the ICCAT decided to impose a cut in
its quota for Taiwan's bigeye tuna fish catch by around 70 percent,
from 14,900 tons to 4,600 tons, during its annual conference last
month, forcing Taiwan to reduce the number of its bigeye tuna fishing
boats operating in the Atlantic to 15 for 2006.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will deliver a
major policy speech while presiding over the commissioning ceremony
for two Kidd-class destroyers at a naval base in the northern port
city of Keelung Saturday, government sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen is expected to touch on Taiwan's political situation after
the Dec. 3 local government chiefs elections in which the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was soundly beaten, winning only
six out of the 23 seats up for grabs, the sources said.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Chen will recount China's relentless expansion of
its military might and explain in detail a new way of thinking and
vision for Taiwan's national security.</P>
      <P>Chen will also reaffirm the government's established policy on
the long-stalled arms procurement plan under which the military wants
to buy three big-ticket weaponry items from the United States --
eight diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.</P>
      <P>The two Kidd-class destroyers -- the "1801 Keelung" and the "1802
Suao" -- purchased from the United States, were delivered to Taiwan
early this month.</P>
      <P>President Chen will officiate at the commissioning ceremony in
his capacity as the commander-in-chief of the ROC armed forces. Vice
President Annette Lu, Premier Frank Hsieh, Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng and many senior military officers will attend the
ceremony.</P>
      <P>Navy staff and seed instructors, as well as repair and
maintenance technicians had received training in the United States to
prepare for the delivery of the two de-mothballed destroyers, which
have also undergone sea trials and weaponry systems tests over the
past month, naval authorities said.</P>
      <P>With a full displacement of 9,783 tons, the Kidd-class destroyers
are the largest warships in the country's naval fleet. Equipped with
many advanced weaponry systems, the new destroyers are expected to
help upgrade the Navy's defense capability.</P>
      <P>Taiwan purchased four Kidd-class destroyers, built in the late
1970s, at a cost of NT$24 billion (US$730 million) in June 2003. The
other two destroyers are expected to be delivered by the end of 2006.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has planned a national project to
develop the island into a high-tech research and manufacturing center
in the Asia-Pacific region by 2010, President Chen Shui-bian said on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen unveiled the plan at the award presentation ceremony for two
recipients of the 2005 Presidential Science Prize, which was held at
the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>To achieve the goal of building Taiwan into a "technology island"
in its efforts to maintain and boost economic growth, the government
has raised the amount of its 2006 national research and development
fund to 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).</P>
      <P>In the 2006 draft government budget, the fund is listed at some
NT$84.3 billion (US$2.54 billion), Chen said.</P>
      <P>Two senior fellows from Academia Sinica, Lee Lou-chuang and Chen
Chien-jen, received the awards, the country's highest honor for
academic research, for their prominent contributions in the fields of
space science and public health.</P>
      <P>Lee, now head of the National Applied Research Laboratories, has
helped Taiwan successfully launch two satellites -- FORMOSAT-1 and
FORMOSAT-2 -- for scientific missions since he took over the post of
director of the National Space Program Office in 1997.</P>
      <P>The FORMOSAT-3, Taiwan's third satellite fabricated under Lee's
guidance, is scheduled to take off next year. "Lee has helped Taiwan
set up a world-class systems for scientific satellites, " said
Academic Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen was awarded for his research on arsenic poisoning.
For the past 20 years, Chen and his teams have carried out studies
involving tens of thousands of Taiwanese who suffer from chronic
arsenic poisoning because they drank contaminated well water.</P>
      <P>Thanks to his research, a worldwide reference for the safe level
of arsenic in drinking water was set up. Besides, the former minister
of the Department of Health also led Taiwan people to fight against
the islandwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
epidemic in 2003.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE BUDGET TO BE BOOSTED TO 3% OF GDP BY 2008: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's defense spending will be
increased to 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2008 as
part of the government's efforts to boost Taiwan's defense
capability, President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"This is our goal. It is also a key administrative priority which
we must do our best to achieve, " the president said while
commissioning two Kidd-class frigates for the Navy. The "1801
Keelung" and "1802 Suao" destroyers, named after two northern Taiwan
ports, arrived from the United States Dec. 8.</P>
      <P>Chen also used the occasion to voice his frustration, again, at
the legislature's failure to pass his government's special budget
bill for purchasing major weapons from the U.S.</P>
      <P>The president said he is concerned that the budget proposal for
buying eight conventional submarines, 12 anti-submarine aircraft and
six Patriot-III anti-missile batteries has been stalled in the
Legislative Yuan for so long. "What will we do if some day other
countries decide not to sell us weapons?" he asked.</P>
      <P>"This is an issue that everyone of us must think about, " he
added.</P>
      <P>He said the administration has followed the people's suggestion
by shifting some of the special budget for the arms procurement into
the defense ministry's regular annual budget, but the legislature
still hasn't passed it.</P>
      <P>"What should we (in the government) do to satisfy the
legislature? Please give me clear instructions so that the executive
branch can make changes to the budget plan," he added.</P>
      <P>He said the budget bill has been blocked from being put on the
legislative agenda 41 times, causing international concerns that
Taiwan seems unconcerned about its own defense.</P>
      <P>He called on all sectors of Taiwan society to "return to
reasonable discussion, " after the heated "three-in-one" local
election campaigns, about issues related to national security and
peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The legislature should at least allow the National Defense
Committee to discuss the arms purchase proposal, he said.</P>
      <P>The NT$480 billion budget bill for buying the three major weapons
items has been reduced to NT$340 billion for two items, with the
third item to be financed by the defense ministry's regular annual
budget.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION SHOULD MAKE CLEAR ITS STANCE ON ARMS PURCHASE PLAN: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 17 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislator said Saturday that the opposition parties should express
their real stance regarding the arms procurement plan so that the
administration can make necessary changes.</P>
      <P>Lee Wen-chung, a co-convener of the Legislative Yuan's National
Defense Committee, made the appeal following President Chen
Shui-bian's remarks earlier in the day that the country's defense
spending would be increased to 3 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) by 2008 to boost Taiwan's defense capability.</P>
      <P>Noting that President Chen has on many occasions stated his
intention to boost the country's defense spending, Lee urged the
president to show determination in implementing his promise.</P>
      <P>To his understanding, Lee said, if defense spending is to be
raised to 3 percent of GDP by 2008, then the annual military budget
needs to be increased by NT$50 billion (US$1.49 billion) for each of
the next three years, which he urged the government to do.</P>
      <P>Lee said that although it is the executive branch's
responsibility to list the budget, the opposition parties, which hold
a slight majority in the legislature, should state clearly their
stance regarding the arms purchase package, namely whether they want
it listed in the regular annual budget or scrapped altogether.</P>
      <P>The original arms procurement bill called for the purchase of the
three items in the package -- -- eight diesel-electric submarines, a
squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six Patriot PAC III
anti-missile batteries from the United States -- to be financed
through a special budget.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has since made changes to the bill, which now
calls for the six Patriot anti-missile batteries to be financed via
the defense ministry's regular annual budget.</P>
      <P>However, President Chen noted, the opposition parties have
continued to block the bill from being placed on the legislature's
agenda.</P>
      <P>Lee expressed concerns that the fact that the bill has been
stalled in the legislature for so long may make it more difficult to
convince the United States and other countries to sell the island
weapons in the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PAN-BLUE TO CONSIDER ARMS BILL IF DEFENSE SPENDING UPPED TO 3% OF GDP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 17 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) will consider allowing
debate on the administration's major arms purchase bill at the
legislature if the administration immediately boosts defense spending
to 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) , a senior KMT official
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT's Central Policy
Committee and party whip at the legislature, said that of the three
major items in the arms procurement package, the anti-missile
batteries have already been vetoed in a referendum, so the KMT will
only consider approving the purchase of the eight conventional
submarines and 12 P-3C Orion submarine-hunting aircraft, and only
through the defense ministry's regular annual budget.</P>
      <P>"The bill must be legal and reasonable, and not a single cent
should be wasted," he said.</P>
      <P>Sun Ta-chien, deputy convener of the PFP's legislative caucus,
agreed that his party will consider allowing the bill to be debated
if the administration agrees to list the funding for the purchase of
the submarines and anti-submarine aircraft in the ministry's regular
annual budget instead of in a special budget.</P>
      <P>Sun said the government must also settle the legal issue
surrounding the referendum held in conjunction with the presidential
vote in 2004, a referendum participated in by less than 50 percent of
the eligible voters concerning the nation's anti-missile capability.</P>
      <P>The two "pan-blue alliance" lawmakers were responding to
President Chen Shui-bian's appeal to the legislature to state clearly
what should be done to break the deadlock over the government's
NT$480 billion proposal to buy the three defense items from the
United States.</P>
      <P>Warning that China has been rapidly boosting its military might
and that Taiwan must defend its freedom and democracy from being
encroached upon by "authoritarian China, " Chen stressed that it's
imperative for the legislature to debate issues concerning national
security and cross-Taiwan Strait peace and to pass the arms purchase
bill before the current legislative session ends in late January.</P>
      <P>The president claimed that he was not being "selfish or partisan"
in making the appeal, as the purchase plan had been mapped out before
2000, when the KMT was still the ruling party, and delivery of all
three items would not begin until after 2008, when he is due to step
down. According to the Constitution, a president cannot serve more
than two terms.</P>
      <P>He also announced that defense spending will be increased to 3
percent of the nation's GDP by 2008 as part of the government's
efforts to boost Taiwan's defense capability.</P>
      <P>Tseng said the "pan-blue alliance" has neither opposed nor
boycotted a proposal to purchase military weapons for truly defensive
purposes, adding that what the alliance is against is "senseless use
of money like a free-spending prodigal son."</P>
      <P>"We have been blocking an unreasonable spending proposal so that
the executive branch does not waste the tax payers' hard-earned
money," Tseng said.</P>
      <P>If recent media reports are correct that both the government and
the United States are willing to see the stalemate overcome by means
of regular budgets, then the bill will no longer be a "special
budget" bill and the legislature's Procedures Committee needs no
longer block it, he said.</P>
      <P>Rather, it will have to deal with a regular budget bill that
contains weapons procurement in the defense ministry's budget, he
said.</P>
      <P>He called on the government to at once raise defense spending
from the current 2.4 percent of GDP to 3 percent of GDP in order to
cover the cost of financing the weapons purchases through the defense
ministry's regular annual budget. He said he made the call because
the year 2008 is quite far off and "uncertainty abounds" from now
till that time.</P>
      <P>As to the purchase of Patriot III anti-missile batteries, he said
there is no reason to list this item in the arms procurement bill
since it was voted down in the 2004 referendum. "The KMT caucus has
crossed it out from the regular budget," he said.</P>
      <P>Tseng assured that his party and the PFP will remain united when
it comes to reviewing the arms purchase bill at the Legislative Yuan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan office workers on average hope to
spend no more than 38 minutes per day on commuting, and convenience
and ticket fares are their main considerations in selecting their
means of transportation, according to the results of a survey
released Saturday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the online employment service

is said to have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage
points.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that the most popular form of public
transportation among the respondents is the bus, with 53.59 percent
of them taking buses regularly, followed by the MRT and the railway,
which are taken regularly by 49.25 percent and 32.63 percent of the
respondents, respectively.</P>
      <P>The purposes of taking public transportation mentioned by the
respondents include commuting to work (42.96 percent) , making
pleasure trips (36.68 percent) and returning to one's hometown to
visit relatives (22.75 percent).</P>

can handle 11-20 minutes, and 21.41 percent said they can bear 41-60
minutes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 70.66 percent of the respondents said they know that
the high-speed railway system will start operations late next year.</P>
      <P>On the effects of the launch of the high-speed railway services,
68.26 percent of the respondents believe that it will narrow
rural-urban disparity, 48.5 percent think that will boost the tourism
industry and commercial activities along the railway route, and 44
percent believe that will make possible one-day commuting between the
northern and southern parts of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also, 32.63 percent of the respondents said the coexistence of
the high-speed railway, the traditional railway and the MRT will form
a compact transportation network, 27.99 percent said it will form a
mutually beneficial system, and 23 percent said it will lessen the
time and space restrictions.</P>
      <P>In a separate survey conducted by the 1111 Job Bank on 572
business owners during the same period, 57.69 percent of the
respondents said they think the shortening of north-south travel time
will help attract more foreign investment and encourage the return of
businesses that have moved abroad.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 70.63 percent of the business owners said they will
invest more to expand their business if travel times are shortened.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu called for the Legislative Yuan Saturday to restore the
council's budget to maintain normal government operations and as an
effort to promote normal cross-Taiwan Strait development.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the MAC's budget for 2006 was slashed at a joint
meeting of the Legislative Yuan's interior affairs committee and
budget committee Nov. 16., with only the funding for the council's
personnel salaries being kept intact.</P>
      <P>Wu said it is not a reasonable action to wipe a budget listed for
government operations. He urged the Legislative Yuan to give the MAC
a chance to explain its planned operations in 2006 and to request the
funds for these operations.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance, " which holds a slim majority
in the Legislative Yuan, engineered the budget cut, saying that it
would only restore the budget after five major policy initiatives
were implemented.</P>
      <P>The initiatives include enacting the revised Executive Yuan
Organization Law; setting a timetable for the opening of direct
transportation links across the Taiwan Strait; opening Taiwan to
Chinese tourists; opening Sungshan and Chingchuankang airports to
direct flights to and from Hong Kong and Macau; and implementing
direct cross-strait charter flights during the Chinese Lunar New

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Finance Minister Lin Chuan called for
public support Saturday for the government's taxation reforms,
stressing that the reforms are aimed ultimately at achieving low tax
rates to boost economic growth.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks while giving a speech at the Chunghua
Association of Public Finance, after the government's minimum tax
rates policy triggered opposition from the business sector.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan last week passed a law which requires
companies that earn more than NT$2 million a year to pay between 10
percent and 20 percent in corporate income tax. Meanwhile,
high-income individuals who earn more than NT$6 million per year are
required to pay at least 20 percent in personal income tax.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that the government's revenues as a ratio of
gross domestic product (GDP) have increased slightly in recent years,
with the ratio rising from the 12.3 percent in 2002 to 13.9 percent
in 2004, but that it was still lower than the 15.9 percent of the
financially tight Japan.</P>
      <P>Lin attributed the situation to the eroded tax base.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, it is impossible for the government to increase
its revenues by simply hiking tax rates. Therefore, the objective of
the taxation reforms is to make the tax burden light and allow
economic growth to naturally enhance the government's revenues, he
said.</P>
      <P>Lin said it will be difficult for the government to lower tax
rates unless the tax base is expanded.</P>
      <P>He noted that the implementation of minimum income tax rates is
one of the government's efforts to broaden the tax base and to create
a fair tax system.</P>

      <P>The ministry will hold a ceremony at the Taan District's
population administration office under the Taipei City Government on
the inaugural day to mark the event, an MOI official said.</P>
      <P>During the ceremony, Premier Frank Hsieh and Minister of the

to Sun Yueh, a popular actor-turned-volunteer, to mark the start of
issuance, the official said.</P>
      <P>His remarks were seen as a response to a newspaper report that
Sun would be the first to get the new-version ID card.</P>
      <P>"The question of who will get the first new ID card is not an

      <P>Nearly 19 million of the new ID cards will be handed out before
the set deadline of Dec. 31, 2006.</P>
      <P>According to MOI regulations, local citizens can commission other
people to apply for ID card renewal but should pick up their new ID
cards in person so that population administrators can verify the
authenticity of the photos on the ID cards. Nevertheless, population
office staff will offer home delivery services for frail elderly
citizens, seriously ill patients and those with major disabilities.</P>
      <P>As to whether the president and vice president should personally
claim their new ID cards, the official said it's up to local
population offices to decide in line with all relevant rules.</P>
      <P>"If the local population offices want to offer home delivery
services for our head of state and his deputy in consideration of
security risks, the MOI will respect the decision. Likewise, if they

      <P>Noting that Taiwan actually registered a trade deficit for three
of the first six months of the year, the BOFT said that it is
possible that the island's trade surplus for the whole of 2005 could
be as low as US$3 billion.</P>
      <P>Asked by reporters about the rare decline in Taiwan's trade
surpluses, Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh said recently
that she is not concerned about the trend as it is "just a temporary
situation."</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has accumulated huge foreign reserves, Ho said
it is not necessary for the island to increase significantly its
trade surpluses annually.</P>
      <P>The public should not overreact to the trade surplus figures and
should instead look at the overall trends in the island's trade
performance, Ho stressed.</P>
      <P>Noting that the island's exports have not shrunk, Ho said the
recent decrease in Taiwan's trade surpluses is due to the rise in the
total value of imports caused by sharp hikes in oil prices as well as
the purchase from abroad of high speed train carriages, machinery
equipment and airplanes. She also said that Taiwan people bought
nearly US$1 billion in gold in the first 11 months of the year as
investment in expectation of surging prices.</P>
      <P>Ho noted that if these temporary and unusual factors are
excluded, then Taiwan's trade surplus for this year is similar to
that of previous years.</P>
      <P>Huang stressed that Taiwan's trade and industrial structure are
sound and that the decline in Taiwan's trade surpluses is not a
long-term trend.</P>
      <P>According to Industrial Development Bureau estimates, Taiwan's
overall imports will decrease next year as Taiwan can increase
supplying DRAM, phone cells and chemical products to its own market,
and the island's trade deficit with South Korea is not expected to
expand further.</P>
      <P>Wu Hui-lin, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research (TIER), noted that in international trade, there should be a
balance maintained in imports and exports over the long term and that
excessive trade surpluses are not healthy, adding that an
occasionally shrinkage in trade surplus figures is not necessarily a
bad thing.</P>
      <P>He urged the public not to overreact to the decline in trade
surplus figures, saying that more attention should be payed to
whether both exports and imports are registering growth.</P>
      <P>To his understanding, Wu said, Taiwan has maintained a vigorous
economy, with both its exports and imports growing. He added that the
island's trade figures will move in positive directions if the
government doesn't intervene.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that
the four Kidd-class destroyers purchased from the United States will
be named after various Taiwanese ports, which he stressed has
significant meaning.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after commissioning two of the Kidd-class
destroyers for the ROC Navy at a ceremony at Keelung. The "1801
Keelung" and "1802 Suao" destroyers, named after two domestic ports
in northern Taiwan, arrived from the United States Dec. 8.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that naval vessels have been given names
of geographical locations in Taiwan, under the legislature's
proposal.</P>
      <P>The remaining two Kidd-class destroyers, which are expected to be
delivered by the end of 2006, will be named "Tsoying" and "Makung, "
which are ports located in Koahsiung and on the outlying island of
Penghu, respectively.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the ships' being named after the four
important naval ports in Taiwan has significant meaning in terms of
the determination to safeguard the island.</P>
      <P>The four Kidd-class destroyers, which the Ministry of National

youth policy.</P>
      <P>The panel is made up of 21 young people who will represent

      <P>Presenting appointment certificates to the panel members, NYC
Chairwoman Cheng Li-chiun said the group of young people might not

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT INCOMPETENCE TOP CAUSE OF DISTRESS AMONG TEENS: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's incompetence is the top
source of distress among local teens, a non-profit foundation
dedicated to social education and service said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a "youth misery index" survey,
conducted by the Tosun Foundation between September and November, the
top five causes of youth distress were all related to the
government's inaction or sloppy performance.</P>
      <P>The survey found that environmental pollution topped the list in
terms of the main causes of youth distress, with a misery index of
79.8 points on a zero-to-100 scale.</P>
      <P>Second on the list was domestic political chaos, with a misery
index of 75.4 points; followed by inadequate legal protection, with
an index of 73.4 points; topsy-turvey educational reform, at 71.4
points; and chaotic traffic, with a misery index of 68.6 points.</P>
      <P>The Tosun Foundation has compiled a "youth misery index" annually
in terms of youth feelings about five categories of factors -- school
environment, family influence, social climate, future prospects and
government performance. Five sub-items were gauged in each category.</P>
      <P>This year's survey found that poor government performance was the
worst cause of youth distress, with the category's overall misery
index reaching 73.5 points.</P>
      <P>Much to the foundation's surprise, academic workload was not a
major cause of youth distress in comparison.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the average 2005 youth misery index stood at 61.29
points, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>For this year's misery index, the foundation sent out
questionnaires to 20 selected junior high and senior high schools as
well as vocational schools and junior colleges around Taiwan and
collected 2,202 valid copies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Fifty-three members of the U.S. House
of Representatives sent a joint letter to Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice Friday asking for an explanation why Taiwan is left
out of the US-initiated International Partnership on Avian and
Pandemic Influenza (IPAPI) network.</P>
      <P>The congressmen also urged Rice to help pave the way for Taiwan
to be invited to the next full meeting of the IPAPI, scheduled for
January 2006 in Beijing.</P>
      <P>The letter, initiated by Rep. Robert Andrews (D-NJ) and co-signed
by -- among others -- House International Relations Committee
chairman Henry Hyde, reads: "We encourage you to work with Taiwan as
apart of the international effort to combat the avian flu, despite
Taiwan's exclusion from the WHO. Please provide an update on how the
Administration has been working with Taiwan in combating the avian
flu in the face of its official isolation. We also ask what steps
will be taken to ensure Taiwan's involvement in international health
cooperation in the future."</P>
      <P>Stressing that diseases know no borders, the congressmen said in
their joint letter that Taiwan cannot afford to be the missing link
in this international battle against the avian flu. "Even more
importantly, the global community cannot afford to leave Taiwan out,"
it added.</P>
      <P>The Formosan Association For Public Affairs (FAPA) , a
Washington-headquartered non-profit organization to promote Taiwan's
cause, said Friday it is unimaginable that with the Avian Flu
currently spreading through Asia, Taiwan, being in the heart of the
region, is noticeably absent in the related global network.</P>
      <P>FAPA president-elect C.T. Lee, a medical doctor, said that saving
lives is the sacred duty that every doctor must uphold regardless the
patient's sex, religion, race or profession. "The same universality
should be applied by the international arena to the case of Taiwan, "
he contended.</P>
      <P>Urging the international community to stop playing politics over
the lives of the Taiwanese people, Lee said Taiwan should have access

Senators Thwart Bush Bid to Renew Law on

The U.S. Senate on Friday blocked
reauthorization of the broad antiterrorism bill
known as the USA Patriot Act, pushing Congress
into a game of brinksmanship with President
Bush, who has said the nation will be left
vulnerable to attack if the measure is not

Republicans saying the bill does not go far
enough in protecting civil liberties, the
Republican leadership fell short of the 60 votes

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A reform-minded prosecutors group voiced
opposition Saturday to a proposal to set up a special attorney system
to allow for "independent inquiry" into certain controversial cases.</P>
      <P>The Prosecutors Reform Association was responding to reports that
44 independent and opposition lawmakers have drafted a statute on the
establishment of an "independent attorney system" patterned after the
now-defunct U.S. special attorney system.</P>
      <P>According to the draft statute, one-third of lawmakers can come
up with a motion to appoint a prosecutor to launch an independent
inquiry into a special judicial case.</P>
      <P>If such a statute were to be enacted, the association said, the
so-called "independent prosecutor" would be unable to work
independently and without political interference. The system would
end up as a tool for partisan grandstanding, the association.</P>
      <P>The United States installed a special attorney system for
investigating the Watergate scandal back in the 1970s. As the system
failed to live up to public expectations, the system was phased out
in 1999. The last special attorney, Kenneth W. Starr, spent about
NT$1.4 billion in five years from 1994 investigating the Whitewater
scandal involving then-U.S. President Bill Clinton, but failed to get
any concrete results.</P>
      <P>The association said the best way for judicial reform is for the
Legislative Yuan to pass a package of law revisions to require
legislative approval in the appointment of the nation's top
prosecutor and institutionalize a prosecutorial screening body.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OBSERVERS TO BE SENT TO 15 TAIWANESE SHIPS OPERATING IN ATLANTIC: COA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Fisheries Administration under the
Council of Agriculture (COA) will soon dispatch monitors to 15 Taiwan
vessels that will continue to operate in the Atlantic Ocean, fishery
officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The officials noted the administration has recently started a
training program and the first batch of 15 trainees will be
responsible for monitoring the operations of the vessels and the
registration of their catches.</P>
      <P>The 15 were originally ocean science observers collecting
information of ocean resources, the officials said. They are
receiving training on fishery management and disciplinary regulations
to facilitate their new tasks.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries Administration is planning to train another 15
people, hoping to boost the number of observers stationed on the
ships to at least 30 so that they could work on a rotational basis,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials also said that they are now communicating with port
countries via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on arranging the
observers to board the Taiwanese vessels either in Las Palmas, Spain,
or Cape Town, South Africa.</P>
      <P>The first group of 15 observers are expected to board the ships
between the end of December and January next year, and they should be
able to start work in early 2006.</P>
      <P>The observers will monitor the operations of the vessels and
check if they have registered their fishery catches according to
regulations. They will report the catches daily to the Fisheries
Administration, which will in turn report the information to the
International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna
(ICCAT).</P>
      <P>The ICCAT last month cut Taiwan's total allowable bigeye tuna
fishing quota from 14,900 tons in 2005 to a mere 4,600 tons for the
coming year because of overfishing by Taiwan fishing vessels.</P>
      <P>The decision was made on the last day of the ICCAT's 19th regular
meeting held in Seville, Spain, after Japan proposed a quota cut
citing overfishing by Taiwanese vessels.</P>
      <P>Most bigeye tunas caught by Taiwanese boats are sold to Japan.
The amount exported to Japan in the past two years has exceeded the
total yearly catch quota, prompting the overfishing allegation.</P>
      <P>Japan has also accused the Taipei government of failing to
supervise operations of the tuna-fishing industry, saying
mismanagement had led to overfishing.</P>
      <P>As a result, 42 fishing vessels specializing in catching bigeye
tuna in the Atlantic will not be able to operate during 2006. Only 15
Taiwan vessels will be allowed to continue fishing.</P>

      <P>Former Presidential Office chief of staff
Yu Shyi-kun formally announced his candidacy for the chairmanship of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Sunday.</P>
      <P>Yu, a founding member of the DPP, announced his intention to run
at a news conference in the Grand Hotel, where the DPP was founded 19
years ago. He stressed that he has already resigned his post as the
secretary-general of the Presidential Office and is in the race
purely in his capacity as a member of the party.</P>
      <P>The DPP chairmanship election became necessary after former
Chairman Su Tseng-chang stepped down to take responsibility for the
party's humiliating defeat in the Dec. 3 local government elections.</P>
      <P>Commenting on remarks by Legislator Trong Chai, an opponent in
the race, that Yu should make clear whether he will run for president
in 2008 if he is elected DPP chairman, the former Presidential Office
chief of staff said that no DPP member should talk about the 2008
presidential race at this crucial juncture.</P>
      <P>Chai's remarks echoed an open statement by former DPP Chairman
Lin Yi-hsiung that an incumbent DPP chairman should not run for
president in 2008.</P>
      <P>Yu said that the DPP is facing the most difficult time since its
founding, and that the highest interests for the party and the state

      <P>He added that the voters used their ballots to make the DPP
reflect upon itself, and that the DPP must heed the voices of the
people and speed up reform.</P>
      <P>Yu stressed that the DPP can win back the people's trust and
respect only by demonstrating through action that the DPP is a
selfless party that can shoulder heavy responsibilities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HOW U.S. ARMS PACKAGE IS FUNDED MAY BE IMMATERIAL: KMT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Changing the funding method for the
administration's U.S. arms procurement bill from a special military
budget to a regular Ministry of National Defense budget will not
necessarily make the package more acceptable to the opposition-
controlled legislature, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" legislative caucuses will
accept an arms procurement bill only when they consider it to have
been drafted after professional assessments and when it genuinely
meets Taiwan's defense needs, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has
"indulged" itself in using the "special budget" plan, a practice that
apparently runs counter to the spirit of the nation's special budget
law and that was the main reason why the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" lawmakers have continued to block the bill.</P>
      <P>Ma, however, pointed out that even if the Executive Yuan changes
the funding for the three weapon systems -- six Patriot III
anti-missile batteries, eight conventional submarines and 12 P-3C
Orion submarine-hunting aircraft -- regardless of whether the arms
procurement is funded by an annual budget or by a special budget, the
DPP government is still not coming to grips with the reason that the
opposition is against the bill.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in response to President Chen Shui-bian's
appeal the day before to the legislature to state clearly what should
be done to break the deadlock over the government's NT$480 billion
proposal to buy the three defense items from the United States.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the opposition parties have never objected to arms
procurement, but the "pan-blue alliance" is opposed to
"cash-for-friendship" purchase plans.</P>
      <P>Under this mentality, Ma said, the country should jointly review
what weapon systems are truly needed to beef up Taiwan's defense.
Should such a purchase only be confined to those three items as the
administration has proposed? Or other weapon systems should also be
considered?</P>
      <P>Warning that China has been rapidly boosting its military might
and that Taiwan must defend its freedom and democracy from being
encroached upon by "authoritarian China, " Chen stressed Saturday
that it's imperative for the legislature to debate issues concerning
national security and cross-Taiwan Strait peace and to pass the arms
purchase bill before the current legislative session ends in late
January.</P>
      <P>"If recent media reports are correct that both the government and
the United States are willing to see the stalemate overcome by means
of regular budgets, then the bill will no longer be a 'special
budget' bill and the legislature's Procedures Committee has no
further cause to block it," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The international community must play a
role to prevent China from internalizing the issue of Taiwan and stop
it from attacking the island, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in
a position paper released recently.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministry has sent the 10-page paper in English to
overseas missions.</P>
      <P>The ministry warned that if the international community accepts
China's rhetoric that the Taiwan issue is an internal affair, then it
will only encourage Beijing to launch an attack against Taiwan, which
it said will further endanger the security of the Taiwan Strait and
East Asia.</P>
      <P>To avoid this, the United Nations must send envoys or inspection
groups to assess the security in the Taiwan Strait, and regularly
report their finding to the U.N.</P>
      <P>In addition, the international community should support Taiwan to
join official or "Track II" communication channels -- a proposed
communication mechanism that would be in addition to the current
channel of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation and Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait -- to help
establish a framework to build confidence between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lastly, the international community should firmly advocate its
stance to solve the Taiwan issue peacefully and categorically condemn
the use of force against Taiwan via any means necessary, the position
paper said.</P>

    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Dec.   17  (CNA)
(By Chiang Chun and Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Victory for main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou in Taiwan's 2008 presidential
race is not a sure thing despite the KMT's landslide win in the Dec.
3 local government elections, KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen said in
the United States Saturday.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the observation while attending a rally with the
producer and a co-hostess of a talk show on Taiwan's Videoland OnTV
channel at the invitation of supporters of the "pan-blue alliance" of
the KMT and the People First Party in San Francisco.</P>
      <P>In her analysis of the political situation in Taiwan after the
KMT's resounding election victory, Cheng cautioned "pan-blue
alliance" supporters that it is too early to be complacent about the
election results because the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will surely stage a comeback in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The KMT spokeswoman pointed out that although the DPP suffered a
humiliating defeat in the Dec. 3 elections, its candidates still
managed to win 41 percent of the popular vote -- only 9 percent less
than KMT candidates.</P>
      <P>Cheng said it would be wrong for "pan-blue alliance" supporters
to believe that Ma could win the 2008 presidential race easily as
long as he does not make any serious mistakes in the run-up to the
election.</P>
      <P>She explained that the Dec. 3 elections were only local ones
where "clean government" had been made a central issue, whereas the
presidential election will certainly be fought on different fronts,
with heated debate on such issues as cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Cheng added that the Dec. 3 elections were only a prelude to the
KMT's "battle of honor, " and that the KMT must rebuild its
partnership with the people and manage that relationship assiduously
in order to win back the power it has lost as the ruling party since
2000.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 18 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, former secretary-general of
the Presidential Office, said Sunday that he has what it takes to get
the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) back on track after the party
was soundly beaten in recent local elections.</P>
      <P>The ruling DPP will elect a new chairman after Su Tseng-chang
stepped down to take political responsibility for the party's poor
showing in the elections for local leaders. Registration for
candidacy for the DPP chairmanship race is Dec. 19-20 and balloting
by party members islandwide will be on Jan. 15. The winner will
officially be announced Jan. 18.</P>
      <P>While officially announcing his candidacy for the DPP's top post,
Yu said the recent election results should serve as a wake-up call
for the party.</P>
      <P>"The DPP did poorly in the recent elections. This means that the
people decided to teach the party a lesson so that it learns to be
introspective and humble. This is undoubtedly the DPP's most
difficult time, " Yu said at a news conference at the Grand Hotel on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The opposition has made considerable progress. Therefore, the
DPP will have to accelerate reforms. I don't talk much, but I keep my
word. I will prove that I can win back the people's trust and respect
with concrete actions," Yu added.</P>
      <P>Yu said he chose the Grand Hotel to announce his candidacy
because the DPP was officially launched there on Sep. 28, 1986.</P>
      <P>However, Yu did not comment on his priorities for party reform
and what he would do if elected. "I will make announcements on my
policies in the future," he said.</P>
      <P>Asked if he would run for president in 2008, Yu replied that no
one in the DPP is qualified to talk about this right now.</P>
      <P>Some reports have said that former party chairman Lin I-hsiung
would also run for chairman, but this would be contradictory to his
declaration made on Friday that past chairmen are not fit to run and
that the party needs new blood at the top if it is to properly
reform.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER DPP CHAIRMAN'S LATEST MOVE HAS  EVERYONE GUESSING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major factions within the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Sunday that they were perplexed as to
why former DPP Chairman Lin I-hsiung asked for registration forms for
the party chairmanship by-election, which is scheduled to take place
Jan. 15.</P>
      <P>Lin sent an aide to get the registration forms Saturday.
Registration for the new chairman will run until Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin published an open letter Friday during which he said that
those who have served as president, vice president, premier or party
chairman are not suitable to serve as the new chairman, and should
any of those "old guards" come out, he would "dissuade them in all
earnestness." He also said that the new party chairman should not run
for Taipei or Kaohsiung mayor in 2006 or for president in 2008.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Wen-chung of the New Tide faction said that Lin is
not fit to run in this election if his criteria are to be followed
and speculated that Lin was "obtaining the registration forms for
someone else."</P>
      <P>Lin has long been reported to be hoping to recruit others to run
for party chairman, Lee said, adding that Lin is closely associated
with the party and he is worried about the fate of the party after
its unprecedented defeat in the Dec. 3 local elections, speculating
that Lin is "looking for someone to lead the party forward."</P>
      <P>Legislator Gao Jyh-peng of the Justice Alliance said that he
"had no idea" why Lin's aide took the registration forms.</P>
      <P>Gao also said that Yu Shyi-kun, who stepped down from his post as
secretary-general to the Presidential Office to announce his
candidacy for party chairman Friday, is unlikely to bow out of the
race because of Lin's opposition. Yu was a former premier.</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Wei-cher of the Justice Alliance also said that
Lin's move does not mean that he will run himself, and that he
"probably is not satisfied with anyone who has come out so far."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, pro-independence Legislator Trong Chai, who was the
first to register his candidacy, said he couldn't figure out why Lin
would want registration forms with his understanding of the latter's
character.</P>
      <P>On whether Lin's move aims to embarrass Yu as reports have said,
Chai would not give a direct answer.</P>
      <P>Chai also challenged Yu to say clearly whether he will run for
president in 2008.</P>
      <P>Lin, who was at the party helm between 1998 and 2000, has faded
from the political scene and has been engaged in working for a
nuclear-free homeland since successfully stumped for Chen Shui-bian
in the 2000 presidential election. He is highly respected within the
party because of his image of integrity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HALF OF TAIWAN COMPANIES MAINTAIN POOR MANAGEMENT OF FOREIGN WORKERSBy Deborah Kuo</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> CNA staff reporter</P>
      <P>Taipei, Dec. 18 (CNA) Nearly half of Taiwan's major foreign
worker employers poorly manage their foreign staff, a survey
conducted by the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs has found.</P>
      <P>The labor affairs council conducted the poll of 228 manufacturing
and construction companies which are employers of at least 100
foreign workers between mid-September and the end of October, finding
that five of the surveyed companies were already closed and 110
companies had violated the current laws governing foreign laborers
and related affairs in Taiwan. The rest, or 113 companies, have not
violated any laws.</P>
      <P>The labor council conducted the poll in the wake of a Thai worker
riot at a dormitory at a Kaohsiung MRT construction site in August --
a riot which was considered by political observers as one of the
major reasons for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party to suffer a
humiliating defeat in the Dec. 3 "three-in-one" local government
elections.</P>
      <P>It was found in the poll that 54 percent of the major foreign
worker employing companies have not maintained efficient and
sufficient bilingual signs at their factories or offices -- their
fire-fighting equipment and escape exits have signs only in Chinese.</P>
      <P>More than 30 percent of the respondent companies maintained
filthy living quarters and inadequate public places for the foreign
laborers and 20 percent of the respondents had tiny rooms for the
foreign workers and their water pumps were not cleaned regularly.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that many of the surveyed companies have
employed unqualified labor managers and some companies didn't even
have any labor management regulations.</P>
      <P>After the Kaohsiung Thai worker riot, the labor council
authorities promised to revamp the country's foreign labor policy and
amend the current foreign labor law to help improve working
conditions for the migrant workers -- roughly 320,000 of them, mostly
from Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam.</P>
      <P>A Council of Labor Affairs ad hoc group has submitted an 11-point
proposal recently on this effort. Main points of the proposal include
that the employer is subject to jail terms if the freedom, life or
property of the foreign laborers working at his company are
threatened or impaired.</P>
      <P>The potential foreign worker employer should submit a copy of the
company's foreign labor management regulations to the local
government for approval prior to hiring any foreign worker and the
local government authorities should conduct on-the-spot
investigations before granting the approval, according to the
proposal.</P>
      <P>The current broker system will be revamped too and there will be
a mechanism to judge which foreign labor brokers should be sacked or
retained based on assessment reports, the proposal says.</P>
      <P>The labor affairs community, however, has different opinions
about the council's moves aimed at amending the foreign labor law.</P>
      <P>However, Chen Su-hsiang, chairwoman of the Taiwan International
Workers Association, is doubtful about the labor council's revamp
plans, saying that the government is only applying a stopgap measure
and a piecemeal solution to a major issue.</P>
      <P>Chen added that the government should not treat foreign labor
affairs from the angle of "management." Rather, she said, the
government should improve Taiwan's foreign workers' policy from the
perspective of the foreign workers' needs and rights.</P>
      <P>Prof. Cheng Chih-yueh from National Cheng Chi University said
that regulations or laws are supposed to be enacted to serve a
nation's policy. If regulations or laws are legislated without
considering national policies, these laws will run parallel with the
intent of the nation's overall wishes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP FIRMLY OPPOSED TO ANY SPECIAL MILITARY BUDGET: PFP WHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec.  18 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP) is
firmly opposed to any military procurement plan of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) government that would leave the nation's debt
to future generations, a whip of the PFP's legislative caucus
reiterated Sunday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Sun Ta-chien, deputy convener of the PFP caucus in the
legislature, said that in view of the nation's serious financial
deficits, the PFP will oppose any military procurement plans in the
form of special central government budgets.</P>
      <P>Sun stressed that the PFP will never accept the plan of the
Ministry of National Defense to request a special budget to purchase
submarines, anti-submarine aircraft and Patriot anti-missile
batteries from the United States.</P>
      <P>Sun said that although the defense ministry has decided to
include its plan to purchase six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries in a regular fiscal year budget, the PFP is unlikely to
consent to this because this particular item had already been vetoed
by the people in the 2004 referendum that took place alongside the
presidential election.</P>
      <P>As for the submarines and the anti-submarine aircraft, Sun said
the PFP will agree to proceed with the screening of the procurement
plan if the two items are included in a regular budget. However, he
added, the PFP is unlikely to take the whole plan as it stands now.</P>
      <P>Sun also said that if President Chen Shui-bian is determined to
increase the national's military budget to 3 percent of the nation's
gross national product, he does not have to wait until 2008, but
should begin from next year.</P>
      <P>By doing so, the president would have NT$50 billion (US$1.5
billion) every fiscal year for military spending, and this would
allow the defense ministry to pay for what it intends to buy in six
years, Sun said.</P>
      <P>The opposition-controlled legislature has blocked two bills
submitted by the DPP government in the past two years seeking
approval of a special budget of NT$480 billion to purchase eight
diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The greater Taipei area will soon be
blanketed in wireless Internet access covering 28 square kilometers,
making it the largest in the world, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ma made the announcement at a news conference Sunday at an opening
ceremony of an online "brain game contest" at the offices of the
Taipei City Government.</P>
      <P>"Every city in the world is striving to become a place with as
many wireless Internet connection points as possible. In two days,
Taipei City will establish a wireless Internet zone that covers 5
percent of the most-populated area. From June or July next year,
around 90 percent of these areas will be provided with wireless
access," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Currently, the 28 square kilometer wireless coverage includes
Taipei's eastern sections, Hsimenting, Hsinyi and other areas around
Taipei Main Station where 2300 wireless Internet access points are
seen.</P>
      <P>"In other countries, places where wireless Internet is provided,
such as MacDonald's, hotels and schools, are called 'hot points.' But
Taipei has already become a 'hot zone,'" Ma said.</P>
      <P>He added that all the schools in Taipei City will have wireless
access, and that not only will laptop computers, mobile phone and
PDAs have access to the Internet, but PDAs will also be provided
Internet phone service.</P>
      <P>"I was recently exclusively interviewed by the Asian Wall Street
Journal and was asked the reason why Taipei should become a 'wireless
city' and how it can reach this goal. The reason is simple. It's for
Taipei to increase its competitiveness," the mayor said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is the best computer hardware manufacturer in the world
and more than 90 percent of wireless Internet ports are made here.
Plus, because of the government's support of such a plan, Taipei is
becoming a wireless city," Ma added.</P>
      <P>Ma also mentioned that he has used ICQ instant messaging in the
past. Now he sometimes uses MSN Messenger.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RESIDENTIAL OFFICE CLARIFIES IT DIDN'T INVITE WANG TO FORM CABINET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office on Sunday clarified
reports about inviting Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng to
form a Cabinet during a recent meeting with the president.</P>
      <P>In a news release, the Presidential Office said that the
president did express the hope of inter-party cooperation and
reconciliation between the ruling and the opposition parties during
the meeting.</P>
      <P>For the sake of political stability and harmony, the president is
sincere in meeting with main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou and exchange views with him on policies and the
consultations between the two could be arranged at any time, the news
release also said.</P>
      <P>The president also expressed the hope that all parties could put
aside their differences to push through major bills currently stalled
in the legislature, including a major arms procurement package from
the United States, in the interests of the nation and the people, it
said.</P>
      <P>The release was issued after reports said President Chen
Shui-bian has invited Wang to form a Cabinet, and that Wang, a former
KMT vice chairman, has reported to Ma about the matter. Ma said
Sunday that the prerequisite for Wang's serving as premier would
be a party-to-party consultation between the DPP and the KMT on the
matter.</P>
      <P>Ma said that under the current ROC Constitution, the nation
should practice the dual-leadership system, and the majority party
should form the Cabinet in conformity with democratic principles,
although the KMT will not take the initiative in asking to form the
Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Ma noted especially that the president has constitutional rights
regarding cross-Taiwan Strait and diplomatic affairs, but since there
is a big difference between the ruling and opposition parties on
cross-strait policies, consultations on policy are essential. "If
there are no consultations first, no matter who forms the Cabinet, it
is bound to fail," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Wang also said that President Chen discussed bills, policy and
Cabinet formation with him during Saturday's meeting, seeking
cooperation between the ruling and the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Wang said President Chen has several options, including
having incumbent Premier Frank Hsieh stay on, inviting the main
opposition party to form a Cabinet, and finding others within the DPP
to from a Cabinet.</P>
      <P>"President Chen didn't ask me to form a Cabinet, " Wang said,
adding that he was "only one of the possible options."</P>
      <P>Wang also said that he recommended Ma to the president to form
a Cabinet.</P>

into prostitution across Japan.</P>
      <P>The youngest from Taiwan was 19, while the oldest was 53, with
many of them in their thirties, the officials said. Police
investigations in the two countries showed that many of the Taiwan
women were cheated and lured to Japan by false job ads in Taiwan
newspapers, and police have found that more and more gangsters and
document forgery rings are increasingly involved in luring Taiwan
women to work in the sex trade in Japan.</P>
      <P>Tipped off by the representative office in Japan, Taiwan police
raided a human cargo smuggling group in southern Kaohsiung City in
January this year, and another human trafficking organization was
busted in central Taichung City in July, the officials said. In
addition, they pointed out that a group of human traffickers from
Taiwan and Japan was arrested by Japanese police in October in Chiba
prefecture.</P>
      <P>The three human smuggling groups in Taiwan and Japan were highly
connected to gangsters or document counterfeiting organizations, the
officials noted.</P>
      <P>Most of the Taiwan women tricked into going to Japan are usually
forced to work as prostitutes, and their passports are immediately
taken away upon their arrival in Japan by human traffickers who keep
tight control of their lives, they said, reiterating that Taiwan
women must be on high alert when reading classified ads offering jobs
in Japan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT-PFP TALKS TO TEST THE WATER ON WHETHER OR NOT TO MERGEBy   Flor   WangCNA staff writer</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  18  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Talks between the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and its "pan blue alliance" partner the People First
Party (PFP) on a planned merger early this month were intended to
test the water and to pave the way for future arrangements, according
to political commentators.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and PFP Chairman James Soong said
following the merger talks on Dec. 12 that "the two parties will keep
on cooperating in order to maintain the majority at the Legislative
Yuan" before a host of legal issues are resolved, but their remarks
have actually ruled out the possibility of an imminent merger for the
time being, analysts pointed out.</P>
      <P>In turn, Ma and Soong came to an agreement to coordinate a
mechanism by January next year for nominating candidates wishing to
take part in the elections in the coming two years, in particular the
legislative elections in 2007, in an effort to maintain a delicate
balance between them and allay grave concerns from supporters over
the future of the alliance, observers said.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT's landslide win in the Dec. 3 local government
elections has crowded out the PFP on Taiwan's political map, Ma made
it clear that the KMT will not "hold back" from the merger plan.</P>
      <P>Ma said last week that the KMT and the PFP will not touch on
substantial issues regarding the merger until 2007 as coming together
overnight is impossible, but he added that room will be ampler for
the two parties to collaborate in future elections.</P>
      <P>KMT spokeswoman Cheng Lee-wen said that in theory, the two
parties will not be able to complete the merger prior to the 2007
legislative elections out of consideration of retaining a majority at
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, opinions are sharply divided within the PFP,
given that around 60 percent of PFP lawmakers are wary of a merger
with the KMT despite the fact that a five-member task force has been
formed to take charge of merger talks.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman Soong and several hard-line lawmakers opposed to the
merger have said that they will not return to the KMT should a common
ground fail to be found within the party, overshadowing the
much-expected merger among supporters of the two parties, observers
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, it is worth noting whether a PFP national party
congress, slated for March next year, will endorse the merger -- a
development that analysts said would serve as a key gauge for "pan
blue" unity. They noted that the Ma-Soong talks only marked the very
first step towards setting up a mechanism for both to deal with each
other in view of a lack of mutual trust between the two parties.</P>
      <P>After the PFP performed miserably in the Dec. 3 election, the
party, a splinter from the KMT formed in 2000, has been driven by
"pan blue alliance" supporters to merge with the galvanized KMT,
which strongly won over the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, to
further secure "pan blue" victories in future elections.</P>
      <P>Ma has been tipped as the "pan blue" leader and the first option
for the 2008 presidential race following the election win, watchers
said.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Sun Ta-chien, one of the party's five-member ad hoc
team members, contended that a KMT-PFP merger will be the prevailing
trend for "pan blue" voters and he called for a quick merger to avert
a vicious circle.</P>
      <P>Sun said that he understands that some people in the PFP might
feel like they are being treated unfairly, and that they are having
to deal with a lot of pressure, but he said that the party should be
brave and open-minded towards the merger and that the KMT should be
sincere for the sake of "pan blue" unity.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Lee Chiang-an is also in favor of a merger with the
KMT, saying that the party's continued survival is being seriously
tested at a time when many supporters have turned to the KMT.</P>
      <P>The PFP must not balk at the public mandate regarding its future
development, because PFP voters are basic "pan blue" voters, she
said.</P>

Ordered Domestic Spying

U.S. President Bush acknowledged on Saturday that he had ordered

the National Security Agency to conduct an electronic

eavesdropping program in the United States without first

obtaining warrants, and said he would continue the highly

classified program because it was "a vital tool in our war

against the terrorists." He also lashed out at senators, both

reauthorization of the USA Patriot Act, which expanded the

president's power to conduct surveillance, with warrants, in

      <P>The sperm taken from the body of a late
Army Captain Sun Chi-hsiang will be destroyed, his elder brother Sun
Kui-sheng said in Taitung, eastern Taiwan Sunday.</P>
      <P>Sun Kui-sheng said his father Sun Yu-ching has written a letter
to Dr. Li Mao-sheng, an obstetrician in Taichung, central Taiwan to
destroy the sperm despite the opposition of his late bother's
unmarried girl friend Lee Hsing-yu who insisted on bearing her late
boy friend a child.</P>
      <P>As the legal successor of his late brother, Sun Kui-sheng said
his father has the full legal right to determine how to deal with the
sperm taken from Sun Chi-hsiang before he died from his wound
suffered in an accident in Sept. 7, and Lee is not in a position to
interfere with it.</P>
      <P>Although Lee loved his later brother, but it doesn't serve the
interest of a child conceived with sperm taken from a dead man and
born to a single mother, Sun Kui-sheng went on.</P>

Yu-ching's letter and would do what Sun Yu-ching says although Lee
Hsing-yu has warned him against destroying it.</P>
      <P>The doctor took the sperm at the request of Lee Hsing-yu after
getting the approval from the health authorities on Sept. 9.</P>
      <P>The health authorities was initially reluctant to give greenlight

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT URGED TO TALK WITH DPP MEMBERS BEFORE NAMING NEW PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian should first talk
with Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) members to seek a consensus
on the crucial issue of appointing a new premier, DPP Legislator
Trong Chai said Monday.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence Chai, who was the first to register his
candidacy for the DPP party chairmanship by-election slated for Jan.
15, made the call amid speculation that President Chen may invite a
an opposition politician to be premier after the DPP suffered a
humiliating defeat in the Dec. 3 "three-in-one" local government
elections.</P>
      <P>On rumors that Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pygn, an
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) stalwart, and even KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou may be on Chen's short list of candidates for premier as an
"unavoidable solution, " Chai said it would be unwise for Wang to
give up the helm of the legislature for the premiership, a position
which Chai called "as dangerous as a time bomb."</P>
      <P>As to Ma being a candidate for premier, Chai said that Ma is
"utterly distant from the qualities that a premier should have --
integrity and a strong Taiwan identity."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former Premier Yu Shyi-kun, who also announced
recently his bid to run for the DPP chairmanship, warned Monday that
it would be a disaster for the country for the sitting Cabinet to be
led by an opposition premier.</P>
      <P>"An opposition premier would leave the engine of the national
apparatus running and leading the nation nowhere," Yu claimed.</P>
      <P>Yu also lashed out at Ma for "manipulating" the media to create
the impression that President Chen is going to name Wang as the new
premier.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office clarified Monday that President Chen had
not talked with Wang about naming him as the next premier as Ma had
claimed a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Wang himself also denied Monday that President Chen had talked
with him about his being the next premier. "The president and I
talked about matters concerning a Cabinet reshuffle but definitely
not about me being a candidate for the post," he stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW DPP CHIEF SHOULDN'T RUN FOR OFFICE WITHIN 3 YEARS: PARTY OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is not appropriate for the new chairman
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to run for any
government post within three years of assuming the position as the
person should first dedicate themselves to establishing stability
within the party, a senior DPP member said Monday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chang Chun-hsiung, who has served in the past as
premier and as DPP chairman, made the remarks while responding to
reporters' questions at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>He said the new DPP chairman should refrain from running for
Taipei or Kaohsiung mayor in 2006 or from taking part in the
legislative elections in 2007 or the presidential election in 2008.</P>
      <P>Chang said he doesn't want to see the chairmanship post used
simply as a springboard for individuals seeking more political power,
adding that the party will suffer if it has to endure a succession of
leadership elections in the short span of three years.</P>
      <P>Su Tseng-chang stepped down Dec. 3 as DPP chairman to take
responsibility for the party's defeat in the Dec. 3 local government
chief elections. Vice President Annette Lu was appointed as interim
chairwoman by the party's decision-making Central Standing Committee

    <HEADLINE>MORE DISCUSSION REQUIRED BEFORE CABINET RESHUFFLE: LEGISLATIVE HEAD</HEADLINE>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More talks among leaders of the ruling and
opposition parties are required before President Chen Shui-bian makes
a decision on reshuffling the Cabinet, legislative speaker Wang
Jin-pyng said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang made the comments after a closed door meeting with
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou at the former's residence.</P>
      <P>Wang said he needs to consult with People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong as well as independent lawmakers in the
legislature on a lot of issues.</P>
      <P>He further said that Ma has not yet pledged his support for
Soong's idea of forming a coalition.</P>
      <P>Wang, who met with the president Saturday, echoed a statement
released by the Presidential Office on Sunday that Chen sought his
advice on a possible Cabinet reshuffle but did not ask him to head
the new Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The speaker also said Ma would like to talk with the president
about the Cabinet reshuffle issue, although the KMT chief said the
previous day that "policy should come before the selection of an
individual for the premiership."</P>
      <P>However, Wang said Ma ruled out the possibility of talks with the
president on the administration's arms procurement bill, claiming
that it is up to the KMT's legislative caucus how it deals with the
matter.</P>
      <P>The arms purchase budget bill has been stalled in the legislature
since being submitted last year because of the opposition of the KMT
and PFP.</P>
      <P>Noting that a meeting between the president and Ma would help
reconcile the political differences between the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the KMT, Wang said he will do his best to line
up a meeting between the two.</P>
      <P>He dismissed the significance of his meeting Saturday with the
president, pointing out that he often meets with him to exchange
views on domestic issues.</P>

Last-minute compromises by World Trade Organisation (WTO) member

break down trade barriers in agriculture and help improve the lives

eliminate by 2013 all farm export subsidies which give their farmers
an unfair advantage over developing nations.

    <HEADLINE>'TAIWAN FORREST GUMP' SETS OFF ON ROUND-ISLAND CHARITY CYCLING RIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chang Wen-yen, the first visually-impaired
person in Taiwan to finish a 42.195-km marathon unaided, is
challenging himself again by going on an ambitious 1,050-km
around-the-island cycling journey of charity.</P>
      <P>Chang, nicknamed "Taiwan's Forrest Gump" for his perseverance in
running, departed from the Taipei City Hall Square Monday on a tandem
bicycle with his trainer Wu Hsing-chuan to embark on the 13-day
journey aimed at raising funds to help 1,000 families facing severe
financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>Chang said upon departing on his journey that cycling non-stop
for four to five hours every day for almost two weeks straight will
be a new and tougher challenge for him as cycling puts much more
strain on the spine than long-distance running does.</P>
      <P>Wu, who is serving as Chang's eyes on the tandem bike journey,
said his task of navigating will be stressful as he will have to rely
on his voice alone in giving directions on a trip in which the pair
will have to face all sorts of challenging weather and road
conditions.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Chinese Christian Relief Association, which
is sponsoring the around-the-island charity cycling journey, said
that it is hoped that enough money is raised by the activity to
provide each of the 1,000 families with NT$5,000 per month for up to
four months to help them tide over their difficulties.</P>
      <P>Fifteen other cyclists are also taking part in the 13-day
around-the-island activity, including a pair brothers aged 9 and 11,
the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who greeted Chang at the starting
point of the journey, donated NT$10,000 from his own pocket in the
hopes that it will encourage others to make donations.</P>
      <P>Chang challenged himself in October 2003 by launching an
ambitious 1,000-km around-the-island run to commemorate renowned
writer Liu Hsia -- a wheelchair-bound activist fighting for the
rights of the physically and mentally challenged in Taiwan -- who
died Feb. 8, 2003.</P>
      <P>Chang completed the run in February 2004.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW METHOD DEVELOPED TO EVALUATE PROGRESS IN TREATMENT OF LUNG CANCER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new method of detecting genetic markers
for lung cancer in a person's blood developed by a local research
team is being used to better monitor the effectiveness of treatment,
a researcher from Academia Sinica said Monday.</P>
      <P>At a news conference called by Academia Sinica to unveil the
studies and research on the new technique, Pai Guo-neng, a researcher
of the Biomedical Institute of Academia Sinica, said the method was
developed jointly by himself and his colleagues from the National
Health Research Institutes and National Taiwan University Hospital.</P>
      <P>Noting that lung cancer is the top killer of women and has been
one of the top-10 causes of death of all people in Taiwan since 1982,
Pai said the number of local people suffering from this disease is
increasing rapidly.</P>
      <P>Although medical science has come a long way in recently years,
Pai said lung cancer therapy has not seen much progress; most
patients are only diagnosed with the disease when it is fairly
developed or terminal, only 20 percent of these can be treated with
surgery, and only 10 percent to 20 percent of these survive more than
five years.</P>
      <P>The current method of evaluating the effectiveness of treatment
of lung cancer patients is imaging, via simple X-rays or computed
tomography (CT), originally known as computed axial tomography (CAT),
which uses a large series of two-dimensional X-ray images taken
around a single axis of rotation to map "slices" digitally to create
a three-dimensional image of the internals organs.</P>
      <P>Both of these take time, often weeks, and depend heavily on the
experience of the physicians who have to read and interpret the
images.</P>
      <P>Usually, the evaluation of effectiveness of chemotherapy through
imaging takes one or two months, Pai said.</P>
      <P>However, Pai said, he and his colleagues have found several
genetic markers for lung cancer in a person's blood and have
developed a method to measure their numbers through analyzing
polymerase chain reactions. This test requires only one milliliter of
blood and two or three days.</P>
      <P>By comparing the number of genetic cancer markers before and
after treatment, Pai said, physicians can accurately evaluate the
progress of the treatment even after only two or three days, which
enables doctors to modify their course of action quicker in response
to the treatment.</P>
      <P>Although the method has the potential of being used as a way to
diagnose lung cancer, Pai said this could bring rise to confusion
since the presence of such genetic markers only indicate the
likelihood of cancer, not the actual presence of it.</P>
      <P>Pai said the technology has already been transferred to six
biomedical technology companies for commercial applications.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NON-DPP MEMBER SHOULD BE NEW PREMIER: FORMER DPP HEAD LIN I-HSIUNG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If President Chen Shui-bian wants to find a
new premier, he should look for someone outside the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) -- excluding the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), former DPP Chairman Lin I-hsiung suggested Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin, who served as party chairman between 1998 and 2000, made the
suggestion in an open letter to the president -- his second in four
days. If the president really wants the Cabinet reshuffled and a new
premier to give the party a fresh look after its unprecedented defeat
in the Dec. 3 local elections, Lin said the president can look for
candidates outside the party as long as they enjoy high esteem in
society.</P>
      <P>With the wisdom of the president, he will find an appropriate
person, Lin stressed. Lin explained that all capable men within the
DPP have served as premier before, and if the president continues to
choose among the DPP pool, it will not give the party a fresh look
and will not be helpful to its development.</P>
      <P>However, if the president chooses someone from the KMT, the KMT
might think it's a gambit to drive a wedge within its party, and DPP
members will also be unsatisfied.</P>
      <P>Lin reiterated that ranking officials should not run in the
by-election for chairman.</P>
      <P>He recalled that the public took President Chen to task when he
served concurrently as party chairman. The DPP charter stipulates
that the president should automatically serve as DPP chairman if the
president is of the same party.</P>
      <P>Chen stepped down as party chairman after the DPP's dismal
performance in the legislative elections in late 2004. For this
reason, he said that if Yu Shyi-kun, who quit the post of
secretary-general to the Presidential Office, does run as he has
announced, DPP members will conclude that this is another of the
president's attempts to try to pull the strings from behind the
scenes regarding party affairs.</P>
      <P>If the president endorses Yu's run it will deal another blow to
the party, which is already reeling after its humiliating defeat in
the Dec. 3 mayoral and magistrate elections, Lin said. The DPP
managed to win only six out of 23 seats up for grabs, while the KMT
captured 14 seats.</P>
      <P>Lin urged the president to "dissuade Yu from running by all
means."</P>
      <P>This was Lin's second open letter over the past few days. In the
first letter to DPP members last Friday, Lin said those who
have served as president, vice president, premier, or party chairman
should not run in the DPP chairman by-election, nor should they run
in the Taipei or Kaohsiung mayoral elections in 2006, or the 2008
presidential election.</P>

Taitung County magistrate, will become the shortest-serving
magistrate in Taiwan's history because he will be suspended
immediately after being sworn in Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu will be suspended because he was sentenced in a second court
trial to seven and a half years in prison for involvement in a
corruption scandal. The court in the first trial found him guilty and
ordered him to serve 13 years in jail.</P>
      <P>Ministry of the Interior officials said Monday that Wu will not
have the right to appoint a deputy once he has been suspended as
magistrate.</P>
      <P>Wu can only return to his post if and when a higher court acquits
him, they added. It's unclear when a higher court will hand down a
verdict.</P>
      <P>Deputy Interior Minister Chang Wen-ying said the ministry has
asked the Executive Yuan to appoint an acting magistrate for the
county.</P>
      <P>If Wu resigns, a new election must be held within three months to
pick a new magistrate; if by then Wu's verdict still has not been
handed down, he will be eligible to run.</P>
      <P>If he is found guilty in the third and final trial, he will lose
his right to run for any public office, according to the local
government law.</P>
      <P>The Taitung County Council was informed Sept. 28 by the Ministry
of the Interior that Wu would be suspended as magistrate if he ran

      <P>Yang Ju-men, also known as the "rice

protest of rice imports, described the just-concluded WTO talks as a
"success" for the United States and Europe, but "meaninglessness" for
Taiwan, particularly its farmers.</P>
      <P>Noting that "WTO meetings make no sense for Taiwan since the
Taiwan authorities don't give a damn about the interests of farmers

fair trade, not the myth of free trade."</P>
      <P>Yang Monday ended his six-day hunger strike at the Taipei
Detention Center. A group of his supporters visited him Monday
morning and briefed him on the progress in a "Save Taiwan's
Agriculture" campaign.</P>
      <P>Yang's supporters held the campaign in Taipei Dec. 16-17 and some
of them have just returned from the WTO protests in Hong Kong.</P>

with the plight of Taiwan's rice farmers. He said he had had only one
meal each day for six days all for experiencing the feeling of hunger
that many around the globe experience.</P>
      <P>Yang was convicted in his first trial on charges of threatening
public security for placing bombs at several public locations. He

    <HEADLINE>WTO DEAL BENEFICIAL TO TAIWAN: ROC ECONOMICS MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The agreement reached in the latest trade
ministers' meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Hong Kong
will benefit Taiwan industries, Minister of Economic Affairs Ho
Mei-yueh said Monday.</P>
      <P>Ho made the remarks at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport upon
returning from Hong Kong after the six-day meeting concluded a day
earlier.</P>
      <P>The deal agreed upon by negotiators from 149 WTO members to slash
government subsidies for farm exports will not affect Taiwan's
competitive edge, as local farmers are not subsidized by the
government, Ho said, pointed out that the domestic industrial sector
will not be much affected in the initial stage of market opening that
will be made in a gradual and flexible manner.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, negotiators also agreed on opening global
markets to each other for services trade, providing Taiwan companies
with greater market access to set up footholds in developed
countries, Ho said. This is a great offer for Taiwan manufacturers to
upgrade and undergo transformation, she added.</P>
      <P>Aside from these deals, developed countries also came to an
agreement to remove customs tariffs and quotas for least developed
countries, making it much easier for Taiwan enterprises to relocate
to those countries, she explained.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the just-concluded Hong Kong meeting has set
a firmer frame towards global market opening, injecting greater
momentum for Taiwan businesses in search of new horizons, she said.</P>
      <P>However, an academic suggested that the government take
precautions against Taiwan's agricultural market opening to the rest
of the world now that it will be unavoidable following the WTO's Hong
Kong meeting.</P>
      <P>Liu Ta-nien, a senior researcher at the WTO center under the
Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research, said that the government
should draft countermeasures as soon as possible to protect Taiwan
farmers' interests as member countries will begin discussing slashes
in tariff duties for foreign farm imports, in particular fruit and
rice, from next year.</P>
      <P>Liu prodded the government to overhaul its agricultural policy to
focus on value-added output in view of the new situation, and he
opined that agricultural issues should be included for discussions in
Taiwan's second national economic development conference.</P>
      <P>In addition, he urged the government to strengthen bilateral
cooperation with individual WTO member states to prevent from being
sidelined, but he asked the government to review the question of
whether Taiwan has readied itself for such an opening, which might be
much wider than the WTO requirements.</P>
      <P>Regardless of whether it is a bilateral mechanism or multilateral
mechanisms, Taiwan's agriculture has come to a critical point that
needs to be dealt with comprehensively and in detail, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DUCK FARMERS IN CHANGHUA COUNTRY SEEKING HUGE STATE COMPENSATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 20 duck farmers from Changhua
County filed a lawsuit with the Taipei Public Prosecutors' Office
Monday, seeking NT$2.6 billion in state compensation for their losses
caused by environmental pollution which, they claimed, happened
mainly because related government agencies neglected their duties.</P>
      <P>According to a report issued by the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) last week, a task force formed by government
officials and experts has established that pollutants from Taiwan
Steel Union Co. were responsible for the high dioxin level that
brought one of nine duck farms in the county to ruins. The task force
was not sure about the pollution source found at five other duck
farms.</P>
      <P>The duck farms each had from 3,000 to 10,000 ducks, which were
all destroyed together with all the eggs seized by government
authorities because they contained high levels of dioxin that would
be harmful to human health.</P>
      <P>The duck farmers complained that they have been deprived of their
livelihood, and that with the Council of Agriculture doling out a
monthly subsidy of NT$15,000 apiece, they cannot make a living.</P>
      <P>They also charged that the central and local government
authorities in charge of environmental protection affairs had
neglected their duties because they knew in July 2003 that Taiwan
Steel Union was discharging large amounts of dioxin but did not take
any corrective measures.</P>
      <P>The duck farmers said they want the government not only to
compensate their losses, but also to remove the polluted topsoil from
their farms, and provide necessary health care to residents in the
affected townships.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Chen Chao-jung, of the opposition People
First Party, urged the Industrial Development Bureau under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs not to allow Taiwan Steel Union to
resume production. He also wanted government authorities to make sure
that the company compensate the losses of its victims.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Steel Union has stopped its production under government
orders since mid-June, but is doing test runs and requesting
permission to resume production.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INVESTIGATION TASK FORCE TO BE FORMED OVER NAVY PURCHASE PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan's National Defense
Committee decided Monday to form a seven-member investigative task
force aimed at clarifying doubts on the ROC Navy's "Kuang-hua Six"
plan to purchase a fleet of fast-attack missile boats.</P>
      <P>The ROC Navy's program to build 30 fast-attack missile boats is
called " Kuang-hua Six." A prototype has already been built. Test
firings with surface-to-surface Hsiungfeng II missiles have been
accomplished. The members of the task force are to be chosen
according to each party's proportional representation in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>The legislature's defense committee suspects the procedure of the
tender held by the Ministry of National Defense (MND) was defective
and is vowing to shed light on it with this investigative task force.
A meeting will be held next Monday to determine their working agenda.</P>
      <P>The task force will have the right to have access to the official
documents related to the "Kuang-hua Six" procurement plan. If needed,
it will also have to interview persons involved. It will be led by a
convener who is also spokesman.</P>
      <P>It has been reported that this purchase plan might be delayed
because a private shipyard, Jong Shyn Shipbuilding based in the
southern city of Kaohsiung, contested the result of the tender won by
the state-run China Shipbuilding Corporation (CSBC).</P>
      <P>At first, Jong Shyn's plea was not accepted. But the company
further appealed to the Public Construction Commission under the
Executive Yuan, claiming that the decision to attribute this
ship-building contract to the CSBC was defective.</P>
      <P>Following the appeal, the MND assigned the case to the Bureau of
Investigation under the Ministry of Justice (MJIB) in October and
asked the CSBC to suspend the contract in November.</P>
      <P>Still then, the MND's procurement authorities evaluated the CSBC
as the best tender following discussions in mid-November.</P>
      <P>The platforms to be built under the "Kuang-hua Six" plan are
150-ton fast-attack missile boats that will carry four Hsiungfeng II
surface-to-surface missiles.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HOPES TO BUILD OFFICIAL EXCHANGE MECHANISM WITH MACAU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Civilian exchanges between Taiwan and Macau
have continued to grow since China took over control of Macau from
the Portuguese Dec. 20, 1999, but strenuous efforts have to be made
to promote bilateral official engagements, the Mainland Council
Affairs (MAC) said in a report released Monday.</P>
      <P>The MAC issued the report on Macau's current situation in the
fields of politics, economy, social development and its relations
with Taiwan to mark the sixth anniversary of the sovereignty handover
of the former Portuguese colony.</P>
      <P>The report said that the government of the special administrative
region of China has performed fairly well in ruling the land located
on China's southeast coast under the leadership of incumbent Chief
Executive Ho Hau Wah.</P>
      <P>However, fast expansion of the gambling sector is unbalancing the
economy of Macau, while public concerns over social order are
emerging after conflicts among casino operators were seen to be
increasing.</P>
      <P>The report said there have been close personnel exchanges between
Taiwan and Macau, with the number of Taiwanese travelers being the
third-largest of those of foreigners visiting the former Portuguese
colony.</P>
      <P>According to statistics of Taiwan's Bureau of Immigration, the
number of Taiwanese traveling to Macau from January to November this
year was over 1.08 million, posing a year-on-year growth of 18.7
percent.</P>
      <P>The number of Macau citizens traveling to Taiwan in the 11-month
period was registered at over 17,000, posing a year-on-year growth of
0.8 percent.</P>
      <P>The council hopes that the Macau government will take more
aggressive actions in the development of official exchanges with
Taiwan to push for reciprocal Taiwan-Macau relations by trying to
promote functions of institutionalized communication channels between
the two sides and open a representative office in Taiwan, MAC
officials said.</P>
      <P>The ROC government will continue efforts to boost exchanges and
cooperation with all sectors in Macau based on existing foundations,
they added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>APPEAL TO ALLOW RANKING CHINESE OFFICIAL TO VISIT TAIWAN REJECTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Bureau of Immigration on Monday let
stand its decision to reject an application for a high-ranking
Chinese official in charge of Taiwan affairs to come to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The National Policy Foundation, a think tank of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT), originally invited Chen Yunlin, director
of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, to visit Taiwan to attend an
economic and trade forum slated for Dec. 15.</P>
      <P>The forum would have been the first of its kind between the KMT
and the Communist Party of China (CPC) in more than 50 years after
the CPC defeated the KMT in a civil war in China that caused the KMT
to flee to Taiwan in 1949.</P>
      <P>However, the Bureau of Immigration rejected the foundation's
application for Chen Nov. 18, citing as reasons present cross-strait
relations, international practice as well as the desire to improve
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council said that given Chen's
political position, prior cross-strait consultations would be needed
before the trip would be allowed.</P>
      <P>The quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) contacted
its China counterpart to exchange views on the proposed trip, but all
requests for bilateral communication fell on deaf ears.</P>
      <P>The KMT-affiliated think tank then appealed the rejection and the
Bureau of Immigration convened another screening meeting Monday.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsueh-yen, deputy commissioner of the Bureau of Immigration,
said that more than 20 officials attending the screening meeting had
not raised different views and decided to let stand the original
decision.</P>
      <P>On learning that the request was rejected again, a KMT official
expressed regret.</P>
      <P>But Chang Jung-kung, director of the KMT's Department of Chinese
Affairs, said that the party still hopes to sponsor the forum in

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Welfare State Alliance, a major faction
within the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said Monday if
Legislator Trong Chai wins the upcoming by-election for DPP chairman
it would set an example for other factions and disband.</P>
      <P>Chiu Chui-chen, the faction's convener, said the Welfare State
Alliance has decided to support Chai's party chairmanship bid.</P>
      <P>As Chai, a key member of the Welfare State Alliance, has made "an
end to factional politics and infighting within the party" one of his
campaign appeals, Chiu said the Welfare State Alliance will take the
lead and dissolve if Chai is elected DPP chairman.</P>
      <P>DPP members are scheduled to vote Jan. 15 to elect a new chairman
to fill the position left vacant by the resignation of Su Tseng-chang
who assumed political responsibility for the party's defeat in the
Dec. 3 local government chiefs elections.</P>
      <P>Chai, who has already registered his candidacy, was quoted as
having said at a meeting of the Welfare State Alliance faction
earlier in the day that factional politics is very entrenched in the
DPP, and this has hindered the party's reforms and ability to
transform itself into a highly competitive political force.</P>
      <P>"Many foreign political parties also have factions within their
ranks, but their factions have never been as institutionalized as
those in the DPP. I have long been advocating disbanding intra-party
factions as the first step to our party's reinvention and
resurrection, " said Chai, a political science professor-turned

      <P>Some representatives urged the government to allow Chinese

To Bag China's Snack Market, Pepsi Takes Up
Potato Farming

After concluding a decade ago that Coca-Cola
Co. held an insurmountable lead in soft drinks
across much of the world, Pepsi embarked on a
risky gambit in China and other key markets --
one that relies increasingly on potatoes, not
just soda pop. Pepsi decided to build its global
presence by dominating snacks and other packaged
foods, much as its Frito-Lay and Quaker
businesses had helped battle Coke in the U.S.
But pulling that off outside North America was
far more complicated, ultimately forcing Pepsi
to become something it had never intended to be:
a farmer. Pepsi has potato farms in inner
Mongolia and Beihai on China's southern coast as
well as budding programs in Russia, Poland and
South Africa. The Pepsi farms illuminate an
intriguing new thread in the changing global

magistrate so that "all business will go on as usual," an official of

      <P>Cho Jung-tai, secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, made the
announcement after Ministry of the Interior officials said earlier in
the day that magistrate-elect Wu Chun-li will be immediately
suspended after being sworn in Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lai Shun-hsien, will take Wu's place until a new magistrate is
produced via a by-election, Cho said. Wu will be suspended because of
his involvement in a corruption scandal when he was deputy speaker of
the Taitung County Council. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison in
the first trial in 2002, and communized to seven years in the second
trial. Wu appealed and the Supreme Court overturned the verdict of
the second trial and return the case for a retrial.</P>
      <P>According to the law, Wu will be suspended immediately after
being sworn in, Cho said, Lai will take over as acting magistrate
because the operations of the Taitung County Government cannot be put

been suspended as magistrate, interior ministry officials said.</P>
      <P>Wu can only return to his post if and when a higher court acquits

suspension upon swearing in but they were caught off guard when they
learned that Wu couldn't appoint a deputy for the post.</P>
      <P>The aides said they had expected Wu to appoint his team before
receiving the suspension papers, and after his suspension, he would
seek to get his conviction overturned. If he was unable to do this,
he was going to resign at the most favorable time, and run again in a

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Legislator Lee Wen-chung came up with a three-point plan Monday to
address a long-stalled arms procurement project.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government agreed to sell Taiwan a robust arms package
in April 2001, including eight diesel-electric submarines, 12 P-3C
Orion anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft and six Patriot PAC-3
anti-missile batteries. The opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan,
however, has refused to screen relevant budget plans for the package
for the past few years.</P>
      <P>According to Lee's new three-point plan, the eight
diesel-electric submarines should be financed by a special budget as
originally planned to convince the United States to open a new
production line to build the submarines.</P>
      <P>Lee, a co-convener of the legislature's defense committee, also
suggested that the 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft be financed by the
Ministry of National Defense's regular budget and the legislature had
better pass an increase to the ministry's 2006 budget during its next
session scheduled to begin in February.</P>
      <P>As for the six Patriot anti-missile batteries, Lee said this can
be addressed after the three-year deadline expires in March 2007.</P>
      <P>Lee was referring to a clause in the Referendum Law that states
that is a question put to national referendum is turned down, it
cannot appear in another referendum until after three years.</P>
      <P>Lee urged the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang
and the People first Party to make a unified response to his new
proposal as soon as possible because the United States may change its
mind and decline to sell Taiwan the arms if Taiwan continues to drag
its feet.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The time is not yet ripe for unification
of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan's main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou has said in an interview with
Newsweek magazine.</P>
      <P>Ma, who doubles as Taipei mayor, said while Beijing does not
want to see Taiwan pursue de jure independence, it also refrains from
pushing for unification at the moment.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan, Ma said, the most important thing at present is to
maintain the status quo and refrain from provoking Beijing. Taiwan
should instead promote cross-strait trade and investment and take
steps to ease cross-strait tension, he added.</P>
      <P>In the interview with Newsweek correspondent Jonathan
Adams, Ma said for the KMT, unification is its ultimate goal. But
it doesn't have a timetable for realizing that goal. He said he
doesn't think either side is ready for unification. The situation

    <HEADLINE>CABINET APPOINTS OFFICIAL TO TAKE OVER 'IN AND OUT' MAGISTRATE(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has appointed the
secretary-general of Taitung County Government as the acting
magistrate so that "all business will go on as usual," an official of
the Executive Yuan said Monday.</P>
      <P>Cho Jung-tai, secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, made the
announcement after Ministry of the Interior officials said earlier in
the day that magistrate-elect Wu Chun-li will be immediately
suspended after being sworn in Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lai Shun-hsien, will take Wu's place until a new magistrate is
produced via a by-election, Cho said. Wu will be suspended because of
his involvement in a corruption scandal when he was deputy speaker of
the Taitung County Council. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison in
the first trial in 2002, and communized to seven years in the second
trial. Wu appealed and the Supreme Court overturned the verdict of
the second trial and return the case for a retrial.</P>
      <P>According to the law, Wu will be suspended immediately after
being sworn in, Cho said, Lai will take over as acting magistrate
because the operations of the Taitung County Government cannot be put
on hold. Wu will not have the right to appoint a deputy once he has
been suspended as magistrate, interior ministry officials said.</P>
      <P>Wu can only return to his post if and when a higher court acquits
him, they added. It's unclear when a higher court will hand down a
verdict.</P>
      <P>Wu's aides said Monday that they have been anticipating Wu's
suspension upon swearing in but they were caught off guard when they
learned that Wu couldn't appoint a deputy for the post.</P>
      <P>The aides said they had expected Wu to appoint his team before
receiving the suspension papers, and after his suspension, he would
seek to get his conviction overturned. If he was unable to do this,
he was going to resign at the most favorable time, and run again in a
new election.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>It could be a breakthrough in relations
between the administration and the legislature if Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng were to head the Cabinet, the legislative party
whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP has long sought a breakthrough in
interactions between the administration and the opposition-controlled
legislature, Chao Yung-ching said that appointing Wang, an opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) stalwart, as premier would possibly mark a turning
point in deadlocked relations between the two branches of government.</P>
      <P>Chao said that a Wang-led Cabinet would result in much better
interactions between the administration and the legislature.</P>
      <P>As premier, Wang would definitely have power in policy-making and
appointing personnel, Chao said, adding that the KMT-led opposition
"pan-blue alliance" should not disregard the DPP's sincerity in this
regard.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus head made the remarks amid speculation
that President Chen Shui-bian might invite an opposition politician
to be the next premier following the DPP's defeat in the Dec. 3

    <DATELINE>Panama City,  Dec.  19 (CNA)
(By Ramon Huang &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>At least 51 Taiwan businesses will
take part in the 24th EXPOCOMER international commercial exhibition
to be held March 8-12 in Panama City.</P>
      <P>It will mark the 23th year in a row that Taiwan businesses
display their latest products at the fair, officials from the ROC
Embassy in Panama said Monday.</P>
      <P>ROC Ambassador Hou Ping-fu and August Simons, head of the Chamber
of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture of Panama, signed a contract
Dec. 15 on leasing space at the fair for Taiwan businesses.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between Taiwan and Panama has rapidly expanded
since the free trade pact between the two countries came into effect
Jan. 1, 2004.</P>
      <P>For 2004, trade between Taiwan and Panama, excluding the Colon
free trade zone, reached US$32.7 million, representing an increase of
25.28 percent over the 2003 level.</P>
      <P>Panamanian exports to Taiwan totalled US$11.06 million in 2004,
posting a record-high year-on-year growth of 67.15 percent, while
Taiwan exports to the Central American nation hit US$21.63 billion,
up 11.05 percent, according to the ROC Embassy.</P>
      <P>For the first nine months of this year, two-way trade amounted to
US$33.79 million, with Panamanian exports to Taiwan hitting US$14.82
million, up a whopping 112.96 percent over the figure for the same
period a year earlier. Meanwhile, Taiwan exports to Panama reached
US$18.96 million, up 14.49 percent year on year.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Panama's trade deficit with Taiwan dropped from
US$10.57 million in 2003 to just US$4.14 million last year, Hsu
Ta-wei, an ROC embassy official in charge of economic affairs, said
the free trade accord has done well in eliminating the trade
imbalances between the two countries.</P>
      <P>At the EXPOCOMER 2005 held March 2-6, Taiwan businesses received
contracts totalling some US$4.65 million, with US$8.25 million-worth
of follow-up orders, according to the embassy.</P>
      <P>At next year's exhibition, Taiwan businesses will mainly show off
their high-quality products, including computers and peripheral
equipment for computers, communications equipment, electronic
products, parts and components for automobiles and motorcycles,
bicycles, electric home appliances, sports gear, medical equipment,
and processing machines.</P>
      <P>Over 500 businesses from 30 nations attended the 2005 Panamanian
trade fair, which hosted more than 300,000 visitors. Business deals

    <HEADLINE>IMMIGRATION LAW SHOULD BE REVISED TO STOP HUMAN TRAFFICKING: LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The immigration law should be revised to
strengthen Taiwan's ability to deter the smuggling of people into the
country and help stamp out human trafficking, ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Hsiao Bi-khim said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a public hearing on Taiwan's immigration law and
possible revisions, Hsiao said that although working to eliminate
human trafficking is now a worldwide trend and that a recent U.S.
State Department report on the problem assessed that Taiwan "does not
fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of
trafficking, " the Executive Yuan-proposed draft amendment to the law
does not deal with the issue of trafficking.</P>
      <P>Hsiao joined DPP Legislator Chen Chung-hsin and opposition
Kuomintang Legislator Wang Yu-ting in calling for the Executive Yuan
to pay closer attention to the issue.</P>
      <P>According to Su Ching-chao, a deputy director from the Ministry
of the Interior's Population Administration Department, the Executive
Yuan's draft amendment mainly deals with three issues: namely how to
attract foreign professionals to Taiwan to help boost the country's
economic and trade development; strengthening the system of
interviews and related checks for screening foreigners applying to
reside in Taiwan; and simplifying administrative procedures and paper
work to protect human rights and make entering and exiting the
country more convenient.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said it is pitiful that there is not a single word in the
draft amendment on eliminating human trafficking. She reminded the
Executive Yuan to heed the matter since the U.S. State Department
report released this past summer indicated that "Taiwan lacks a
comprehensive trafficking law."</P>
      <P>The report indicated that Taiwan is primarily a destination for
trafficked women and girls, mainly from the China, who are smuggled
into the country for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Some
trafficking victims from China, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam are
forced or coerced into the commercial sex trade or lured to Taiwan by
bogus offers of employment or marriage.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan laws criminalize most forms of trafficking but do not
address prevention of trafficking or victim protection, which the
authorities nonetheless provide on an ad hoc basis," the report said.</P>
      <P>It further said that "Taiwan authorities do not fully comply with
the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however,
they are making significant efforts to do so. Taiwan authorities have
increased efforts to provide protection for trafficking victims.
Despite prosecutions of traffickers, there is insufficient protection
for trafficking victims, particularly for women and girls from the
PRC (People's Republic of China)."</P>
      <P>"Foreign victims of trafficking who are not of PRC origin are
provided with shelter and counseling and are generally quickly
repatriated. But current Taiwan law provides no legal alternative to
the return to the PRC of all unlawfully present PRC citizens,
including trafficking victims," it said.</P>
      <P>On this concern, Ho Sen-kuei, a director with the Bureau of
Immigration, suggested that the immigration law be revised to include
people from the mainland China area to entitle them to protection for
trafficking victims.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu Mei-hung, an official with the Mainland Affairs
Council, maintained that the issue of trafficking should be tackled
from the angles of prevention, investigation and apprehension, as
well as protection.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE RATIFIES TAIWAN-GUATEMALA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan on Tuesday ratified
the ROC-Guatemala free trade agreement (FTA) , which will now take
effect Jan. 1, 2006 as scheduled.</P>
      <P>The agreement was signed by President Chen Shui-bian and his
Guatemalan counterpart Oscar Berger Perdomo Sept. 22 during Chen's
state visit to the Central American country. Chen had expressed the
hope that the FTA would come into effect on the first day of 2006 in
line with the implementation of the Central American Free Trade
Agreement (CAFTA).</P>
      <P>The CAFTA covers the United States, central American nations and
the Dominican Republic.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has assessed that the
Taiwan-Guatemala FTA will have only a limited impact on Taiwan's
agricultural sector because despite the fact the island will open its
doors wide to agricultural imports from the country, there will be
strict screening and quarantine measures in place.</P>
      <P>While signing the pact, Chen said that the FTA will help redress
the trade imbalance between Taiwan and Guatemala, which is currently
heavily in Taiwan's favor. He further said that Guatemala can use
Taiwan as a gateway to explore the wider Asian market while Taiwan
can use Guatemala as a springboard into the North American market.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Chen Ruey-long affirmed the pact in
November of last year while filing a report on it at the Legislative
Yuan, saying that the FTA between Taiwan and Guatemala is expected to
boost Taiwan's annual exports by an estimated 5.5 percent to 6
percent.</P>
      <P>In 2004, Taiwan exported US$110 million worth of goods to
Guatemala while importing US$4.1 million worth of Guatemalan
products, according to official statistics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'PAN-GREEN' LAWMAKERS FORCE ARMS BILL ONTO LEGISLATIVE AGENDA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"Pan-green" camp legislators pulled a fast
one on their opposition "pan-blue alliance" colleagues at the
Legislative Yuan's Procedures Committee Tuesday by calling for a snap
vote on the long-stalled arms purchase bill when some opposition
legislators were away at another meeting.</P>
      <P>At around noon time, when only five "pan-blue alliance" lawmakers
were present at the meeting, one of the 12 lawmakers of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU),
which form the "pan-green" camp, proposed a vote whether to put on
the legislative agenda the arms bill and the review of the
president's nominations for Control Yuan members.</P>
      <P>Committee chairman William C.T. Lai of the DPP ruled that a vote
be held immediately to decide on DPP Legislator Hsu Kuo-yung's
proposal. By 12: 30 p.m., the committee had voted 12-5 to put the two
matters on the legislature's meeting agenda, leaving the five
"pan-blue alliance" legislators in a daze.</P>
      <P>This was the ruling camp's 42nd attempt to put the NT$480 billion
arms purchase budget bill on the legislative agenda. That amount had
been cut down from NT$610.8 billion. The funds are for the purchase
of eight conventional submarines, 12 anti-submarine aircraft and six
anti-missile batteries from the United States.</P>
      <P>Huang Yi-chiao, convener of the People First Party's legislative
caucus, said Lai did not follow precedent by allowing all members to
speak and called a surprise vote when other "pan-blue alliance"
members were attending a legislative negotiation session chaired by
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng. "This was a very childish
move," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the Kuomintang's (KMT)
Central Policy Committee and party whip at the legislature, said
Lai's snap vote "meant nothing" except to create legislative turmoil
because it did not follow proper and legal procedures and is
therefore "invalid and illegal."</P>
      <P>Tseng said lawmakers of the "pan-blue alliance" of KMT and PFP,
who hold a slim majority, will simply return the two items to the
Procedures Committee in Friday's legislative meeting.</P>
      <P>He criticized Lai for having acted "in a stupid way" by inciting
a ruling-opposition division because the legislature was dealing with
the government's overall budget bill, a time that he said calls for
harmony, not stand-offs.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wu Chun-li, the magistrate-elect of Taitung
county in eastern Taiwan, named his ex-wife Kuang Li-chen as his
deputy magistrate immediately after he was sworn in in a
controversial move called invalid by an official administering the
swearing-in ceremony.</P>
      <P>Knowing that he would be suspended from his post immediately
after assuming office Tuesday because of his involvement in a
corruption case, Wu divorced his wife Monday in order to sidestep the
restriction against a magistrate selecting a relative or spouse as
deputy.</P>
      <P>Wu asserted the appointment of Kuang before Minister of Council
of Indigenous Peoples Walis Pelin, who administered his swearing in,
could stop him.</P>
      <P>However, Pelin said immediately that Wu's suspension was
effective immediately upon his being sworn in to office and that he
therefore did not have the right to name any deputies.</P>
      <P>Pelin refused Wu's request to have the county's seal handed over
to him as a symbol of the transfer of power, saying the Executive
Yuan has named the county's chief staff Lai Shun-hsien as the acting
magistrate.</P>
      <P>The swearing-in ceremony, which took place at the auditorium of
the county hall, was packed with Wu's supporters who gave him and his
ex-wife a big round of applause when they entered the hall. They also
applauded when Wu claimed that he was the magistrate before receiving
the interior ministry's notice of his suspension.</P>
      <P>Wu, who served as the speaker of the county council before
entering into the race for the magistracy, was sentenced in 2003 by
the Taiwan High Court to a prison sentence of seven years and eight
months for his role in a corruption case in 2000. He has appealed the
sentence to the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior had warned during Wu's campaign for
magistracy that he would not be allowed to serve as magistrate even
he were to win the election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MA, SOONG TO MEET AGAIN TO DISCUSS POLITICAL SITUATION IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The leaders of Taiwan's two main opposition
parties -- the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) --
have agreed to meet again Friday to discuss how to cope with the
changing political situation in Taiwan after the Dec. 3 local
government elections.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the KMT said the meeting will take place at the
Taipei Youth Activity Center, and that KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and
PFP Chairman James Soong will meet behind closed doors in the
presence of only the secretaries-general of the two parties.</P>
      <P>In their previous meeting on Dec. 12 that lasted four hours, Ma
and Soong pledged that the "pan-blue alliance" formed by their
parties will step up cooperation in the run-up to an eventual merger
and push for an early realization of the opening of the direct "three
links" -- trade, postal and transportation links across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>The second Ma-Soong meeting in 10 days became necessary after
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng confirmed Monday that
President Chen Shui-bian had consulted with him about the possibility
of letting someone from the "pan-blue alliance" serve as the next
premier and form his Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Chen's gesture has been seen as an attempt to alleviate the
growing pressure within the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
after the party suffered a humiliating defeat in the Dec. 3
elections. Some analysts believe Chen's plan might be aimed at
alienating the KMT if he does not intend to relinquish the power to
form the Cabinet to the KMT.</P>
      <P>Ma made clear the KMT position Monday that the matter should be
settled through party-to-party negotiations, and that the president
must let the "pan-blue alliance" designate the premier and appoint
all Cabinet members. However, he said the KMT must consult with the
PFP and another ally -- the New Party -- and form a consensus on the
issue before the "pan-blue alliance" makes the next move.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Soong confirmed on the outlying island of Matsu that
after meeting with Ma Thursday, he will meet with Wang to discuss the
president's overture to let the main opposition parties form the
Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Soong said he believes that it would be "barking up the wrong
tree" to ask the DPP government to let the opposition parties appoint
the premier and all the Cabinet members.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Changhua Magistrate Weng Chin-chu
signed up Tuesday for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
chairmanship by-election slated for Jan. 15, just before registration
for the race closed.</P>
      <P>Weng also announced her decision to withdraw from the DPP's New
Tide faction, stressing that running for chairman or whoever wins
should not be swayed by factional influences.</P>
      <P>Weng's registration came one day after former DPP Chairman Lin
I-hsiung had paid a visit to her, reportedly to persuade her to run.</P>
      <P>However, Weng would not confirm if her decision to join the race
was the result of Lin's persuasion. Weng said she knows very well
that grassroots DPP members and the public have high expectations for
the DPP and she pledged that if she is elected, she will work hard to
try to win back public support for the party.</P>
      <P>Also, Weng said she will stick to the values of democracy,
freedom and dignity that the DPP has been following.</P>
      <P>Weng's participation increased the number of registrants to
three. The other two are former Presidential Office Secretary-General
Yu Shyi-kun and DPP Legislator Trong Chai.</P>
      <P>The DPP's Central Standing Committee will review the
qualifications of the registrants on Wednesday and hold a draw on
Dec. 22 to decide the numerical designations of the candidates. The
new chairman is expected to take office after the Chinese Lunar New
Year holiday in February.</P>
      <P>Over the past days, Lin reportedly has actively persuaded several
DPP politicians, including Weng, DPP Legislator Hung Chi-chang and
former Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan to enter the race.</P>
      <P>Both Hung and Chen said they had no intention of running.</P>
      <P>Hoping for a new generation of leaders, Lin has openly expressed
his expectations for the next chairman.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the current president and vice president, as
well as past premiers or party chairmen should not serve as the next
DPP chairman. Lin also said that the next chairman should not run in
the 2006 Taipei or Kaohsiung mayoral election or the 2008
presidential election because he or she must concentrate on party and
election campaign affairs.</P>
      <P>The remarks were believed to be aimed at Yu, a former premier.
Vice President Annette Lu has acted as DPP chairwoman after Su
Tseng-chang stepped down early this month to take political
responsibility for the party's drubbing in the Dec. 3 "three-in-one"
elections.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most local economic think tanks are
optimistic about Taiwan's economic growth for 2006, believing it
could top 4 percent with the expectation of international oil prices
leveling and growth of world trade likely to accelerate next year.</P>
      <P>Noted economic think tanks, including Academia Sinica, the
Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research and the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) , have forecast
that Taiwan's economic growth will top out between 4.01 percent and
4.5 percent, with the CEPD being the most optimistic about 2006
growth.</P>
      <P>CEPD Vice Chairman Yeh Ming-feng said that Taiwan's economic
growth in the first half of 2005 was lessened as a result of
skyrocketing oil prices and high interest rates. Luckily, Yeh said,
growth has rebounded from the third quarter and a better picture is
expected to continue throughout the year.</P>
      <P>Worldwide, Yeh said, 2006 economic growth is seen to top 7
percent -- better than this year's growth, which is predicted to be
around 6.4 percent -- under the anticipation that oil prices will
stop spiraling next year.</P>
      <P>Domestically, Yeh quoted a CEPD forecast as predicting that
Taiwan's economic growth will be 4.5 percent in 2006 as a result of a
series of economy-revving measures, including more public
construction projects to be launched islandwide.</P>
      <P>Liang Kuo-yuan, director of the Palaris Research Institute,
predicted that private consumption will be one of the prime movers
behind Taiwan's economic growth next year, which is expected to top

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Household registration offices around the
country will begin issuing the new version of identification
cards to local citizens Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh, Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyuan, and
Sun Yueh, a popular actor-turned-volunteer in the promotion of social
welfare, will jointly host a news conference at the household
registration office of the Da-an district of Taipei to inaugurate the
issuance, according to the Ministry of the Interior (MOI).</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, not only those who are up for ID card renewal that
day can have their new cards, but also people who register their
marriage, change their household address, or change their registered
name that day are able to receive new ID cards.</P>
      <P>The last time ID cards were renewed was in 1986.
Customarily, ID cards were renewed every 10 years, and the
MOI had intended to renew the cards in 1996, but it was forced to
postpone the procedure until this year due to some technique problems
and a controversial governmental policy concerning
fingerprinting.</P>
      <P>The fingerprinting policy led some lawmakers to request a
constitutional interpretation by the Council of Grand Justices, which
ruled on Sept. 28 that the fingerprinting policy was
unconstitutional, promoting the MOI to drop it.</P>
      <P>MOI official of population administration, Hsiao Chen-chia, said
Tuesday that a color photo taken within the last year, the old ID
card and the applicant's chop are needed to get a new card, noting
that the applicant is allowed to designate a proxy to apply, but has
to pick up the new ID card in person around two weeks after
submitting the application.</P>
      <P>The public should renew their ID cards according to the time and
venue printed in notices mailed to them by local household
registration offices to shorten their waiting time, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>Over 19 million new ID cards will be issued until Dec. 31
2006, according to the MOI.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ID CARDS SHOULD HAVE OPTION FOR ANCESTRAL NAMES: INDIGENOUS GROUP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20 (CNA)
(By Taijing )</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New ROC ID cards should mean having the
option to use one's ancestral name, according to an indigenous group
that asked the government Tuesday to make this procedure easier.</P>
      <P>A 1994 amendment to the law regarding how names should be
displayed on ID cards states that Taiwan's indigenous people can
register their ancestral names using their indigenous mother tongue.
However, as of September of this year, only 890 people had chosen to
use their aboriginal name on their ID cards. Sixty-five of these have
already come forward publicly to say that they regret having made the
change.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to reclaim their ancestral culture, the indigenous
group that calls itself the Vine Cultural Association has called on
more than 50 of its members to change their Chinese names on their ID
cards into their mother tongue at a household registration office
Wednesday, the day that the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) will begin
to issue the new version of IDs.</P>
      <P>"We hoped to convince at least 100 of our members to correct
their names, but only a bit more than 50 were willing to do this, "
said Mayaw Biho, the head of the association.</P>
      <P>Mayaw said he hopes the procedure to change a person's name on
their ID card can be simplified.</P>
      <P>"For starters, the application time for this ought to be shorten
to one day," he said.</P>
      <P>The time the household registration office currently needs to
change anyone's name takes at least three days to run a check to see
if the person in question has a criminal record.</P>
      <P>Mayaw explained that a name rectification by an aborigine would
be to " correct" their name instead of changing it; therefore, the
time spent on investigation into the background of the applicant
could be saved, assuming that officials would see the difference
between "correcting" a name and changing one.</P>
      <P>"Of course the new version of the ID card should have our
traditional name on it, and the household certificate transcript
modification fee should be waived," Mayaw said.</P>
      <P>"The household registration office should be in charge of
correcting our names on all other official papers such as driver's
licenses, health insurance cards, passports and so on. We'd also like
to see the Romanization of our mother tongue name under the Chinese
characters on our ID cards," Mayaw added.</P>
      <P>Mayaw said that it's a difficult decision for indigenous people
to actually change the name shown on their ID cards as society
basically frowns on the practice, not to mention the fact that many
feel that they will be discriminated against by those who do not
understand the meaning of using an ancestral name.</P>
      <P>Mayaw gave an example. "An indigenous teacher in eastern Taiwan
got very frustrated when a student's parent told the school principal
that he didn't want his child to be taught by an aborigine," he said.</P>
      <P>Lipay Sinsi, a woman in her 50s, said that it took her about four
years to cut through all the red tape to finally get her ancestral
name on all her official documentation.</P>
      <P>"If I had tried to do it all at the same time, it would have been
impossible. So I first corrected my ID card, then the other cards
were corrected when they expired," Lipay said.</P>
      <P>Ado Kaliting Pacidal, a TV commentator, said that she uses her
mother tongue name on her TV programs, but hasn't yet corrected her
name on official documents.</P>
      <P>"I am going to apply for the new version of the ID card tomorrow.
When I was a little girl, I had to be familiar with two names. One
used in my family when speaking my mother tongue, especially when my
grandparents wanted to tell me intimate things, and the other Chinese
one, which was only used at school and on administration forms," Ado
said.</P>
      <P>Panay Arik, a young woman student in her early 20s, said that she
only learned the meaning of the word "Panay" at school when she was
19 years old.</P>
      <P>"Panay means 'a stalk of rice.' I did not like the name until I
learned its meaning. My parents expected me to be humble when they
gave me this name because the more rice on a stalk, the more it
bends," Panay said.</P>
      <P>A series of TV commercials will be broadcast at the beginning of
January next year to encourage more indigenous people to correct
their names.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HAIR MERCURY LEVELS HIGH AMONG TAIWAN MEAT, FISH EATERS: EPA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The hair mercury levels among Taiwan people
average 2.4 mg/kg, slightly higher than that of Americans and
Japanese, according to the results of a survey released Tuesday by
the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA).</P>
      <P>While the hair mercury levels of people who eat large -- and
therefore older -- fishes frequently are six times higher than those
who do not eat fish, those of meat-eaters are eight times higher than
vegetarians, the survey shows.</P>
      <P>However, Wang Cheng-hsiung, deputy head of EPA's Bureau of
Environmental Inspection, said the hair mercury levels of Taiwanese
are still much lower than the maximum toxicity level of 50 mg/kg
stated by the World Health Organization. He urged the public not to
panic, although he said it would be best if they could avoid eating
large, deep-sea fishes to reduce their mercury intake.</P>
      <P>Nearly all fish contain some amount of mercury. Mercury
accumulates in the body, so larger, older fish such as shark or
swordfish contain the highest amounts and pose the largest threat if
eaten regularly.</P>
      <P>When you eat fish you absorb over 95 percent of the mercury that
they contain.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted on 1,066 people, with the hair mercury
levels of men and women averaging 2.92 mg/kg and 1.84 mg/kg,
respectively. The figures compared with the 2.5 mg/kg among Japanese
men and 1.6 mg/kg among Japanese women and are also higher than the
U.S. reference level of 1 mg/kg.</P>
      <P>The hair mercury levels found in the samples ranged from 0.12
mg/kg to 18.9 mg/kg. Older people have a higher level than those who
are younger, with the levels of those 60 and above being 1.5-times
higher than that of people 20 and below.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that the mercury levels of the sampled people
are related to their dietary habits. The hair mercury levels among
meat-eaters average 2.54 mg/kg, compared with 0.32 mg/kg among
vegetarians. People who eat a lot of large fishes, such as tuna,
swordfish, shark and salmon, have an average hair mercury level of
3.68 mg/kg, compared with 0.55 mg/kg among people who do not eat
fish.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hualien County residents registered the highest
mercury level at 3.09 mg/kg, while Taichung City residents register
the lowest at 1.83 mg/kg. By occupation, the mercury levels of
dentists, who have regular contact with mercury-containing amalgam,
are 1.6-times higher than others.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, mercury is a long-lasting, accumulating
contaminant, and a content of more than 50 mg/kg in human bodies can
damage the nervous system. Pregnant women who eat seafood of high
mercury content can cause brain defects in the fetuses, he noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC ASSISTING DETAINED TAIWAN STUDENT IN HONG KONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's representative office in Hong Kong
has organized a three-member attorney group to assist a National
Taiwan University (NTU) student who has been detained and charged
with unlawful assembly in the former British colony, the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Earlier the same day, the council said, Pao Cheng-kang, Taiwan's
top representative in Hong Kong, paid a visit to Lee Chien-cheng, a
22-year-old student at the NTU's political science department who has
been in police custody since last weekend for his part in anti-free
trade demonstrations during a World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting.</P>
      <P>Tsai Jy-jon, director of the MAC's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs
Department, said the MAC and Taiwan's representative office have been
working in concert to offer Lee all necessary assistance.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, 12 Taiwan citizens along with more than 1,000
other anti-WTO protesters from neighboring Asian countries were
arrested by Hong Kong police last Saturday for going on a violent
rampage outside a WTO convention hall. Except for Lee, all other
Taiwan citizens have been released.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong police charged 14 men, including Lee, with unlawful
assembly Monday for their role in the anti-WTO demonstrations last
weekend and released another 944 people who were detained. Among
those being charged were 11 South Koreans, one Japanese, one Chinese
and one Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>Tsai said Taiwan's representative office in Hong Kong has asked
for Lee's release on bail. The Hong Kong court rejected the request
on the grounds that Lee has neither any relatives nor a residency
permit in Hong Kong, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>A Hong Kong court is scheduled to review the case Dec. 23, Tsai
said. It remains unclear why Hong Kong police have charge only the 14
men, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>A group of NTU students visited the MAC to push for its
assistance for their classmate. Tsai assured them that the MAC and the
representative office in Hong Kong will do their best to ensure Lee's
safety and early release.</P>
      <P>If convicted, Lee may face a fine of HK$5,000 (NT$21,500) plus
three years in prison, according to the Hong Kong public security
statute.</P>
      <P>Most of the 1,000-plus people rounded up during the protests, in
which activists attacked riot police and sought to disrupt the WTO
ministers meeting, were militant South Korean farmers and unionists.
Police repelled the demonstrators with batons, pepper spray, water
cannons and tear gas. It was the worst street violence in decades in
Hong KOng. More than 100 police and protesters were injured.</P>

Transit Union Walkout Follows Collapse of 
Contract Talks 

Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union,
which represents 33,700 subway and bus workers
in New York, announced its first strike in 25
years this morning after feverish last-minute
negotiations faltered over the transportation
authority's demands for concessions on pension
and health benefits for future employees. New
York State's Taylor Law bars strikes by public
employees and carries penalties of two days' pay
for each day on strike, but the transit union
decided it was worth risking the substantial
fines to continue the fight for what it regards
as an acceptable contract.

Five Who Laid the Groundwork For Historic Spike 
in Oil Market

The oil shocks of the 1970s and 1980s happened 
for a simple reason: huge and sudden cuts in 
supply. After supply was restored, oil prices 
eased. Today's energy crunch -- which has seen
oil prices double since 2003 -- is different.
Once again, supply shocks have played a role,
including those triggered by hurricanes in the
oil-rich Gulf of Mexico and the U.S. invasion of
Iraq. But the real cause is a profound shift in 
the global energy system that has been 25 years 
in the making: The world's thirst for oil has 
grown faster than the industry's ability to slake
it. Decisions of five persons have vital impact
on oil price. They include the OPEC Czar, gas
guzzler, prophet, Washington warrior, and oil

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
said Tuesday that during his meeting with James Soong on Dec. 24, he
will urge the chairman of the opposition People First Party (PFP) to
stop holding onto past grudges, but instead look forward and work for
the highest interests of the nation by responding to the people's
expectations.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from news media at the legislature, Wang said
that he will brief Soong at the meeting about what was discussed
between President Chen Shui-bian and himself during their latest
consultation.</P>
      <P>He said the issues the president discussed with him included the
deadlock in the legislature over the two bills about military
procurement from the United States; the legislature's reluctance to
endorse the nominees named by the president as members of the Control
Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog body; cross-Taiwan Strait
relations; and the possibility of letting the main opposition parties
form a new Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Wang did not say what past grudges he will ask Soong to leave
behind, but it is widely known that Soong and the president are not
on speaking terms because the president has ignored Soong's demand
for an apology from the president for making a false claim to the
nation that Soong had a secret meeting with Chen Yunlin, director of
the Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council, in the United
States early this year.</P>
      <P>Soong filed a lawsuit in June against the president, asking for a
symbolic compensation of NT$1 for defamation of his reputation.
However, in October after the president continued to say that his
claim was not without a reason, Soong filed a second suit, increasing
the damages he sought to NT$50 million.</P>
      <P>While visiting the outlying island of Matzu Tuesday, Soong told
news media that he would not be interested in having another meeting

    <HEADLINE>U.S. CONCERNED ABOUT ARMS PROCUREMENT BILL: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington is concerned about progress in a
major arms procurement bill stalled in Taiwan's legislature that
would allow billions of dollars in arms purchases from the United
States, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chin Jih-hsin, director-general of MOFA's North American Affairs
Department, made the comments to reporters after the bill was finally
included on the agenda at the Legislative Yuan by its Rules Committee
earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>Noting that cross-Taiwan Strait security has always been one of
the major concerns of the United States in its relations with Taiwan,
Chin said that Washington has repeatedly urged Taiwan to beef up its
defense capability to deter China from attacking Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But the U.S. side fully respects Taiwan's dealings of its
internal affairs, such as when the legislature will approve the
procurement package, the purchase items and their value of the major
arms procurement package, he noted.</P>
      <P>Twelve lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
and its ally the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) railroaded the major
weapons purchase bill through a Rules Committee meeting earlier that
day, in which only five lawmakers of the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP)
were present.</P>
      <P>KMT and PFP legislators accused the bill passage process of being
flawed and vowed to kill the bill in Friday's legislative session and
return it to the committee.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, PFP Chairman James Soong said that it will be harder
for the "pan-blue alliance" to maintain its "fragile majority" at the
Legislative Yuan in the future as a result of the KMT's faulty
election strategy. Four KMT lawmakers have to give up their
legislative seats after being elected as local government chiefs in
the Dec. 3. elections.</P>
      <P>The major arms procurement bill put forth by the Ministry of
National Defense (MND) has been blocked at the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan since the middle of 2004.</P>
      <P>The bill originally called for procuring eight diesel-powered
submarines, six PAC III Patriot anti-missile batteries and 12
anti-submarine airplanes from the United States through a special
budget of NT$610.08 billion</P>
      <P>The MND later slashed its budget proposal and agreed to finance
the purchase of the anti-missile batteries in its annual regular
budget to seek legislative support for the bill. But the "pan-blue
alliance" still declined to screen it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SNAP VOTE ON ARMS BILL NOT AIMED AT PROVOKING PARTISAN STRIFE: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The railroading of two long-stalled bills
through the Legislative Yuan's Rules Committee was aimed at
spotlighting the opposition "pan-blue alliance's" absurdity and
irrationality, not to provoke an interparty stand-off, a ruling party
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Ker Chien-ming, who concurrently serves as the head of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) policy coordination
department, was referring to a snap vote engineered by the DPP and
its "pan-green" ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity Union -- in the
legislature's Rules Committee earlier in the day to put two
controversial bills onto the legislative agenda.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and
the People First Party (PFP) , which controls a slim majority in the
legislature, has blocked the two bills -- a robust arms procurement
package and the review of the president's nominations for Control
Yuan members -- from being put on the legislative agenda for more
than a year.</P>
      <P>At around noon, when only five "pan-blue alliance" lawmakers were
present at the Rules Committee meeting, one of the 12 "pan-green"
lawmakers proposed a vote whether to put the two bills on the agenda
for discussion at the legislature's plenary session this Friday.</P>
      <P>Committee convener William Lai of the DPP ruled that a vote be
held immediately. By 12: 30 p.m., the committee had voted 12-5 to put
the two bills on the legislature's agenda, leaving the five "pan-blue
alliance" legislators stultified.</P>
      <P>This was the DPP's 42nd attempt to put the NT$480 billion arms
purchase budget bill on the legislative agenda. That amount had been
cut from NT$610.8 billion. The funds are for the purchase of eight
conventional submarines, 12 anti-submarine aircraft and six
anti-missile batteries from the United States.</P>
      <P>Dismissing the DPP's move as childish, "pan-blue alliance"
lawmakers have vowed to kill the two bills at Friday's plenary
session. They said the DPP's surprise blitz would only worsen the
hostility between the ruling and opposition camps.</P>
      <P>In response, Ker said the "pan-blue alliance's" stonewalling of
the two bills from being rationally screened and debated on the
legislative floor is absurd and unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>"Our move is only aimed at letting the public understand the
severity of the matter," Ker added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu, who also
currently serves as acting chairwoman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), expressed Wednesday her expectation that the
upcoming DPP chairmanship by-election will be a "fair race with
style."</P>
      <P>Lu, who was nominated as the interim party chairwoman during a
regular meeting of the DPP Central Standing Committee Dec. 6 after Su
Tseng-chang stepped down to take responsibility for the DPP's
humiliating defeat in the Dec. 3 city and county chief elections, has
ruled out the possibility of her running for the DPP chairmanship.</P>
      <P>The vice president made the remarks during a meeting at the DPP
Central Standing Committee Wednesday to screen the qualifications of
the three candidates -- former Premier and Presidential Office
Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun, DPP Legislator Trong Chai and former
Changhua County chief Weng Chin-chu.</P>
      <P>If nothing unexpected happens, the party chairmanship
by-election, slated for Jan. 15, will be a three-way race.</P>
      <P>"I am eager to see that via this by-election, the DPP will
produce a new leader who is not only capable of leading the party to
a rebirth, accelerating democratic reforms and deepening the Taiwan
identity, but who is also capable of helping Taiwan meet the
challenges brought by globalization," Lu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PEOPLE'S SUPPORT A KEY FOR UNIFICATION: BEIJING OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec, 21 (CNA)
(By P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese Taiwan affairs official has said
that peaceful unification can only be discussed when it is supported
by the Taiwan people, according to a report carried by the Hong
Kong-based Wen Wey Po Daily Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The official, who wished to remain anonymous, said that the time
will be ripe for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to discuss
peaceful unification only when most of the Taiwan people support it.</P>
      <P>The report also quoted a Chinese scholar as saying that
currently, Beijing no longer wants to talk about a "unification
timetable" as it realizes the complications in dealing with work
related to the Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>According to the scholar, the main point of China's current
Taiwan policy is to prevent the island from moving toward
independence.</P>
      <P>"This does not mean that Beijing will not push for eventual
unification with the island," the scholar said, adding that it "will
map out a more systematic, detailed and tolerant scheme for future
cross-strait unification."</P>
      <P>The remarks by the Chinese official and the scholar were in
response to comments made Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou during his Dec. 9 interview with Newsweek magazine.</P>
      <P>Ma told the magazine that even though eventual unification is a
goal of his party, there has certainly been no timetable set.</P>
      <P>Noting that the time is not yet ripe for unification, Ma said
that he does not think that neither side is ready to move forward
toward unification.</P>
      <P>"Currently, China neither works on matters related to unification
nor talks about it," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLICE ARREST THREE SUSPECTED 'SNAKE HEAD' RING MEMBERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police arrested three individuals suspected
of being part of a "snake head" ring in three separate raids in the
southern port city of Kaohsiung Tuesday night, sources from the
Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>After receiving a tip, CIB investigators, backed up by Kaohsiung
police, arrested a Taiwan man surnamed Yen, a Taiwan woman surnamed
Ho and a mainland Chinese woman surnamed Chen at their residences.
The three are suspected of having smuggled at least 40 mainland
Chinese citizens into the country with forged documents.</P>
      <P>In the raids on the homes of the three suspects, police
discovered stacks of forged documents and certificates, including
bogus marriage certificates issued by local governments in China,
entrance guarantees for Chinese citizens, registration forms for
immigrants, household registration papers, mainland Chinese
residential cards and travel documents.</P>
      <P>Yen confessed at the police station that he has worked with an
accomplice, surnamed Lee, who remains at large, to help mainlanders
travel to Taiwan with forged papers and travel documents with back-up
by Yen's Chinese wife in Ningde City, Fujian Province. Each of the
illegal mainland Chinese immigrants paid NT$10,000 (US$303) to be
trafficked into Taiwan, he further told police.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CIB investigators have discovered that guarantee
papers for more than 40 entrance applications filed by mainland
Chinese citizens carry doctored stamps issued by Kaohsiung police
between November 2004 and July 2005, meaning that more than 40
mainland citizens entered Taiwan with forged papers during that
period.</P>
      <P>All three of the arrested suspects said they did not know the
current whereabouts of the mainland Chinese citizens that had entered
the country using forged documents provided by the ring.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REDISTRICTED CONSTITUENCIES EXPECTED BY NEXT NOVEMBER: CEC CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) will
promulgate the newly redistricted constituencies for the next
legislative elections by the end of November 2006, CEC Chairman Chang
Cheng-hsiung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks when he reported to the Home Committee at
the legislature on the progress of redrawing constituencies in line
with electoral system reforms for legislators.</P>
      <P>He noted that according to the constitutional amendment passed
this June, the electoral system for legislators will be changed from
the current multiple seats per constituency to a "single seat, two
votes" format.</P>
      <P>In line with the constitutional amendment, the CEC has been
commissioned with the task of redistricting the constituencies.</P>
      <P>As the issue has been controversial in the experience of
many other countries, the CEC formed a task force in July to work
out the redistricting principles, which were then sent to municipal,
city and county election commissions.</P>
      <P>The commissions will work out their draft redistricting plans and
hold public hearings in early 2006 and send the results to the CEC in
April for reference, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The CEC team will hold public hearings by the end of next August
and complete a draft redistricting plan by the end of September and
then promulgate it by the end of November, he added.</P>
      <P>Starting from the seventh legislature to be elected in 2007, the
legislative electoral system will be changed, the Legislative Yuan
will be halved to 113 seats and lawmakers will be elected every four
years. While 73 seats will be elected from regional districts, there
will be six seats for aboriginal representatives and 34 seats for
at-large and overseas expatriate representatives.</P>
      <P>CEC officials have said that the redrawing of the constituencies
should be promulgated one year before the term of the incumbent
legislators expires, which means it should be announced by Jan. 31,
2007 at the latest.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday the
operations of the National Communications Commission (NCC) should not
be affected by the constitutional controversy over the statute which
provides for the commission's formation.</P>
      <P>Noting that a panel charged with choosing NCC member nominees has
agreed to select another nominee to replace Lu Chung-chin, chairman
of the Electrical Engineering Department at the National Tsinghua
University, who withdrew his name from consideration, the premier
lauded the panel's response as positive.</P>
      <P>After the final nominee is selected, the premier said he will
immediately present the list of all 13 nominees to the Legislative
Yuan for confirmation in the hope that the commission can begin its
operations as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>As to the controversy over the way the nominees were chosen, the
premier said it should not affect the operations of the commission
even if his administration decides to appeal to the Council of Grand
Justices for a ruling on its constitutionality.</P>
      <P>The premier was referring to Article 3 of the NCC Organic Law
which stipulates that the nominees should be chosen from a pool of
candidates recommended by the political parties in the legislature
according to the number of legislative seats each party holds.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's administration, which considers the provision an
infringement on the power of the executive branch, had urged
lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and its
political ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, to block it, only
to see it railroaded through the legislature by the opposition.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers who had fought tooth and nail in the legislature to
try to block the bill have threatened to cut the Executive Yuan's
budget unless it turns to the Council of Grand Justices for a ruling
to invalidate the provision.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With a large number of outsourcing jobs
being created amid the trend of business streamlining in Taiwan,
tallies released Wednesday by a local online outsourcing job bank
shows that the number of moonlighters has more than doubled in the
past year.</P>
      <P>According to Jcase, office workers who accepted second jobs
through the job bank increased 2.37-fold from 52,372 in May 2004 to
124,058 in October 2005.</P>
      <P>A survey of these workers indicates that 73.02 percent of them
are pessimistic about the amount of year-end bonus they will receive
and about the prospect of a pay hike this year. While most of them
said they will be satisfied if they can get as much as they got last
year, many are worried that they will get less or even nothing.</P>
      <P>As many businesses have opted to outsource their work in an
effort to reduce costs, a wide variety of part-time jobs are now
available in the job market, Jcase officials said.</P>
      <P>Unlike in the past when most outsourcing work was in the
computer, writing and design categories, a lot of new options are
being added to the list, which include program planners for year-end
or New Year parties, pet sitters, adult story writers, and
pornography dubbing actors, they said.</P>
      <P>There are also companies looking for moonlighters who will be
responsible for answering mobile phones to respond to callers'
questions, offer legal counseling or simply chat with the callers,
they said.</P>
      <P>For those who are good at imitating the voice of popular singers
such as Jolin Tsai an Jay Chou, there are jobs for pre-recording
ringback tones for mobile phones, they added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Dozens of college students staged a sit-in
in front of the main gate of National Taiwan University (NTU)
Wednesday to protest the recent arrest by Hong Kong police of NTU
student Lee Chien-cheng for alleged unlawful assembly in the former
British colony.</P>
      <P>The students urged the Beijing and Hong Kong authorities to
respect the principles of democracy and human rights and release Lee
immediately. They argued that Lee is not violent and was not among
the 1,000-strong rioters who were accused of assaulting and battering
Hong Kong police during anti-globalization protests at the World
Trade Organization (WTO) talks in Hong Kong Dec. 17.</P>
      <P>Lee was among 14 protesters from Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and
mainland China who were charged by Hong Kong law enforcement
authorities after taking part in the WTO protests.</P>
      <P>The students said they want the Hong Kong authorities to produce
evidence to support their reasons for arresting Lee and keeping him
detained.</P>
      <P>They also urged the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
to "take immediate actions" to secure Lee's release.</P>
      <P>According to NTU students who traveled to Hong Kong with Lee last
week and had talked with him before returning to Taiwan Monday, Lee
has not been provided with enough warm clothes and has even been
stripped of his glasses while in detention.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to NTU student leader Hsu Po-jen, the NTU
authorities have made three promises regarding assisting Lee. They
agreed that an NTU professor, surnamed Huang, will accompany Lee's
parents on a visit to Hong Kong to try to secure Lee's release, that
NTU will retain Lee's student status during the period of his
detention, and that NTU will foot the legal bills for Lee's release
if the MAC refuses to pay, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Hsu added that a "Taiwan Conscience" activity to "save Lee" was
launched Wednesday and that it will continue through Dec. 23 when a
Hong Kong court is scheduled to review Lee's case.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai Jy-jon, director of the MAC's Hong Kong and Macau
Affairs Department, said the MAC and Taiwan's representative office
have been working in concert to offer Lee all necessary assistance.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, 12 Taiwan citizens along with more than 1,000
other anti-WTO protesters from neighboring Asian countries were
arrested by Hong Kong police last Saturday for going on a violent
rampage outside a WTO convention hall. All the Taiwan citizens that
were arrested have been released, except for Lee.</P>
      <P>Tsai said Taiwan's representative office in Hong Kong asked for
Lee's release on bail, but the Hong Kong court rejected the request
on the grounds that Lee has neither any relatives nor a residency
permit in Hong Kong.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN CHE-NAN REMAINS SILENT AT COURT HEARING ON KRTC SCANDAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec.  21  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Presidential Office Deputy
Secretary-General Chen Che-nan appeared in court for the first time
Wednesday in a corruption case in connection with the construction of
Kaohsiung's rapid transit system.</P>
      <P>Chen remained silent throughout the hearing while his lawyer
claimed the prosecution was wrong to charge him with accepting
freebies from a major contractor related to the rapid transit
project.</P>
      <P>The Huapan Administration Consultant Co. did not treat Chen to
two free trips to Thailand and South Korea -- it just "pre-paid" the
ticket prices for Chen and others, according to the lawyer.</P>
      <P>Still, the prosecutors requested that the court hand down a
"severer than usual" sentence on the former senior official for
repeatedly violating the law governing graft and corruption.</P>
      <P>The presiding judge asked both Chen's lawyer and the prosecutors
to supply further evidence to support their claims.</P>
      <P>According to the indictment, Chen, his bodyguard Chen Chih-ming,
former Vice Chairman Chen Min-hsien of Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp.
(KRTC) and two others accepted Huapan General Manager Yen Shih-hua
and his wife Wang Tsai-pi's return tickets and visited Bangkok,
Thailand July 6-9, 2002.</P>
      <P>The time coincided with the KRTC schedule to select a contractor
for hiring foreign workers working on the rapid transit lines and
managing their life in Taiwan, the indictment noted.</P>
      <P>From Nov. 1 to Nov. 3, 2002, the two Chens, plus bodyguard Chen
and two others, again accepted free tickets offered by Wang Tsai-pi
and traveled to Cheju Island, South Korea on a pleasure trip, the
prosecution said.</P>
      <P>When Chen Che-nan arrived at the court, he told the media that he
trusts the judicial authorities. That was the only sentence he
uttered throughout Wednesday's hearing.</P>
      <P>Also appearing in court were the Yen-Wang couple, former
legislator Liu Ping-wei and other defendants. Wang's lawyer accused
the prosecution of illegally arresting her and encroaching upon her
human rights. She also charged that her statements as recorded in the
investigation report were not made out of her own free will.</P>
      <P>Retorting her charges, the prosecution said her arrest was made
with warrants; the investigation process was legal and tape-recorded;
breakfast was supplied when she was in custody -- in short, no
violations of her human rights ever occurred.</P>
      <P>The KRTC scandal erupted in late August when Thai workers rioted
in protest against their inhumane treatment by Huapan Co., bringing
to light more corruption suspicions including the contract-awarding
practices. Huapan's contract has since been canceled and Chen
Min-hsien charged.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, Premier Frank Hsieh, former mayor of Kaohsiung, called
on the public to "let the justice system do its job." He also
welcomed closer supervision of the MRT's construction work to ensure
its operation safety in the future.</P>
      <P>"And don't just look at the KRTC from negative perspectives. It
needs cheering up," Hsieh said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY EXODUS TO CUT TAIWAN FOREIGN INCOME: ECONOMIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will lose more than NT$2.5 trillion
(US$75.14 billion) in foreign income annually if the country's
manufacturing industry is allowed to move overseas, a local economist
warned Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Giving a speech on the challenges and future of the manufacturing
industry, Taiwan Thinktank Chairman Chen Po-chih pointed out that
many people in the country consider the manufacturing industry a
low-value sector and are proposing that the country focus on research
and development as well as marketing.</P>
      <P>Chen said he agrees that a high-income country should pay
attention to research and development and marketing, but this does
not mean that the manufacturing sector -- now accounting for 23
percent of Taiwan's economic production and a large share of the
country's exports -- can be done away with.</P>
      <P>Noting that manufacturing still accounts for approximately 20
percent of the economic production of most developed countries, Chen
said Taiwan has no reason to give up the manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the production lines of the manufacturing
industry can continue to stay in high-income countries and will not
face competition from countries of low labor costs as long as their
products are developed with unique know-how.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, although China has the ability to
manufacture commercial planes, the country continues to purchase
aircraft from Boeing and Airbus mainly because it involve unique
know-how in aircraft manufacturing.</P>
      <P>With at least one million out of the total of 2.7 million
workforce in Taiwan's manufacturing industry being labor-intensive,
the exodus of the industry will seriously impact local society and
the economy, Chen said.</P>
      <P>If the manufacturing industry moves out of the country, it will
be difficult for those working in the sector to find other jobs,
which will worsen the unemployment problem, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>In addition, the financial, transportation and electrical power
industries, which mainly serve the manufacturing industry, will
shrink significantly if the manufacturing industry no longer exists,
he said.</P>
      <P>Instead of adopting a laissez-faire attitude toward the
manufacturing industry, Taiwan should encourage the manufacturing
industry to produce distinctive products to enhance their
competitiveness, he proposed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP ANTI-CORRUPTION COMMITTEE BECOMES OPERATIONAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An anti-corruption committee under the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) became operational
Wednesday immediately after Vice President Annette Lu announced its
establishment. The committee is aimed at galvanizing the DPP's image
of integrity and discipline.</P>
      <P>Lu, who was nominated as the DPP's interim party chairwoman
during a regular meeting of the DPP Central Standing Committee Dec. 6
after Su Tseng-chang stepped down to take responsibility for the
DPP's humiliating defeat in the Dec. 3 city and county chief
elections, said that the DPP anti-corruption committee is open to all
people, including non-DPP members, to report their findings about
graft and irregularities committed by DPP officials or other
government officials.</P>
      <P>Noting that integrity and discipline are cornerstones of the DPP,
which also helped the party win Taiwan's first peaceful transition of
ruling political power in 2000, Lu said that it is regrettable that
the DPP did poorly in the Dec. 3 "three-in-one" elections -- a
development that can be attributed to a recent string of corruption
scandals, including the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. scandal and the
"vultures" insider-trading case.</P>
      <P>As several officials from the DPP government were allegedly
involved in the scandals, Lu said, President Chen Shui-bian has
instructed the launch of a campaign against official corruption to
regain the public's faith in government.</P>
      <P>Attorney Chen Chuan-yueh, who was assigned to head the DPP
anti-corruption committee, said that his job is daunting, but he will
do his utmost to help discipline wayward DPP members or officials so
that the DPP's image of integrity can be regained.</P>
      <P>The committee will investigate the president, vice president, the
premier, DPP legislators, city and county chiefs and DPP Central
Standing Committee members if necessary, Chen added.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The shortage of women's restrooms on the
campus of National Taiwan University has inspired a school feminist
group to urge women Wednesday to stand up for their rights --
literally -- by standing when they urinate.</P>
      <P>The group, the Gender Equality Commission, said that standing up
while going to the bathroom is a liberating experience and is quicker
and cleaner than sitting down, according to Lin Yi-ling, a member of
the commission.</P>
      <P>She said women have to wait much longer at public restrooms
because there are fewer stalls in the women's rooms compared to men's
rooms. The line would move faster if women just stood up to urinate
and, besides, this would eliminate the problem of sitting down on a
dirty toilet seat, she said.</P>
      <P>In addition to showing the history of how women have adapted to
passing water standing up in different places around the world, kits
manufactured in the United States, the Netherlands, Canada, Taiwan
and China to help women urinate in a standing position were on
display at an activity Wednesday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will be watching
the upcoming by-election for a new Democratic Progressive Party
chairman, but will remain neutral, Vice President Annette Lu, who is
concurrently serving as acting DPP chairwoman, said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lu said in a DPP Central Standing Committee meeting that
President Chen specifically asked her to convey his stance on the
upcoming election, which is set to take place Jan. 15.</P>
      <P>The president will be impartial to all three candidates for the
post -- former Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun,
Legislator Trong Chai, and former Changhua County Magistrate Weng
Chin-chu -- and will not endorse any of them, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Lu also said that as the acting party chairwoman, she will remain
impartial so that the election can be held in a "just way with
style."</P>
      <P>The DPP Central Standing Committee also decided in the meeting to
hold two TV debates for the by-election, with the first one in Taipei
Jan. 7 and the second one in Kaohsiung with the date yet to be
decided.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP lawmakers' reactions to the three candidates were
mixed.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Wen-chung, who is from the New Tide faction of
the party, said that he supports Weng "morally, " because Weng
projects an image of integrity, which is what DPP members expect in a
leader.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he expected more people to register for the
chairmanship race so that the "democratic, open and pluralistic
spirit" of the DPP can be revived.</P>
      <P>Legislator Gao Chih-peng of the Justice Alliance said that Weng's
running will affect the election result, but the alliance will not
endorse a specific candidate.</P>
      <P>Yu is said to have the endorsement of two major factions -- the
New Tide as well as the Justice Alliance. With his long-term
relations with the president, he is also generally considered to have
been hand-picked by Chen for the post, although Chen has often vowed
neutrality in the election.</P>
      <P>Political observers said that they are still watching to see if
the race comes down to a battle between Yu and Weng, who apparently
came forward at the last minute at the urging of respected former DPP
Chairman Lin I-hsiung.</P>
      <P>They are also watching if Chai, a long-time advocate of Taiwan
independence, will benefit from playing off against Yu and Weng.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIST PROPOSES RELAXING CEILING LIMITS ON CHINA-BOUND INVESTMENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local economist proposed Wednesday that
the government relax the ceiling limits on China-bound investments
under certain conditions.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan businesses are forbidden from directing more
than 40 percent of their total investments to China.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan Thinktank Chairman Chen Po-chih, the ceiling
limits can be relaxed if the investing businesses are not in debt in
Taiwan, if they do not involve in any capital-labor disputes and if
their scales of production do not rely heavily on the operations in
China.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in response to questions from the media.
Whether the government will further relax its restrictions on
cross-Taiwan Strait trade and economic activities is expected to be a
major issue on the agenda of the second national economic development
conference slated for next year.</P>
      <P>Chen is one of the economists who contributed to the government's
"no haste, be patient" policy on investments towards China in the
1990s. He was head of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development when the last national economic development conference
was held in 2001, during which the policy of "positive opening,
efficient management" on cross-strait trade and economic activities
was formed.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that investing in China does not only involve
economic aspects but it also concerns national security. Therefore,
the government must make careful considerations before further
relaxing its restrictions on China-bound investments, he said.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, most local notebook computer manufacturers
had no plan to set up operations in China when the business sector
was discussing whether the government should allow notebook
computer-makers to invest in China in the past.</P>
      <P>However, the manufacturers later decided to move their production
lines to China to reduce their production costs after some businesses
had taken the first move to do so without the government's
permission, he noted.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan's notebook computer sector now posts a gross
profit margin of only 4 percent, he added.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most people have never been in court, but
few have any confidence in the institution, according to a survey
released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>It found that 80 percent of Taiwan's judges and 60 percent of
lawyers and court staff have a good impression of the court, but only
30 percent of the public agree with them.</P>
      <P>The survey, done by the Judicial Reform Foundation (JRF), found
that 80 percent of lawyers and court staff think that the court is a
safe place. However, the same ratio of lawyers said they could be
insulted at court and 70 percent thought they could be threatened
there. Half of the interviewed court staff members also felt they
could be insulted or threatened.</P>
      <P>Some 60 percent of polled lawyers and members of the public said
Taiwan's courts are partial, favoring in particular the higher
echelons of society or those higher in the economic pecking order.
More than 70 percent of lawyers said criminal court judges favor
prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Kao Jung-chih, a JRF Executive Committee member, said that to
improve the court's image, people working at the court need to
upgrade their feel for the people and enhance their ability to "see
and feel like others."</P>
      <P>A good judicial system as well as professional and ethical mass
media are also needed, Kao added.</P>
      <P>Chu Hai-yuan, an Academia Sinica research fellow, said this was
the first comprehensive survey about the judicial system, which found
that almost 80 percent of the people have never had any experience of
dealing with the court and yet they had a poor impression of it.</P>
      <P>Chu said one way to improve the judicial authorities' image and
achieve "quality trials" is to lay off incompetent judges by
legislating a law governing the organization of the courts and
professional practices of judges.</P>
      <P>The JRF's Chief Executive Kao Yung-cheng said the Judicial Yuan
should try to boost people's confidence in the court system because
they are all its potential users.</P>
      <P>The JRF interviewed 1,068 people, 918 staff members working at
district courts, 426 lawyers and a number of judges from Nov. 10 to
Nov. 25 this year.</P>
      <P>Following the establishment of the Judicial Reform Committee by
the government in 1994, a group of reform-minded lawyers, professors
and social activists banded together in the belief that judicial
reform could not become a reality without the support of the rank and
file working within the judicial system.</P>
      <P>These lawyers, professors, and social activists therefore formed
the Judicial Reform Foundation, which operates independently of the
ROC government.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PASSAGE OF ARMS BILL KEY FOR U.S., NOT NATURE OF BUDGET: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States is looking forward to a
quick passage of a major arms procurement bill by Taiwan's
legislature, but it does not care about whether it is financed by a
regular or special budget, Vice Minister of National Defense (MND)
Tsai Ming-shien said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who returned recently from the United States where he took
part in a Taiwan-U.S. military meeting, made the remarks while giving
a special report at the National Defense Committee under the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The MND is willing to find common ground with the opposition on
how the budget for the arms purchase package should be earmarked in
order not to affect the allocation for other operations despite the
fact that President Chen Shui-bian has proclaimed that the country's
military spending should be lifted to 3 percent of the nation's gross
domestic product (GDP), Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The MND submitted the major military procurement bill last year,
valued at NT$610.8 billion, to the Legislative Yuan for its approval
to procure eight diesel-powered submarines, six Patriot PAC III
anti-missile batteries and 12 anti-submarine airplanes from the
United States.</P>
      <P>But the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan has repeatedly
refused to discuss the bill, questioning the heavy financial burden
that Taiwan has to sustain and the country's need to acquire the
weapons, although the MND has slashed the spending to NT$480 billion.</P>
      <P>The bill was rammed through the Rules Committee a day earlier, in
which 12 lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
and the Taiwan Solidarity Union voted in favor against five lawmakers
of the opposition "pan blue alliance" of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>Out of concern over the latest development, members of the
Democratic Action Alliance visited the legislative caucus of the PFP
Wednesday morning, asking the party never to soften its stance
against the major military purchase bill.</P>
      <P>Alliance members also urged KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou not to bow
to pressure from the United States by agreeing to the MND's 3 percent
GDP proposal.</P>
      <P>Increased military expenditures would fan an arms race with
China, whose military budget accounts for only 0.43 percent of its
GDP but is 8.7 fold that of Taiwan's level, they warned.</P>
      <P>An adjustment from the current ratio of 2.42 percent in GDP to 3
percent equals a considerable growth of NT$70 billion in cash, which
in turn is not a guarantee for peace, they said, noting that a 2.42
percent share already makes Taiwan one of Asia's frontrunners in
military spending.</P>
      <P>Echoing their comments, PFP legislative caucus whip Daniel Y.C.
Huang said that the MND's military procurement bill must be assessed
together with the government's finances and the state of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations.</P>
      <P>The PFP maintains that the military procurement package must not
crowd out the government's budgets in other fields and that the
government should first do something to bolster cross-strait ties,
such as opening up to Chinese tourists and setting up direct
transport links.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Chao Liang-yen said that she will call a public
hearing to gauge public opinion about the 3 percent GDP proposal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ISSUANCE OF NEW IDENTIFICATION CARDS BEGINS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Household registration offices around the
island started to issue the new version of ID cards Wednesday, with
Premier Frank Hsieh saying that the new ID cards symbolize the next
era for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>More than 18 million new ID cards would be issued by the end of
next year. The current version was issued in 1986. The new version
was scheduled to be issued July 1 this year but was delayed till Dec.
21 due to issues revolving around whether to include the owner's
fingerprint. A Council of Grand Justice ruling declared such a
requirement unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>During a news conference at the Da-an District household
registration office, Premier Hsieh said, "The old ID cards have a
very deep historical meaning. During almost 20 years, our people have
witnessed with this card the country's democratization. That includes
using it for presidential elections, electing the last term of
National Assembly members, mayoral elections, legislative elections,
and have benefited from the national health insurance and many other
things."</P>
      <P>Hsieh also urged applicants to cooperate as much as possible with
the staff of the household registration offices because there are
many cards to issue.</P>
      <P>"In the past 20 years, the way people look has changed and the ID
pictures must be replaced. I believe that the new ID cards mean the
start of new era because Taiwan is going to change in the coming 20
years, and we are going to fight for the right to organize the 2020
Olympic Games," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, the procedure to get new ID cards is
not complicated and people do not have to wait too long.</P>
      <P>Ado Kaliting Pacidal, an indigenous woman who wanted to use her
aboriginal name on her new ID card got her wish at Taipei's Sungshan
District household registration office in less than two hours, a
procedure that used to take twice the time in the past.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Wang Chien-ming, a local man who pitches in
the Major Leagues in the United States, whose domicile is registered
in the southern city of Tainan, obtained his new ID card with
considerable delay due to a computer problem that made him wait for
more than an hour.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he wants to apply for his U.S. visa with his new
ID card before he leaves before Chinese Lunar New Year, which falls
on Jan. 29, 2006.</P>
      <P>Chou Hsi-wei, the newly elected Taipei County magistrate,
reportedly was the first in his county to obtain a new ID card

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN ORDERED TO PAY TOKEN COMPENSATION OVER COUP REMARK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court ordered President
Chen Shui-bian Wednesday to apologize and pay symbolic compensation
to his two rivals in the last presidential election for implying they
had attempted to stage a "soft coup d'etat" after last year's
divisive election.</P>
      <P>According to the court ruling, Chen must pay former Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong
NT$1 -- about 3 U.S. cents -- each and publish half-page apologies in
three major local newspapers -- the Liberty Times, the China Times
and the United Daily News -- for one day.</P>
      <P>Lien and Soong ran on a joint ticket in the 2004 presidential
election, but lost the race to the incumbents -- President Chen and
Vice President Annette Lu -- by a very small margin after an
election-eve shooting in which both Chen and Lu were wounded
slightly.</P>
      <P>Chen accused Lien and Soong at a public occasion in November 2004
of attempting a "soft coup d'etat" after losing the March 20, 2004
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Under the constitutional system, the court ruling said, the
presidency is a government agency. Therefore, the verdict said, Chen
is not entitled to freedom of speech and is obligated to prove the
truthfulness of his words.</P>
      <P>As Chen was unable to provide concrete evidence to prove there
was a coup d'etat in the wake of the 2004 presidential election and
that his two opposition rivals were involved in such an event, the
verdict said Chen had to apologize and pay token compensation.</P>
      <P>Chen's lawyer argued that the president had not been specific in
his public remarks, but the court said Chen's statement was
apparently insinuating that Lien and Soong were involving in the
planning for a "soft coup d'etat."</P>
      <P>On Nov. 14, 2004, President Chen said at a legislative campaign
rally that Lien and Soong had lobbied senior military generals to
either "resign" or "take a leave of absence" in preparation for a
"soft coup d'etat" after losing their presidential bid.</P>
      <P>Thanks to his efforts to push for de-politicization of the
military since he assumed office in 2000, Chen claimed that the
Lien-Soong appeal received a lukewarm response and the "soft coup
d'etat" didn't happen. Chen's remarks prompted Lien and Soong to file
a slander suit against the president late last year.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times:
In Final Hours, M.T.A. Took a Big Risk on 
Pensions 

On the final day of intense negotiations,
the New York Metropolitan Transportation
Authority greatly altered what it had called its
final offer, to address many of the objections
of the transit workers' union. But then, just
hours before the strike deadline, the
authority's chairman, Peter S. Kalikow, put
forward a surprise demand that stunned the
union. Seeking to rein in the authority's
soaring pension costs, he asked that all new
transit workers contribute 6 percent of their
wages toward their pensions, up from the 2
percent that current workers pay. The union
balked, and then shut down the nation's largest
transit system for the first time in a quarter-
century. The pension proposal would have saved
the transit authority less than US$20 million
over the next three years. It seemed a small
figure, considering that the city says that
every day of the strike will cost its businesses
hundreds of millions of dollars in lost
revenues. But the authority contends that it
must act now to prevent a "tidal wave" of
pension outlays if costs are not brought under
control.



Wall Street Journal: Course Corrections,
To Cut Prison Bill, States Tweak Laws,
Try Early Releases

Many U.S. states are taking steps to reduce 
its prison population. That has little to do
withh any change in tough-on-crime thinking and
a lot to do with dollars and cents. Housing
criminals is expensive: The average cost was
US$22,650 a year per person in 2001, the last
year for which figures are available.
The two-decade trend of severe penalties has 
led to a surge in corrections spending. In fiscal
year 2006, states are expected to spend US$34.6 
billion, up 24 percent from five years earlier, 
according to the National Conference of State 
Legislatures. Virginia revised its laws in 2001
to allow prisoners who are at least 65 years old
and have served at least five years in prison to
apply for parole on the basis of their age. 
Prisoners who are 60 or older and have served 
10 years also may apply to the board. Inmates 
serving time for capital murder aren't eligible.
A state law of Connecticut promotes the release 
of less-dangerous offenders by letting
those accused of minor crimes stay home while
awaiting trial.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT DID NOT IMPLY LIEN, SOONG IN COUP REMARKS: AIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian was not referring
to former Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party
Chairman James Soong when he said some people were attempting to
stage a "soft coup d'etat" in the days after he was re-elected by a
small margin, a close aide to the president said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ma Yung-cheng, acting secretary-general to the president, said
Chen "has no qualms" about what he said at the time. Ma replaced Yu
Shyi-kun after Yu quit the Presidential Office post to run for the
ruling party's chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Ma made his comments just before a court was to announce its
ruling on the slander lawsuit filed by Lien and Soong, running mates
who lost the 2004 presidential election by 0.0228 percent of the
vote. The court found Chen guilty and ordered him to pay a token NT$1
in compensation to each of the complainants and to publish an apology
in three major newspapers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma said when the president made the controversial remarks,
protests in front of the Presidential Office had been going on for
six or seven days and some of the protesters were uniformed soldiers
while some Web sites called on the military and the police to "rise
up."</P>
      <P>Most precarious was that at that juncture, Beijing issued a
statement claiming it would not sit idly by as chaos continued in
Taiwan, making people feel that Taiwan's national security was under
threat, Ma said.</P>
      <P>President Chen was using examples in other countries when he said
there were attempts at a "soft coup d'etat" as he tried to remind the
people that some people were colluding to act, probably being used by
China, to affect national security and to create political turmoil,
Ma added.</P>
      <P>The court, however, disagreed with Ma's explanation and said in
its ruling that the president did imply Lien and Soong when he
mentioned that the protests were part of an attempt to gain "personal
power."</P>
      <P>Judging from the social situation at the time, the court said it
was reasonable to infer that the president was implicitly referring
to Lien and Soong.</P>
      <P>Ma insisted that Chen did not have the slightest compunction
about having made the remarks as he "had a lot of understanding" and
was not referring to "Mr. Lien and Mr. Soong."</P>
      <P>To the media question about the president's "psychological
preparedness" for the court ruling, Ma replied that a court ruling
could be based on different arguments such as freedom of expression
and facts, and he would not make a prediction or a comment.</P>

      <P>A bill that would revoke the tax-exempt
status for elementary and junior high school teachers and the
military personnel failed at the Legislative Yuan Wednesday, with
lawmakers opting to discuss the bill at a later date.</P>
      <P>Opposition "pan blue alliance" lawmakers vetoed the bill 23 to 21
and decided to elaborate on the bill another day following a
filibuster at a joint committee meeting.</P>
      <P>"Pan blue" lawmakers of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP) were sharply alighted against "pan green" camp lawmakers
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) over the question of whether teachers and
military personnel should be compensated by the government for their
taxes paid to the government.</P>
      <P>KMT and PFP lawmakers contended that the bill must be made into
law with a set of complementary measures to fully compensate income
tax paid by teachers and military personnel to the government, while
DPP and TSU lawmakers insisted on revoking their tax-free privilege
first.</P>
      <P>The issue, although a historic remnant, has become one of the
major debate points in recent elections as the rich-poor gap is
increasingly widening in Taiwan society.</P>
      <P>Some 60 members of a group advocating fair taxation voiced their
regret after the bill failed at the Legislative Yuan, saying that
they will continue seeking public endorsement to hold a referendum on
the issue.</P>
      <P>The Fair Taxation Alliance said that they will step up their

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said
Wednesday that the decision to import pandas will be delayed until
experts release their findings on the needs of the animals and
whether Taiwan has the appropriate environment to breed them.</P>
      <P>The COA made the statement following an audition with the Taipei
Zoo and the Leofoo Village theme park located in Hsinchu Wednesday.
Both of them have applied to the COA to receive the pandas.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government announced that they are willing to donate
a pair of pandas to Taiwan following the visit of former Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Lien Chan to China earlier this year.</P>
      <P>During the audition, the Taipei Zoo showed the COA statistics on
39 pandas' births and deaths between Jan. 1, 1993 and Dec. 31, 2004.
Among them, seven were exported from China before 1993 and 18 were
exported after that, while 14 were born out of China. A total of 11

      <P>The government must create favorable

      <P>Tsai Hung-ming, vice secretary-general of the Chinese National

businesses must focus on industrial upgrading and pursue product
uniqueness in tune with an unfettered investment climate, Tsai said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) honorary
Chairman Lien Chan hailed a court ruling Wednesday that requires
President Chen Shui-bian to apologize to him for implying he had
attempted a "soft coup d'etat" after losing last year's presidential
election.</P>
      <P>"Justice is served, " Lien said after the Taipei District Court
ruled earlier the same day that Chen must apologize to Lien and
Lien's 2004 presidential election running mate -- People First Party
Chairman James Soong -- for implying they had attempted to stage a
"soft coup d'etat" in the wake of the divisive election.</P>
      <P>The court ordered Chen to pay Lien and Soong each NT$1 -- about 3
U.S. cents -- in symbolic compensation and publish half-page
apologies in three major local newspapers -- the Liberty Times, the
China Times and the United Daily News -- for one day.</P>
      <P>"The ruling is a very nice gift. It is expected to help guide our
political culture to develop in a positive direction. I hope it will
inspire local politicians to refrain from running off at the mouth
and making false accusations," Lien said.</P>
      <P>Lien also urged Chen to show full remorse for his unfounded
accusation against him and Soong by giving up his right to appeal the
case.</P>
      <P>Lien and Soong ran on a joint ticket in the 2004 presidential
election, but lost the race to the incumbents -- President Chen and
Vice President Annette Lu -- by a very small margin after an
election-eve shooting in which both Chen and Lu were wounded
slightly.</P>
      <P>On Nov. 14, 2004, President Chen said at a legislative campaign
rally that Lien and Soong had lobbied senior military generals to
either "resign" or "take a leave of absence" in preparation for a
"soft coup d'etat" after losing the March 20, 2004 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Thanks to his efforts to push for de-politicization of the
military since he assumed office in 2000, Chen claimed that the
Lien-Soong appeal received a lukewarm response and the "soft coup
d'etat" didn't happen. Chen's remarks prompted Lien and Soong to file
a slander suit against the president late last year.</P>
      <P>Under the constitutional system, the court ruling said, the
presidency is a government agency. Therefore, the verdict said, Chen
is not entitled to freedom of speech and is obligated to prove the

      <P>As Chen was unable to provide concrete evidence to prove there
was a coup d'etat in the wake of the 2004 presidential election and
that his two opposition rivals were involved in such an event, the
verdict said Chen had to apologize and pay token compensation.</P>
      <P>Lien and Soong commissioned their lawyer, Lee Fu-tien, to issue a
joint statement hailing the court's judgment as "fair and impartial."</P>
      <P>"Chairmen of the two main opposition parties were accused by the
head of state of staging a coup. This is a very serious accusation
against any politician, " the joint statement said. "We hope the
verdict will send a message to politicians that they can't make
groundless accusations."</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Hwang Yih-jiau said his party
welcomes the court ruling. Hwang urged Chen to exercise prudence in
making comments and to be a role model so that Taiwan can develop a
decent political culture.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as Taipei mayor, said he
believes that Chen's approval rating will rebound if Chen drops his
plan to appeal the case.</P>
      <P>"This is the first time that a sitting ROC head of state loses a
slander suit. The case involves a very important point that
opposition parties' activities should not be regarded as coup d'etat
or rebellions," Ma added.</P>
      <P>Lien and Soong disputed the 2004 presidential election result,
suggesting the president had organized the shooting to win sympathy
votes, and alleging irregularities during the voting.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the election, "pan-blue" supporters took to the
streets in weeklong protests in which sometimes turned violent.
Courts at all levels have rejected the two opposition suits
challenging the validity of Chen's re-election, and investigators
said the most likely suspect in the March 19, 2004 shooting was an
unemployed man in his 50s who was unhappy over his economic
situation. The man died shortly after the shooting, apparently a
suicide.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DECISION ON PANDAS DELAYED UNTIL MORE EXPERTS WEIGH IN: COA(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said
Wednesday that the decision to import pandas will be delayed until
experts release their findings on the needs of the animals and
whether Taiwan has the appropriate environment to breed them.</P>
      <P>The COA made the statement following an audition with the Taipei
Zoo and the Leofoo Village theme park located in Hsinchu Wednesday.
Both of them have applied to the COA to receive the pandas.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government announced that they are willing to donate
a pair of pandas to Taiwan following the visit of former Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Lien Chan to China earlier this year.</P>
      <P>During the audition, the Taipei Zoo showed the COA statistics on
39 pandas' births and deaths between Jan. 1, 1993 and Dec. 31, 2004.
Among them, seven were exported from China before 1993 and 18 were
exported after that, while 14 were born out of China. A total of 11
died during that time. The youngest died at birth and the oldest at
27 years old.</P>
      <P>Leofoo Village proposed that the importation of pandas could be
dealt with by a Chinese cultural association while the National
Pingtung University of Science and Technology could provide them care
and help with breeding techniques, according to a mutual contract
they signed.</P>
      <P>Leofoo also said it can also provide China NT$35 million annually
as a "panda protection fund" and NT$18 million as a local panda
breeding fund.</P>
      <P>The COA said that they need to collect more information before
making a decision.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
called on the media Thursday to stop asking him questions about the
possibility of him heading the next Cabinet.</P>
      <P>He also denied speculation that if he cooperates with the

      <P>Wang is a Kuomintang (KMT) member. The KMT and the People First

      <P>Wang said if the rumors about his possible defection to the

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHAIRMAN CANDIDATE PROMISES TO PUSH FOR RENAMING COUNTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Trong Chai, one of the three
candidates in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
chairmanship by-election set for Jan. 15, said Thursday he will push
for renaming the country and redrawing the country's territorial
boundaries if he is elected.</P>
      <P>In a brief speech after drawing lots to determine the order of
candidates' names on the by-election ballot, the pro-independence
lawmaker said the party suffered defeat in the Dec. 3 local
government elections because of its failure to emphasize Taiwan's
identity and maintain a clean administration.</P>
      <P>In order to address the two problems, Chai said he would push for
renaming the country as "Taiwan" and redrawing the country's
boundaries to include only Taiwan proper and the outlying islands of
Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>Also, Chai said he would require DPP public officials and
lawmakers to entrust their assets to financial institutions and
subject the assets to investigation if they increased unreasonably.</P>
      <P>In a jab at his leading rival in the race, Yu Shyi-kun, Chai said
Yu disappointed him and many of his like-minded DPP members by ruling
out the possibility of renaming the country and redefining its
territorial boundaries in the country's ongoing second-phase
constitutional reform.</P>
      <P>Chai was referring to Yu's remarks in a meeting with DPP
lawmakers in Taipei three months ago when Yu, who was Presidential
Office secretary-general at the time, gave a briefing on President
Chen Shui-bian's plan for constitutional reform.</P>
      <P>On a sperate occasion in the Legislative Yuan Thursday, Chai also
promised to push for a national referendum on the arms procurement
budget and for enactment of a bill to force the Kuomintang to return
its "ill-gotten assets, " as well as a referendum on the abolishment
of elections for chiefs of urban and rural townships.</P>
      <P>Flanked by a group of pro-independence activists, Chai said at a
news conference that there is no way the United States will help
Taiwan to ward off an attack from China if Taiwan has no willingness
to defend itself by acquiring the necessary defensive arms.</P>
      <P>The budget for the arms procurement has been blocked by the
opposition in the legislature for more than one year.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Wu Rong-i said Thursday that
Taiwan's economy is in good shape and that the public needs to have
confidence in the nation.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks while delivering a speech in Taichung,
central Taiwan at the annual meeting of the Chinese Water Resources
Management Society in his capacity as president of the society.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan's economy has rebounded, Wu expressed the
hope that people will stop being pessimistic about the nation's
economic performance.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's economy began to slow down in May 2000 when
the global economy was experiencing a downturn, Wu said that as the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) came to power at that time, some
have blamed Taiwan's economic problems on what they call the DPP's
lack of talent or incompetence in running the nation.</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that after negative growth in 2001, Taiwan's
economy rebounded to show positive growth the following year and has
since maintained growth of around 4 percent or above.</P>
      <P>"The figures clearly show that Taiwan's economy has rebounded,
although some still cling to the old memory of 2001 and continue to
be pessimistic about the nation's economy," he said.</P>
      <P>"In terms of economic growth, the unemployment rate and the
annual increase in the consumer price index, Taiwan's economy is in
good shape," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, Taiwan's economic performance next year should be
even better, Wu said, adding that economic growth should reach 4.5
percent, the jobless rate will likely be reduced to 4 percent, and
the annual increase in the consumer price index is expected to be
maintained at 2 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT AIMING AT FISCAL BALANCE BY 2011: FINANCE MINISTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the government's fiscal status having
improved significantly as the economy has recovered, the government
will continue financial reforms with the goal of achieving fiscal
balance by 2011, Finance Ministry officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks in response to a report released
Wednesday by the Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services, in which
Taiwan's sovereign credit ratings outlook remained "negative, " on
the grounds that Taiwan's fiscal position is expected to remain
"vulnerable to politics and a lower growth trend" and that "fiscal
reform measures are still insufficient to address longer-term
budgetary pressures."</P>
      <P>The officials pointed out that the government has since April 22,
2003 implemented financial reforms consisting of 60 short-term,
medium-term and long-term measures, 29 of which have displayed
substantial accomplishments.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the recovering economy, the government received NT$53.2
billion in excess of the target revenue amount in 2004, the first
time since 1999 that the revenues have reached the target, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>In 2005, the revenues received by the government had accounted
for 107.6 percent of the target amount as of the end of November,
with approximately NT$110 billion in excess of the target amount
expected for the whole year, they said.</P>
      <P>The increase in revenues, together with the government's
belt-tightening measures, is expected to narrow the 2005 fiscal
deficit to NT$125 billion, compared with the NT$274.7 billion
previously projected by the government, they said.</P>
      <P>As to the budget plan for 2006, which is currently being reviewed
by the Legislative Yuan, the growth of the projected expenses is
minus 0.5 percent, while the growth of the projected revenues is 5.3
percent, they said.</P>
      <P>The decrease in projected expenses and increase in projected
revenues have thus controlled the projected deficit below NT$200
billion, they said.</P>
      <P>They predicted that government debts payable will amount to
NT$3.9 trillion at the end of 2006, accounting for 35.6 percent of
the average gross national product (GNP) for the previous three
years. This will mean an increase of 1.3 percentage points from the
34.3 percent for 2005, which will be the lowest increase rate in four
years, they added.</P>
      <P>They continued that the taxation reforms currently being carried
out by the government, which include the introduction of minimum
income tax rates targeting high-income earners, will help enhance tax
fairness and ensure the stability of government revenue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUAPAN, KRTC RECEIVE 'HITTER AWARD' FOR TRAMPLING HUMAN RIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Association for Human Rights
(TAHR) awarded the ignominious "hitter award" to Huapan
Administration Consultant Co. and Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp.
(KRTC) Thursday to underscore their records in trampling Thai
workers' human rights.</P>
      <P>TAHR President Wu Hao-jen announced the association's
"ten-plus-one top human rights stories of 2005" and winners of the
"Orz awards for trampling human rights."</P>
      <P>Wu said the stories and "awards" are aimed at ensuring the
protection of human rights, but he added that this cannot be achieved
if the government and society do not stop violating people's human
rights.</P>
      <P>Huapan and KRTC were not the only ones to receive this year's
"hitter award" in the "Orz" category. Formosa Plastics and a few
notorious labor brokers were also given the "award" for their role in
violating foreign workers' human rights.</P>
      <P>Gil Lebria, a Filipino worker who had worked at Formosa Plastics'
Mailiao, Yunlin County plant, told his story at the TAHR press
conference Thursday.</P>
      <P>He said that after he was beaten by the factory's security
guards, the management did not send him to hospital. Instead, he and
15 other maltreated co-workers were sent back to their home
countries.</P>
      <P>It was only with funds donated by civic groups that he was able
to file a lawsuit against the security guards who had hit him, Lebria
said.</P>
      <P>In connection with foreign workers' human rights violations, TAHR
presented a "black hand award" to the Council for Labor Affairs (CLA)
for its poor foreign workers policy and lousy supervision of their
management.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health received an "unwashed hand award" for
its discriminatory AIDS patients policy that bans them from donating
blood and for its failure to educate the public about respecting the
medical rights of the disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>Police and prosecution authorities as well as the Government
Information Office (GIO) received the "cradle-overthrowing hand
award" for repressing freedom of speech by cracking down on the
publishing of "unusual DVDs" during the Dec. 3 elections and other
violations of civil liberties.</P>
      <P>Wu said that in Taiwan, there are still quite a few "heavy-handed
and totalitarian" policies and institutions. For example, he said,
the controversy over relocating a leprosarium in Xinzhuang, Taipei
County is a case of a minority group whose human rights were violated
when the interests of the minority could not withstand the onslaught
of the majority interests.</P>
      <P>He said the controversy over fingerprinting all citizens in order
to set up a police data bank is an example of the majority interests
being encroached upon by an institution.</P>
      <P>The TAHR's 10-plus-one top human rights stories were the
controversy over fingerprinting, foreign workers policy, domestic
violence, infringements on the freedom of speech and thought, the law
on assembly, sexual discrimination, banning students from choosing
their hair styles and corporal punishment on campus, discrimination
against patients of certain diseases, ecological murderers,
abolishing capital punishment, and relocation of the Xinzhuang
leprosarium.</P>
      <P>TAHR is a non-governmental organization committed to securing
human rights and preventing human rights violations. TAHR believes
that human rights, the rule of law, and democracy are indivisible and
interdependent.</P>
      <P>TAHR's campaigns have focused on investigating individual human
rights cases and assisting victims, monitoring the government's
policy-making and development, proposing legal and constitutional
amendments so as to meet international human rights standards, and
promoting human rights consciousness and education.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan computer makers are suggested to
shift their attention to Vietnam for the country's potential demand
for their products and its cheap labor, according to a recent report
by the Market Intelligence Center under the Institute for Information
Industry (III).</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan is Vietnam's largest foreign investor, but
Taiwan investments mainly go to traditional businesses, the report
said, pointing out that the Vietnamese information and communication
technologies (ICT) market actually provides many good opportunities
for Taiwan ICT companies thanks to its government's open policies
since 1986.</P>
      <P>According to the report, it is estimated that demand for desktop
and notebook computers in Vietnam next year will reach around 1.13
million units, including some 1.02 million desktop computers and over
100,000 notebook computers -- a combined 21.5 percent growth over the
2005 figure.</P>
      <P>At a time when Taiwan computer makers in China are worried about
overcapacity since the ICT business has become saturated since 2000,
Taiwan companies should consider shifting to Vietnam, where political
stability, cheap labor and strong market demand are its advantages,
the report said, noting that monthly salaries for Vietnamese workers
average NT$2,500, lower than China's NT$4,000 (US$120).</P>

      <P>Taiwan and Japan both have a good chance of
doing well in next spring's baseball tournament, with Taiwan's
fine stable of players and baseball legend Sadaharu Oh managing the
Japanese side, President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he received Oh at the

Japanese mother and holds an ROC passport.</P>
      <P>Oh is scheduled to be the manager of the Japanese team in the
upcoming World Baseball Classic, which will be held in Japan, Porto
Rico and finally in San Diego, the United States.</P>
      <P>Born in 1940, Oh was a former player and manager for Japanese
baseball's most famous team, the Yomiuri Giants.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the president said he admired Oh and lauded
the many contributions that he has made to the sport, as well as his
work to promote closer relations between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>Oh retired in 1980 at age 40 with a world record 868 career home

ought to be interesting to watch.</P>
      <P>The World Baseball Classic will be held March 3-20, with 18
teams, including Taiwan, Japan, Cuba, and the United States

    <HEADLINE>YU SAYS IF ELECTED DPP CHAIRMAN HE WILL STRESS COORDINATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, one of the candidates for
chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , said
Thursday that he will strengthen policy coordination between the DPP
and the government once elected party leader.</P>
      <P>Yu, who quit his job as secretary-general of the Presidential
Office recently to vie for the DPP chairmanship, stressed that the
DPP should keep presenting reform projects and make the
administration fully understand the direction of the party.</P>
      <P>Former DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang stepped down from his job
earlier this month to take responsibility for the party's defeat in
the Dec. 3 "three-in-one" elections, and Vice President Annette Lu
was named to serve as acting chairwoman of the DPP. The DPP won only
six of the 23 city mayor and county magistrate posts being contested,
far behind the 14 won by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>The election for the new DPP chairman is Jan. 15.</P>
      <P>Yu stressed that the DPP has played an important role as a
reformer during the last 20 years by advocating the lifting of the
ban on the formation of new political parties and by pushing for a
free press and the direct election of the president. These led to
open and fair public elections in Taiwan. The DPP has also made
progress in fostering women's participation in politics, he added.</P>
      <P>However, Yu added, the party has lost its luster after taking the
helm of the country for five years. Chen Shui-bian of the DPP was
voted into office as president in 2000, ending the nearly 55-year
rule of the KMT.</P>
      <P>Yu said many current problems lie in the unclear relationship
between the party and the administration. Once elected DPP chairman,
Yu stressed that he will re-define this relationship.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP has never been dictatorial, Yu said the party
should not be limited to just being an "election-driven entity, "
stressing that he will strengthen reforms and make the party a kind
of think tank for the government.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will accept nothing less than a
bilateral currency clearance agreement with China before it will
offer the currency exchange service for the Chinese yuan in Taiwan,
Mainland Affairs Council Minister Joseph Wu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a joint conference of the Ethnic Committee and the

for the yuan with the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of China and
starting the exchange services before any clearance agreement is
concluded with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Wu said an agreement is not only required by law but also
necessary for the financial security of the country, noting that
billions of yuan could flow into Taiwan once the exchange service
begins and it could jeopardize the security of the country's finances
if China refuses to clear them.</P>
      <P>The clearance agreement is being blocked by Beijing's refusal to
talk with Taipei over political differences despite the close trade

      <P>A 47-year-old man living in Houpi
township of Tainan County was arrested Thursday on charges of
counterfeiting Chinese banknotes and is being prosecuted.</P>
      <P>Tsai Tung-lo, a spokesman for the Tainan County Station of the
Bureau of Investigation said that Huang Chao-sheng, who had been
convicted of counterfeiting Chinese banknotes in June and sentenced
to five years in jail by a district court, was again caught
manufacturing the new version of the Chinese currency, which came out
in September.</P>
      <P>Investigators raided Huang's residence early Thursday and found
that he had turned the first and second floors of his home into a
money-printing factory and was managing the whole production process
single-handedly.</P>
      <P>The investigators seized one million yuan in completed fake notes
and more than half a million in semi-finished notes. They also
confiscated three currency-printing machines, more than a dozen
various other machines and computers.</P>
      <P>The forged currency -- all 100 yuan banknotes -- bear a strong
resemblance to genuine bills, even down to the surface-relief
holograms.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the fake money was apparently intended to be supplied
to buyers from smuggling rings for use during the Chinese Lunar New
Year holiday when new banknotes will be in big demand.</P>
      <P>This is the first currency-counterfeiting case in Taiwan
involving the new 100 yuan Chinese banknotes, which even many people

    <HEADLINE>TAICHUNG MAYOR UNDECIDED WHETHER TO SUE  PRESIDENT OVER HEALTH REMARK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said Thursday he
is still undecided as to whether he will sue President Chen Shui-bian
for damaging his reputation during campaigning before the Dec. 3
election.</P>
      <P>Hu, a member of the opposition Kuomintang, was re-elected despite
negative campaigning against him by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , particularly instances where the DPP -- and the
president himself -- alluded to the fact that Hu had had a mild
stroke previously and wondered if this made him unfit to be mayor.</P>
      <P>Hu said that the president is still on his shortlist of people he
is considering taking legal action against.</P>
      <P>During campaigning for DPP Taichung mayoral candidate Lin
Chia-lung, Chen asked Taichung residents to support Lin, since Hu
could "drop dead at any time."</P>
      <P>Hu said Thursday that Chen's remarks had seriously damaged his
reputation and he should file a lawsuit against the president for
compensation for the benefit of his supporters.</P>
      <P>The point of this, Hu stressed, would be to inspire the country's
politicians to refrain from running off at the mouth and making false
accusations during campaigning, a time that no one should think of as
a "holiday from the law."</P>
      <P>During the height of the campaigning, 12 medical doctors in the
Taichung area even came forward at a news conference to denigrate
Hu's health with what they claimed was Hu's medical records in an
attempt to thwart Hu's re-election by saying that he might not be
healthy enough for the post.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A woman's dream of bearing her late
fiance's child, using frozen sperm harvested after his death, was
shattered Thursday when a clinic in Taichung destroyed the sperm at
the insistence of the family of the diseased man, despite the woman's
repeated pleas not to do so.</P>
      <P>Li Hsin-yu, 29, lost her fiance, Capt. Sun Chi-hsiang, a
29-year-old ROC Army company leader who died in September, in an
accident while guiding an armored tank unto a truck. Sun's sperm was
harvested 68 hours after his death when health authorities and Sun's
family agreed to Li's plea that she wanted to bear Sun's child via in
vitro fertilization.</P>
      <P>However, last weekend the Sun family notified the clinic where
the sperm had been kept frozen that they wanted the sperm destroyed.
They also told Li that the Sun family changed their minds and that
she should look forward to a new life and leave the past behind.</P>
      <P>With lawyers serving as witnesses, an obstetrician removed the 14
vials of sperm preserved in liquid nitrogen at minus 196 degrees
Celsius, thus rendering them inert.</P>
      <P>Li's wish of keeping one vial of the destroyed sperm as something
to remember her late fiance by was flatly rejected by the Sun family.</P>
      <P>The Sun family also refused a request from the clinic that they
donate the sperm for medical research to examine whether the DNA in
the sperm remained intact and whether the vitality of the sperm was
affected.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PREPARING FALLBACK DRUG IN FIGHT AGAINST AVIAN FLU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI) announced Thursday that it is working to produce a
well-known anti-influenza drug in the fight against avian flu.</P>
      <P>Tamiflu, which doctors say could be the most effective treatment
against avian flu, was found by a study published in the New England
Journal of Medicine to have been ineffectual in four of eight
patients treated in Vietnam who died of the disease.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, the ITRI is trying to produce a form of
Relenza, the trade name of a drug marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, for
the treatment of influenza A and B.</P>
      <P>Although the World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the
apparent resistant to Tamiflu is nothing to be concerned about, the
ITRI wants to be prepared.</P>
      <P>"Whenever you use any kind of drugs, antivirals or antibiotics,
you expect to see resistance develop in organs. Finding some
resistance in and of itself is not surprising and is not necessarily
alarming, " Keiji Fukuda, an expert at the WHO's global influenza
program told Reuters.</P>
      <P>The WHO has suggested that Relenza could be one of the drugs
effective in fighting avian flu. Hospitals in Germany and the United
Kingdom have begun to stockpile Relenza.</P>
      <P>Huang Chong-hsiung, a spokesman for the ITRI said the institute
is already capable of mastering the technique to produce Relenza as
well as its important component, sialic acid.</P>
      <P>Huang said the ITRI has been capable of making sialic acid since
1998 or 1999. However, Relenza is less convenient than Tamiflu
because it is a powder, and is inhaled. Relenza is not officially
available in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su Shin-san, the head of the ITRI's Biomedical Center, said that
the effects of Relenza are similar to those of Tamiflu; if taken
within 48 hours of the onset of flu symptoms, it should be effective.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DETAINEE'S FRIEND 100% SURE NTU STUDENT DID NOT ASSAULT HK POLICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A graduate school student who went with
National Taiwan University student Lee Chien-cheng to Hong Kong last
week to observe the Asian farmers' protests against the World Trade
Organization (WTO) talks in Hong Kong said Thursday that he is 100
percent sure that Lee did not attack police and Lee was not involved
in any violent activities in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Lee, a senior with NTU's Department of Political Sciences, was
arrested by Hong Kong police Dec. 18 and later charged with unlawful
assembly in the former British colony.</P>
      <P>Lee Che-yu, a student with Shih Hsin University's Institute of
Social Development, said during an exclusive interview with CNA
Thursday that he was with Lee Chien-cheng all the time after they
arrived in Hong Kong Dec. 12, and they were there mainly to record
how Asian farmers lodged their protests during the WTO meetings until
the early morning of Dec. 18.</P>
      <P>Lee Che-yu said that Lee Chien-cheng, himself, Kuan Chen-yin, a
classmate of his, and Chang Li-pen, a doctorate candidate with
Tunghai University, were taking part in a peaceful march near Hong
Kong's Victoria Park at noon on Dec. 17.</P>
      <P>The police cordoned off the street before they knew it and they
were held on the street without any pre-warning. Hungry and without
warm clothes, they proceeded to the cordon line in the small hours of
Dec. 18 and asked to leave. The Hong Kong police then arrested all of
them and whisked them to a police station.</P>
      <P>He said that until this day, he still has no idea why the Hong
Kong police should have arrested the four of them and for what
reasons the Hong Kong police detained and charged Lee Chien-cheng
while releasing the other three.</P>
      <P>Lee Che-yu said that he guarantees with his life that Lee
Chien-cheng was in a peaceful march and was not among the
1,000-strong rioters who were accused of assaulting and battering
Hong Kong police during anti-globalization protests at the WTO talks
on Dec. 17.</P>
      <P>Lee Che-yu added that they had not been offered any help or
assistance by Republic of China officials stationed in Hong Kong
until they were released and departed the Chinese special
administrative district for home Dec. 20.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition Kuomintang Legislator Ting Shou-chung said
in Hong Kong Thursday that he visited Lee Chien-cheng at a Hong Kong
detention center earlier in the day and believes that an "optimistic
result" should be apparent Friday when a Hong Kong court reviews
Lee's case.</P>
      <P>Ting, a lecturer with the NTU Department of Political Sciences
who traveled to Hong Kong Wednesday for a meeting, said that he
accompanied Lee Chien-cheng's parents and an NTU professor as well as
a couple of Taiwan officials stationed in Hong Kong on a visit to Lee
at the detention center Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ting said that Lee's physical condition seemed to be good and Lee
told him that he did not attack or assault any Hong Kong police Dec.
17.</P>
      <P>In the past, the Hong Kong authorities have dealt with protesters
or demonstrators by imposing fines or having them do social services.</P>
      <P>Lee's arrest in Hong Kong has stirred up indignation among
Taiwan's students. Dozens of college students began a sit-in in front
of the NTU's main gate Wednesday to protest against the Hong Kong
authorities for arresting and detaining Lee. The sit-in has continued
for 30 hours as of press time Thursday night.</P>
      <P>The students urged the Beijing and Hong Kong authorities to
respect the principles of democracy and human rights and release Lee
immediately.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOUTH KOREA IS TAIWAN'S REAL RIVAL, NOT CHINA: BUSINESS LEADER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>South Korea, not China, is the leading
rival of Taiwan companies, and local businesses should forge
cooperative ventures with Chinese enterprises to create a broader
footprint, a business leader said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar at National Taiwan University, Matthew F.
C. Miau, chairman of Mitac International Corporation, opined that
Taiwan and China should be partners rather than competitors because
South Korea is the real adversary.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Chinese businesses should align to take on the
challenges from South Korean companies, Miau said, explaining that
China can provide a cheap production force for Taiwan to gain
handsome orders from big customers.</P>
      <P>Miau also urged the government to ease its cap on China-bound
investments by Taiwan companies, saying that the current restrictions
will only drive domestic businesses into a blind alley.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businesses are full of vigor and the government should not
restrict their potential and hobble their advantages with unnecessary
limits, he said, adding that even Hong Hai Precision Machinery Corp.,
which is Taiwan's largest company in the manufacturing sector, would
find no way out if the government is not willing to remove this
roadblock.</P>
      <P>This will also drag down foreign investors interested in Taiwan
if Taiwan's economy is not perceived as free and open, he contended.</P>
      <P>Taiwan companies are now banned from investing more than 40
percent of their capital in China -- a restriction that the business
community has repeatedly called on the government to phase out.</P>
      <P>In the face of Taiwan's declining exports as a result of local
companies' mass relocations to China, sharpening global
competitiveness and building up company scales are the two major
tasks testing Taiwan businesses, said experts attending a symposium
later the same day.</P>
      <P>At a time when Taiwan's export sector is increasingly
diminishing, it is important that domestic enterprises think of new
business directions, experts advised.</P>
      <P>Pointing to South Korea as an example, they said that it has
surpassed Taiwan in research and development, helping it overtake
Taiwan in terms of foreign trade. It enjoys a snowballing trade
surplus with Taiwan that has amounted to US$7 billion for the first
11 months of this year.</P>
      <P>Although the new Taiwan dollar has slid to about 33.3 against the
U.S. dollar to help exporters, economists warned that Taiwan
industries would be in greater danger if they fail to improve their
competitive edge and do not come up with a visionary business
development strategy amid the rapidly changing international
situations.</P>
      <P>When flagging exports become commonplace, no foreign investors
will want to invest in Taiwan, they asserted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MA, SOONG CONTINUE OPPOSING MILITARY PURCHASE AT 'EXORBITANT PRICES'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The leaders of Taiwan's two main opposition
parties reiterated Thursday that while they believe the nation needs
to maintain appropriate defense capabilities, they remain opposed to
the plan of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to procure weapons
at what they said were "exorbitant prices."</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and People First Party
(PFP) Chairman James Soong reached this consensus at their second
meeting since the DPP's humiliating defeat in the Dec. 3 local
government elections.</P>
      <P>Emerging from the meeting, Soong pointed out that the PFP has
been opposed to buying weapons at exorbitant prices for quite some
time.</P>
      <P>"Why must we spend US$1 billion to purchase submarines from the
U.S. that would cost other countries only US$300 million? And why
does the DPP government use a special budget to dodge oversight by
the legislature?" he asked.</P>
      <P>Soong reminded the Americans that if they want to help Taiwan
develop its defense capabilities, they should sell Taiwan new
weapons, not outdated ones. He added that although Taiwan must
demonstrate its determination to defend itself, the United States
must also show equal determination to help Taiwan defend itself.</P>
      <P>The PFP chairman urged the DPP government to make clear to the
people whether it intends to settle the cross-Taiwan Strait issue by
war or by peaceful means. "If it is to be settled by war, I would say
frankly: 'We are not China's match.'"</P>
      <P>Ma said that the nation needs adequate defense capabilities,
which do not have to come from the three proposed categories of the
procurement plan.</P>
      <P>The DPP government has submitted two bills in the legislature
seeking approval for a NT$480 billion (US$14.45 billion) special
budget to purchase eight diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC
III anti-missile batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine
aircraft from the United States. However, the "pan-blue alliance" of
the KMT and the PFP has blocked the legislation 41 times.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ENVOY HOPES ROC-JAPAN TIES CAN BE INSTITUTIONALIZED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Representative to Japan Koh Se-kai said
Thursday that he saw an improvement in Taiwan-Japan ties in the last
year, but hopes that such relations can be institutionalized in the
future.</P>
      <P>At a meeting with Taiwanese reporters, Koh noted that the biggest
improvement in bilateral ties has been the Japanese government's
offering permanent visa-free treatment to Taiwanese tourists starting
from this September.</P>
      <P>Noting that the number of Taiwanese tourists traveling to Japan
is expected to exceed 1.3 million this year, Koh said the number of
Japanese travelers visiting Taiwan has topped 1.1 million so far this
year.</P>
      <P>Although the exchange channels between Taiwan and Japan are not
weak, the fact is that they are not institutionalized like the ties
between Japan and the United States under a security alliance and the
relations between Taiwan and U.S., which are managed by the Taiwan
Relations Act, Koh stressed.</P>
      <P>Koh said he was happy to see that some Japanese scholars are
planning to promote a Taiwan-Japan Relations Act in Japan.</P>
      <P>Referring to the Japanese government's move of classifying
Taiwanese people living in Japan as China's citizens, Koh said this
will not only cause inconvenience to Taiwanese people, but will
affect their legal rights.</P>
      <P>However, Koh said he has confidence a solution to the problem
will be found.</P>
      <P>As to the long-term fishing rights dispute between Taiwan and
Japan over their overlapping economic zones, Koh urged both
governments to seek solutions.</P>
      <P>As to the decision by the International Commission for the
Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) to cut Taiwan's bigeye tuna
fishing quota in the Atlantic Ocean from 14,900 tons in 2005 to 4,600
tons for next year, under the proposal by Japan which claimed that
Taiwanese tuna fishing boats were overfishing, Koh noted that the
solution to the problem lies in the self-control of each country.</P>
      <P>He urged fishing boats around the world to respect international
regulations to further protect the world's marine resources.</P>
      <P>Koh went on to say that with many anti-Japanese protests in
China, Japan now has no more illusions about China, as it is now
aware that China is not an ordinary country in which Japan can expect
changes through long-term engagement.</P>
      <P>However, with China's obstruction, Koh said it is impossible to
imagine that Taiwan can join the proposed "East Asian Community, "
which may include the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China,
Japan and South Korea.</P>

      <P>Allowing more foreign workers into Taiwan
will not be considered at least for the next six months to protect
the interests of domestic workers, Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
Chairman Lee Ying-yuan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee was responding to a call made by Minister of Economic Affairs
Ho Mei-yueh recently for increasing the number of foreign workers
to work in Taiwan's industrial sector, particularly in
the "3K" industries -- referring to those sectors where work is
"dirty, " "dangerous," or demands "hard labor."</P>
      <P>Lee said that 20,000 foreign workers will be allowed to be
introduced into Taiwan next year for certain manufacturing jobs in 19
industries to help boost Taiwan industries' international
competitiveness. He added that the 20,000-head quota will be
allocated in two phases in a ratio of two foreign workers for every
three domestic workers in "3K" sectors.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 2:3 worker format will be implemented for one

Wall Street Journal: Second Chance,
Once-Touted Drug For Cancer Finds New Life in
China

In the 1960s, pioneer researcher Judah
Folkman first came up with the idea of treating 
cancer by choking off tumors' blood supply. He
was largely vindicated in February 2004 when
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved
Avastin, a cancer drug based on this principle.
But Avastin is sold by Genentech Inc. Shortly
before Avastin's approval, EntreMed, the
small company making the drug, gave up on 
Folkman's own discovery, a drug called
endostatin. Today, the entrepreneurial Chinese
biochemist believes he has rescued Dr. Folkman's
dream. Luo Yongzhang, who teaches in Tsinghua
University and owns a company, says an
improved version of the drug, developed by his
company, has shown promising results in Chinese
human trials, and he hopes to bring it to
patients in the U.S. Dr. Luo says his new drug, 
which he calls Endostar, "could be a revolution,
and the Chinese government recognizes this." He 
says his company is in talks with several major 
U.S. pharmaceutical companies about licensing 
Endostar, which was approved by Chinese 
authorities in October, for use in the U.S. He 
declines to name the companies.</TEXT>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) is
willing to adjust its budget planning in order to win legislative

military official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Gen. Hu Chen-pu, director of the MND's Political Warfare

big-ticket weaponry items from the United States, including eight
diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C Orion
anti-submarine warfare aircraft and six Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile
batteries.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its "pan-green"

      <P>The MND originally intended to have all three items financed by a

listed the six anti-missile batteries in its 2006 regular budget plan
while leaving only the remaining two items in a NT$480 billion
special budget plan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a year-end tea party with military journalists
Thursday, Hu said the MND is now considering having the P-3Cs
included in the military's regular annual budget, too.</P>
      <P>Hu said the MND's bottom line is to have the submarines retained
in the special budget plan to meet the U.S. requirement. The eight
submarines will call for an estimated outlay of NT$299 billion.</P>
      <P>"This is our internal plan and we'll further consult with
lawmakers from across the political spectrum to better understand
their opinions and seek their support for the critical procurement
project," Hu said.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, the military cannot lump all the three items
into its regular annual budget plan because such a practice would
drain funds for other military build-up plans.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE MUM ON NEW PROPOSAL FOR CONTROL YUAN MAKEUP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office kept mum Thursday
on an opposition proposal on the makeup of the Control Yuan, the
nation's supreme watchdog body.</P>
      <P>Under the current ROC Constitution, Control Yuan members are
appointed by the president with the consent of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian referred a list of Control Yuan nominees
to the legislature in November 2004. The opposition-controlled
legislature had refused to review it. Earlier this week, the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally called a snap-vote on
putting the list on the legislative agenda for review after
opposition lawmakers were away at another meeting and did not have
their usual majority.</P>
      <P>The heads of the two opposition "pan-blue alliance" parties --
Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and People First Party Chairman
James Soong -- came up with a proposal for resolving the gridlock
after their long closed-door meeting.</P>
      <P>They suggested that the Control Yuan seats be filled up with a
formula adopted in the formation of the National Communications
Commission (NCC) , under which political parties first recommend
celebrities to form a screening committee to review Control Yuan
nominees to be put forward by political parties in proportion to
their representation in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on this new proposal, Chen Wen-tzung, director
of the Presidential Office's Public Affairs Department, said
President Chen would not respond for the time being.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOUTH KOREA IS TAIWAN'S REAL RIVAL, NOT CHINA: BUSINESS LEADER(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>South Korea, not China, is the leading
rival of Taiwan companies, and local businesses should forge
cooperative ventures with Chinese enterprises to create a broader
footprint, a business leader said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar at National Taiwan University, Matthew F.
C. Miau, chairman of Mitac International Corporation, opined that
Taiwan and China should be partners rather than competitors because
South Korea is the real adversary.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Chinese businesses should align to take on the
challenges from South Korean companies, Miau said, explaining that
China can provide a cheap production force for Taiwan to gain
handsome orders from big customers.</P>
      <P>Miau also urged the government to ease its cap on China-bound
investments by Taiwan companies, saying that the current restrictions
will only drive domestic businesses into a blind alley.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businesses are full of vigor and the government should not
restrict their potential and hobble their advantages with unnecessary
limits, he said, adding that even Hong Hai Precision Machinery Corp.,
which is Taiwan's largest company in the manufacturing sector, would
find no way out if the government is not willing to remove this
roadblock.</P>
      <P>This will also drag down foreign investors interested in Taiwan
if Taiwan's economy is not perceived as free and open, he contended.</P>
      <P>Taiwan companies are now banned from investing more than 40
percent of their capital in China -- a restriction that the business
community has repeatedly called on the government to phase out.</P>
      <P>In the face of Taiwan's declining exports as a result of local
companies' mass relocations to China, sharpening global
competitiveness and building up company scales are the two major
tasks testing Taiwan businesses, said experts attending a symposium
later the same day.</P>
      <P>At a time when Taiwan's export sector is increasingly
diminishing, it is important that domestic enterprises think of new
business directions, experts advised.</P>
      <P>Pointing to South Korea as an example, they said that it has
surpassed Taiwan in research and development, helping it overtake
Taiwan in terms of foreign trade. It enjoys a snowballing trade
surplus with Taiwan that has amounted to US$7 billion for the first
11 months of this year.</P>
      <P>Although the new Taiwan dollar has slid to about 33.3 against the
U.S. dollar to help exporters, economists warned that Taiwan
industries would be in greater danger if they fail to improve their
competitive edge and do not come up with a visionary business
development strategy amid the rapidly changing international
situations.</P>
      <P>When flagging exports become commonplace, no foreign investors
will want to invest in Taiwan, they asserted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MA, SOONG CONTINUE OPPOSING MILITARY PURCHASE AT 'EXORBITANT PRICES'(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The leaders of Taiwan's two main opposition
parties reiterated Thursday that while they believe the nation needs
to maintain appropriate defense capabilities, they remain opposed to
the plan of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to procure weapons
at what they said were "exorbitant prices."</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and People First Party
(PFP) Chairman James Soong reached this consensus at their second
meeting since the DPP's humiliating defeat in the Dec. 3 local
government elections.</P>
      <P>Emerging from the meeting, Soong pointed out that the PFP has
been opposed to buying weapons at exorbitant prices for quite some
time.</P>
      <P>"Why must we spend US$1 billion to purchase submarines from the
U.S. that would cost other countries only US$300 million? And why
does the DPP government use a special budget to dodge oversight by
the legislature?" he asked.</P>
      <P>Soong reminded the Americans that if they want to help Taiwan
develop its defense capabilities, they should sell Taiwan new
weapons, not outdated ones. He added that although Taiwan must
demonstrate its determination to defend itself, the United States
must also show equal determination to help Taiwan defend itself.</P>
      <P>The PFP chairman urged the DPP government to make clear to the
people whether it intends to settle the cross-Taiwan Strait issue by
war or by peaceful means. "If it is to be settled by war, I would say
frankly: 'We are not China's match.'"</P>
      <P>Ma said that the nation needs adequate defense capabilities,
which do not have to come from the three proposed categories of the
procurement plan.</P>
      <P>The DPP government has submitted two bills in the legislature
seeking approval for a NT$480 billion (US$14.45 billion) special
budget to purchase eight diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC
III anti-missile batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine
aircraft from the United States. However, the "pan-blue alliance" of
the KMT and the PFP has blocked the legislation 41 times.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SPEAKER CALLS FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO AVOID SHOWDOWN ON ARMS BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
called Friday for negotiations between the "pan-green camp" led by
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the "pan-blue
alliance" led by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in order to
avoid a showdown vote over the arms procurement bill.</P>
      <P>The bill was finally placed on the legislative agenda two days
ago when the "pan-green camp" pushed it through the Procedure
Committee. It was able to do so because fewer "pan-blue" members were
in attendance. Prior to Tuesday, the bill had been blocked by
"pan-blue" lawmakers 41 times over the past year.</P>
      <P>Both camps have now mobilized their legislators, with the
"pan-blue" lawmakers criticizing Tuesday's "surprise attack" and
threatening to send the bill back to the Procedure Committee for
further screening, in effect killing it. The "pan-green" legislators
are mobilizing to try to push the bill through to the first reading
at Friday's plenary session.</P>
      <P>The two camps exchanged harsh rhetoric during a national affairs
forum Friday, with "pan-green camp" lawmakers saying that the
opposition is threatening Taiwan's national security by trying to
block the bill, and "pan-blue" lawmakers insisting that they would
oppose the current "cash-for-friendship" arms package to the end and
would only accept a "reasonable" bill.</P>
      <P>Legislative speaker Wang, a KMT stalwart, said he keenly hopes
that legislators from the two rival camps can negotiate with each
other and arrive at a consensus at Friday's session in order to
prevent a showdown vote on the arms procurement bill.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense submitted the bill for the
purchase of six Patriot III anti-missile batteries, eight
conventional submarines and 12 P-3C Orion submarine-hunting aircraft
from the United States to the Legislative Yuan last year. The initial
price tag was NT$610.8 billion, but the ministry later reduced it to
NT$480 billion after the opposition lawmakers rejected the bill.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou breakfasted with members of
the legislative caucus of the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU)
Friday morning in an apparent attempt to seek the support of the
independent legislators in the "pan-blue alliance's" bid to block the
bill yet again.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, head of the KMT Central Policy Committee, said
after the breakfast that independent lawmakers will be on the side of
their "pan-blue alliance" colleagues to oppose to the bill.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lin Ping-kun, the NPSU legislative party whip, was
more reserved, saying that "we have our own opinions and judgment" on
various bills.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESS SOFTWARE MARKET TO CONTINUE GROWING: IDC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's enterprise resource management
(ERM) software market posted sales of US$21.1 million in the first
half of 2005, up 25 percent compared with the same period last year,
the International Data Corporation said Friday.</P>
      <P>The IDC forecast that the market will expand at a compound annual
growth rate of 4.9 percent to register sales of US$52.9 million by
2009.</P>
      <P>IDC Taiwan's software analyst Hsueh Ju-shan said the growth in
the first half of this year was mainly boosted by system replacement
and upgrading by large-size enterprises as well as the installation
of new systems by small- and medium-size enterprises.</P>
      <P>By function, fiscal application software seized the largest share
of the market during that period, at 25.6 percent, following by asset
management software and payroll management software, which took 18.4
percent and 16.2 percent, respectively, Hsueh said.</P>
      <P>The assembly and process manufacturing industries had the highest
demand for ERM software, with the two together accounting for 62.4
percent of the total sales, Hsueh said.</P>
      <P>Small- and medium-size enterprises' demand for ERM software is
forecast to continue to increase steadily, and they are expected to
become the main clients of software suppliers, Hsueh said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she said, the sales of business performance management
(BPM) software will surpass those of other application software in
the future with enterprises paying more and more attention to
performance and procedural management.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu said Friday that he keenly looks forward to a favorable
Hong Kong court ruling later in the day which will allow National
Taiwan University (NTU) student Lee Chien-cheng to be released
immediately.</P>
      <P>A Hong Kong court is scheduled to begin hearings at 2 p.m. Friday
for 14 people charged in last week's anti-World Trade Organization
protests.</P>
      <P>Lee, a senior in NTU's Department of Political Science, was among
the 14 protestors arrested Dec. 18 and later charged with unlawful
assembly. The 14 people charged include 11 Koreans, one Japanese
national, and a mainland Chinese citizen. They were all denied bail
and ordered detained by a Hong Kong judge. If convicted, they face a
maximum prison sentence of five years.</P>
      <P>Wu talked with Lee's father, who has traveled to Hong Kong to
support Lee, by cell phone Friday and told the senior Lee that the
MAC-assigned attorneys have prepared to secure his son's early
release.</P>
      <P>For his part, Lee Wen-ping said that he greatly appreciates the
"timely" assistance of the MAC and its staff posted in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Lee Che-yu, a graduate school student at Shih Hsin University's
Institute of Social Development who went with Lee Chien-cheng to Hong
Kong last week to observe the Asian farmers' protests against the WTO
talks in Hong Kong said Thursday in an exclusive interview with CNA
that he is 100-percent sure that Lee did not attack police and that
he was not involved in any violent activities in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>He said that to this day, he still has no idea why the Hong Kong
police should have arrested them or why they detained and charged Lee
Chien-cheng while releasing the other three Taiwan students who were
with Lee.</P>
      <P>Lee Che-yu said that he "guarantees with his life" that Lee
Chien-cheng only took part in a peaceful march and was not among the
1,000-strong rioters who were accused of assaulting and battering
Hong Kong police during anti-globalization protests at the WTO talks
on Dec. 17.</P>
      <P>Lee's arrest in Hong Kong has stirred up indignation among Taiwan
students. Dozens of college students began a sit-in in front of the
NTU's main gate Wednesday to protest Lee's arrest and detention.</P>
      <P>The students have urged the Beijing and Hong Kong authorities to
respect the principles of democracy and human rights and release Lee
immediately.</P>

      <P>Thai workers Mueangjan Phon, Meemak Saranyoo, Bopribun Suksan,
Kaeokone Baeng and others were indicted on charges of causing public
danger, theft and impeding the execution of public duty.</P>
      <P>Chang Juan-fang, an official of the Thai representative office in
Taiwan, observed the hearing.</P>
      <P>Hsu Ming-teh, attorney for the Thai accused, told the judges that
the prosecution's investigation reports cannot serve as evidence
because they were filled with hearsay and rumors.</P>
      <P>He noted that the investigators have obtained testimonies mostly
from Huapan's management, including a Thai, and that these managers
themselves were among the indicted as they were part of the reason
for the riot.</P>
      <P>Through interpreters, four accused Thai workers denied that they
had burned down the security guards' quarters at their dormitory and
the management office and set fire to some vehicles.</P>
      <P>They also denied hurling rocks at firefighters who were rushing
to the scene of the riot. They further denied that they had stolen
NT$750,000 (US$22,607) and 600,000 baht (US$14,659) from a safe.</P>
      <P>Huapan staff members, including general manager Yen Shih-hua,
manager Yang An-chi, Chung Huan-wei, Chen Jui-yuan, Shih Feng-jui,
Chen Kuo-an and Lee Yung-ao, were charged with gambling.</P>
      <P>Except for Chen Jui-yuan, who admitted to gambling, all of the
accused Huapan staff denied the charges against them. Chen is also
charged with impeding freedom.</P>
      <P>Chen said setting up gambling machines for Thai workers was his
"individual" decision. Yen and the other accused Huapan staff members
said they did not know anything about Chen running a gambling
business at the dormitory.</P>
      <P>After the hearing, Yen Shih-hua and Chang Juan-fang hurried away,
declining to reply to any media questions.</P>

      <P>The head of the Formosan Association
for Public Affairs (FAPA) said Thursday that to strengthen relations
between Taiwan and the United States, he will start with the
promotion of medical and health exchanges and the signing of a free
trade agreement between the two countries.</P>
      <P>New FAPA President Lee Chin-tai made the remarks in an interview
with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he is scheduled to lead a delegation to visit
Taiwan in February 2006. During his stay in Taiwan, he is expected to
call on related government officials.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, Lee said that his planned work will include
pushing for exchanges of visits by ranking officials of the two
countries, including Taiwan's president, premier and foreign affairs
minister, the strengthening of military cooperation, the signing of a
free trade agreement, and medical and health exchanges.</P>
      <P>Among the tasks, the promotion of exchanges of visits by ranking
officials will be the most difficult, while the promotion of medical

easier, he said.</P>
      <P>The FAPA, established in 1982, is a Washington, D.C.-based

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
the national identity disparity among the Taiwan people is posing the
greatest challenge to the country's security.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, only if the people have a clear idea as to who
is the country's biggest enemy will they be able to unite their
strength to establish a strong national defense system and overcome
natural and geographical restrictions to expand the depth of the
country's defense strategy.</P>
      <P>As long as the national identity disparity is resolved,
inter-party disagreements over the government's arms procurement
package with the United States will no longer exist, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a luncheon with a group of
presidential advisers. Earlier that day, legislators of the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and People First
Party sent the arms procurement bill back to the legislature's
Procedure Committee by voting to dismiss Friday's plenary session.</P>
      <P>"Pan-blue" lawmakers had barred the bill from being included in
the legislative agenda on 41 occasions over the past year. It was
finally placed on Friday's legislative agenda -- when it was supposed
to go through the first reading -- after the "pan-green" camp pushed
it through the Procedure Committee two days ago.</P>
      <P>The president said although the Taiwanese identity has become the
mainstream value in Taiwan society today, there are still more than
10 percent of the people who identify with the old national identity
that considers China to be their mother country.</P>
      <P>Chen said the spirit and value of integration of the European
Union can be a reference model, but not the only one, for the future
development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>He said the EU principles of sovereignty, parity, democracy and
peace are of great reference for Taiwan and China, pointing out that
all EU member nations accept each other as independent sovereign
states on equal footing.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan is willing to gradually
ease the current restrictions on China investments as long as the
National Security Council (NSC) agrees, Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD) Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks following a breakfast gathering sponsored by
the Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce with
business community leaders who asked the government to phase out the
present limits on investments allowed for Taiwan companies in China
in view of a string of incentives recently provided by China.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Premier Frank Hsieh has in principle agreed to
gradually remove the 40 percent cap on capital investment by Taiwan
companies in China, Hu quoted Hsieh as making it clear that it could
be possible only after the NSC has fully weighed the issue and gives
its approval.</P>
      <P>The local business community and economists have repeatedly
called on the government to permit Taiwan industries to invest in
China freely as Taiwan and China are complementary in taking on
aggressive competition from other countries.</P>
      <P>Mitac International Corporation Chairman Matthew F. C. Miau
called a day earlier for building a partnership between Taiwan and
Chinese companies on the grounds that South Korea is actually the No.

blind alley and would find no way out should the government be

    <HEADLINE>EU FORMULA A NEW PATH  FOR CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS: ACADEMIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following a European Union-style formula
could be a new way of thinking on the development of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations, an academic said Friday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a forum held at the Presidential Office marking
Constitution Day, which falls on Saturday, Chen Ming-tung, formerly a
vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, said
that seeking co-existence and co-prosperity with China under an EU
formula is one of the three policies that the government is following
to achieve its strategic goal regarding cross-strait relations -- a
normalized cross-strait relationship.</P>
      <P>In his speech, entitled "A new mindset of national security for a
democratized Taiwan, " Chen said he does not think the sitting
administration has maintained "wavering" mainland China policies as
criticized by some opposition politicians. On the contrary, he said,
the government's strategic goal of cross-strait relations is lucid --
seeking the normalization of relations.</P>
      <P>To achieve this goal, the administration has three major policies
-- consolidate a national consensus on Taiwan's status, stressing
that Taiwan is a sovereign state and its official designation is "the
Republic of China"; put forward a cross-strait "co-existence and
co-prosperity" vision, borrowing the EU formula as an example to
follow; and construct transitional arrangements which will facilitate
the materialization of the vision, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The "transitional arrangements" include that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait negotiate over the building of a cross-strait
interaction framework for peace and stability; that Taiwan continues
to enhance business and trade ties with China on principles of
"active opening and efficient management"; that Taiwan helps China
accelerate its democratization to solve the cross-strait
contradiction at its root, he added.</P>

(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fishermen in Hualien County are
angry about a report issued by the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) last weekend that advises people to eat less
large deep-sea fish to avoid high mercury levels in their bodies.</P>
      <P>Wang Min-chang, general-secretary of the Hualien Fishermen's
Association, said Friday that the report had caused fish prices to
plunge, and that the hardest-hit were large deep-sea fish, such as
marlin.</P>
      <P>He said the report had caused the fish market to become stagnant,
resulting in huge losses to fishermen who rely on selling their
catches for a living, because even at such low prices, consumers were
reluctant to buy.</P>
      <P>Wang urged the EPA to provide precise figures and other details
about the mercury levels in large deep-sea fish, or the fishermen in
Hualien County will not rule out a protest demonstration against the
administration.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, an EPA spokesman told news media that officials had
tried to communicate with representatives of the fishermen after
learning of the situation, and had obtained their understanding.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the EPA report was not targeted at
deep-sea fish, but was mainly intended to call people's attention to
the problem of mercury pollution.</P>
      <P>The EPA report, issued Sunday after a one-year study based on
1,066 samples, showed that the people in Taiwan have an average
mercury level of 2.4 milligrams per kilogram in their hair, slightly
higher than people in Japan and the United States.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Hualien County leads all other 22
counties and cities of Taiwan, with the average mercury content in
the hair of its people measured at 3.09 milligrams per kilogram.</P>
      <P>The report also said that the average mercury level in the hair
of people who have the habit of eating large deep-sea fish is six
times that of those who do not eat such fish.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>If the chip-making industry can integrate
solar energy to produce highly efficient solar cells, it will help
Taiwan reduce its dependency on imported energy, according to a think
tank.</P>
      <P>Chang Chien-yi, a department director of the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research (TIER) , said the production process involved in
developing low-cost solar cells have many common features as in
semiconductor production; in fact, some solar cell manufacturers are
studying how to use new chips and related technology to lower
production costs.</P>
      <P>Therefore, solar energy production can be a new business
opportunity for the chip industry, he added.</P>
      <P>If the chip-making industry can work well with the "green" energy
sector, it will not only open up a new horizon for the industry but
also create a great benefit for Taiwan, which is 99 percent reliant
on imported crude oil, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In a recent report forecasting the industrial trends from now
until 2015, TIER said memory chip and computer platform industries
seem to be on the decline, whereas bio-tech and Chinese medical
equipment are seen as potential areas for growth.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION GOING AGAINST THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE ON ARMS BILL: HSIEH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu and Mark Wolfe)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition's vote Friday to end a
meeting to discuss the controversial arms bill before it had really
even begun goes against the wishes of the electorate and is damaging
the efficacy of the legislative body, Premier Frank Hsieh said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The "green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and
the Taiwan Solidarity Union pushed the U.S. arms procurement bill
through the Procedures Committee Tuesday by virtue of the fact that
many opposition lawmakers were attending a different meeting, thus
relinquishing their majority.</P>
      <P>Since the regulations say that the bill under consideration
should be reviewed on the specific day requested, in this case Friday
only, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" rallied its forces to the
plenary session to make sure that no actual discussions took place.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the People
First Party (PFP) proposed that the meeting be dismissed shortly after
it started. A vote was taken and the "pan-blue alliance" easily had
the meeting ended by a vote of 113 to 100.</P>
      <P>Premier Hsieh pointed out that the "pan-blue alliance" had the
numbers to first discuss the bill and then vote it down Friday if
they had wanted, regardless of what was said during the session, but
instead they simply pulled the plug on the whole meeting.</P>
      <P>"The legislators in the majority could have easily just voted
down the bill, but they chose to cut off discussions of it
altogether. This must have been because they know that the public
supports the bill and it seems like the opposition was being
pressured by an invisible hand," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was referring to a Ministry of National Defense poll
released the previous day that indicated that about 70 percent of
respondents were in favor of having the bill discussed in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that almost 53 percent of the people
support the country acquiring the three defense items at issue. The
current version of the bill includes eight conventional
diesel-electric submarines, 12 P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft and
six PAC-3 Patriot anti-missile systems from the United States.</P>
      <P>The request for the weapons began in the mid-1990s, when the KMT
had ruling power. The U.S. government agreed to the arms package in
April 2001.</P>
      <P>Cho Jung-tai, a spokesman for the Executive Yuan, said that the
leaders of the "pan-blue alliance," KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and PFP
Chairman James Soong, are misrepresenting the will of the people by
their party's actions.</P>
      <P>"The two leaders of the opposition met twice to talk on a number
of issues, including the arms bill. The result of all this seems to
run counter to the will of the people. The executive branch regrets
that this is the way that they want to deal with the issue, " Cho
said.</P>
      <P>Defending the day's events, Legislative speaker Wang Jin-pyng
said that the meeting was ended entirely within the bounds of normal
procedure, adding that other sessions in the past had been abruptly
ended as well.</P>
      <P>Since ending the session effectively sends the bill back to the
Procedures Committee, which then must again vote whether to put the
bill back on the legislature's agenda for discussion, the arms
package is no closer to becoming law than it was over a year ago.</P>
      <P>The opposition-dominated Procedures Committee will meet again in
four days on Dec. 27.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Red Cross Society of the Republic of
China said on Friday that it has put the donations it collected for
tsunami relief for South Asia to good use, including a clean water
program in Indonesia and a housing reconstruction program in Sri
Lanka.</P>
      <P>Society officials made the comments in a new conference to report
on their relief work as the first anniversary of the killer tsunami
approaches on Dec. 26.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the society has collected NT$730 million
(US$21.79 million) in donations for tsunami relief and that about 97
percent of the money has been earmarked for various projects.</P>
      <P>In the next three to five years, the society will promote
employment, housing reconstruction and disaster prevention centers in
the affected areas.</P>
      <P>Society president C.V. Chen said that in view of the
unprecedented disaster, the reconstruction work in the affected areas
has been proceeding slowly.</P>
      <P>Taiwan experienced a massive 7.6 earthquake on Sept. 21, 1999 and
knows all too well the feeling of having come through a natural
disaster, Chen said.</P>
      <P>To help residents in the tsunami-affected areas return to a
normal life soon, the Red Cross Society is working on a clean water
program in Aceh province in Indonesia, and working with the Buddhist
group Dharma Drum Mountain Culture and Education Foundation to build
a "Taiwan village" in Sri Lanka.</P>
      <P>The first housing complex in the "Taiwan village" was completed
in September and has 300 low-income households. It will also build
550 fishing boats.</P>
      <P>Hau Lung-bin, secretary-general of the Red Cross Society, also
said that the donations from 200,000 people in Taiwan has shown the
world that Taiwan is a country that appreciates the kindness it was
shown during the Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake and wants to reciprocate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ONCE TRAMPLED, TAIWAN IDENTITY WILL BEGIN TO FLOURISH: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Friday deplored
the legacy of the Chinese Nationalists, who he claimed were "against
democracy and intellectualism, " and said that identification with
Taiwan will become deeply rooted in the country over time.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan identity grows, it is imperative for the government and
people to "actively carry out the spirit of constitutional democracy
and to maintain social unity," he said.</P>
      <P>Meeting a group of presidential advisers over lunch, Chen said
that after the Chinese Nationalist Party or Kuomintang (KMT) lost
power in 2000, some people were speaking ill of Taiwan's prospects;
and after the KMT lost another presidential election in 2004, voices
again appeared that were more in favor of China than of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Those who try to forsake Taiwan suggest their strenuous effort in
resisting Taiwan identity, he warned.</P>
      <P>Under the jackboot of martial law rule, Taiwan's national
identity was clouded as being impractical and was misdirected by the
illusory concept of a "greater China," Chen said.</P>
      <P>With the progress of the nation's democratization, he noted,
people in Taiwan have gradually come to embrace a Taiwan identity
that is different from their previous "greater China identity."</P>
      <P>He cited a long-term study as saying that in 1996, 41 percent of
Taiwan's population thought "this country's territory covered Taiwan,
Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu" while 42 percent thought that mainland
China was part of their "national territory."</P>
      <P>A similar study showed that in 1998, those two opinions were held
by 65 percent and 27 percent, respectively; by 2003, the ratio had
become 71 percent versus 14 percent, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Another study found that in 1996, 73 percent of those polled in
Taiwan said Taiwan residents alone have the right to decide their own
future, whereas 13 percent said the 1.3 billion mainland Chinese also
have the right to help in the decision. Those favoring the right of
the Taiwanese to decide Taiwan's future grew to 81 percent in 1998,
but still 13 percent thought mainland Chinese should take part in the
decision-making.</P>
      <P>It is the 13 percent that are worrying Chen. He said 13 percent
of the public still insist on keeping their "old national identity"
even though Taiwan identity has become a mainstream value in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, he added, in a democracy, this minority view must be
"tolerated and respected."</P>
      <P>He said the wheel of history will not stop turning because a
minority of the people are obsessed with their ideas of the past. He
said he firmly believes Taiwan identity will keep growing while the
"old national identity" -- the product of a heavy-handed rule -- will
decline.</P>
      <P>Because the "old national identity" was a government-inculcated,
top-down product, Chen said he will never make the same mistake.
Rather, he said, he favors a "healthy and land-linked national
identity" which emanates from the heart of the people, from the
feelings about and memories of their daily lives -- in short, a
down-top process.</P>
      <P>The president reiterated that his administration will never
change the key policy of pro-actively promoting Taiwan identity.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
the four key principles observed in the integration of the European

      <P>Chen made the remarks while hosting a luncheon at Taipei Guest

sovereignty, parity, democracy and peace -- can be applied to
resolving cross-strait disputes and problems.</P>
      <P>First of all, Chen said EU countries respect each other as
independent sovereign states. This principle allows EU member states
to integrate to the extent that they have reached today.</P>
      <P>Second, Chen said, all EU member states, regardless of their
size, treat each other in line with the principles of parity and
equality. None of them denigrate any other member state as a local

With Deal Reached, Normal Commutes Return

Thousands of New York City transit workers
put down their picket signs and streamed into
bus depots and railyards last night to restart
the nation's largest transit system, after
leaders of their union agreed to a tentative
framework for a new contract and ended a 60-hour
strike that hobbled the city. Transit officials 
said they expected the system to come haltingly 
back to life last night but be running at nearly
full capacity by this morning's rush. Despite
the end of the strike, a final settlement of
the dispute remains to be reached. But officials
hinted that in exchange for the union's ending
the strike, the authority would significantly
scale back or even abandon its insistence on
less-generous pensions for future workers. In
return, the union would consider having its
members pay more for health insurance.


Wall Street Journal: Second Opinion,
Study Tied Pollutant to Cancer;
Then Consultants Got Hold of It

During China's Cultural Revolution 40 years 
ago, a city doctor named Zhang JianDong was 
banished to the countryside of northeastern 
China. He found that a giant smelter was
spilling large amounts of chromium waste into
the groundwater. After spending the next two
decades treating and studying the residents of
five villages with chromium-polluted water. In
1987, he published a study saying they were
dying of cancer at higher rates than people
nearby. In America, regulatory agencies began
citing it as evidence that a form of the metal
called chromium-6 might cause cancer if
ingested. Then in 1997, Dr. Zhang, in
retirement, appeared to retract his life's
work. A " clarification and further analysis"
published under his name in a U.S. medical
journal said there was no cancer link to
chromium in the villages after all. This new
conclusion, like the earlier one, soon found its
way into U.S. regulatory assessments, as
evidence that ingested chromium wasn't really a
cancer risk. Yet Dr. Zhang didn't write the
clarification, judging by voluminous testimony
and exhibits in a lawsuit in a California state
court. The court papers indicate that the second
study was conceived, drafted, edited and
submitted to medical journals by science
consultants working for the lawsuit's defendant,
a utility company being sued for alleged
chromium pollution. Regulators in California
after investigating the second Zhang report,
have concluded it is dubious. They have reverted
to the original dark view of chromium-6 and are
moving to propose a strict limit on it in ground
water. The action could ultimately require a
costly cleanup, because a third of wells tested
in the state exceed the envisioned limit. Costs
would grow if other states followed California's
lead.</TEXT>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) officials expressed confidence Saturday that
Taiwan's unemployment rate will decline below 4 percent in 2006.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate for the 11 months to November this year
registered 4.15 percent, and that for the whole of 2005 is estimated
at 4.1 percent, according to the Directorate-General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials said although the unemployment rate is unlikely to
fall below 4 percent this year, it is expected to continue to fall
with the help of the government's measures to promote employment.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that 9.93 million people were employed from
January to November this year, up 157,000 from the same period last
year.</P>
      <P>Compared with the same time last year, the percentage of employed
people in the agricultural sector decreased to 5.97 percent; that of

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION LEADERS EXPRESS CONDOLENCES TO CHINA'S  LATE NEGOTIATOR</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairmen of the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP)
expressed their condolences to the family of Wang Daohan, China's top
negotiator with Taiwan, Saturday.</P>
      <P>Both KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and PFP Chairman James Soong paid
tribute after China's official Xinhua News Agency confirmed that
Wang, chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), died in a Shanghai hospital at the age of 90 earlier
in the day.</P>
      <P>Ma said Wang played a pivotal role in the development of
cross-strait relations, adding that with his "mild, rational and
creative temperament, " he helped bring bilateral relations to a peak
with his meeting with C.F. Koo, the late Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) chairman from Taiwan, in Singapore in 1993.</P>
      <P>The Koo-Wang meeting was considered a major breakthrough in
cross-strait relations as it marked the first high-ranking contact
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait since the KMT forces
retreated to Taiwan nearly five decades earlier after being defeated
by the Communist Party of China in a civil war in 1949.</P>
      <P>The meeting opened up regular dialogues between the SEF and
ARATS in the following years, although the communications between the
two semi-official bodies came to a stop after former President Lee
Teng-hui defined cross-strait relation as "special
state-to-state" in nature in 1999.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the KMT will send an envoy to attend the funeral of
Wang, Ma said that the party is considering the matter and should do
so.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman Soong expressed the hope that there will be others
in China that carry the same weight as Wang, considered to be a
mentor of former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin, who will be able to help
promote bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Wang sent envoys to attend the funeral of Koo, who died in Jan. 3
this year three days before his 88th birthday.</P>
      <P>Former KMT Chairman Lien Chan and Soong called on Wang during
their visit to China early this year.</P>

      <P>After seven years in office, Taipei Mayor
Ma Ying-jeou's performance rating remains high, with a survey
released Saturday showing that 80 percent of the citizens in the
capital support him.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the Research, Development and Evaluation

1,113 valid responses from Taipei citizens over 20 years of age.</P>
      <P>Ma, who also serves as chairman of the opposition Kuomintang

considered the party's most likely contender in the 2008 presidential

      <P>According to the survey, more than 70 percent of the respondents
were satisfied with Ma's administrative performance, the quality of
life, and the city government's efforts in protecting the
environment, while about 60 percent were satisfied with cultural
activities, social order and public construction projects.</P>
      <P>It was the first time in a number of years that more than 80
percent of the respondents expressed satisfaction at the quality of

      <P>Ma's promotion of the EasyCard, which integrates transport fares

      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Chang Chun-hsiung has offered to visit Shanghai to pay his last

      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations set up by
Taipei and Beijing, respectively, to handle cross-strait affairs in
the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>ARATS notified SEF Saturday that Wang had passed away in Shanghai
that morning, and the SEF later replied to extend its condolences on
Wang's death, SEF officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang also sent a letter to Wang's son, Wang Yu, to

      <P>Chang's predecessor, Koo Chen-fu, who died in January this year,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) on Saturday expressed condolence over the death of Wang Daohan,
China's chief negotiator with Taiwan, who died earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Chinese authorities confirmed Saturday that Wang, president of
the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), died at 7:00 a.m. Saturday in Shanghai, at the age of 90.</P>
      <P>Noting that with the death 11 months ago of Taiwan's chief
negotiator with China, Koo Chen-fu, former chairman of the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) , MAC officials said Wang's death on
Saturday represented a further loss to both sides of Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the negotiations framework laid by Koo and Wang is
a fine asset for both sides of the Taiwan Strait, MAC officials urged
Chinese authorities to fully understand the importance of
cross-strait reconciliation and negotiations, and work more for peace
and bilateral development across the Taiwan Strait in the future.</P>
      <P>The SEF was founded in February 1991, and China followed suit by
establishing ARATS in December of the same year, with Wang as
president.</P>
      <P>With concerted efforts, Koo and Wang had a historic meeting in
Singapore in 1993 after a hiatus of formal contacts between Taiwan
and China for more than four decades.</P>
      <P>At the Singapore meeting, Koo and Wang signed four agreements,
laying the framework for institutionalized negotiations between the
two intermediary bodies and creating a new era for cross-strait
negotiations on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Koo and Wang met in China for more talks, which laid the
framework for cross-strait reconciliation.</P>
      <P>However, Beijing unilaterally cut the formal contacts between the
two bodies in 1999, when then-ROC President Lee Teng-hui defined
cross-strait ties as "state-to-state" relations.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) has

biomass crops including canola, soybeans and sunflowers next year,
officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The farmland will be located in Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung

      <P>While only 90 hectares of fallow farmland in Ilan, Yunlin and
Tainan were selected this year to grow the crops on a trial basis,
the COA decided to expand the size to 2,000 hectares next year after
the trial was successful, they said.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that farmers growing biomass crops will receive
a subsidy of NT$60,000 per hectare from the government.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The people will decide the direction
constitutional reforms must take and the government has no
preconceived notions on the matter, the director of the
constitutional re-engineering office at the Presidential Office said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lee Chun-yi made the remarks after a civic group said that the
current governmental system is so chaotic that it is seriously
undermining the government's efficiency.</P>
      <P>The 21st Century Constitutional Reform Alliance said that the
future governmental system could be presidential or parliamentary,
but it will vehemently oppose a dual-leadership system.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the suggestions by the alliance are valuable and he
encouraged others to come forward and make their voices heard as this
is the best way to build a national consensus.</P>
      <P>Although the ROC Constitution has been amended seven times since
the lifting of martial law in 1987, many questions remain unresolved.</P>
      <P>He cited as examples lawmakers' boycott of the reading of
administrative reports by the premier in the Legislative Yuan, the
long-stalled screening of nominations for Control Yuan members, the
opposition party's proposal to revive the right to endorse the
premier who has been appointed by the president, and the ruling
party's proposal that the president should take the initiative to
dissolve the legislature if the opposition's boycotting renders it
ineffective.</P>
      <P>The nature of the system of government is crucial and must be
addressed in the next phase of constitutional reforms; however, Lee
stressed that the administration does not have a hidden agenda as to
what sort of result should come out of these reforms. This, he said,
will be at the discretion of the people.</P>
      <P>Whether to adopt a three-branch or five-branch governmental
system, a presidential or parliamentary system, or to move toward a
dual leadership system that clearly defines the rights and
responsibilities of the two leaders will be up to the people to
decide, Lee added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO POWERFUL NATIONAL DEFENSE, NO STABLE CROSS-STRAIT TIES: DPP CAUCUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must have a credible defense or
there will be no stability in cross-Taiwan Strait ties, a
high-ranking ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) official said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun, a caucus leader of DPP in the legislature, made
the remarks after the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) on Friday again blocked
the screening of the arms procurement package from the United States,
which was put on the legislative agenda several days ago.</P>
      <P>The arms procurement package, which has been prevented from even
being discussed in the legislature 42 times by the "pan-blue
alliance, " includes eight diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of
12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries.</P>
      <P>Although the pursuit of stable cross-strait ties has been the
DPP's long-term goal, the relations between the two sides have not
been largely controlled by Taiwan, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>For example, Chen added, Taiwan's proposal of giving marine
transportation precedence over air links between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, with cargo shipments coming before passenger
transportation, has not received a positive response from China, not
to mention the numerous Chinese overtures that have been aimed at
downgrading Taiwan to a Chinese local government.</P>
      <P>With China's enactment of the Anti-Secession Law earlier this
year, which legalizes an attack on Taiwan should the island seek
formal independence, Chen said it indicated a certain level of
hostility in China toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the circumstances, if Taiwan does not maintain a powerful
deterrent force, there will be no stable cross-strait ties, Chen
stressed, urging the "pan-blue alliance" to support the arms purchase
bill.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, PFP Chairman James Soong and Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng, who is a KMT member, met earlier in the day to discuss
politics, including the arms procurement bill and the possible
formation of a joint Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Both Soong and Wang believe maintaining stable cross-strait
relations is the key issue that affects Taiwan's political stability
and its economic development.</P>

      <P>The death of Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) President Wang Daohan symbolizes the
end of a generation but will not mean any changes in present or
future cross-strait relations, a Chinese scholar said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wang died Saturday morning in Shanghai, more than 11 months after
that of Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation. As leaders of the semi-official organizations set up by
Beijing and Taipei, respectively, to handle cross-strait affairs in
the absence of official ties, Wang and Koo acted as chief negotiators
on behalf of their governments and held ground-breaking talks in 1993
in Singapore.</P>
      <P>Wang Jianmin, a research fellow on Taiwan studies at the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, said the function of ARATS will not
change because of Wang's death and that the organization remains
Beijing's contact with Taipei.</P>
      <P>"The Koo-Wang talks were something that happened many years ago,
and Wang can be said to be a figure of a past generation, " he said.
"His death will not affect cross-strait relations at present or in
the future."</P>
      <P>As for Wang's successor, the scholar predicted that it will take
some time for Beijing to find a successor because it is not easy to
find someone who has the qualifications Wang possessed.</P>
      <P>Zao Zhizhou, another Chinese scholar specializing in Taiwan
studies, said Wang's successor must be someone who enjoys high esteem

      <P>Wang died Saturday morning in Shanghai, more than 11 months after
the death of Koo Chen-fu, Wang's counterpart from the Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation.</P>
      <P>Yang Jian, deputy secretary-general of the Center for Taiwan
Studies at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, said Beijing is
not likely to make a quick decision on the choice of Wang's
successor, as the operations of ARATS are mainly taken care of by its
deputy chairman, Li Bingcai.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government
adopts a pragmatic attitude on its cross-strait policy, the dialogue
between SEF and ARATS may be resumed before the 2008 presidential
election, Yang said, adding that only then will Beijing start to
consider naming a new ARATS chairman.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, cross-strait disagreements over the "one
China" principle and the "1992 consensus" remain the main obstacles
to the resumption of cross-strait dialogue, and whether the deadlock
will be broken will depend on whether the DPP government will make
any compromises on these issues.</P>
      <P>Yang said the next ARATS chairman should be someone who is
devoted to cross-strait affairs and who has good understanding of

    <TEXT>
      <P>China is studying the offer by Taiwan's
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chang Chun-hsiung to visit
Shanghai to pay his last respects to Wang Daohan, the late president
of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Wang passed away early Saturday in a Shanghai hospital at the age
of 90.</P>
      <P>In addition to Chang, main opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou also expressed the hope to send envoys to attend Wang's
funeral, but officials from Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office of the
State Council only responded by saying that they would have to "ask
ARATS."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in Taipei, opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong is "studying cautiously" whether to attend
Wang's funeral, his aides said.</P>
      <P>They cited Soong as saying that over the past dozen years, the
relations between both sides of the Taiwan Strait were the smoothest
between 1992 and 1993, when Wang and Koo Chen-fu, Chang's predecessor,
played pivotal roles in the communications between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official organizations set up by
Taipei and Beijing, respectively, to handle cross-strait affairs in
the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Soong thinks that after the passing of Koo and Wang, cross-strait
relations will face the challenge of the new era, and he hopes that a
pragmatic communication platform will be established soon to
stabilize cross-strait relations, the aides said.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang held ground-breaking talks in 1993 in Singapore,
reaching agreements on cross-strait technical affairs and
establishing an institutionalized channel of consultations between
the two sides.</P>
      <P>However, Beijing unilaterally suspended the dialogue channel to
pretest against then-President Lee Teng-hui's remarks in 1999 that
cross-strait relations are "special state-to-state" in nature. The
dialogue channel has yet to be resumed.</P>
      <P>Senior officials from ARATS arrived in Taipei early this

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) on Saturday expressed its condolence over the death of Wang
Daohan, China's chief negotiator with Taiwan, while affirming his
contributions in maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wang, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) , died at 7: 00 a.m. Saturday in
Shanghai at the age of 90.</P>
      <P>In a news release, the DPP hailed Wang for promoting cross-strait
negotiations and exchanges by setting aside the controversial
disputes between the two sides.</P>
      <P>After the historic meeting between Wang and Koo Chen-fu, former
chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , in
Singapore in 1993, the first of its kind after a hiatus of formal
contacts between Taiwan and China for more than four decades, Wang
maintained a positive attitude toward Taiwan's democratic development
and respected the island's diverse opinions, according to the
release.</P>
      <P>At the Singapore meeting, Koo and Wang signed four agreements,
laying the framework for institutionalized negotiations between the
two intermediary bodies and creating a new era for cross-strait
negotiations on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Koo and Wang met in China for more talks, which laid the
framework for cross-strait reconciliation.</P>
      <P>However, Beijing unilaterally cut the formal contacts between the
two bodies in 1999, when then-ROC President Lee Teng-hui defined
cross-strait ties as "state-to-state" relations.</P>
      <P>The DPP hopes that there will be someone like Wang from ARATS to
work with the SEF in the future to contribute to the peace, stability
and welfare of the people between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,
the release added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, several opposition Kuomintang (KMT) figures, including
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and honorary Chairman Lien Chan, as well as
family members of Koo, who passed away in January this year, all
expressed their condolences over Wang's death.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONTROL YUAN GRIDLOCK MAY BE RESOLVED: LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The issue regarding the Control Yuan lineup
may be addressed in the next legislative session as President Chen
Shui-bian plans to come up with a new nomination list, Legislative
Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng predicted optimistically Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wang, an opposition Kuomintang (KMT) heavyweight, made the
remarks after a closed-door meeting with James Soong, chairman of the
KMT's "pan-blue" ally -- the People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>Under the current ROC Constitution, Control Yuan members are
appointed by the president with the consent of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>President Chen referred a list of Control Yuan nominees to the
legislature in November 2004. The opposition-controlled legislature
had refused to review it. As a result, the nation's supreme watchdog
body has been standing empty since the tenure of previous Control
Yuan members expired early this year.</P>
      <P>There were reports earlier this week that the two "pan-blue"
parties had a new proposal for the Control Yuan makeup. They
reportedly suggested that the Control Yuan seats be filled up with a
formula adopted in the formation of the National Communications
Commission (NCC) , under which political parties first recommend
celebrities to form a screening committee to review Control Yuan
nominees to be put forward by political parties in proportion to
their representation in the legislature.</P>
      <P>However, Wang said PFP Chairman Soong told him during their
meeting earlier in the day that the NCC formula proposal was broached
by KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Wang said both he and Soong agreed that the president's
Constitution-enshrined power to nominate Control Yuan members should
be respected and observed.</P>
      <P>"Since the Constitution has clear provisions for Control Yuan
nominations, it's unrealistic to demand the enforcement of an
NCC-formula. What Soong and I advocate is that the president draws
inspiration from the NCC spirit and handle Control Yuan nomination
through a just and transparent mechanism," Wang explained.</P>
      <P>To the best of his understanding, Wang said President Chen is
mulling to refer a new Control Yuan nomination list to the
legislature for approval.</P>
      <P>"I think the legislature is likely to deal with the Control Yuan
nomination issue during its next session to be opened in February, "
he added.</P>
      <P>Wang said he met with President Chen for one and a half hours a
week ago to exchange views on a range of critical policy issues,
including relations across the Taiwan Strait, the Control Yuan
nomination issue and the long-stalled arms procurement project.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER LOOKS FORWARD TO ATTENDING WANG'S FUNERAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 24 (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Saturday if opportunity presents itself, he will be more than willing
to travel to Shanghai to attend the funeral of China's top negotiator
with Taiwan on behalf of the government.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks after learning that Wang Daohan, president
of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), died in a Shanghai hospital early Saturday at the age
of 90.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he is likely to pay the last tribute of respect to
Wang Daohan on behalf of the Republic of China government, Wang
Jin-pyng said this is a good idea.</P>
      <P>"If I can go there on behalf of the government, it would be a
plus to the development of cross-strait relations, " the legislative
speaker said.</P>
      <P>Wang Daohan, a one-time Shanghai mayor and mentor to former
Chinese President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin, was
instrumental in starting rapprochement between China and Taiwan --
political rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 -- in
the early 1990s.</P>
      <P>He and Koo Chen-fu, the late chairman of the Taipei-based Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), held landmark talks in Singapore in 1993,
after Beijing and Taipei agreed to their own interpretations of the
"one China" principle in what is known as the 1992 consensus.</P>
      <P>Koo died of cancer this past January at the age of 87. ARATS sent
a contingent to Koo's funeral earlier this year. Koo's successor
Chang Chun-hsiung said he hopes to attend Wang's funeral if Wang's
family allows.</P>
      <P>"We express deep condolences on the death of Wang Daohan,
especially since Wang did all he could to improve cross-straits
relations and boost exchanges across the Strait. We deeply regret his
death," Chang said.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official organizations authorized by
their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official ties.</P>

wins he courteously makes his bow before he advances to take his
place among the winners; and, when he has lost, he walks down and
drinks his cup of forfeit. Thus, even in this case of competition, he
shows himself to be a gentleman."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>OFFICERS REPORTEDLY PLANNING TO QUIT KMT OVER STALLED ARMS BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An unknown number of military officers have
reportedly written a letter to the Ministry of National Defense
saying that they are planning to quit the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
in anger over the long-stalled arms procurement bill, local newspapers
reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and
People First Party, which together hold a slight majority in the
Legislative Yuan, have blocked the bill from being put on the
legislature's agenda for over a year.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Monday morning that he has read
the reports about the letter and has also heard that the letter to
the defense ministry carried no signatures. Ma said he will gain a
better understanding of the matter before making any further comment.</P>
      <P>Ma, who doubles as Taipei mayor, said that the KMT has made its
stance on the arms procurement bill very clear, stressing that Taiwan
needs to maintain sufficient military strength to defend itself.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense submitted the bill for the
purchase of six Patriot III anti-missile batteries, eight
conventional submarines and 12 P-3C Orion submarine-hunting aircraft
from the United States to the Legislative Yuan last year. The initial
price tag was NT$610.8 billion, but the ministry later reduced it to
NT$480 billion after the opposition lawmakers rejected the bill.</P>
      <P>Noting that the KMT has never objected to arms procurement, Ma
said that the KMT is opposed to "cash-for-friendship" purchase plans
or "unreasonable" procurement plans.</P>
      <P>"No military members, regardless of their political affiliation,
should support an arms procurement bill if it is not drafted based on
professional assessments and if it cannot genuinely meet Taiwan's
defense needs," Ma said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND RESPECTS SERVICEMEMBERS' 'PERSONAL' DECISIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) said
Monday it has no opinion about media reports that an unknown number
of military officers are planning to quit the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) in anger over the long-stalled arms procurement bill.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Military Spokesman's Office said that the
military's stance of remaining neutral and firmly observing the
nationalization of the armed forces in accordance with the
Constitution definitely will not change.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, they said, the defense ministry will
respect any "personal" decisions that the military officers make and
will not intervene in matters pertaining to any military
servicemember's personal political affiliations.</P>
      <P>They said that since the Republic of China armed forces was
nationalized, no political activities have been allowed in the
barracks, meaning that the defense ministry has maintained a
hands-off attitude toward military servicemember's personal political
stances.</P>
      <P>The MND officials, however, lamented that lawmakers of the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and People First Party,
which together hold a slight majority in the Legislative Yuan, have
blocked the arms procurement bill from being put on the legislature's
agenda 42 times since last year.</P>
      <P>Quoting a recent public opinion poll, the officials said that
over half of the people support the arms procurement bill for the
purchase of six Patriot III anti-missile batteries, eight
diesel-powered submarines and 12 P-3C Orion submarine-hunting
aircraft from the United States, and that more than 70 percent of the
respondents think that the Legislative Yuan should debate and pass
the bill as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Therefore, they said, the servicemember's alleged protest against
the opposition "pan-blue alliance's" blocking of the bill is in line
with mainstream public opinion.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that the KMT sincerely
hopes to communicate with those servicemembers who wrote the letter
to the defense ministry in order to talk to them about their
positions on the stalled arms procurement bill.</P>
      <P>Ma noted, however, that the KMT has no way of contacting them
because the letter did not contain any signatures. He added that they
are welcomed to come forward and talk with KMT officials about their
grievance.</P>
      <P>Ma, who doubles as Taipei mayor, said that the KMT has made its
stance on the arms procurement bill very clear, stressing that Taiwan
needs to maintain sufficient military strength to defend itself.</P>
      <P>Noting that the KMT has never objected to arms procurement, Ma
said that the KMT is opposed to "cash-for-friendship" purchase plans
or "unreasonable" procurement plans.</P>
      <P>"No military members, regardless of their political affiliation,
should support an arms procurement bill if it is not drafted based on
professional assessments and if it cannot genuinely meet Taiwan's
defense needs," Ma said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP TO ORGANIZE GROUP TO ATTEND LATE ARATS HEAD'S FUNERAL IN SHANGHAI</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
will organize a group to visit Shanghai to pay the party's last
respects to Wang Daohan, China's top cross-strait negotiator, who
passed away Saturday at the age of 90, a PFP spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Kung-ping said that it is still unclear whether PFP
Chairman James Soong will personally lead the PFP delegation to
Wang's funeral scheduled to be held at a funeral parlor in Shanghai
Dec. 30. The decision will be made after consultations with Wang's
family, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Soong met with Wang at his Shanghai residence during a visit to
China in May this year.</P>
      <P>Members of the PFP delegation will also include several PFP
legislators, Hsieh added.</P>
      <P>Key figures of the Beijing leadership are expected to travel to
Shanghai to attend the funeral for Wang, the late chairman of
Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS),
a quasi-official intermediary body responsible for negotiating with
Taiwan in the absence of formal ties between the two sides. ARATS's
Taiwan counterpart is the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>Both SEF Chairman Chang Chun-hsiung, a legislator-at-large of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party, and Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng, a stalwart of the opposition Kuomintang, have offered
to visit Shanghai to pay their last respects to Wang Daohan, a senior
Communist Party of China member who had been Shanghai mayor in the
1980s.</P>
      <P>Chang's predecessor, Koo Chen-fu, who died in January this year,
held ground-breaking talks with Wang Daohan in 1993 in Singapore,
signing four agreements on cross-strait technical affairs and
establishing an institutionalized channel of consultations between
the two sides.</P>
      <P>However, Beijing suspended the dialogue first in 1995 to protest
against then-President Lee Teng-hui's U.S. visit and later in 1999
against Lee's remarks which defined cross-strait relations as those
between two states.</P>
      <P>Beijing has not resumed the dialogue with Taipei during the past
five years since the pro-independence DPP came to power.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAX BURDEN FOR BUSINESS SHOULD NOT GO UP TOO SHARPLY AT ONCE: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 26 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Ho Mei-yueh said Monday
that tax incentives for high-tech investors should not be restricted
after the minimum tax code has been adopted because imposing these
two measures at the same time would increase the financial pressure
on them.</P>
      <P>A government plan to claw back tax incentives for high-tech
investors has angered industry leaders, including Chairman Morris
Chang of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. and Robert Tsao of
United Microelectronics Corp., who lashed out against the government
for trying to "take two layers of skin" off them.</P>
      <P>They have demanded that the government change the law encouraging
people to invest in certain "strategic" industries rather than taking
back some incentives by administrative decree. The Ministry of
Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have not reached a
consensus on this issue.</P>
      <P>Under the government plan, investors will be given an option to
choose between a five-year tax holiday or a tax exemption on certain
amounts of their investment. The minister said these two preferential
treatments have stood together for 30 years, and if investors are to
choose only one of them, the law should be amended.</P>
      <P>She noted that her ministry will put forward an amendment
proposal within one year in accordance with a Legislative Yuan
request.</P>
      <P>The "minimum tax" code, which goes into effect next month,
requires that a company whose annual earnings exceeds NT$2 million
pay between 10 percent and 20 percent in corporate income tax.</P>
      <P>Ho said since the new tax code has added tax burden on corporate
leaders, the burden will get heavier if the measures on tax holidays
and tax deductibles are to be revoked.</P>
      <P>She suggested that a "right time" be chosen to restrict both tax
benefits for businesses that have been lured into making new
investments in "emerging" strategic industries because of the
government offer.</P>
      <P>She admitted that the government has given quite a number of
incentives to investors, incentives which she claimed have brought
benefits to the country.</P>
      <P>For example, she said that last year, government revenue went up
by NT$130 billion (US$3.93 billion) due in part to a whopping 28
percent increase in private investment. This year, private investment
rose only nine percent over last year.</P>
      <P>Some firms paid less than five percent of their earnings in
income tax previously; if the tax rate jumped to more than 10 percent
all of a sudden, it would not be "very appropriate, " the minister

    <HEADLINE>TSU LAWMAKER BLAMES GIO HEAD FOR MEDIA REFORM BILL FAILURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Tseng Tsahn-deng on Monday
blamed Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Pasuya Yao for
the failure in having the government, political parties and military
meet the Dec. 26 deadline for withdrawing from the media.</P>
      <P>Tseng, an opposition Taiwan Solitary Union (TSU) lawmaker, is the
person who was assigned to organize negotiations between the ruling
and opposition parties in an attempt to pass the media reform bill.</P>
      <P>With the legislature failing to pass the bill in time for the GIO
to release state-controlled shares in two terrestrial television
companies -- the Chinese Television System (CTS) and Taiwan
Television Enterprise Ltd. (TTV) -- the government's check for
carrying out President Chen Shui-bian's directive that all government
agencies, political parties and military units relinguish control of
news media by the end of this year has bounced.</P>
      <P>Tseng said four rounds of talks on the draft statute have taken
place among all the party caucuses at the Legislative Yuan. In the
first three rounds of negotiations, consensus was reached on parts of
articles in the bill, including the one regulating the formation of a
special team, to be formed based on the proportion of seats each
party has in the legislature, to review the sale of state-owned
stakes in the two terrestrial television stations.</P>
      <P>However, Yao overturned the decision to organize the team based
on proportional representation in the fourth round of inter-party
talks, making it impossible to pass the bill ahead of the deadline
stipulated in the Broadcasting and Television Law, Tseng noted.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the GIO did not deliver the bill to the
Legislative Yuan until October, severely restricting the amount of
time to review the bill, the legislators were still able to overcome
some of their differences to form a consensus, Tseng said, adding
that "the Legislative Yuan has done its duty."</P>
      <P>Tseng claimed he thinks the GIO has "never been sincere nor
active" in pushing for the withdrawal of the government, political
parties and military from the media.</P>
      <P>He stressed that he will ask Yao to accept the parties' consensus
on the bill before he tries to organize a new round of talks.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, chairmen and general managers of both the CTS and TTV,
as well as directors and supervisors representing the government's
stakes in the terrestrial TV stations, resigned en masse to show
support for the government's media reform bid.</P>
      <P>Outgoing CTS General Manager Chiang Hsia said Monday that for the
time being, the company can do noting but wait and see because there
is now no law regulating its management.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S LAWS NOT THE MAIN OBSTACLE IN DIRECT LINKS: MAC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   26  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is more to opening direct
transportation links with China than simply revising laws, Vice
Chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Johnnason Liu said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remark in response to a call the previous day by
opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou that he would work with
his political ally, the People First Party, to pass the necessary
legislation to pave the way for direct transportation links with
China. Liu said negotiating with China on the technical details of
the links is the real sticking point, not any current restrictions
imposed by Taiwan's laws.</P>
      <P>Liu was referring to Beijing's refusal to talk with Taiwan on
anything because of political differences.</P>
      <P>The MAC vice chairman said the Executive Yuan is pushing for the
links " step by step" in the hope that they will come about without
endangering Taiwan's security, debasing its status as a state or
compromising its national dignity.</P>
      <P>Liu also said that before any such links are opened, a
comprehensive analysis must be done on what the impact would be on
Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>The council has been looking into the feasibility of the issue
since the summer of 2003 when both sides allowed a limited opening of
charter flights across the Strait during the Chinese Lunar New Year.
The flights did not take place the next year, but were resumed in
2005. Taiwan has also shown its willingness and flexibility to reach
out to China as evidenced by the streamlining of cargo shipments
between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>However, to expand on this would require negotiations with
Beijing, who has been firm in its resolve to give Taiwan the cold
shoulder on any discussions if they are not tied to a capitulation on
its "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>Liu pointed to such issues as how the links would be framed - as
domestic routes, international, or some creative blend of both that
would satisfy both sides - the laws that would have to be crafted to
encompass the many facets of direct links, and the flags to be flown
on cargo ships - not to mention whether the ROC national flag would
be acceptable to China on any vessel.</P>
      <P>These matters can't be resolved by Taiwan alone, he said, adding
that they would have to be agreed upon before Taiwan could formulate
its own laws that would fit a future reality.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT FIRST VICE CHAIRMAN TO ATTEND TOP CHINA NEGOTIATOR'S FUNERAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said
Monday it will send its first vice chairman, Wu Poh-hsiung, to pay
the party's last respects to Wang Daohan, China's top negotiator with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou has assigned Wu to attend Wang's
funeral on behalf of the party," a KMT spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Wang, whose official title was president of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), died in a
Shanghai hospital Saturday at the age of 90. His funeral is scheduled
to take place in Shanghai Dec. 30.</P>
      <P>Wang, a one-time Shanghai mayor and mentor to Jiang Zemin, former
Chinese president and Communist Party chief was instrumental in
starting rapprochement between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in
the early 1990s.</P>
      <P>He and Koo Chen-fu, the late chairman of the Taipei-based Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), held landmark talks in Singapore in 1993,
after Taipei and Beijing agreed to their own interpretations of the
"one China" principle in what is known by some as the "1992
consensus, " although many in Taiwan believe that no such consensus
ever existed.</P>
      <P>Koo died of cancer this past January at the age of 87. ARATS sent
a contingent to Koo's funeral earlier this year. Koo's successor,
Chang Chun-hsiung, said he hopes to attend Wang's funeral if Wang's
family allows it.</P>
      <P>"We express our deep condolences on the death of Wang Daohan,
especially since Wang did all he could to improve cross-strait
relations and boost exchanges across the Strait. We deeply regret his
passing," Chang said.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official organizations authorized by
their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Beijing unilaterally suspended regular ARATS-SEF dialogue in
mid-1999 when then-ROC President Lee Teng-hui redefined cross-strait
ties as a special "state-to-state" relationship.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASKING PRESIDENT TO QUIT DPP NOT CONSTRUCTIVE: LEGISLATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Asking President Chen Shui-bian to quit the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) would not be a smart move
in terms of helping bail the party out of its current political
difficulties, DPP Legislator Trong Chai said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chai, one of the three candidates in the DPP's Jan. 15
chairmanship by-election scheduled after Su Tseng-chang stepped down
to take responsibility for the DPP's humiliating defeat in the Dec. 3
local government elections, said that blaming President Chen for the
party's failure at the polls is "simplifying a major issue" and that
it is not constructive in terms of tackling the difficulties that the
party is now facing.</P>
      <P>Chen Ou-po, chief of the DPP Ilan Chapter, reportedly wrote
President Chen over the weekend to ask him to quit the party as a
gesture to take responsibility for the DPP's poor showing in the
local elections, in which the ruling party won only six of the 23
city mayor and county magistrate posts up for grabs. The opposition
"pan-blue alliance" led by the Kuomintang won 17 of the posts.</P>
      <P>Chai called for every DPP member to "conduct in-depth
soul-searching" on the question of why the party lost so badly in the
elections.</P>
      <P>He attributed the DPP's defeat mainly to two factors -- shaky
grass-roots organizations and a recent string of corruption scandals,
including the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. scandal and the
"vultures" insider-trading case.</P>
      <P>He also called for the DPP policy makers to incorporate the heads
of the DPP's local chapters into the DPP Central Standing Committee
so that local party organizations can work in tandem with officials
in the upper levels of the party's hierarchy.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Six high energy-consuming industries
associations signed an agreement Monday, pledging to voluntarily
conserve energy and cut carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>The voluntary agreement comes in the wake of the Kyoto Protocol
going into effect Feb. 16. Countries that ratified the accord are
committed to reducing their emissions of carbon dioxide and five
other greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>Under the auspices of the Industrial Development Bureau and the
Chinese National Federation of Industries (CNFI) , the associations
representing the petrochemical, cement, pulp and paper, steel,
man-made fiber, as well as the fabric or piecegoods printing, dyeing
and finishing industries joined the Ministry of Economic Affairs to
sign the agreement.</P>
      <P>A total of 125 manufacturers from the six industries signed the
agreement, pledging to voluntarily cut carbon dioxide emissions
starting next year based on the 2004 levels. Under the agreement, the
companies are expected to conserve a total of 1.39 million
KLOE (kiloliters of oil equivalent) and cut their carbon
dioxide emissions by 4.02 million tons by 2008.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh noted that the Taiwan
Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers Association (TEEMA) had
wanted to enter into the agreement, but due to the fact that the
manufacturers of the TEEMA release other greenhouse gases in addition
to carbon dioxide and that the board of directors of the TEEMA has
yet to approve the matter, the association will sign the agreement
later.</P>
      <P>CNFI Deputy Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung said the signing of the
agreement demonstrates that the industries are willing to make
efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions and are determined to do
their part to safeguard the environment.</P>

      <P>An assessment center to grade the nation's
colleges and universities was launched Monday after one year of
preparations.</P>
      <P>Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng, in attending the launch
ceremony, said that with the trend of globalization, Taiwan's
colleges and universities have to compete with top-notch universities
in the world.</P>
      <P>The assessment center therefore aims at ensuring the high quality
of colleges and universities as well as collecting assessment
information, hoping to establish a professional and systematic
assessment mechanism.</P>
      <P>This will be the first semi-official professional assessment
institution, with the Ministry of Education (MOE) contributing NT$15
million (US$447,760) and the 153 colleges and universities of Taiwan
contributing NT$100,000 each.</P>
      <P>The first task for the center will be to assess the teaching
level of the departments and graduate schools of the universities.
The assessment will target the departments related to education, fine
arts and physical education in the first year, and the departments
and graduate schools will first make self-assessments next March and
then the center will make on-site inspections of their schools and
conduct second reviews in the second half of 2006.</P>
      <P>Center chairman as well as former President of National Sun

produce three results -- pass, fail or inconclusive.</P>
      <P>Those departments or graduate schools that are listed as
inconclusive will not be able to increase recruitment or apply to
increase graduate schools, while those who fail will have to cut the
number of student recruitments.</P>
      <P>In addition, those departments or graduate schools graded
inconclusive or failing will have to receive followed-up assessments
in the future.</P>
      <P>If they still fail the followed-up assessment, they will be
banned from recruiting more students.</P>

      <P>People in Taiwan are retiring younger,
according to information released Monday by the Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting, and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The DGBAS report shows that employees in the industrial and
service sectors in Taiwan who applied to retire in 2004 were 54.9
years old on average, lower than the 55.7 a year ago.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS published the report after nearly six months of
compiling and analyzing data gathered from a survey on retirement
that it conducted in March on employees from over 9,000 companies.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that about 63,000 people retired from work in
the industrial and service sectors last year.</P>
      <P>Some 32 percent of the retirees were over 60, down from the 74.12
percent in 1991, while 51.73 percent of those who retired in 2004
were between 50 and 59, posing a significant rise in comparison with
the level of 21.77 percent in 1991.</P>
      <P>The 50 to 59 age group made up the bulk of retirees in the
industrial and service sectors, the report said, noting there were
more people aged 40 to 49 choosing to retire, with 15.19 percent of
the 2004 retirees in this age group, up from the 10.55 percent a year
ago.</P>
      <P>The report attributed the trend to an increase of corporate
mergers in recent years. Many of these companies offer preferential

    <HEADLINE>DISPUTE CONTINUES OVER WHO IS TAITUNG COUNTY'S ACTING MAGISTRATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taitung  County,  Dec.  26 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The dispute over who is the
legitimate acting magistrate of Taitung County is continuing after an
official designated by the Ministry of the Interior as acting
magistrate was sworn in Monday to replace the newly elected
magistrate suspended by the ministry on the grounds that he has been
convicted of corruption.</P>
      <P>Lai Shun-hsien, secretary-general of the Taitung County
Government, was sworn in Monday afternoon as the acting magistrate
despite protests from more than 100 supporters of Wu Chun-li, who had
been suspended by an executive order from the interior ministry as
soon as he took his oath of office on Dec. 20.</P>
      <P>Under police protection, Vice Interior Minister Chien Tai-lang
presided over the swearing-in ceremony and witnessed the handover of
the county's seal to Lai. He expressed satisfaction that the
necessary procedure was completed so that the county government could
become functional again. He said that Lai will be acting magistrate
until a new magistrate is produced through a by-election.</P>
      <P>However, Wu's ex-wife, Kuang Li-chen, who had been designated by
Wu as deputy magistrate on Dec. 20 -- the day after their divorce
became effective -- insisted that she should be the legitimate acting
magistrate even if the ministry's order to suspend Wu was effective.
She vowed that she will continue to perform her duties at the county
government and receive visitors as usual in her capacity as deputy
magistrate regardless of Lai's so-called takeover.</P>
      <P>The ministry, on the other hand, contended that Wu had no right
to designate his ex-wife as a deputy because he had been suspended as
soon as he was sworn in.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu was seeking legal recourse against the interior
ministry. He filed a lawsuit Monday morning with the Public
Prosecutors Office in Taitung County, accusing interior ministry
officials of committing forgery.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the executive order declaring his suspension
reached him by e-mail on Dec. 19, while its date of issue in the
document was Dec. 20, the day of his swearing-in. This means that he
was suspended even before he could take the oath of office -- an
apparent violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.</P>
      <P>Later Monday afternoon, Wu flew to Taipei and filed a second
lawsuit with the Taipei High Administrative Court, seeking an
injunction that the interior ministry be stopped from executing the
order to suspend him.</P>
      <P>Wu explained that the court sentence that convicted him was about
his involvement in a corruption scandal while he was deputy speaker
of the Taitung County Council and should not apply to his new post.
Furthermore, he added, the ministry did not give him any opportunity
to present his side of the argument before having him suspended, and
the executive order was not presented to him personally and,
therefore, should not be considered as effective.</P>
      <P>Wu was sentenced to 16 years in prison in the first trial in
2002. The sentence was reduced to seven years in the second trial.
After he appealed, the Supreme Court overturned the sentence in the
second trial and returned he case for a retrial.</P>
      <P>The interior ministry has indicated that Wu can only be restored
to his post if a higher court acquits him from the corruption
charges.</P>
      <P>It remains to be seen how Lai could make the Taitung County
Government function because most members of the county council have
openly declared that they want no one else but Wu to be the
magistrate.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC government has contingency plans in
place to deal with any outbreaks of bird flu in Taiwan, the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The MAC said that although Chinese authorities are making public
their statistics on the disease, their actions are still too slow,
and neighboring countries as well as international organizations have
concerns about whether the numbers being released are accurate. The
MAC is urging China to accelerate their response time.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) reported Monday on its efforts to
monitor what is going on in China and the policies that Taiwan should
adopt to prevent the disease from coming to the island.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH report, the Office International des
Epizooties (OIE) has now pinpointed 33 places in China where the H5N1
virus has been discovered since January 2004. According to the
report, the first H5N1 virus found in a person in China this year was
in Hunan province. There have been six cases of human infections in
China; two of them have died.</P>
      <P>The DOH suggested that new vaccines and medicines should be
introduced while the island strengthens its umbrella of protection
against the virus.</P>
      <P>Infected birds must not be brought into the country, inspection
and quarantine mechanisms should be established, communities must be
properly educated about the disease and health care facilities should
be prepared for the worst, the DOH said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some universities that have distinctive
research programs but are excluded from the government's five-year,
NT$50 billion (US$1.49 billion) subsidy program for local colleges
and universities deserve part of the funds, the head of the nation's
top research institute said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee Yuan-tseh, president of Academia Sinica, cited the examples
of Chung Yuan Christian University's excellent research on membranes,
National Taiwan Normal University's education information center,
National Chung Cheng University's Taiwan culture center and Taipei
Medical University's stroke prevention center.</P>
      <P>He said that these universities deserve some funds from the
program to ensure the further development of their research. He made
the remarks when he was asked to comment on the recent protest by a
ranking official of National Chung Cheng University for being shut
out of the program aimed at helping 12 select universities raise
their level to that of international standards.</P>
      <P>"It is inappropriate for a ranking official to stage a sit-in in
front of the building of the Ministry of Education," Lee said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the number of colleges and universities in Taiwan
have ballooned over the past decade, but although the quantity has
increased, the quality hasn't.</P>
      <P>He cited those research-oriented universities as examples, saying
that the top seven such universities recruit only 12,000 students a
year, or just 4 percent of those who took part in the university
entrance examination, which he said is too few.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the government will appropriate NT$10
billion a year to upgrade 12 colleges and universities that are
included in the program, hoping that the number of recruitments can
reach 10 percent of those who take part in the entrance examination.</P>
      <P>Old and dilapidated classrooms or out-of-date equipment should
also be phased out so as to be at the same level of the elite schools
in the world, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MEDIA WATCH GROUPS BLAME POLITICIANS FOR MISSING REFORM DEADLINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Media Watch and two other civic groups
blamed both the ruling and opposition parties for failing to honor
their own words to give up control of media holdings by the Monday
deadline.</P>
      <P>Media Watch, Campaign for Media Reform and the Association of
Taiwan Journalists issued a joint statement Monday saying the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has failed to make good on
President Chen Shui-bian's promise to reform government-owned media,
such as Taiwan Television Enterprise (TTV) and Chinese Television
System (CTS).</P>
      <P>President Chen has lost credibility because he pledged during his
2000 campaign to make TTV and CTS publicly owned companies, a promise
he reiterated in his recent National Day speech, said the statement.</P>
      <P>The three groups also criticized Premier Frank Hsieh's proposal
to put government stock in the two companies in a trust, an idea that
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) also suggested for its so-called
"ill-gotten assets."</P>
      <P>It's ironic that the DPP, which vehemently opposed the KMT's
idea, should have come up with the same idea to handle the public
assets under its control, they said.</P>
      <P>They went on to lambaste previous and current Government
Information Office chiefs since Chen took power in 2000, because all
of these GIO heads have made grandiose promises to make good on the
DPP government's commitment to relinquish control of media holdings.</P>
      <P>Media reforms have turned out to be empty words because the
legislature failed to amend the law governing the transfer of
government stock in the two companies by the Dec. 26, 2005 deadline.
The three media watch groups urged lawmakers to pass the amendment by
Dec. 30.</P>
      <P>Neither has the KMT, which owned China Television Company (CTV)
and Broadcasting Corp. of China (BCC), shown any sincerity in playing
its part in the reform plan because it delayed to the very last
moment selling these two media groups, plus the Central Motion
Picture Company, to the China Times Group for NT$9.3 billion, said
the statement.</P>
      <P>The top management of CTV and BCC remained unchanged with the
sale, indicating that the KMT has also failed to honor its word that
political parties, the government and the military should give up
manipulation of the media, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>It blamed KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou for allowing the sale to be
negotiated behind closed doors, triggering protests by the employees
of the affected media.</P>

Courts Criticize Judges' Handling of Asylum
Cases

U.S. Federal appeals court judges around the
nation have repeatedly excoriated immigration
judges this year for what they call a pattern of
biased and incoherent decisions in asylum cases.
Citing cases from around the country, the court 
wrote of "a disturbing pattern" of misconduct in
immigration rulings that sent people back to co
untries where they had said they would face
persecution. The harsh criticism may stem in
partt from a surge in immigration cases before
the federal appeals courts. Immigration cases,
most involving asylum seekers, accounted for
about 17 percent of all federal appeals cases
last year, up from just 3 percent in 2001. In
the courts in New York and California, nearly 40
percent of federal appeals involved immigration
cases.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>DPP SLAMS KMT CHIEF OVER SALE OF ILL-GOTTEN PARTY ASSETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) lambasted opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
Monday over the sale of three controversial KMT-controlled news media
to a conglomerate led by China Times Group Chairman Yu Chien-hsin.</P>
      <P>"By selling off the party's three ill-gotten news media, Ma has
once again broken his promise of disposing of the KMT's assets in
accordance with the law and the principles of fairness and justice by
2008," DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang said.</P>
      <P>The KMT announced earlier in the day that it had sold its
controlling shares in the Broadcasting Corp. of China (BCC) , China
Television Co. (CTV) and the Central Motion Picture Corp. (CMPC) to
the Yu-led holding company for about NT$9.3 billion.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the KMT took over BCC from the Japanese
Broadcasting Association at the end of Japanese colonial rule, Lee
said the KMT was not entitled to sell off the company and should
instead have returned it to the national coffers.</P>
      <P>Noting that CTV and CMPC were established with earnings by KMT's
ill-gotten businesses amassed during its 55 years in power, Lee said
the KMT should also have returned them to the public coffers.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, Lee said, the KMT has on the one hand blocked the
enactment of a statute requiring the return of ill-gotten party
assets to the national coffers, and on the other "secretly" sold off
its ill-gotten assets to resolve its financial woes.</P>
      <P>Lee also branded Ma as a liar, claiming that Ma, who doubles as
mayor of Taipei, has backed off from his promise to reform and fairly
and justly deal with the KMT's ill-gotten party assets.</P>
      <P>"Judging from the KMT's selling of a plot of land in suburban
Taipei and the three news media outlets since Ma took over the helm
of the KMT in August this year, I don't think Ma will ever be willing
to honor his promise of reform," Lee added.</P>
      <P>Under a law revised two years ago, Monday was the deadline for
Taiwan's political parties, the government and the military to divest
themselves of their investments in television and radio stations.</P>
      <P>"The KMT has honored its previous promise of pulling out of media
operations, " said KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen, who termed the move

    <HEADLINE>SPECIAL LIAISON TEAM IN PLACE FOR CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has formed a special liaison
task force to ensure smooth proceeding of charter flight service
across the Taiwan Strait during the upcoming Chinese New Year
holiday, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-hsun made the remarks while briefing
the press on the preparations for direct cross-strait charter flights
for Taiwan citizens during the Chinese New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>A total of 72 flights jointly operated by six carriers from each
side of the Taiwan Strait will be available from Jan. 20 through Feb.
13, with each side operating 36 flights. Chinese New Year Day falls
on Jan. 29. The destinations will include Shanghai, Beijing,
Guangzhou and Xiamen in China, and Taipei and Kaohsiung in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As of Dec. 22, Liu said five Taiwan carriers -- China Airlines,
EVA Airways, UNI Airways, Mandarin Airlines and Far East Air
Transport -- have applied to operate a total of 30 cross-strait
flights during the holiday period. The Civil Aeronautics
Administration has not yet approved any of the applications, Liu
said, adding that no mainland Chinese airline has filed applications.</P>
      <P>Although local carriers' flight schedules have not yet been
finalized, they have accepted reservations since early this month,
Liu said, adding that the ticket prices for direct cross-strait
charter flights will be higher than those via a third place.</P>
      <P>During the holiday period, Liu said all relevant government
agencies have assigned staff members to handle emergencies and a
special liaison task force has been in place to deal with
cross-strait charter flight affairs.</P>
      <P>The MAC has also asked the Council of Agriculture and the
Department of Health to prepare publicity materials to prevent
invasion of avian flu virus and other contagious diseases during the
holiday charter flight period.</P>
      <P>The service target for the upcoming cross-strait charter flights

    <HEADLINE>NO CHANCE OF ETC SYSTEM FOR FREEWAYS BEING INAUGURATED JAN. 1: MOTC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The electronic toll collection (ETC) system
for freeways will not be able to be inaugurated next month as the
operator has claimed, Minister of Transportation and Communications
Lin Ling-san said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin's remarks at the Institute of Transportation under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) came as the
FETC, a subsidiary of the Far Eastern Group which will operate
the ETC system, recently published advertisements saying that the
system will be inaugurated Jan. 1, 2006.</P>
      <P>He noted that there are currently around 8 million vehicles in
Taiwan, but car owners are reluctant to install the on-board unit
(OBU) for the automatic toll-ticketing system because of its high
price. Only slightly more than 2,000 vehicles have been equipped with
OBUs so far, he added.</P>
      <P>In addition, there will be at least four toll lanes reserved for
OBU-equipped vehicles, raising concerns that this will lead to long
lines in lanes for vehicles not equipped with OBUs.</P>
      <P>Some legislators have also voiced concerns that the price for
installing the OBU is unreasonable, asking that the Taiwan Area
National Expressway Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications re-screen the price structure, Lin said.</P>
      <P>He added that the bureau will have the final say on the price of
OBU installation and the date of the ETC's inauguration.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin said that it might be difficult to open the
Hsuehshan Tunnel at the end of this year as scheduled. He said that
the MOTC is currently dealing with some of the flaws and deficiencies
found in the second inspection of the 13-kilometer tunnel, the
centerpiece of the 34-kilometer of the Peiyi Freeway linking Taipei

    <HEADLINE>HEALTH INSURANCE FOR INMATES NECESSARY: MOJ</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials from the Ministry of Justice
(MOJ) said Tuesday that it is necessary to provide national health
insurance coverage to prison inmates.</P>
      <P>MOJ officials have been in contact with their Department of
Health counterparts for discussions on technical problems pertaining
to the issue, said Wu Yu-ming, a commissioner with the MOJ's
Department of Corrections.</P>
      <P>A group of legislators urged Tuesday that the country's prison
inmates, numbering about 50,000, be allowed to join the national
health insurance program in a bid to better protect the prisoners'
human rights.</P>
      <P>Legislators Lin Kuo-ching, Lu Tien-lin, Huang Wei-che and Huang
Shu-fen from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party jointly held a
press conference Tuesday, calling for the immediate implementation of
new health regulations to make inmates eligible for national health
insurance coverage.</P>
      <P>Lin said it is ridiculous that while Taiwan calls itself "a
country of human rights, " its 50,000 inmates are excluded from the
national health insurance program.</P>
      <P>He noted that mainland Chinese spouses of Taiwan citizens are
entitled to join the national health insurance program and that even
illegal immigrants from China are provided with free health care
based on humanitarian considerations.</P>
      <P>Hung Pi-lan, an official from the Bureau of National Health
Insurance (BNHI) who attended the press conference, said that the
Executive Yuan instructed in November 2004 that relevant agencies
should begin to study the issue pertaining to national health
insurance coverage for inmates.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health authorities have since convened several
meetings with MOJ officials and conducted surveys on the matter, but
the prisoners have still not been provided coverage as several
technical problems remain to be tackled, Hung said.</P>
      <P>These problems include the support of medical and law enforcement
personnel, whether and how medical doctors and nurses should be
dispatched to prisons, and how prisoners should pay their national
health insurance premiums, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Hung, the government will have to subsidize the
health program with an additional NT$700 million (US$21.2 million) a
year if coverage is provided to the 50,000 inmates.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou denied Tuesday that the buyer of the three KMT news media
companies was financed with capital from China or Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he had asked Chang Che-shen, director of the KMT
Administrative Management Committee, about the allegations that the
party has sold the three companies to a Cayman Islands-registered
holding company which may have investment from China, and that he was
told by Chang that China Times Group Chairman Yu Chien-hsin has
invested in the company and that there is no Hong Kong capital or
Chinese capital involved in the purchase.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Pasuya Yao called for the
KMT to "give the public an explanation" about the sale of its
controlling shares in the Broadcasting Corp. of China (BCC) , China
Television Co. (CTV) and the Central Motion Picture Corp. (CMPC) to
the Yu-led holding company for about NT$9 billion (US$272.73
million).</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislators Huang Shih-chuo
and Lo Chih-ming accused the KMT at a press conference Tuesday of
selling the KMT's three news media organizations to an offshore
holding company that might be invested in by foreign companies.</P>
      <P>Huang questioned whether the China Times Group had the financial
viability to make the NT$9 billion purchase, pointing out that the
group recently shut down its China Times Evening News because of
financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>Lo quoted other media reports as saying that Hong Kong's Li Ka
Shing Group secretly financed the China Times Group in its purchase
of the three KMT companies and that Chang's recent trip to Hong Kong
proved the relationship.</P>
      <P>On this allegation, Ma said that Chang did visit Hong Kong
recently but that the trip had nothing to do with the purchase of the
three media firms.</P>
      <P>As to the issue of the KMT still being the major shareholder in
the Central Daily News and the China Daily News, Ma said that the KMT
will "keep on trying" to deal with these assets as soon as possible.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the operator of an
electronic toll collection (ETC) system for highways slated to be
inaugurated Jan. 1 said Tuesday that he is frustrated that the
system's scheduled start date has been postponed.</P>
      <P>Douglas Hsu, head of the FETC, a subsidiary of the Far Eastern
Group, made the remarks after Minister of Transportation and
Communications Lin Ling-san announced the postponement earlier the
same day.</P>
      <P>At issue are complaints about the high price of installing an
on-board unit (OBU) in cars to use the automatic toll-ticketing
system. The price currently stands at about NT$2,200 (US$65.67).</P>
      <P>Lin said the Taiwan Area National Expressway Bureau under the
ministry will have the final say on the OBU price tag and on the
start date for the ETC system.</P>
      <P>Hsu presided over a ceremony held at National Taiwan University's
sports stadium to announce that the FETC is ready to inaugurate the
system.</P>
      <P>Dressed like the head coach of an American football team, Hsu
said the ceremony means that the company has accomplished the task
that it was commissioned by the government to do, adding that the
company has given "a New Year's present to the public."</P>
      <P>Hsu insisted that the company will not budge on the price for
installing an OBU, pointing out that the company is not forcing
anyone to buy one. "Some people like the convenience that the OBUs
will provide and wouldn't mind even paying NT$5,000 to NT$10,000, "
he said.</P>
      <P>Hsu added that he couldn't say when the ETC system would be
inaugurated, pointing out that "the government has too many other
considerations."</P>
      <P>However, Chang Yung-chang, president of the FETC, said that the
company has applied to the MOTC to begin using the system on a trial
basis at some busy freeway toll booths on Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>There are currently around 8 million vehicles in Taiwan, but it
is estimated that only a little more than 2,000 vehicles have been

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 27 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Media watch group leaders on Tuesday urged
the ruling and opposition parties to make an apology for failing in
their task of having the government, political parties and military
withdraw completely from media operations by Monday's deadline.</P>
      <P>Media Watch Chairman Kuan Chung-hsiang, Campaign for Media Reform
convener Wei Ti, and Association of Taiwan Journalists President Lu
Tung-hsi, as well as Hung Chen-ling, assistant professor at National
Taiwan University's Graduate Institute of Journalism, made the call
at a news conference held at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Kuan indicated that President Chen Shui-bian made a promise to
reform government-owned media firms during the 2000 presidential
campaign and reiterated the promise in his recent National Day
speech.</P>
      <P>Now "the check has been bounced" since the government has failed
to divest itself of its investments in media firms by the stipulated
deadline of Dec. 26, Kuan said, adding that Chen should offer an
explanation for the failure.</P>
      <P>Kuan also lambasted the Executive Yuan for "playing an old army
game" of blaming the legislature as the culprit for the media reform
failure.</P>
      <P>Kuan drew a comparison between the Executive Yuan's large-scale
efforts to promote the arms procurement bill and what he called its
reluctance to give up its media holdings.</P>
      <P>At the news conference, the three media watch groups issued a
joint statement saying that media reform has turned out to be "empty
words" because the legislature failed to amend the law governing the
transfer of government stakes in two terrestrial TV stations, Taiwan
Television Enterprise and Chinese Television System, by the deadline.
They urged lawmakers to pass the amendment by Dec. 30.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING MUM ON TAIWAN'S OFFER TO PAY RESPECT TO LATE ARATS CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 27 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing continued to keep Taipei guessing
Tuesday on whether it will allow Chang Chun-hsiung, chairman of the
Taipei-based Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF), to attend the funeral
for the late Wang Dao-han, who headed the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Three days after Taiwan's chief mainland affairs official Joseph
Wu said Chang would like to visit Shanghai to pay his last respects
to Wang, Beijing officials have still not responded, although
Beijing's Xinhua news agency quoted members of Wang's family as
saying the previous day that Wang had told them before he died that
his funeral should be as simple as possible.</P>
      <P>"That means only a few of Wang's intimate relatives and close
friends will be allowed to pay their last respects at his funeral, "
Xinhua said, adding that "not all of Wang's friends and
representatives of some institutions would be invited."</P>
      <P>This has been viewed by some in Taiwan as a veiled rejection of
Chang's attendance at the funeral which is to be held in Shanghai on
Jan. 30.</P>
      <P>Beijing stopped all contact with Taiwan in 1999 after
then-President Lee Teng-hui characterized cross-strait ties as
"state-to-state relations."</P>
      <P>As ARATS Vice Chairman Sun Yafu and Secretary-General Li Yafei
had visited Taipei Feb. 3 to pay homage to Koo Cheng-fu, the chief of
SEF who died Jan. 3, political analysts believe Beijing will allow
SEF officials below Chang's rank to attend Wang's funeral.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD REFUTES CHARGE OF SELLING NATION'S ASSETS TOO CHEAPLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou on Tuesday denied charges that his party sold three media
outlets too cheaply that should have gone to the national coffers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Solidarity Union, a minor opposition party, said the KMT
has undersold "the property of the people of Taiwan." </P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, who is running for chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , said that by selling the party's
shareholdings in China Television Co. (CTV) and two other companies,
Ma has "pocketed a huge sum of cash, while winning the reputation as
a reformer."</P>
      <P>Ma responded by saying that "they are again trying to divert
attention," this time from the fact that the DPP had failed to act on
its promise to give up its shareholdings in two government-controlled
TV stations by the stipulated deadline of Dec. 26, 2005.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the KMT has completed all legal steps for getting
rid of its shares in CTV, the Broadcasting Corporation of China and
the Central Motion Picture Company by Monday night, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"We have done this to show the people that we're not just paying
lip service to reform," he said.</P>
      <P>Although DPP-appointed top managers at Taiwan Television
Enterprise (TTV) and China Television System (CTS) have quit, this is
not the point, Ma said, noting that the DPP pledged to turn the
companies into independent firms.</P>
      <P>As to DPP criticism about the price of the KMT's sale of its
holdings in the three media firms -- NT$9.3 billion, including NT$5.3
billion debt -- Ma said he was quite surprised to hear the criticism.</P>
      <P>Ma said that both sides had many factors to consider before
deciding to make the deal and that he would not call it an "under
sale." The KMT is responsible for the pensions and severance pay for
nearly 1,000 party workers, a financial burden that no other
political parties have, he noted.</P>
      <P>He called on all sectors of society to keep urging all parties
and the government to give up their shareholdings in media outlets
and stop making excuses or adopting "attention diverting" strategies
to cover up their failure to honor their own words.</P>
      <P>As to Government Information Office Minister Pasuya Yao's
accusation that KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen has violated the "spirit
of withdrawing from media" by hosting a weekly radio talk show, Ma
said he "definitely will look into the matter."</P>
      <P>Both the ruling and opposition parties had agreed that political
parties, the government and the military should "withdraw their
influence from the media" by Dec. 26, 2005.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 27 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The widow of Taiwan's late chief negotiator
with China, Koo Chen-fu, will go to Shanghai Wednesday to attend the
funeral of Wang Daohan, the president of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), a source
close to the Koo family said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Cecilia Y. Koo will be accompanied by her secretary and a
one-time close aide to her late husband. Her son, Koo Cheng-yun, who
heads Taiwan Cement Corp., will also attend, the source said.</P>
      <P>Wang died in a Shanghai hospital Saturday at the age of 90. His
funeral is scheduled for Dec. 30.</P>
      <P>Besides the Koo family members, former executive officials of the
Taipei- based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , which the late Koo
Chen-fu headed until his death this past January at the age of 87,
will also fly to Shanghai to attend Wang's funeral. They include Chiu
Chin-yi, Chiao Yen-ho and Lee Ching-ping.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former Shanghai mayor and mentor to Jiang Zemin, former
Chinese president and Communist Party chief, was instrumental in
starting rapprochement between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in
the early 1990s.</P>
      <P>He and Koo held landmark talks in Singapore in 1993, after Taipei
and Beijing agreed to their own interpretations of the "one China"
principle in what is known by some as the "1992 consensus, " although
many in Taiwan believe that no such consensus ever existed.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official organizations authorized by
their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Beijing unilaterally suspended regular ARATS-SEF dialogue in
mid-1999 when then-ROC President Lee Teng-hui redefined cross-strait
ties as a special "state-to-state" relationship.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Blood Donation Center is sending
out an urgent call to civic-minded people in the Hualien area to
donate blood, as supplies in the eastern part of the island are
dangerously low.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics prepared by its Hualien office, which provides
blood to hospitals in eastern Taiwan, the center said there are only
37 bags of type O blood, 133 bags of type A, 121 bags of type B and
12 bags of type AB in stock in Hualien, only a two-day supply. The
small amount of type O blood is particularly worrying as it is the "
universal donor" type.</P>
      <P>Wang Yun-lung, the director of the blood center's Hualien office
said blood supplies are usually tight in the winter but the current
shortage is more serious than in the past.</P>
      <P>In order to replenish the blood reserves, Wang said his office
will organize seven blood donation drives in January.</P>
      <P>Wang said his office used to depend heavily on donations from
soldiers and students, but since schools and the military have
stopped giving these people time off to donate, supplies have been
tight.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VOTE-BUYING STILL A COMMON PRACTICE: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
despite the government's efforts over the past five years,
vote-buying is still a common practice, and the just concluded
"three-in-one" elections were worse than last year's legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>President Chen made the comments when he attended the
commencement ceremony of newly recruited agents of the
Bureau of Investigation under the Ministry of Justice after
their completion of a training program.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has done a great deal to crack down on
election bribery since 2000, the president lamented that old habits
die hard, and the public is still looking for better results.</P>
      <P>"There is great room for improvement, " Chen said, adding that
vote-buying is still rampant and the practice was even more serious
in the Dec. 3 elections for city and county chiefs, city and county
councilors, and village and township chiefs than last December's
legislative elections, which he said poses a threat to the healthy
development of Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>Since it is difficult to obtain solid evidence of vote-buying,
the president urged law enforcers to look closely at people who tread
on gray areas of the law to strengthen the government's credibility
and authority.</P>
      <P>The president said that prosecution and investigation officials
must work actively to forestall any irregularities in the March
speaker and deputy speaker elections for city and county councils.</P>
      <P>Before attending the ceremony, the president also toured the
newly inaugurated anti-narcotics museum.</P>
      <P>The president visited a section of the museum dedicated to
simulating what it's like to be in a club where drugs like ecstasy
and marijuana are used.</P>
      <P>The museum, built at a cost of about NT$10 million (US$298,500),

    <HEADLINE>MOEA TO RETHINK PLAN TO CUT PREFERENTIAL CORPORATE TAX TREATMENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs will
further study if it is necessary to reduce the preferential tax
treatment for the industrial sector following the introduction of the
minimum tax rate system, Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, the main purpose of offering preferential tax
treatment to the industrial sector is to boost its development, but
before making any changes, the government needs to consider if the
industries are being given sufficient time to adapt to the changes.</P>
      <P>Ho said she was very happy that the Ministry of Finance (MOF) had
agreed to postpone the plan to cut the preferential tax treatment.</P>
      <P>Ho was commenting on the MOF's decision to delay a plan to revise
a bylaw of the Statute for Upgrading Industries to reduce the
preferential tax treatment for emerging industries that have
strategic importance, amid strong opposition to the planned revision
from the hi-tech industrial sector.</P>
      <P>Currently, strategic industries enjoy tax deductions of up to 50
percent on their investments in machinery and equipment for
industrial upgrading. These industries also enjoy tax exemptions for
five years on their profits.</P>
      <P>To avoid a double incentive, the MOF has proposed changing the
bylaw, for implementation next year, in such a way that these
industries could only enjoy one of the preferential treatments,
instead of both.</P>
      <P>The plan was strongly objected to by the industrial sector,
especially with the minimum tax rate system set to take effect
starting Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan on Dec. 9 passed a law which requires
companies that earn more than NT$2 million a year to pay between 10
percent and 12 percent in corporate income tax. Meanwhile,
high-income individuals who earn more than NT$6 million per year are
required to pay at least 20 percent in personal income tax.</P>

      <P>The Government Information Office (GIO)
will ask the Ministry of Economic Affairs and national security
agencies to probe into the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) recent
sale of three news media outlets to determine whether any Chinese
capital was involved, the GIO head said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>GIO Minister Pasuya Yao said that the buyer -- a venture company
invested in by a Cayman Islands-registered holding company which is
in turn invested in and run by the China Times Group -- will also be
asked to produce documents on its capital and financial structures to
determine whether it is financed by any capital from China or
overseas.</P>
      <P>The KMT announced a day earlier that it has sold its controlling
stakes in the Broadcasting Corp. of China (BCC), China Television Co.
(CTV) and the Central Motion Picture Corp. (CMPC) to the China Times
Group-run holding company for about NT$9 billion (US$272.73 million).</P>
      <P>Yao reiterated that according to Taiwan law, terrestrial
television companies must be 100-percent Taiwan owned and operated,
meaning that no mainland Chinese or foreign investors are allowed to
own shares in them.</P>
      <P>Opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislators Huang Shih-chuo
and Lo Chih-ming accused the KMT at a press conference Tuesday of
selling the KMT's three news media organizations to a buyer that is
possibly backed with capital from China or other foreign countries.</P>
      <P>Huang questioned whether the China Times Group had the financial
viability to make the NT$9 billion purchase, pointing out that the
group recently shut down its China Times Evening News because of
financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>Lo quoted other media reports as saying that Hong Kong's Li Ka
Shing Group might have secretly financed the China Times Group in its
purchase of the three KMT companies.</P>
      <P>Under a law revised two years ago, Monday was the deadline for
Taiwan's political parties, government and military to divest
themselves of their investments in television and radio stations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>State Public Prosecutor-General Wu
Ying-chao announced on Tuesday that he was resigning to take
responsibility for not stamping out vote-buying in the just-concluded
"three-in-one" elections.</P>
      <P>Wu's decision to resign came after President Chen Shui-bian's
remarks earlier in the day that bribery is still rampant despite the
government's crackdown efforts over the past five years and that
vote-buying in the Dec. 3 elections was even more serious than in the
legislative elections in late 2004.</P>
      <P>Wu presided over a review meeting Tuesday in Wulai, Taipei County
on the results of anti-graft efforts in the run-up to the Dec. 3
elections.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued later by the Supreme Prosecutor's Office,
Wu said prosecutors put in long hours and had actually done quite a
lot to stop vote-buying, but they were nevertheless severely
criticised and misunderstood.</P>
      <P>As of Dec. 26, prosecutors have filed charges in 750 bribery
cases and prosecuted 2,511 people, Wu said, adding that whether in
terms of cases or anti-bribery campaigns, they have set new highs.</P>
      <P>But regrettably, some people and civic groups don't see the
positive side of their efforts, Wu said. As the leader of all
prosecutors, Wu said he felt uneasy and was deeply worried about the
situation.</P>

governor should avoid political intervention, says Confindustria

Confindustria president Luca Cordero di Montezemolo said in

should be free of political intervention in order to avoid veto and
counter-veto campaigns which will deal another blow to the national
credibility. He therefore suggested that the nomination would not be

    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of several civic groups devoted to
education reforms urged lawmakers Tuesday to include a clause
supporting "zero tolerance of physical punishment of children" in the
Education Basic Law.</P>
      <P>The members made the call one day before the Legislative Yuan's
Education and Culture Committee is set to review draft amendments to
the law.</P>
      <P>Shih Ying, a leading member of the Humanistic Education
Foundation, said giving up physical punishment does not mean giving
up on disciplining children.</P>
      <P>Instead, the purpose of banning physical punishment is to
encourage teachers to make more effort on education and to think how
to educate children with more reasonable and efficient methods, Shih
said.</P>
      <P>Huang Yu-chi from the Parents Society of Overseas Students argued
that physical punishment is violence and that a civilized country
should not allow violence in education.</P>
      <P>According to data from the Humanistic Education Foundation, 101
countries around the world have banned physical punishment of
children in school, and more than 20 have implemented a comprehensive
ban on physical punishment.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, more than 90 civic organizations, 60 academics led by

Iraq Vote Shows Sunnis Are Few in New Military 

An analysis of preliminary voting results
released Monday from the Dec. 15 parliamentary
election suggests that in contrast to the
remarkable surge in Sunni Arab participation in
the political process, the Sunnis still have
comparatively little representation in the Iraqi
security forces. The indication is troubling
because Sunni Arabs, who are about 20 percent
of Iraq's population, came out in greater
numbers largely as a response to the recent
domination of the government by Shiites and
Kurds. In particular, Sunni Arabs say they fear
that the security forces will be used against
them.

Wall Street Journal: Playing Detective,
At Medical Journal, Editor Finds Truth
Hard to Track Down

In 1992, the British Medical Association's 
flagship journal published a study led by 
Indian doctor Ram B. Singh with a striking 
finding: Heart-attack victims who ate more fiber,
fruits and vegetables for a year cut their risk 
of death during that period by almost half.
A year later, Richard Smith, the journal's 
editor, received two letters questioning the 
findings. What followed was an extraordinary 
inquiry stretching over a dozen years and 5,000 
miles. Along the way, Dr. Singh contended that 
termites had eaten crucial data and Dr. Smith 
spent four years begging a busy statistician to 
deliver a report. Finally this July, the
journal, called BMJ, lowered the boom.
Editors said they had "reasonable grounds to
doubt the validity of the 1992 paper" and
published an article calling the data in another
paper submitted in 1994 " either fabricated or
falsified." The long investigation points to a
problem in medical research: While prestigious
journals act as gatekeepers, awarding legitimacy
to some papers and withholding it from others,
they have little power to detect or investigate
questionable findings. The outside experts who
review articles before publication often fail to
catch faked results.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Fund-raising programs of many local
public-interest groups have been affected by the massive post-tsunami
relief campaign, United Way Taiwan (UWT) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Quoting tallies compiled by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, a UWT spokesman said annual philanthropic
donations in Taiwan amount to NT$40 billion. After a devastating
tsunami hit South and Southeast Asian countries on Dec. 26, 2004,
Taiwan citizens donated about NT$5 billion for various relief
programs in the hardest-hit regions.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by UWT between June and July this
year, the spokesman said, 60 percent of local public-interest groups
surveyed said tsunami-related relief efforts have affected their
fund-raising drives.</P>
      <P>About 10 percent of the respondents said the philanthropic
donations they received after the tsunami disaster have declined by
more than 31 percent from their previous level.</P>
      <P>The UWT distributed questionnaires to 1,444 public-interest
groups which have received its financial aid over the years and
received 415 valid replies.</P>
      <P>In addition to the tsunami factor, the spokesman said, a domestic
economic slowdown and the public's increasing reluctance to donate

      <P>State Public Prosecutor-General Wu
Ying-chao said Tuesday that he chose to resign now because it will
make more room for the executive and legislative branches to engage
in rational discussion on how the nation's top prosecutor should be
fielded in the future.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks in an interview with CNA after tendering his
resignation earlier in the day -- apparently in response to a
complaint by President Chen Shui-bian that vote-buying had become
more serious in the run-up to the Dec. 3 local government elections,
compared with the legislative elections in 2004.</P>
      <P>He said that actually the idea of quitting crossed his mind a
week ago, and that he hopes the ruling and opposition parties can
have rational discussions on whether a nominee named by the president
in the future for the post of public prosecutor-general needs the
approval of the legislature.</P>
      <P>Currently, a nominee for the post is named by the minister of
justice and appointed by the president, without consent from the
legislature. Opposition legislators have complained that as a
political appointee with no clearly defined term of office, the
public prosecutor-general is susceptible to influence from the
president and the premier.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" of the two main opposition parties -- the
Kuomintang and the People First Party -- have introduced legislation
through their legislative caucuses, seeking to make the public
prosecutor-general an independent post with a clearly set term of
office, so that he or she will be armed with the necessary power to
investigate and prosecute wrongdoings by the president and the
premier.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PENSION REFORM EXPECTED TO BE IMPLEMENTED FROM FEB. 1: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday that the
government's pension reform program is expected to be implemented
beginning Feb. 1, 2006, if the reform scheme is passed by the
Examination Yuan in time.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the last Executive Yuan meeting of the year, Hsieh
said that the pension reform program should be implemented as soon as
possible to help achieve social justice and fairness as President
Chen Shui-bian has advocated.</P>
      <P>Under the existing scheme, some retirees receive more money per
month than they actually earned prior to retirement, due mainly to
the preferential 18-percent deposit interest rate available to
retired civil servants, military personnel and teachers.</P>
      <P>"This unreasonable phenomenon should be changed because it has
become a bone of contention for the general public and a heavy
financial burden for the government, " President Chen said earlier
this year.</P>
      <P>According to a reform scheme adopted by the Examination Yuan, for
retirees who worked as civil servants for at least 25 years, the
post-retirement income -- including monthly pension, the preferential
deposit interest and year-end bonus money -- will not be more than 85
percent of the pay they were receiving at the time of their
retirement. The ratio will be no more than 95 percent for those who
worked for at least 35 years.</P>
      <P>Slightly more than 80,000 current and retired civil servants will
see their pensions reduced under the new scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition to civil servants, the new scheme will also be
applied to military personnel and school teachers.</P>
      <P>Looking back on the past 11 months, Hsieh said that the Executive
Yuan's administrative operations could be described in one sentence:
Economic growth has staggered forward while reform has continued amid
controversy.</P>
      <P>He said that despite a year that featured high oil prices, the
avian flu threat, and disturbances arising from Beijing's passage of
an anti-secession law, Taiwan's economy still managed to grow.</P>
      <P>Despite pessimism at some points during the year, the economy's
performance has turned out to be "not bad at all," he added.</P>
      <P>The premier said there are several points worth celebrating,
including the fact that the unemployment rate dipped to a five-year
low, per capita income exceeded US$15,000, the central government's
tax revenues has topped NT$100 billion (US$3.03 billion) and the real
estate market experienced moderate growth, to name a few.</P>
      <P>As to the reform programs the government has been pushing, Hsieh
said that it is normal that reforms are sometimes controversial and
that history shows that not all reforms are successful. Nevertheless,
he said that it is laudable that despite some controversy, Taiwan has
been able to march forward and make breakthroughs in reform.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CSBC ORDERS STAND AT US$2.68 BILLION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) said in
a report it issued Wednesday that the company currently has orders
totalling more than NT$90 billion (US$2.68 billion) to build vessels.</P>
      <P>The written report was presented by the CSBC to the Science and
Technology Committee of the Legislative Yuan which is set to review
the CSBC's budget for next year.</P>
      <P>The brisk business will help the company continue its efforts to
improve its financial structure and promote its privatization, the
CSBC report said.</P>
      <P>The CSBC said that it currently has orders worth NT$78.32 billion
to build 51 commercial ships and orders worth NT$12.61 billion to
build 30 military vessels.</P>
      <P>It has therefore listed its post-tax profits at NT$285 million
for 2006, up 17.28 precent from the figure for 2005, mainly because
of increased business.</P>
      <P>Following on the heels of the hot demand seen in 2003 and 2004,
orders for new ships reached a peak in May 2005, with orders and
prices for new vessels declining in the latter half of the year, the
CSBC said.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, the company said that most market research reports
have not been optimistic about the period to the end of the first
quarter of 2006, the company said.</P>
      <P>The report said that because of steep competition and a slump in
vessel prices, the company suffered heavy losses in 2000 and then
launched a "rejuvenation program" in 2001, under which one
first-grade department and 50 second-grade units were phased out and
2,280 staff members were axed, while those who stayed on took a
35-percent pay cut.</P>
      <P>Besides the downsizing move, the CSBC has also adopted many other
measures to cope with cut-throat competition in the sluggish global
shipbuilding market which have greatly improved the financial
situation of the company.</P>
      <P>The company said that it has registered profits every month since
2001 and that its competitiveness is on par with Japan's and South
Korea's shipbuilding industries.</P>
      <P>The ships designed and built by the company have also won
recognition in the international community, the report said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF 'VIETNAMESE BRIDES' DECLINES DUE TO INTERVIEW SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ho Chi Minh City,  Dec.  28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of Vietnamese women
marrying Taiwan men plummeted this year, mainly because of the
resumption of the individual interview program by the Republic of
China government, a liaison source said here Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Due to the regulation that Vietnamese women planning to marry
Taiwanese men are required to visit the Taiwan liaison office in Ho
Chi Minh City or Hanoi to be interviewed individually, the number of
Vietnamese woman marrying Taiwan nationals declined by 70 percent to
3,461 in the first 11 months of this year from 12,202 in 2004, said
Chen Shan-lin, representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Ho Chi Minh City.</P>
      <P>The ROC government withdrew the individual interview regulation
in 1999 and allowed potential "Vietnamese brides" to be interviewed
in groups, resulting in a record high 13,863 marriages between
Vietnamese women and Taiwan men that year.</P>
      <P>The figure averaged 12,000 annually between 2000 and 2004, Chen
said, adding that the Taiwan office in Ho Chi Minh City approved a
total of 90,215 Vietnamese women to go to Taiwan after marrying
Taiwan citizens between 1995 and November 2005. The total number
exceeds 100,000 if the approvals issued by Taiwan's liaison office in
Hanoi are included, he added.</P>
      <P>Under the individual interview system, the average period between
a Vietnamese woman filing an application and departing for Taiwan is
about eight months, Chen said, adding that the average wait for an
interview in Ho Chi Minh City is about six months due to the large
number of applicants.</P>
      <P>Consequently, marriage brokers have since this year begun to
encourage potential "Vietnamese brides" to submit their applications
in Hanoi instead of Ho Chi Minh City to accelerate the process, Chen
said, noting that the average wait for an interview in the Vietnamese
capital is only between one and two months.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, potential "Taiwan husbands" usually fly into
Vietnam on the weekend where arrangements are made for them to meet
with their potential brides. If the couple hit it off, they usually
get married Saturday or Sunday and then jointly file applications
with the Taiwan offices in Vietnam for entrance into Taiwan Monday or
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>About half of the Taiwan men marrying Vietnamese women are
between 30 and 40 years old, while about 23 percent are aged between
41 and 50. By comparison, some 77 percent of the Vietnamese women
marrying Taiwan men are between 20 and 30 years old, while some 14
percent are under the age of 20.</P>
      <P>Nearly 67 percent of the Taiwan men marrying Vietnamese women
have a junior high school level education, and about 20 percent have
a senior high school education. By comparison, 63 percent of the
Vietnamese women have an elementary school education, and 28 percent
have a junior high education, according to Chen.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About 1,500 people around the island making
a living as scavengers are being helped by a program set up by the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) to help them adapt to
the new garbage assortment program, an EPA official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the negative effect on the scavengers'
livelihood of the administration's decision to expand the compulsory
garbage assortment program from several metropolitan areas to the
whole country Jan.1, the official said the EPA came up with the
program to cushion the impact on scavengers.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the EPA official said, part of the local
governments' revenues from selling recyclable material has been used
to buy tricycles or pushcarts for scavengers to ply their trade.</P>
      <P>Also, the official said, the local governments' garbage
collecting teams have offered safety training programs to scavengers
and enlisted their help in gathering recyclable materials in alleys
and lanes located far from the regular routes of garbage trucks.</P>
      <P>Citing the Taichung City Government's program as an example, the
official said that scavengers there were given certificates, badges
and jerseys after completing the city government's training program
and that these individuals are now allowed to enter official
buildings and apartment buildings to collect recyclable materials
rather than being confined to searching through garbage bins located
on the streets.</P>
      <P>The official said the EPA is also seeking donations from private
firms to buy pushcarts and tricycles for scavengers.</P>

      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Chang Chun-hsiung's offer to visit Shangahi to pay his last respects
to Wang Daohan, the late chairman of the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARTAS), has been declined, a SEF official
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>You Ying-lung, SEF secretary-general, said the SEF had asked its
Beijing counterpart the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS) to respond quickly to its offer Tuesday and that the
ARATS replied on Wednesday by declining the offer.</P>
      <P>The ARATS also quoted Wang's family as saying that they want "as
simple a funeral as possible" and regret that they cannot "invite all
the good friends of our father and representatives of the
organizations to Shanghai for the funeral."</P>
      <P>You said that Chang "will respect the wishes" of Wang's family by
not attending the funeral, adding that he will pay his respects
at a later time when the chance arises.</P>
      <P>Chang sent a letter of condolence to Wang Daohan's son Wang Yu
upon learning the news of his father's death Saturday. In the letter,
Chang affirmed Wang's contribution to cross-strait relations and
expressed the hope that Wang's family could inform him of the funeral
time so that he could go pay his last respects in person.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations set up by
Taipei and Beijing, respectively, to handle cross-strait affairs in
the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Reports said that Chinese leaders will attend Wang's funeral
scheduled for Dec. 30 and that representatives from Taiwan will
include family members of Koo Chen-fu, late SEF chairman and
predecessor of Chang, those who were involved in the "Koo-Wang" talks
in Singapore in 1993, former ranking officials of the SEF, as well as
representatives from the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang, People First Party and New Party.</P>
      <P>When Koo passed away in January, Wang sent two ranking ARATS
officials to Taipei to attend Koo's funeral.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang signed four agreements on cross-strait technical
affairs during the 1993 Singapore talks, which paved the way for the
later institutionalized channel of consultations between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>But the cross-strait dialogue was suspended in mid-1999 after
then-President Lee Teng-hui's remarks defining cross-strait relations
as "special state-to-state" in nature.</P>
      <P>Beijing has not resumed the dialogue with Taipei during the past
five years since the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party
came to power.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Wednesday that Taiwan needs to take several steps,
including resuming dialogue, signing a peace accord and expanding
economic and trade exchanges with China, in order to gain the
initiative in cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>During an interview with the Voice of America, Ma said he will
deal with cross-strait relations based on the principle of "Taiwan
first."</P>
      <P>Ma proposed that Taiwan seek to resume talks with China as soon
as possible and sign a peace accord that covers the establishment of
a military confidence-building mechanism to avoid a cross-strait
military crisis.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan should expand its economic and trade
relations with China, especially lifting its ban on direct
cross-strait transportation, business and postal links, so that
Taiwan businesses can reach their market and obtain raw materials
faster, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"Only if Taiwan adopts a more open policy will the country enjoy
the opportunity to secure the initiative in cross-strait relations, "
Ma said.</P>
      <P>He said more Chinese citizens should be allowed to visit Taiwan
to give them a better understanding of Taiwan's democracy and
economic prosperity, which he said will help build up friendship
between the people of the two sides and avoid the outbreak of war.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's national security must not depend solely on weapons but
on working toward a cessation of cross-strait hostility through
political, cultural and artistic means," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma said people of this generation should manage the cross-strait
political dispute properly, although they may not have the ability to

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT INTROSPECTIVE SINCE LOCAL ELECTIONS SETBACK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that he has been introspective over the past several weeks in the
wake of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) defeat in
the Dec. 3 local government elections and has been pondering
delivering an important speech to the country on Jan. 1, 2006.</P>
      <P>Chen denied that he has been left a "lame duck" as some
opposition politicians have claimed and that instead, he has been
thinking deeply about the reasons behind the DPP's poor showing in
the "three-in-one" elections.</P>
      <P>The president further said that his forthcoming New Year's
address will be more significant than his inauguration speeches in
2000 and 2004.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks outside the National Taiwan University
Hospital where he received his regular annual health check-up.
Medical professionals at the center gave the president high marks for
his health.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said that he "stumbled and fell" upon the
DPP's humiliating defeat in the latest elections, in which the ruling
party won only six of the 23 city mayor and county magistrate posts
up for grabs. The opposition "pan-blue alliance" led by the
Kuomintang won 17 posts.</P>
      <P>Despite the setback, Chen stressed that he has not been defeated.
Instead, he said, he has become even stronger, living up to his being
"the Son of Taiwan" -- who becomes more resilient and stronger after
his arms are broken.</P>
      <P>He offered his appreciation to "everybody" for helping him to
avoid becoming "lame" after the elections.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he declined to answer reporters' questions as to
whether he will try to retain State Public Prosecutor-General Wu
Ying-chao who offered to resign Monday to "make more room for the
executive and legislative branches to engage in rational discussion
on how the nation's top prosecutor should be fielded in the future."</P>
      <P>Wu offered to resign apparently in response to a complaint by
President Chen Shui-bian that "vote-buying had become more serious in
the run-up to the Dec. 3 local government elections, compared with
the legislative elections in 2004."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S ADOPTION OF ANTI-SESSION LAW TOP 2005 CHINA NEWS STORY: CNA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan and
the appreciation of the Chinese currency were the top two news
stories out of China, according to a straw poll by senior editors at
Taiwan's Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>The Chinese National People's Congress passed the law on March
14, 2005, threatening the "use of non-peaceful means" against Taiwan
should it move formally toward independence. The law, which aims at
deterring independence and promoting unification, drew immediate
condemnation from Taiwan and the international community.</P>
      <P>Pressured by the United States and European countries, China
announced the appreciation of the yuan in July by 2.1 percent and
replaced its fixed peg to the U.S. dollar by linking it to a basket
of foreign currencies.</P>
      <P>The third top story was China's latest manned space flight with
the launch of the Shenzhou VI Oct. 12. The two astronauts aboard the
spaceship returned triumphantly to earth after completing several
experiments in space.</P>
      <P>The fourth top story was Chinese National Congress appointing
President Hu Jintao as chairman of the Central Military Commission in
March, making him the paramount leader in control of the party, the
government as well as the military.</P>
      <P>The fifth top story was both sides of the Taiwan Strait reaching
an agreement on "two-way, non-stop and multiple-point" charter
flights during the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays in 2005, the first
two-way direct flights across the Taiwan Strait after a hiatus of 56
years.</P>
      <P>The sixth and the seventh top stories were the face-off between
China and Japan over the exploitation of oil in the East China Sea
and the increasing worries by the World Health Organization after
several outbreaks of avian flu in China. Taiwan also heightened its
alert in view of the close personnel exchanges between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait and China's lack of transparency in
reporting disease outbreaks in the past.</P>
      <P>China's huge foreign currency reserves was the eighth top story.
Its foreign currently reserve topped US$913 billion, surpassing Japan
to become the country with the largest foreign currency reserves.</P>
      <P>The six-party talks with the mediation of China resulted in North
Korea agreeing to give up the development of nuclear weapons. China
emerged as the biggest winner in the talks after it proved it could
play a major role in international affairs.</P>
      <P>Rounding out the top-10 was China's two-pronged
carrot-and-stick approach toward Taiwan. China has on the one hand
tried to intimidate Taiwan with the Anti-Session Law, but on the
other tried to woo the people of Taiwan and Taiwan businessmen
with several incentives, and has given the red-carpet treatment
to pro-unification opposition leaders from Taiwan, trying to drive a
wedge between the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 10-top news stories were determined as of events that took
place previous to Nov. 30, 2005.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW LABOR PENSION SYSTEM TOP 2005 TAIWAN STORY: CNA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The adoption of the new labor pension
system was selected by senior editors from the Central News Agency in
a straw poll as the year's top Taiwan news story.</P>
      <P>The July 1 implementation of the new labor pension system, which
will affect 3.16 million or 60 percent of Taiwan's workers, topped
the list of significant domestic news for 2005.</P>
      <P>Second was the precedent-setting direct charter flights across
the Taiwan Strait during the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays, a
service that was reinstated after a 56-year hiatus.</P>
      <P>The third was Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan's historic visit to
China in May, which led to China's goodwill gestures to Taiwan, such
as offering Taiwan two pandas as gifts -- which Taiwan has yet to
accept -- importing Taiwan fruits at zero-tariff and allowing Chinese
tourists to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Fourth was the scandal revolving around the construction of
Kaohsiung's mass rapid transit (MRT) system, a scandal that surfaced
after Thai laborers working on the project rioted in late August in
protest against their inhumane treatment by a local manpower
management company.</P>
      <P>In connection with the MRT scandal, Council of Labor Affairs
Chairwoman Chen Chu and acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai resigned.</P>
      <P>The MRT scandal story was followed by the passing of a set of
constitutional amendments that included raising the bar for future
changes to the ROC Constitution, cutting the number of seats in the
legislature by approximately half and extending lawmakers' terms of
office to four years. Lawmakers will also be elected under a new
system called "single constituency with two votes."</P>
      <P>Sixth on the list was the landslide victory of Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou as the first directly elected chairman of the Kuomintang
(KMT) . He defeated Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng in the
race.</P>
      <P>Ranked seventh was the legislature's passing of the controversial
bill concerning the organization of the National Communications
Commission (NCC).</P>
      <P>Eighth was the Executive Yuan cutting the budget for purchasing
three major military weapons from NT$610.8 billion down to NT$340
billion, and yet the government still could not win the KMT and
People First Party's (PFP) support for the bill at the legislature.</P>
      <P>Ninth among the top 10 was the two major opposition parties - the
KMT and the PFP -- losing a court battle in which they claimed that
President Chen Shui-bian's election in 2004 was invalid and that the
Central Election Commission oversaw an invalid presidential election.</P>
      <P>The election story was followed by another election story -- the
first-ever "three-in-one" elections on Dec. 3 that the government
said saved the nation NT$600 million by electing city, county and
town chiefs and council members simultaneously instead of holding the
elections separately.</P>

Defense Lawyers in Terror Cases Plan Challenges
Over Spy Efforts 


Defense lawyers in some of the United
States' biggest terrorism cases say they plan
to bring legal challenges to determine whether
the National Security Agency used illegal
wiretaps against several dozen Muslim men tied
to Al Qaeda. The lawyers said in interviews that
they wanted to learn whether the men were
monitored by the agency and, if so, whether
the government withheld critical information or
misled judges and defense lawyers about how and
why the men were singled out. While some civil
rights advocates, legal experts and members of
Congress have said President Bush did not have
authority to order eavesdropping by the security
agency without warrants, the White House and the
Justice Department continued on Tuesday to
defend the legality and propriety of the
program.

Wall Street Journal: Different Agenda,
Latest Answer To Mideast Crisis: Fix the Economy

James Wolfensohn, the former head of the
World Bank, who is now a top diplomat in
the Gaza Strip region charged with fixing the
beleaguered Palestianian economy, has helped
resolve border disputes, found funding for a sea
port and safeguarded a chunk of the region's
agricultural industry by rounding up a group
of private investors, including himself. 
Wolfensohn is betting that the Middle East 
conflict needs not only a political settlement 
but also an economic one. Prosperity, he 
believes, will blunt the appeal of extremism 
and give Palestinians a stake in building a new 
state after years of nearly continuous 
violence. He has one eye supporting the efforts 
of Palestinian moderates in January's 
parliamentary elections. The other is on 
fashioning an economy that could underpin any 
resolution for the long term.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>LABOR COUNCIL SPELLS OUT STANCE ON IMPORTING FARM LABOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Job opportunities for local farmers are the
top concern of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) , although the
Council of Agriculture (COA) is assessing the country's need to
import foreign laborers to work in the domestic agriculture sector,
CLA Chairman Lee Ying-yuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a legislative committee while answering questions
from lawmakers who expressed their doubts about the proposal of the
Council of Agriculture (COA), Lee said that the COA is still studying
the possibility of introducing migrant workers to Taiwan's
agriculture sector based on the situation in the domestic labor
market in line with a quota management system.</P>
      <P>Before responding to the COA's initiative to import foreign
workers to help improve a labor shortage in local farming villages,
the CLA will stick to its stance that Taiwan workers' rights and
interests must not be affected, he insisted.</P>
      <P>During the legislative committee meeting, some lawmakers said that
they were highly skeptical about how the CLA would manage to follow
its own quota restrictions as it has decided to open the domestic
labor market wider to foreign workers at a time when there are
already some 320,000 alien laborers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The CLA decided last month to allow up to 20,000 alien laborers
to be imported into certain "dangerous and dirty" manufacturing
industries over a six-year period from January next year. The council
has estimated that the number of foreign workers in Taiwan may
increase by 5,000 to 10,000 in 2006.</P>
      <P>Lin Chi-chang, secretary-general at the Yunlin Farmers'
Association in central Taiwan, voiced his opposition to the idea of
importing alien farmers, and urged relevant government agencies to
seriously consider if this is the best course of action.</P>
      <P>Arguing that the government must not harm local farmers by
importing foreign farmers now that Taiwan farmers already earn less
than workers in other sectors, Lin urged relevant authorities to be
mindful of serious consequences if it goes through with the plan.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the government claims that it would only
"phase in" foreign farmers to "complement" Taiwan's aging
agricultural population, he cautioned the government against a
possible know-how exodus after migrant farmers return to their
homelands.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAMES SOONG DOES NOT SUPPORT 'GRAND COALITION' WITH DPP: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong does not support the idea of forming a "grand coalition
government" with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,
according to Kuomintang (KMT) Secretary-General Chan Chun-po
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen quoted Chan as saying at the party's
Central Standing Committee meeting that the media was "exaggerating"
when they reported that Soong and Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng were "inclined toward" the idea of forming a grand coalition
government with the DPP.</P>
      <P>Soong has also made it clear that he does not support the idea,
Chan said, noting that Soong asked PFP Policy Center Director Chang
Hsien-yao to state his position on the matter.</P>
      <P>Wang has been touted as a potential candidate to replace Premier
Frank Hsieh when President Chen Shui-bian reshuffles his Cabinet,
probably in January. Such a move has been anticipated after Chen's
DPP was resoundingly defeated in the Dec. 3 local government
elections.</P>
      <P>If Wang leaves the KMT to serve in the DPP government, the
"pan-blue alliance's" slim majority in the legislature will become
even thinner.</P>
      <P>Therefore, when Wang and Soong met last Saturday, observers were
curious as to what they were discussing. One of their "consensuses, "
according to media reports, was that if Chen asks the opposition
parties to form the Cabinet, the concept of a "grand coalition" can
be considered.</P>
      <P>However, Wang told the media that if the president is interested
in having opposition members in his Cabinet, he should talk to KMT
Chairman Ma.</P>
      <P>During the party's Central Standing Committee meeting Wednesday,
Cheng said Ma told the members that KMT and PFP, which form the
"pan-blue alliance, " that they now only have 110 seats in the
220-seat Legislative Yuan, so it is becoming ever more imperative for
the alliance to stand firm.</P>
      <P>The 225-seat legislature was reduced to 220 seats after four KMT
lawmakers jumped into the local government race and won and a DPP
lawmaker was put to jail.</P>
      <P>Ma said he has met with Soong twice after the Dec. 3 elections,
and "my feelings got better each time" as both parties have been
cooperating well at the legislature with regard to such critical
issues as the arms purchase budget and the president's nominations of
Control Yuan members.</P>
      <P>He said that at a time when people are fed up with political
fighting at the legislature, only "reasonable debate" of real issues
will win public support.</P>
      <P>He also said Taiwan society now needs "peace and quiet" rather
than verbal attacks between opposing political camps. For that
reason, he said honestly carrying out the Constitution in "spirit" is
more important than talking about another round of constitutional
amendments.</P>

      <P> Taipei, Dec. 28 (CAN) It is best for Taiwan to maintain the
status quo across the Taiwan Strait given the U. S. efforts to play a
"balancing role" in the region, prime opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou told the Voice of America in a Dec. 26
interview.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan would be the most possible cause for war between the
United States and China, it is best for Taiwan to keep the current
cross-strait situation stable in the interests of all parties
concerned, Ma said.</P>
      <P>When China is increasingly rising as a world power and posing
greater challenges to the United States, Ma said, Taiwan has a vital
leverage in the cross-strait situation that is underpinned by the
"one China" policy of the United States.</P>
      <P>Playing a "balancing role" in tune with its "one China" policy is
a move intended to observe Washington's overall military strategy in
East Asia that will help the United States maintain friendly
relations with both China and Japan -- the United States' strategic
emphasis in the region, Ma said.</P>
      <P>When the United States seeks to engage China through its "one
China" policy, it is trying to minimize the damage to a democratic
and open Taiwan by playing the "balancing role" to serve both sides
that remain divergent over independence or unification for Taiwan's
future, Ma pointed out.</P>
      <P>Under such circumstances, Taiwan has to maintain the present
cross-strait status quo by not clamoring for imminent unification
with China nor seeking a perpetual split from it, he contended,
noting that this will best serve Taiwan's interests and those of
other parties.</P>
      <P>Ma, also mayor of Taipei, took over the KMT's chairmanship in
August this year through a historic direct vote among party members.
He has widely been assumed as the most likely contender from the
opposition "pan blue alliance" to run in the 2008 presidential race
since leading the alliance to win 16 seats of the 23 local
governments in the Dec. 3 elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAMPUS CORPORAL PUNISHMENT TO BE OUTLAWED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan's education and
culture committee passed a proposal Wednesday to include a ban on
campus corporal punishment into the Basic Education Law.</P>
      <P>The committee passed draft revisions to Articles 8 and 15 of the
Basic Education Law that will protect students from corporal
punishment. According to the draft revisions, teachers and students
can also seek legal remedies if their rights are infringed by school
authorities or administrative agencies.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu said the draft
revisions are mainly aimed at reminding teachers to manage or control
their emotions and refrain from resorting to corporal punishment.</P>
      <P>"Times have changed. School teachers should not adopt corporal
punishment that could leave not only physical wounds but also mental
scars, " Hung said. Nevertheless, Hung said, the revised bill has not
proposed any compensation for students who have been hit by teachers
in spite of the corporal punishment ban.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear when the legislature will complete the third
reading of the bill.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Education Chou Tsan-teh said the Ministry of
Education has consistently opposed campus corporal punishment.</P>
      <P>"More explicitly banning corporal punishment of students complies
with the education ministry's longstanding policy and signifies
respect for students' basic human rights," Chou said.</P>
      <P>In line with the legislature's move to outlaw campus corporal
punishment, Chou said, the education ministry will step up a
publicity campaign to remind teachers that corporal punishment of
students could make them liable to penalties prescribed in relevant
criminal and civil laws.</P>
      <P>Chou said the ministry will also compile class management
reference materials into teachers' school curricula to instill a
zero-corporal punishment concept into would-be teachers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Humanistic Education Foundation, which has long
been advocating a ban on campus corporal punishment, said the new law
is the best new year's gift to students around the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NORTHERN TAIWAN SOCIETY URGES  MND TO CLOSE LI-MING FOUNDATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
should immediately close the Li-ming Cultural Enterprise Foundation
without any litigation so that NT$4 billion in its stakes in Chinese
Television System (CTS) would not be embezzled, the Northern Taiwan
Society said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Li-ming Foundation is an organization under the MND that
invests in the Chinese Television System. Recent debates on the
government, military and political parties pulling out of media
operations have brought up this issue. The deadline set by the
authorities concerned for the pull-out was Dec. 26.</P>
      <P>During a news conference at the Legislative Yuan Wednesday, the
Northern Taiwan Society said the stakes of the CTS which the Li-ming
Foundation retains are not privately owned, bought by retired
military officers, as they used to claim. Instead, they are issued
from the national defense budget in an indirect way; therefore, the
shares they own are considered public stakes.</P>
      <P>The Northern Taiwan Society made the statement after the Li-ming
Foundation said it would not donate its CTS stakes to facilitate the
task of political parties, government and military giving up control
over media.</P>
      <P>The Northern Taiwan Society said that the Li-ming Foundation was
established in order to create the CTS later. But now CTS is going to
turn into a public service television station, the purpose for such a
foundation to exist is gone, and the MND should order to have it
closed at once.</P>
      <P>Huang Guangqin, a well-known journalist who attended the news
conference said that the Li-ming Foundation is a problem created
during the Kuomintang (KMT) administration and left till now, and
that KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou is responsible for this case according
to ethics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE AGREES ON BILL TO WIPE OUT HUMAN SMUGGLING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan made the first move Wednesday toward
incorporating global efforts to crack down on human trafficking after
lawmakers agreed to add a draft revision to the immigration law to
specifically serve that end.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers at the Home and National Affairs Committee under the
Legislative Yuan agreed unanimously to add a new chapter to the law
based on a consensus that Taiwan must clearly underscore its resolve
to better protect human rights to the international community at a
time when the country has increasingly been used as a human cargo
transshipment hub by cross-border criminal organizations.</P>
      <P>The bill clearly stipulates what is called "human trafficking, "
which includes abusing victims sexually or profiteering from their
work, or forcing others to do something against their will through
blackmail, threats, sexual assault, drugs, illegal monitoring, scams
or hypnosis.</P>
      <P>Trans-border activities covering recruitment, transportation,
smuggling, hiding or transferring of human cargo are also defined as
"human trafficking" in the bill.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Bi-khim, a legislator of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party who initiated the bill, said that Taiwan has for some time been
scolded by the international community for failing to set up a
supra-ministerial network to help human trafficking victims.</P>
      <P>Human traffickers pose a serious threat to the wellbeing of all
mankind, Hsiao said, pointing out that their activities are closely
related to criminal rings and public health, among other issues.
Studies show that human smuggling has fast become an issue that also
has an impact on the diplomatic and foreign affairs of a country,
she noted.</P>
      <P>The new bill, Hsiao said, would allow for the establishment of an
exclusive government unit to protect the rights and safety of
international human cargo victims in Taiwan, and it will also help
the government better cope with future tasks.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several new environmental protection
measures are set to take effect Jan. 1, including the comprehensive
implementation of compulsory garbage separation.</P>
      <P>The garbage separation policy, which has been in place in some
cities and counties since early this year, will be expanded to all
areas around the nation at the start of the new year.</P>
      <P>According to the policy, people are required to separate their
garbage into three categories -- ordinary garbage, recyclables and
food scraps -- before taking it out to the garbage truck. Garbage
that is not properly separated will be rejected, with offenders
facing a fine of between NT$1,200 to NT$6,000.</P>
      <P>During the first three months after the policy's implementation,
offenders will not be fined but will be given advice and told to
separate their garbage properly.</P>
      <P>Also starting next year, motorists who fail to send their
motorcycles for regular emission inspection will be fined NT$2,000
and forbidden from renewing their vehicle registration.</P>
      <P>From Jan. 1, all filling stations around the nation will be
required to install gas collection facilities to lower the
concentration of benzene and volatile organics in the air to protect
workers' health. Violators can be fined up to NT$1 million.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, industries will need to pay sewer surcharges every six
months starting July 1. The surcharges will be calculated according
to the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and suspended solids (SS) levels
in their waste water, with NT$12.5 payable per kilogram of COD and

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT OFFERS LEADERSHIP ADVICE TO NEW GENERALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Thursday urged
military officers to be generous and humble in victory and to engage
in self-examination in defeat.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while presiding over a commissioning
ceremony for officers promoted to the rank of general. Also attending
the ceremony was Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>The president said that the art of leadership in the military is
to inspire courage, resist pressure, win the hearts of the soldiers,
and achieve victory based on lessons learnt from previous defeat.</P>
      <P>He also affirmed that to maintain the integrity of the nation's
sovereignty is the core value of national defense, adding that
despite close trade and economic exchanges between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait, one must not forget the risk of possible war if
the nation has insufficient defense capabilities.</P>
      <P>He also said that the nation's effort in upgrading its national
defense is "by no means an arms race, " and that increasing defense
spending will not squeeze spending on social welfare programs or
undermine the promotion of public welfare.</P>
      <P>The president also said that if the long-stalled arms procurement
bill is not passed, this will raise doubts in the international
community about Taiwan's determination to defend itself.</P>
      <P>The bill for the purchase of six Patriot III anti-missile
batteries, eight conventional submarines and 12 P-3C Orion
submarine-hunting aircraft from the United States has been blocked
from being put on the legislative agenda for over a year by lawmakers
of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the
People First Party, which together hold a slim majority in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the strengthening of national defense is not
to serve as a pawn for any other country, adding that the nation
wants to prevent war but that it will stand up for itself if war is
brought upon it.</P>
      <P>"We must be well prepared so as to effectively counter a possible
invasion from China, " the president said, affirming that "we must
keep national security in our own hands."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RAILWAY ADMINISTRATION TO SEE US$295.52 M. LOSSES IN 2006</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA)
reported Thursday that its losses for 2006 will reach NT$9.9 billion
(US$295.52 million).</P>
      <P>Taiwan Railway Administrator Hsu Ta-wen made the remarks when he
reported on the TRA's budget for 2006 at a meeting of the
Transportation Committee of the Legislative Yuan, which is reviewing
the budget for next year.</P>
      <P>The projected losses mark an increase over losses for
2005. Hsu attributed the increase to the high-speed railway, which is
scheduled to be inaugurated Oct. 31, 2006, as well as rising interest
rates.</P>
      <P>Although the high-speed railway will operate for only two months
next year, the TRA stands to lose NT$3 billion on its western routes
alone in 2006.</P>
      <P>The TRA is scheduled to propose to the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications a reasonable price scheme after the Chinese Lunar
New Year, which falls on Jan. 29. Under the scheme, short-distance
fares will be raised while long-distance fares will be lowered to
increase the railway's competitiveness, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The TRA reported that revenues for 2006 will be NT$22.59 billion,
up NT$655 million from the previous year, while expenditures for 2006
will be NT$32.49 billion, up NT$855 million from the previous year,
showing that expenditures will outpace revenues.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yeh Yi-chin of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
criticized the TRA, saying that its daily losses have increased to
NT$20 million from NT$3 million in the past.</P>
      <P>Her colleague, Kuo Mei-cheng, also said that the TRA is "beyond
repair, " criticizing its frequent train schedule changes -- 13 times
a year.</P>
      <P>Hsu replied that the TRA has been burdened with accumulated
debts, interest payments, and its need to act along with national
policy, saying that its main operations are making money, only the
personnel and pension payments as well as interest payments are too
high.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOVEREIGNTY IS BASIS OF TAIWANESE NATIONAL IDENTITY: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National sovereignty has replaced race,
lineage and culture to become the basis of national identity by the
people of Taiwan over the last 20 years, President Chen Shui-bian
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that 20 years ago, the people of Taiwan were split on
whether their country was "Taiwan" or "China." Today, nearly 90
percent of the people identify with Taiwan, Chen claimed.</P>
      <P>Chen made the comments in the latest edition of his online
newsletter, in which he mentioned the renewal of national
identification cards that started Dec. 21.</P>
      <P>"Regardless of sex, origin, ethnic background, color or religion
belief, whoever possessing an ID card is a member of the big family
of Taiwan and a citizen of the same country," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The ID cards also represent the rights entitled to by all
citizens, who are all "Taiwanese" on equal footing, he said.</P>
      <P>To put it simply, Chen said, so-called "nationals" refer to
people who hold the ID cards, and "domestic history" and "domestic
geography" refer to the history and natural environment of the area
where the ID cards are used as a document of identification.</P>
      <P>"I believe every person who has this ID card will agree with this
definition," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that during the past 400 years, several groups of
immigrants have come to Taiwan and formed the country's four major
ethnic groups -- aborigines, Hoklos, Hakkas and mainlanders -- and
that the country has in recent years also seen the participation of
many foreigners who are married to Taiwan citizens.</P>
      <P>Chen said these pluraristic ethnic and cultural features are
important assets of Taiwan that have become a positive, "soft power"
of the country.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's individuality will be displayed and a new Taiwanese
identity will be shaped through the exchanges of different ethnic and
cultural heritages, he said.</P>
      <P>He urged all people in Taiwan to get along peacefully with people
from different ethnic groups to promote the country's solidarity,
progressiveness and prosperity.</P>

illegal assembly charges, flew back to Hong Kong again Thursday for
trial.</P>
      <P>Lee, who returned to Taiwan Dec. 23 after being freed on bail

from the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) -- Taiwan's top mainland
China policy planner -- on his trip to Hong Kong for the trial
scheduled to open at 2 p.m. Friday.</P>
      <P>At the Kaohsiung airport prior to their departure, the senior Lee
thanked the MAC again for its assistance after the incident, and
expressed the hope that the Hong Kong court will give his son a

    <TEXT>
      <P>State Public Prosecutor-General Wu
Ying-chao said Thursday that he is determined to resign and will not
change his mind even if President Chen Shui-bian wants him to
continue serving in his present post.</P>
      <P>Reporting to the legislature's Judiciary Committee, Wu said that
he has not yet tendered his written resignation to the minister of
justice because he has been busy attending meetings over the past two
days.</P>
      <P>The top prosecutor announced on Dec. 27 that he would resign
shortly after President Chen complained in a speech that vote-buying
had become more serious in the run-up to the Dec. 3 local government
elections, compared with the legislative elections in 2004.</P>
      <P>Questioned by legislators on the Judiciary Committee about why he
wanted to resign, Wu said it could not be attributed to any single
reason, but had to do with his plan to retire and the fact that his
resignation now would make more room for the executive and
legislative branches to engage in rational discussions on how the
nation's top prosecutor should be fielded in the future.</P>
      <P>Asked if his decision to resign had to do with pressure from the
president, Wu said that this was not the case because at the time
when he announced his decision, he was not aware of what the
president had said earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that he actually had thought of quitting more than
a week ago.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A wooden boat modeled on the one used by
Chinese mariner Zheng He (1371-1435 AD) is being built and should be
ready to set sail next July to retrace his adventurous voyage, the
head of a Taiwanese adventure group said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hai-peng, president of the Society of Extreme Exploration,
said since July, he has shuttled between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait around 30 times, trying to find a suitable shipyard to build
the boat.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that he was glad that not only has he solicited funds,
he has also found a shipyard in China that is willing to build the
Chinese-style wooden sailboat, which will be 16 meters long and 3.8
meters wide.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 21, Hsu said an anonymous person agreed to pay all the
expenses to build the boat, and the U.S. cosmetic company Kiehl's
also pledged Thursday to give NT$1 million for the training cost of
the sailors on board.</P>
      <P>He said that the boat is expected to be built early next year,
and that seven sailors are now being trained for the trip. His alma
mater, National Ocean University, has also agreed to provide
technical assistance.</P>
      <P>The building of the boat is expected to be completed next March
and the boat will then encircle Taiwan in one week for good luck.</P>
      <P>The recreated wooden boat is scheduled to disembark from
Taichang, Jiangxu province in China in July on its trip of 33,900
nautical miles.</P>
      <P>Huang Ling-hsiao, who has been selected to serve as the captain
of the adventurous journey, said that the operation of the boat is
similar to a modern sailboat, but since the craft is of ancient
design, they have to learn old techniques.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the most perilous place is the South China Sea
during a tropical storm, saying that unforeseen problems could arise
several times a day.</P>
      <P>While Columbus sailed to the Americas on the Santa Maria in 1492,
Zheng He, a eunuch , was sent by Emperor Yungle from China to many
places throughout the South Pacific, the Indian Ocean, Taiwan, the
Persian Gulf and distant Africa in seven epic voyages from 1405 to

      <P>A dozen graduate student representatives
from nine universities, including National Taiwan University (NTU) ,
petitioned the Ministry of Education (MOE) Thursday about the paltry
stipends they currently receive.</P>
      <P>The students asked the MOE to raise the stipends for graduate
students and address the issues of different amounts of stipends for
different departments and graduate schools.</P>
      <P>Stipends are often given to graduate students for doing largely
symbolic jobs for the school, such as light administrative work.</P>
      <P>Chang Yuan-hsiu, the head of NTU's Graduate Student Association,

60 percent of graduate students receive less than NT$3,000 a month,

not enough, and are hoping for between NT$5,000 and NT$10,000 per

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Vietnamese neurosurgeon, who suffers from
acute myeloid leukemia, a rare type of cancer, has been given a new
lease on life after receiving chemotherapy and a transnational bone
marrow transplant at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH).</P>
      <P>Huynh Thanh Thuan, a 27-year-old neurosurgeon at Vietnam's Cho
Ray Hospital, was discharged from NTUH Thursday after attending a
celebration party marking the first successful transnational bone
marrow transplant at the hospital.</P>
      <P>Huynh was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia early this year.
He first received chemotherapy at Blood Transfusion Hospital in Ho
Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam. The medical team treating Huynh
suggested that he receive a bone marrow transplant; otherwise, he
could die.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by his fiancee, Huynh came to Taiwan in April to seek
the possibility of a bone marrow transplant. In two weeks after his
arrival, the Buddhist Tzu Chi Stem Cell Center in the eastern city of
Hualien managed to find a partial match from a Taiwan bone marrow
donor. </P>
      <P>As their HLA antigens were not fully compatible, Huynh underwent
chemotherapy for four months before receiving an unrelated
transnational bone marrow transplant at NTUH in August.</P>
      <P>According to Tzu Chi data bank tallies, the bone marrow matching
rate among Chinese people is about 60 percent. Huynh, a non-Chinese,
was lucky to be able to find a match from a Taiwanese donor in such a
short period of time.</P>
      <P>Even though their HLA antigens were only 60 percent compatible,
physicians at the NTUH blood cancers department said the success rate
of such a bone marrow transplant could be more than 50 percent with
the use of new anti-rejection drugs.</P>
      <P>Huynh and his fiancee are scheduled to return to Vietnam in
mid-January. NTUH physicians said they will cooperate with Blood
Transfusion Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City in follow-up for Huynh by
e-mail. Huynh will be monitored for the next five years.</P>

In Aging Japan, Young Slackers Stir Up Concerns

Japan, which has long prided itself on its 
unbeatable work ethic, faces a troubling trend: 
the swelling ranks of young slackers. Spurred 
by a more casual attitude toward work and a 
tendency to hold out for dream jobs, an estimated
640,000 unmarried Japanese between ages 15 and 34
had dropped out of the work force or failed to 
enter at all last year. This is up from 400,000 
in 1993, the first year for which Japan's Labor 
Ministry has figured. The government calls these
e slackers NEET, or "not in education,
employment or training" -- a term first used
in the United Kingdom in the late 1990s. Japan,
which started labeling NEETs last year, uses the
term specifically for young people who have
given up looking for a job and often get
financial support from their generous parents.
They are not considered unemployed since they are
not actively looking for a job. The phenomenon
has shocked Japan because the nation considers
its highly trained, hard-working labor force to
be its most valuable resource.
As a result, the NEET issue has set the nation

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER PROMISES TO ACCELERATE ESTABLISHMENT OF NCC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng
promised Thursday to help accelerate the confirmation by the
legislature of the name list of the National Communications
Commission (NCC) members presented by the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan referred the name list, containing 13
candidates, to the Legislative Yuan Thursday for confirmation in
anticipation that the commission can be established formally and
become operational soon.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the approval should come before this legislative
session concludes on Jan. 13.</P>
      <P>The nomination list was prepared by a panel charged with choosing
candidates to serve on the NCC in accordance with the NCC Act
promulgated Nov. 11.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan forwarded the name list to the Legislative
Yuan for confirmation despite the fact that one of the 13 candidates
-- Prof. Lu Chung-chin with National Tsinghua University in Hsinchu
-- had withdrawn his name from consideration more than two weeks ago
after he was recommended by the panel to serve on the NCC.</P>
      <P>In a letter dated Dec. 12 to Premier Frank Hsieh, Lu said he
regrets that several political parties had packed the list of NCC
nominees with their supporters, asking the premier to drop his name
from the list of nominees of NCC members to be presented by the
premier to the Legislature for confirmation.</P>
      <P>The 13 candidates were selected from among 18 nominees -- who
were put forward by the legislature according to the share of seats
held by each political party and the Executive Yuan -- by the
11-member review panel, all of them experts and scholars recommended
by political parties based on proportional representation, through an
open vote.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of
the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP), who sponsored
the NCC organization bill, expressed the hope last month that the NCC
could be inaugurated Jan. 1, 2006.</P>
      <P>Opposition lawmakers made the call Nov. 10, one day after
President Chen Shui-bian promulgated the NCC bill into law. KMT and
PFP lawmakers have touted the enactment as a milestone in the
country's history, claiming that it offers the best guarantee of
freedom of the press.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The issuance of new ROC ID cards is going
well, except for a few instances of people submitting the wrong size
photos, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>New ROC ID cards began to be issued Dec. 21. The new
forgery-proof cards should foil attempts by illegal Chinese
immigrants from claiming benefits from Taiwan through the use of fake
cards. The current version of ID cards is very low tech and can
easily be copied.</P>
      <P>"The program to issue new cards is proceeding smoothly, with the
only real hitch being that some people are coming in with
passport-size photos that are too small," the official said.</P>
      <P>Regulations say that the ID photo must be in color and have been
taken within the last year. It should be 4.5 by 3.5 centimeters with
the applicant's face between 3.2 and 3.6 centimeters from the top of

      <P>Independent Legislator Chiu Yi said
Thursday he will sue Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Ma
Yung-cheng for defamation.</P>
      <P>At a news conference in the legislature, Chiu said Ma had told a
meeting of the legislature's Finance Committee earlier Thursday that
the information Chiu publicized to show that Ma might have
profiteered through illegal insider trading on the stock market was
"stolen and incorrect."</P>
      <P>At the meeting, Ma and officials from the Financial Supervisory
Commission under the Cabinet were summoned to clarify speculation
that senior officials at the Presidential Office were involved in
stock transactions and insider trading.</P>
      <P>Chiu presented detailed information at the meeting and claimed
that Ma, with an investment of NT$3.36 million, had made a profit of
NT$3.15 million through the trading of seven different stocks in a
matter of only six months between July 2003 and January 2004,
prompting speculation about his involvement in insider trading.</P>
      <P>Ma countered that Chiu should not have made a "unilateral
interpretation" based on information that was "stolen and incorrect."</P>
      <P>At the news conference Thursday afternoon, Chiu pointed out that
Ma is not a legislator and therefore cannot speak with impunity.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's first woman combat-status
general is an electronic communications expert, particularly in
information technology (IT) hardware and anti-virus computer
software.</P>
      <P>Chai Hui-chen, division chief at the Ministry of National
Defense's Communications and Electronics Department, is among the 44
senior military officers to be promoted to the rank of general Jan.
1, 2006.</P>
      <P>A graduate from National Taiwan University's Horticulture
Department, Chai didn't start her military career until after she was
admitted into National Defense Medical College's Graduate Institute
of Biochemistry. She later obtained a Ph.D. in computer science from
Syracuse University in New York State.</P>
      <P>After serving at electronic communications centers at various
military units, Chai was promoted to her current post in July 2004.</P>
      <P>In the face of China's rapid electronic warfare arsenal buildup,
the Ministry of National Defense (MND) has stepped up electronic
warfare combat preparedness with a view to establishing a three
dimensional safety dragnet to maintain smooth communications and
command operations, troop mobility and military barracks security.
With her superb IT expertise, Chai has played an important role in
this process, military sources said.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Chinese have frequently tried to hack into the
ROC government and military's Web sites. Chai has often assisted
government agencies in strengthening their firewalls to protect their
communications systems and data banks, military sources said. Chai
once said confidently that Chinese hackers' attacks had provided good
opportunities to practice skills to protect the military's
communications and command systems.</P>
      <P>The MND held a commissioning ceremony for the 44 soon-to-be
generals at the Armed Forces Officers' Club in Taipei Thursday, with
Minister of National Defense Lee Jye presiding. Both President Chen
Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu attended the promotion
ceremony.</P>
      <P>Chai was decorated with the major general rank badge by her
husband and daughter at the commissioning ceremony.</P>
      <P>Seven officers were conferred with the rank of lieutenant general
or vice admiral, and 37 were promoted to major generals or rear
admirals.</P>
      <P>Addressing the commissioning ceremony, President Chen said in his
capacity as the commander-in-chief of the nation's armed forces that
Chai's promotion signifies the military's efforts to substantiate
gender equality in the military.</P>
      <P>Among those promoted to the rank of lieutenant general was Ho

    <HEADLINE>NEARLY 50% SUPPORT CTS RELOCATION TO SOUTHERN TAIWAN: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly half of respondents to a recent
opinion poll have thrown their support behind the proposed relocation
of Chinese Television System (CTS) to southern Taiwan, the Government
Information Office (GIO) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The GIO commissioned a private public opinion research group to
survey local people's attitude toward the proposal to have a
public-service terrestrial television headquartered in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>GIO Minister Pasuya Yao brought up the proposal amid recent
debates over the Dec. 26 deadline for the government, political
parties and military to divest themselves of stake holdings in local
news media outlets.</P>
      <P>The government has decided to relinquish its control of two
terrestrial TV companies -- Taiwan Television Enterprises (TTV) and
CTS to meet that requirement. In the process, Yao said the GIO will
push for CTS to become a wholly public-service media outlet and
relocate its headquarters to southern Taiwan to balance regional media
industry development. For decades, all of the country's terrestrial
TV stations headquartered in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Of the 1,072 valid samples collected in the survey, 46.4 percent
said it is "very appropriate" or "appropriate" to have a
public-service terrestrial TV station headquartered in southern
Taiwan, while 28.5 percent thought otherwise.</P>
      <P>As to where the relocated terrestrial TV should be headquartered,
47 percent chose Kaohsiung City/Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that local people were divided over the main
opposition Kuomintang's sale of its controlling shares in three media
outlets -- China television Co. (CTV) , Broadcasting Corp. of China
(BCC) and China Motion Picture Co. -- to a holding company led by
China Times Group Chairman Yu Chien-hsin. The KMT claimed that the
sale signifies its respect for the Dec. 26 pull-out deadline.</P>
      <P>While 31.9 percent of the respondents gave a thumbs-up to the
KMT-China Times Group deal, 34.6 percent disagreed with the dealing.
Nearly 60 percent said China Times Group is obliged to expound on the
source its capital to buy the three controversial KMT media outlets.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 100 staff members of the Chinese
Television System (CTS) lodged a protest with the Legislative Yuan
Friday against the Government Information Office's (GIO's) idea to
relocate CTS, one of the five terrestrial television channels in
Taiwan, to the southern part of the island.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan is supposed to screen a bill on the disposal
of public stakes in terrestrial television stations Friday, and GIO
Minister Yao has advocated that CTS be moved to southern Taiwan to
"help balance information access and cultural development between the
north and the south, as the south has always lagged behind the north
in this regard."</P>
      <P>Yao called on Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng Thursday to
seek Wang's support for the idea in the hopes that an article
stipulating CTS's relocation to southern Taiwan within five years
will be included in the proposed bill.</P>
      <P>Yao and Wang reportedly did not reach any consensus on the issue.</P>
      <P>Venting their anger with the GIO idea, CTS labor union members
called the idea "reckless, " claiming that implementing it "would not
only infringe upon the rights of CTS workers, but would also drain
television news resources and waste taxpayers' money."</P>
      <P>Union leader Chu Chun said that the GIO has no right to make laws
as it wishes. The GIO is "throwing live fish into the desert" by
asking that the CTS be relocated to the south without heeding
professional assessments or the "TV industry's business ecology, " he
claimed.</P>
      <P>Chu said he hopes that agreements reached between management and
labor will be included in the bill on the disposal of public stakes
in terrestrial television stations so that the rights and interests
of TV workers can be protected.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that the CTS relocation issue be discussed
after the television company's share transfer is completed, adding
that he hopes the new CTS management will consult everybody via
public discussion forums in handling the issue.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Friday that KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen will deal
shortly and in an appropriate way with the issue of criticism arising
from her "crossing the line" into media and that he respects whatever
decisions Cheng makes on the matter.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks after the recent quip about Cheng, director
of the KMT Cultural and Communication Affairs Department, by
Government Information Office Minister Pasuya Yao that she is a
"political and media amphibian" for hosting a radio show in conflict
with the required separation between politics and media.</P>
      <P>Yao said Wednesday that Cheng was crossing the line by hosting
the weekday radio show in her capacity as a prominent KMT official.</P>
      <P>The GIO head reiterated that the revised law governing
broadcasting and television stipulates that political parties, the
government and the military should withdraw from all media operations
as of Dec. 26, 2005.</P>
      <P>Taking umbrage with Yao's quip, Cheng said Thursday she may
consider suing Yao for slander.</P>
      <P>Cheng, nevertheless, said late Thursday night after consulting
with Ma that she will quit her radio host job after the Chinese New
Year, which falls on Jan. 29.</P>
      <P>On Cheng's latest statement, Yao replied Friday by asking:
"Should she continue to annoy the country with her poor show for so
long?"</P>
      <P>Noting that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) already
tackled the politics-media separation issue one-and-a-half years ago,
Yao criticized the KMT for lacking sincerity in dealing with the
issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng supported the idea of Cheng
quitting her radio host job the sooner the better, stressing that
"one cannot eat one's cake and have it too."</P>
      <P>Stressing that he bears no grudge against Cheng, Wu said Cheng's
"crossing the line" has tarnished the image of the KMT as well as of
the party's chairman.</P>
      <P>On Friday, DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang lashed out at Ma for
"condoning" Cheng's actions, saying that Cheng's doubling as a radio
host is tantamount to a "political party manipulating the media."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MORE TAIWAN WOMEN BUYING CONDOMS FOR PARTNERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With education on safe sex seeming to be
more effective among women than among men, market surveys show that
the number of women buying condoms for their partners is catching up
to the number of men buying condoms.</P>
      <P>Condom sellers noted that Taiwan produces at least 250 million
condoms per year for export and domestic consumption and that a
survey by ACNielsen also indicates that condom sales are rising at an
annual rate of 10 percent to 20 percent in Taiwan, making condoms the
consumer product with the second highest growth rate after chewing
gum.</P>
      <P>According to the condom company Durex, condoms sales are highest
around Valentine's Day, with sales being 20 percent to 30 percent
higher than usual and convenient stores being the main sales outlets.</P>
      <P>The Christmas holidays and holidays that last more than two days
are also occasions when condoms sell good, the company said.</P>
      <P>Although female condoms became available in Taiwan a few years
ago, consumer response has been lukewarm at best, with male condoms
still making up the vast majority of sales around the country.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, when it comes to condoms, the buying power of women
is on the rise. According to the Japanese condom maker Okamoto, only
20 percent of condom purchases in Taiwan in the 1990s were made by
women, but the figure has risen to 40 percent today.</P>
      <P>Obstetrician and gynecologist Lee Chao-hsi, who is also a
lecturer on sex education for youths, observed that female students
are usually more active in asking questions about sex during his
lectures given to high school and university students.</P>
      <P>In addition, the publicity campaign on using condoms as a method
of contraception and venereal disease prevention appears to be more
effective toward women than men, Lee said.</P>
      <P>As shown by data from the Bureau of Health Promotion, 75 percent
of women in Taiwan between the ages of 20 and 40 have contraceptive
needs, while 89 percent of married women use condoms as their method
of birth control.</P>
      <P>In light of the rise in condom sales to women, more and more
condom products are coming with cute packaging, such as in the form
of golden coins, lollipops, dolls or gift baskets, to cater to
women's preferences.</P>

    <HEADLINE>15 OBSERVERS LEAVE FOR ATLANTIC TO MONITOR TAIWAN FISHING OPERATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fifteen observers departed Taiwan for Spain
and South Africa Friday to board and monitor 15 Taiwan vessels
operating in the Atlantic Ocean, the fisheries administrator said.</P>
      <P>Addressing an event marking the relaunch of Taiwan's bigeye tuna
fishing in the Atlantic Ocean after the International Commission for
the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) cut Taiwan's total
allowable bigeye tuna fishing quota and slashed the number of Taiwan
vessels allowed to operate in the Atlantic in November, Hsieh Ta-wen,
director of the Fisheries Administration under the Council of
Agriculture (COA) exhorted the owners and operators of the 15 vessels
as well as the 15 observers to do their duties to reflect Taiwan's
resolve to help maintain fishing order in that part of the world.</P>
      <P>Protecting deep-sea fishery resources and maintaining sustainable
fishing operations is not just the government's responsibility but
also the responsibility of the private fishery sector, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>More Taiwan fishing vessels will be allowed to return to the
Atlantic Ocean only if the ICCAT decides in its annual meeting to be
held in November 2006 that Taiwan has done a satisfactory job in
curbing its "overfishing" and helping the fishery resources
replenish, Hsieh noted.</P>
      <P>The ICCAT cut Taiwan's total allowable bigeye tuna fishing quota
from 14,900 tons in 2005 to a mere 4,600 tons for the coming year
because of alleged overfishing by Taiwan fishing vessels.</P>
      <P>The ICCA also ruled that out of the 60-strong Taiwan bigeye tuna
fishing boats, only 15 will be allowed to continue their operations
in the Atlantic Ocean for the following one year on a trial basis.</P>
      <P>The decision was made on the last day of the ICCAT's 19th regular
meeting held in Seville, Spain, after Japan proposed a quota cut
citing overfishing by Taiwanese vessels.</P>
      <P>The 15 observers, who were originally ocean science observers
collecting information on ocean resources, will be responsible for
monitoring the operations of the 15 Taiwan vessels and the
registration of their catches.</P>
      <P>The observers will monitor the operations of the vessels and
check if they have registered their fishery catches according to
regulations. They will report the catches daily to the Fisheries
Administration, which will in turn report the information to the
ICCAT.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries Administration is planning to train another 15
people in order to boost the number of observers stationed on the
ships to at least 30 so that they can work on a rotational basis,
Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Most bigeye tuna caught by Taiwanese boats are sold to Japan. The
amount exported to Japan in the past two years has exceeded the total
yearly catch quota, prompting the charge of overfishing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STATUE OF LIMITATIONS PAST ON RECOVERING KMT-SOLD LAND: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The properties that the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) sold recently could be construed as having once
belonged to the government, but the statue of limitations on their
recovery has long since expired, Vice Minister of Finance Lee
Jui-chang said Friday.</P>
      <P>In a briefing to the legislative caucus of the Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU), Lee said the real estate occupied by the Central Motion
Picture Corp. (CMPC) and Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC), the
two companies sold by the KMT, was either transferred to the party
without cost by the KMT government when the island was handed over to
the Republic of China by Japan at the end of World War Two or was
purchased by the party afterward with money provided by the
government.</P>
      <P>However, since the property has been registered as belonging to
the two companies for many decades, the government has no right to
reclaim the plots as the statue of limitations of 20 years has long
since run out, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The land in question has been in the news since the KMT sold it
along with the China Television Co. to a private investment company
on Dec. 26, a move criticized by the TSU as a KMT attempt to dump its
"ill-gotten assets."</P>
      <P>On the same occasion Friday, Government Information Office
Minister Pasuya Yao told the TSU legislative caucus that his office
has asked the Jung Li Investment Company, the buyer of the three KMT
media outlets, to explain how it financed the purchase since the
company only has registered capital of NT$400 million. Yao said he
would like to find out if hidden foreign investors were part of the
deal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GENDER RIGHTS GROUPS CALLS FOR ABOLITION OF OBSCENE PUBLICATIONS LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of several Taiwan gender rights
groups announced Friday their plan to form an alliance to promote the
abolition of Article 235 of the Criminal Code, which bans the sale,
circulation and public display of obscene publications.</P>
      <P>They said as part of their efforts to achieve their goal, they
will request an interpretation by the Council of Grand Justices on
the constitutionality of the article.</P>
      <P>The groups led by the Gender/Sexuality Rights Association of
Taiwan (G/S RAT) made the move after the owner of the country's first
gay bookstore, the Gin Gin Bookstore, was convicted by the Taiwan
High Court on Dec. 2 of obstructing public morality for importing a
gay sex magazine from Hong Kong, based on Article 235 of the Criminal
Code.</P>
      <P>The gender rights activists claimed that since a clear definition
of "obscenity" is lacking in the article, judges are free to decide
what constitute obscenity and expect the public to have the same
feeling as them, a situation which they said is unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>The conviction of the owner of the Gin Gin Bookstore is one of
the events on the 2005 top-10 list of sex rights violations compiled
by G/S RAT. It took third place on the list.</P>
      <P>Topping the list was the implementation of a rating system for
Internet content. Coming in second was police raids of bookstores,
book rental stores and video rental stores as part of their
enforcement of a publication rating system.</P>
      <P>In fourth place was the release of a draft by the Department of
Health on the health standards of blood donors, under which male
homosexuals and sex workers are forbidden from donating blood.</P>
      <P>Fifth place was held by Li Hsin-yu's failed bid to bear her late
fiance's child using frozen sperm harvested after his death, owing
partly to a ban by health authorities.</P>
      <P>In sixth place was the Department of Health's policy of defining
condoms as a kind of medical supply that can only be sold at licensed
stores, a practice which G/S RAT says may lower the accessibility of
condoms in the market and hamper AIDS prevention.</P>
      <P>In seventh place was an amendment that exempts the OEM production
of pornographic VCDs for export from obscenity charges, which G/S RAT
says obviously discriminates against local consumers.</P>
      <P>In eight place was immigration authorities' denying the entry of
a Chinese woman who is married to a Taiwanese man in Kaohsiung City,
on the grounds that she had worked as a prostitute before.</P>
      <P>In ninth place is social affairs authorities' publication of the
name of the parents of a minor girl in Kaohsiung County for allowing
the girl to work as a scantily dressed betelnut seller.</P>
      <P>Rounding out the list was a senior high school girl who was asked
by her school to prove that she had some problem with gender
identification if she continued to refuse to wear a skirt during a
class on the hospitality industry.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The International Taiwan Birding
Association opened an English-language Web site Friday to help the
world understand Taiwan's conservation efforts with regard to wild
birds and to invite bird lovers to join guided tours to watch
Taiwan's endemic bird species.</P>
      <P>The Web site (www.birdingintaiwan.com) has a detailed description
of some 15 bird species endemic to Taiwan, along with pictures. There
is also an art gallery where bird-loving photographers have displayed
hundreds of pictures they have taken of birds in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Some foreign bird lovers who joined birding trips to Taiwan in
the past three years have contributed to the Web site by recording
their experiences in articles and pictures.</P>
      <P>There is also information about the next two birding tours, with
one of them scheduled for May 1-13, 2006, and the other for Nov.
6-15, 2006.</P>
      <P>According to tourism officials, February, May and November are
the best months for bird-watching in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Web site is co-sponsored by the Tourism Bureau under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications, the Council of
Agriculture under the Cabinet, the Wild Bird Federation of Taiwan and
the Changhua Wild Bird Society.</P>
      <P>At a news conference held to inaugurate the Web site, Hsu
Wen-sheng, director of the Tourism Bureau, pointed out that Taiwan
has more than 500 bird species, including 15 precious endemics and 69
sub-endemics.</P>
      <P>Among the species endemic to Taiwan are such highly treasured
birds as the Formosan Magpie, Mikado Pheasant and Swinhoe's Blue
Pheasant.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that Taiwan has attracted more than 80 groups of bird
lovers since it began to organize birding tours three years ago, and
that at least 20 more groups are scheduled to take birding trips to
Taiwan during 2006.</P>
      <P>He cited figures to show that the number of foreign visitors who
traveled to Taiwan during 2005 is expected to surpass 3.35 million,
higher than the Tourism Bureau's target of 3.25 million. He said a
major factor for the success is that Taiwan is free of the avian flu
virus.</P>

of the poorest families in 2004, down from a high of 6.39 times in
2001.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said Friday that
he has invited executives of the Hong Leong Group of Singapore to
visit Taichung in May 2006 to study the feasibility of building a
"six-star" tourist hotel.</P>
      <P>Hu, who just returned to Taiwan from a trade-promotion trip to
Singapore, told news media that while in Singapore, he had met with
executives of the Hong Leong Group and invited them to come to
Taichung in May to see the investment climate in Taichung first-hand.</P>
      <P>He said the Taichung City Government is willing to play a
mediating role to help Hong Leong find an ideal plot of land in the
central Taiwan city for the construction of the hotel.</P>
      <P>Hu, who has just begun his second four-year term as Taichung
mayor after winning re-election in early December, quoted figures to
show that Taichung's hotels recorded a room occupancy rate of 86
percent for the first 10 months of 2005, higher than the 82 percent
for hotels in the capital city of Taipei.</P>
      <P>This means that there is still room for Taichung to add a few
more luxury tourist hotels, he added.</P>
      <P>The mayor also said that in addition to promoting trade with
Singapore, he had used his trip to observe Singapore's cultural
establishments, its management in public housing and its experience
in tourism promotion, because Taichung can benefit by learning from
Singapore.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC URGES CHINA TO EASE PRESS CONTROLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese authorities should ease press
controls in response to the increasingly vocal appeal for
journalistic freedom in China, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairman Joseph Wu said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the call amid foreign wire service reports that about 100
Beijing News reporters walked out Friday in protest at this week's
dismissal of the daily's top editor and his two deputies, the latest
victims of China's strict press controls.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a year-end informal meeting with local
journalists covering the MAC and cross-Taiwan Strait affairs, Wu said
major international media watch groups have been sounding the alarm
regarding China's media development since September 2004 when the
Chinese Communist Party propaganda authorities began to tighten
internal press controls.</P>
      <P>Despite Chinese Communist authorities' ever-stricter censorship,
Wu said he has seen Chinese media professionals' courageous struggle
for a freer hand in news reporting. In some cases, Wu said,
disgruntled mainland media staff have gone on strike in protest.</P>
      <P>Wu urged Beijing authorities to face up squarely to their
journalists' call for freedom of the press in line with the
mainstream trends in the world community.</P>
      <P>He also expressed his hope that China opens its door to the free
flow of correct and objective information about Taiwan to boost
mutual understanding of the people on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the MAC has publicly welcomed several regional
Chinese media outlets to post reporters in Taiwan to facilitate
cross-strait journalistic exchanges. However, Beijing authorities
have so far banned press staff from those newspapers from working in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As to when the MAC will again allow two Chinese official
mouthpieces - the Xinhua News Agency and the People's Daily -- to
post reporters in Taiwan, Wu said it will hinge on when Beijing
allows its people to browse two Taiwan online newspapers -- the China
Times, chinatimes.com, and the United Daily News, udn.com. The MAC
withdrew permission last year for reporters from the two media
organizations to be posted in Taipei in protest of their misleading
and biased reports about Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu said the MAC will handle the Hong Kong-based
Phoenix Satellite TV's application to beam its broadcast into Taiwan
in a positive manner. Once the screening is finalized, Wu said he is
hopeful that Phoenix can objectively broadcast Taiwan-related news
events and other relevant information to various corners of China.</P>
      <P>Foreign wire service reports said the editor in chief of the
Beijing News, Yang Bin, was abruptly removed two days ago without any
official explanation.</P>
      <P>Friday's acts of defiance by journalists were the latest in a
long struggle between the Chinese Communist Party, which tries to
control information, and China's newspapers and magazines, which want
to attract readers and revenue with bold reporting, the reports said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday Taiwan
farmers should focus their export promotion activities on advanced
countries instead of China where bogus Taiwan agricultural products
are rampant.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the appeal during an inspection tour of a vegetable
planting technology and marketing strategy study center in Taipao,
Chiayi County in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The premier said Taiwan's agricultural exports to China have
declined because of the runaway commercial counterfeiting there.
Bogus Taiwan brand-name products, such as Alishan tea, Luku tea and
Chuchi pears, have flooded markets in many parts of China.</P>
      <P>"Most of the bogus farm produce originates in Hainan Island in
southern China. Taiwan should negotiate with China over the issue and
ask China to crack down on this agricultural piracy, " Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>With their superb farming technology and fine product quality,
Hsieh said, local farmers should focus their marketing efforts on
making inroads into advanced countries to increase their income.</P>
      <P>In the process, Hsieh said the government will offer all
necessary assistance. "All local farmers should have trust and
confidence in the government's commitment to helping them tap major
markets around the world," he added.</P>

      <P>The Motor Vehicle Office under the Taipei

questions for written driver's tests in five Asian languages from
Jan. 2 to help immigrants in Taiwan prepare for their tests.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the office said that the examples of test

mother tongues to familiarize themselves with the written tests.</P>
      <P>He said that a lack of opportunities to practice with sample

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu said Friday he sees no reason to be optimistic about a thaw
in the political impasse across the Taiwan Strait in the near future.</P>
      <P>Judging from China's continued campaign to debase the Taiwan
government by aligning with Taiwan's pro-unification opposition
parties, Wu said during a year-end informal meeting with local
journalists covering MAC and cross-strait affairs that improvement in
cross-strait ties is doubtful, at least in the short term.</P>
      <P>Wu cited two disappointing instances to back his pessimistic
view about the prospects for breaking the lingering cross-strait
political impasse.</P>
      <P>In mid-November, Wu said, China blocked Taiwan health officials
from attending a global meeting in the southwestern Chinese city of
Kunming on avian flu prevention. Although three Taiwan academics were
allowed to attend, Wu said, they were deprived of the rights to speak
at the occasion.</P>
      <P>Equally frustrating was China's blunt snub of an offer by Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chang Chun-hsiung to attend the
funeral of Wang Daohan, president of the Beijing-based Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wang, China's top negotiator with Taiwan, died in Shanghai last
Saturday at the age of 90. His funeral was Friday.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan allowed two Chinese officials to attend the
funeral of the SEF's founding chairman, Koo Chen-fu, earlier this
year, Wu said China's snub of Chang's offer manifests China's
reluctance to treat Taiwan on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>Despite China's unfriendliness, Wu said the Taiwan government
will continue to pursue cross-strait reconciliation, cooperation and
lasting peace.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
expressed regrets Friday over a Hong Kong court decision to delay a
trial of suspects arrested during an anti-World Trade Organization
(WTO) riot earlier this month.</P>
      <P>The 14 suspects, including Lee Chien-cheng, a National Taiwan
University (NTU) student, were rounded up after a mob of protesters
broke through a police line Dec. 17 and tried to storm a WTO meeting.
The demonstrators fought with police until they were subdued with
tear gas.</P>
      <P>All of the suspects were released on a HK$2,500 (US$320) bail
Dec. 23 and Lee was the only one allowed to return to Taiwan after a
guarantor paid a cash surety of HK$100,000. Lee, accompanied by his
father, flew back to Hong Kong Thursday to stand trial.</P>
      <P>A Hong Kong prosecutor in charge of the case announced Friday
that the proceedings would be postponed until Jan. 11 to allow for
more time to prepare the case.</P>
      <P>MAC officials said they hope the Hong Kong judicial authorities
can speed up court proceedings and acquit Lee as soon as possible.
Any further delay would seriously affect Lee's study, they added.</P>
      <P>Many of the protesters were South Korean farmers who said the WTO

G.I.'s to Increase U.S. Supervision of
Iraqi Police 

American commanders are planning to
increase significantly the number of soldiers
advising Iraqi police commando units, in part to
curtail abuse that the units are suspected of
inflicting on Sunni Arabs, a senior commander in
Iraq said Thursday. Under the plan, the number
of advisers working with the Iraqi units would
be greatly expanded. The advisers themselves
would be under the command of American officers.
American advisers now accompany commando units 
as part of the vast effort to train and equip 
security forces to take over the fight against 
the insurgency and to maintain order. But the
number of advisers is relatively small:
currently, groups of about 40 American soldiers 
each are attached to seven of the nine special 
Iraqi police brigades.

Wall Street Journal: Policy Woes, China's
Workers See Thin Protection In Insurance Plans

More than two-thirds of China's 1.3 billion 
people have no health insurance at all, and 
many cannot afford any medical care. But under 
China's pay-as-you-go health-care system, even 
those with insurance are often forced to make 
agonizing decisions about whether they can afford
treatment for serious illness. Problems with 
insurance coverage have become a crisis for 
China's growing urban middle class, eating into 
support for the ruling Communist Party. As
recently as the late 1970s, the Chinese
government controlled all hospitals, employed
all doctors, and offered almost universal
health-care coverage. In the cities, the state
provided insurance to civil servants, factory
workers and their families. Collective farms
provided care in the countryside. But the entire
system began breaking down in the early 1980s as
market-style reforms led collective farms to
disband and money-losing factories to close.
Tens of millions of workers were left without
jobs or insurance.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 30 percent of the Taiwan people
consider themselves to be part of the "poor class" of society,
according to the results of a recent survey by a local magazine.</P>
      <P>According to the survey published in the latest edition of Global
View Monthly, 33.9 percent of the people feel they belong to the
lower class of society, while 56.7 percent said they consider
themselves to be "middle class."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the survey also found that 86.9 percent of the
respondents feel that the rise in cost of living is outpacing the
increase in their salaries, while 63.3 percent said their economic
situation has gotten worse over the last three years.</P>
      <P>Sheng Chin-jen, a professor in Soochow University's Department of
Political Science, said the fact that over a third of the people
consider themselves to belong to the lower class is "a very terrible
result." He added that if another 10 percent of those who consider
themselves to be middle class start viewing themselves as part of the
lower class, then "Taiwan will become a poor country."</P>
      <P>Sheng further said that "although the survey only focused on the
subjective perception of one's economic standing, 'poverty' to a
certain degree represents dissatisfaction with the current situation
in society."</P>
      <P>Among the respondents who believe their standard of living will
get worse in the future, the main concerns mentioned were political
instability, cost of living increases, declining income, their
children's education, and fear of being laid off, in that order.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TO ANNOUNCE WHETHER TO RESHUFFLE CABINET IN DUE TIME: HSIEH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 31 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will announce in
due time whether there will be a reshuffle of the Cabinet after
considering the overall situation, Premier Frank Hsieh said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks at a press conference held to report
on the Cabinet's performance in December.</P>
      <P>He said the president has the constitutional right to name a
premier to form the Cabinet. He added that in the wake of the Dec. 3
city and county chief elections in which the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) suffered a humiliating defeat, he has offered
to step down in response to the latest mandate of the people, and the
president will make a final decision on the matter.</P>
      <P>The DPP managed to win only six out of the 23 city mayor and
county magistrate posts up for grabs in the Dec. 3 elections, while
the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) won 14 posts.</P>
      <P>He said that the president is listening to views from all sides,
adding that he believes that the president will make an announcement
in due time.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the landscape of the legislature after the elections,
the premier said that if the KMT and the People First Party merge
into one party, the new party will command a majority in the
Legislative yuan.</P>
      <P>Under this scenario, even though his serving as a premier is
constitutional, his political legitimacy will be challenged, Hsieh
said. However, if the two opposition parties don't merge, then the
DPP will be the largest party, and it will be both constitutional as
well as politically legitimate for a DPP member to head the Cabinet,
he added.</P>
      <P>The premier said that even if the DPP is the largest party, the
Cabinet will still be relatively weak as the ruling party doesn't
command a majority in the legislature.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
expressed confidence Saturday that Taiwan's economy will be better in
2006, for which the Cabinet has set the goal of achieving economic
growth of 4.5 percent.</P>
      <P>During a news show on Taiwan's economic situation and outlook
aired by the Chinese Television System, Ho said many people were not
optimistic about the country's economic performance this year mainly
because of the soaring international oil prices.</P>
      <P>However, Ho said, the government's decision to not raise
electricity rates and to keep oil price hikes at a reasonable level
has effectively maintained consumers' spending power.</P>
      <P>Although the economy was sluggish in the first half of this year,
export orders and exports have posted several new highs since August,
Ho said.</P>
      <P>Exports for the whole of 2005 are expected to amount to between
US$188 billion and US$190 billion, up from the US$174 billion
registered in 2004, Ho said, adding that the trade surplus is
expected to reach US$6 billion for 2005.</P>
      <P>Refuting public criticism that Taiwan's industrial sector is
hollowing out, Ho said the number of factories in Taiwan has
increased by 10,000 this year, with the number of people employed at
plants rising by 56,000.</P>
      <P>She further said that workers in the manufacturing sector
totalled 2.72 million, equal to the peak level registered between
1986 and 1989, and that the unemployment rate also dropped below 4
percent in November, which she said proves that Taiwan's industry has
not been hollowed out.</P>
      <P>She said the manufacturing industry and service industry will be
the "dual engines" driving Taiwan's economy in the future.</P>
      <P>According to the minister, Taiwan should not rely solely on
exports in the future but should establish its own brands and
distribution channels.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou on Saturday affirmed the KMT spokeswoman's decision to quit
her radio talk show host job near the end of next month, although he
added that it would be better if she quit earlier.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks after attending a ceremony marking the
opening of a new branch of the Taipei Municipal Library. KMT
spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen announced earlier the same day that she
would quit her radio host job at the UFO Network Broadcasting Co. on
Jan. 29.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the decision following recent criticism by Government
Information Office Director-General Pasuya Yao about a representative
of a political party being involved in the media. KMT Legislator Wu
Yu-sheng also said that Cheng's controversial double role might be
harmful to the KMT's image.</P>
      <P>According to the revised law governing broadcasting and
television, the government, political parties and the military were
to have withdrawn from all media operations by Dec. 26.</P>
      <P>Cheng began hosting the talk show at the invitation of Jaw
Shau-kong, chairman of the UFO Radio Station, when she was a member
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. Cheng kept the job after
becoming the KMT spokeswoman a few months ago.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Wu's statements that Cheng should quit the talk
show host job, Ma said that the legislator only wants to protect the
image of the party.</P>
      <P>Ma further said that Cheng is "as good as her word" on her
promise to quit the talk show host job.</P>
      <P>Admitting that it would be better if she were to quit at an

Crime Numbers Keep Dropping Across the City 

Crime has fallen across New York City for
the 17th consecutive year, with subway crime
down by more than 5 percent from last year and
the number of recorded murders virtually certain
to be the fewest in any single year since 1963,
new Police Department statistics show. As of

city, according to the department's latest
marking-period reports that are issued weekly.
That is down from 566 in the same period last 
year. And it is down from 649 in all of 2001, 
when joblessness surged, anxiety from Sept. 11 
was present and a budget crisis prompted a 
reduction in numbers of city police officers. 
In that year, some citizens and criminal

the crime downturn as the police force took on

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Saturday that the
nation's economy has registered growth for each quarter this year and
estimated that the growth will reach around 4.5 percent next year.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks in a press conference to report on
the Cabinet's performance in managing the economy for this year.</P>
      <P>He forecast that the jobless rate in 2006 will be around 4
percent and that consumer prices will increase by about 2 percent,
with both figures being better than those for this year.</P>
      <P>After a series of measures implemented by the government to
stimulate the economy, Hsieh said, economic growth rose from 2.49
percent in the first quarter to 4.38 percent in the third quarter.
Economic growth in the fourth quarter is forecast to hit 5.28
percent, he added.</P>
      <P>He further said that the average unemployment rate for the first
11 months of this year was 4.15 percent and that the jobless rate for
November was 3.94 percent, or the lowest level in the past five
years.</P>
      <P>The total number of employed hit 10.02 million in November, up
1.6 percent, or 154,000, over the figure for the same month a year
earlier, which he said indicated that the various measures adopted by
the government have borne fruit.</P>
      <P>On the topic of financial reform, he said the overdue loan ratio
continued to drop this year, falling to 2.8 percent in October from
11.27 percent at the end of 2001.</P>
      <P>The premier also noted that net foreign capital inflows have
increased dramatically, rising to US$100.04 billion in November of
this year from US$80 billion at the end of 2004. The ratio of foreign
capital in the Taiwan stock market rose to 28.88 percent in November,
up by 6.7 percent from the figure at the end of 2004.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that these figures show that the nation's economy is
improving, adding that "the public should have confidence in
themselves."</P>
      <P>He also said that after careful assessment and calculation of the
profits of the Chinese Petroleum Corp., gasoline prices are unlikely
to be hiked before Chinese New Year, which falls on Jan. 29, despite
the fact that world oil prices have topped US$60 per barrel.</P>
      <P>"This will help stabilize consumer prices before the Chinese New
Year," he added.</P>
      <P>As to whether gasoline prices will be adjusted after the Chinese
New Year, he said that this will hinge on whether international oil
prices continue to climb.</P>

      <P>With the number of homeless people
increasing every year, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) is working
on a draft plan to step up assistance to them, including providing
them with temporary shelter and medical services, a ministry official
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Tseng Chung-ming, deputy director of the Department of Social

a draft plan on dealing with and assisting the homeless, adding that
he hopes the plan can be put into practice next year.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that the plight of the homeless raises special concern
in the cold winter months. According to the plan, when the mercury
dips below 10 degrees Celsius, local governments and private groups
will activate a "concern mechanism, " with hot meal stations set up
immediately and temporary shelters opened to them.</P>
      <P>For those vagabonds who are willing to stay at the shelters to be
set up under the plan, local governments will assess their job skills
and provide them with individual counseling, group support, and house
renting information. The homeless individuals will be allowed to stay
in the shelters for up to six months and ask for an extension, if
necessary, during their transitional period.</P>
      <P>For those homeless who fall sick, the local government will foot
their medical bill or work with the private sector to share the
burden.</P>
      <P>For those vagabonds whose identities are established during
hospitalization, the local government of the vagabond's domicile will
be notified so that it can contact family members as soon as possible
to shoulder half of the medical bill.</P>

      <P>The number of people who have registered to
take the General English Proficiency Test (GEPT) basic level test
scheduled for next year is far lower than the number who took the
test this year, mainly as a result of the Ministry of Education (MOE)
changing the rules to bar those who are 12 years old or under from
taking the test.</P>
      <P>The Language Training &amp; Testing Center (LTTC), the sponsor of the
GEPT, said that only around 103,000 people have registered to take
the test scheduled for January.</P>
      <P>With the nation gripped by English mania, the number of
people taking part in each of the two GEPT basic level tests last
year exceeded 120,000, with 124,000 taking the first test and nearly
130,000 taking the second test. The LTTC officials noted that those
aged 14 or under made up a third of the total last year.</P>
      <P>The officials said that they even observed some parents taking

    <HEADLINE>MATSU ON HIGH ALERT AFTER ANOTHER AVIAN FLU DEATH REPORTED IN CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Matsu,  Dec. 31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The outlying island of Matsu has continued
to tighten its contagious disease preventon amid reports of a third
human avian flu death in China earlier this month, a local health
official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, a 41-year-old woman in
Sanming, Fujian Province, died of avian flu infection Dec. 21,
becoming China's third human fatality from the H5N1 strain of bird
flu.</P>
      <P>Liu Tseng-ying, director of Matsu's Health Bureau, said if any
cases of human-to-human transmission of the avian flu virus are
reported in Fujian, which lies a stone's throw away from Matsu, he
will advise the central government to suspend the direct "mini three
links" between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The "mini three links" refer to direct trade, mail and shipping
links between Taiwan's two frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu and
Fujian's Xiamen and Mawei, which have been in place since the
beginning of 2001.</P>
      <P>"In view of our geographic proximity to Fujian, we have had a
cmprehensive avian flu prevention network in place since this summer,
with all county government departments and health care units required
to cooperate closely in disease monitoring, reporting and
prevention," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Liu said the county's epidemic control center has three
months of preventive medical supplies, including face masks,
thermometers and protective gowns, in stock.</P>
      <P>Health monitoring and customs inspection at the harbor for the
"mini three links" services have also been stepped up to detect
potential avian virus carriers and deter poultry smuggling, Liu said.</P>
      <P>China's latest human bird flu case -- the seventh this year --
comes after two fatalities from the virus in Anhui province in
eastern China.</P>
      <P>World Health Organization (WHO) experts also believe a
12-year-old girl in the southern province of Hunan very probably died
from bird flu in November, but China does not include her in its
tally.</P>
      <P>Beijing's official Xinhua news agency did not offer any details
of the latest victim's work or background; nor did it say how she may
have contracted the H5N1 virus. Previous infections have involved
people who had close contact with poultry.</P>
      <P>The WHO and other international health bodies have called on
China to pass on animal samples of the bird flu virus for testing,
which China has not done.</P>
      <P>"It means that there is a question mark that hangs over the
progress of the virus in China, " Roy Wadia, the WHO's Beijing-based
spokesman, was quoted as having said Friday.</P>
      <P>The WHO has said it was unclear why China was not sharing the
virus samples, but said it had not seen evidence of a SARS-style
cover-up. Some information has been shared this year, but only on
paper, Wadia said.</P>
      <P>China agreed earlier this month to share virus samples isolated
from human bird flu cases.</P>
      <P>"It's certainly a situation where the viruses need to be shared
and not only shared but shared in a timely and consistent manner, "
Wadia said.</P>
      <P>The new outbreak showed how difficult the monitoring of bird flu
was in China, he added.</P>
      <P>"If the animals in the area were sick and dying, and if they were
dying in small numbers, it might have been very difficult to identify
that as an outbreak," Wadia said.</P>
      <P>"It just shows you that anything can happen at any time. It's a
very unpredictable situation, whether on the human side or the animal
side, " he said, adding it was too early to say if the WHO was
considering sending a mission to Fujian.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BURKINA FASO HONORS KIND-HEARTED TAIWAN PHYSICIAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lien Chia-en, a young Taiwan doctor, has
become the first foreign youth to have received a prestigious
national medal from the West African state of Burkina Faso.</P>
      <P>Jacques Sawadogo, the Burkina Faso ambassador to the Republic of
China, conferred the medal to Lien in a ceremony held at Grand
Formosa Regent Hotel in Taipei Friday in recognition of his
contributions to the African state while performing alternative
military service there.</P>
      <P>Lien, a graduate of National Yang Ming University's medical
school, helped heal the sick and clean up the countryside in Burkina
Faso during his 20-month compulsory alternative military service
starting in October 2001.</P>
      <P>In addition to working with the ROC medical mission stationed in
Burkina Faso, Lien mounted a clothes-for-garbage drive to help the
people and environment of Burkina Faso that had turned him into
something of a legend on the Internet. He solicited Taiwan people for
donations of unwanted clothes on the Internet. At the end of the day,
he received over 1,500 bags of clothes from people around the world
who learned of his drive on the Internet.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwan citizens responded to Lien's drive, which was
launched by himself and a Christian group in Burkina Faso to help rid
the countryside of discarded plastic garbage bags that posed a danger
to cattle and other animals. People who gathered and handed in such
plastic waste were given a bundle of the donated clothes in return
for their efforts.</P>
      <P>Lien returned to Taipei after ending his mandatory alternative
conscript service. In March 2004, he and his newly-wed wife flew to
Burkina Faso for another year of volunteer service. During the
period, he helped raise funds to build an orphanage and taught the
locals to run the orphanage. He also offered medical services for
Burkina Faso citizens.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the decoration ceremony, Amb. Sawadogo said this is
the first time that his country has conferred the prestigious medal
to a young foreigner. Traditionally, he said, the medal was only
awarded to his nation's political heavyweights, celebrities and
influential foreign figures.</P>
      <P>Lien, who is now working at Veterans General Hospital in suburban
Taipei, said he appreciates the honor the Burkina Faso government has
conferred upon him. Actually, Lien said he has learned a lot during
his four-year work in the African state, including tropical medicine
and French.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS DIVIDED OVER 'HOKLO COUNCIL' PROPOSAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan's education and legal
affairs committees will hold a joint meeting Monday to screen a draft
bill initiated by a Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) legislator
to set up a "Hoklo Affairs Council" under the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The draft bill, broached by NPSU Legislator Yen Ching-piao, has
received the endorsement of more than 60 lawmakers from across the
political spectrum.</P>
      <P>Hoklo, a sub-ethnic group in Taiwan, accounts for about 70
percent of the Taiwan population.</P>
      <P>Yen said the proposed council is expected to come up with
effective measures to preserve and promote traditional Hoklo culture
and language. Now that the Executive Yuan has set up special councils
to handle Hakka and Aboriginal affairs, Yen said, a similar council
should be established to deal with Hoklo affairs.</P>
      <P>Although his proposal has received support from 60-plus
lawmakers, many other legislators have questioned the propriety of
creating such a body at a time when the Executive Yuan is pursuing a
smaller and leaner government.</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party Legislator Lee Yung-ping said she
sees no need to set up such a council since Hoklo is the largest
ethnic group in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Wu Chih-yang and ruling
Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Hsu Kuo-yung echoed Lee's
view, saying that the existing Council for Cultural Affairs can carry
out tasks regarding preservation and promotion of Hoklo culture and
language.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT'S NEW YEAR ADDRESS TO FOCUS ON CROSS-STRAIT TIES: WANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 31 (CNA)
(By sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Saturday he believes that President Chen Shui-bian's New Year address
will focus on relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wang made the forecast while attending a New Year's Eve party
organized by the opposition New Party.</P>
      <P>Wang said local people, political analysts in particular, can
scrutinize differences between Chen's 2005 and 2006 New Year
messages.</P>
      <P>For his part, Wang said he looks forward to seeing resumption of
regular dialogue and exchanges between the two quasi-official
intermediary bodies -- Taipei's Straits Exchanges Foundation (SEF)
and Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS).</P>
      <P>"If the two bodies can resume dialogue, negotiations for opening
direct cross-strait shipping and air links would be able to make
headway," Wang said.</P>
      <P>President Chen has said on several occasions that he will outline
Taiwan's top national goals in his upcoming New Year address.
including relations across the Taiwan Strait, economy and domestic
affairs.</P>
      <P>The New Year address will stress that democratic Taiwan will
continue growing and thriving and will never fade away, Chen said,
adding that his New Year message will be even more important than his
two inaugural addresses.</P>
