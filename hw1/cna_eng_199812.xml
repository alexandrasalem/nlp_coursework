    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui, concurrently
chairman of the ruling Kuomintang, led a KMT campaign "oil tank"
mission Thursday to the front-line Quemoy, better known as Kinmen, to
stump for KMT legislative candidate Chen Ching-pao.</P>
      <P>Lee and the KMT campaign group flew across the Taiwan Strait to
Kinmen, located just 2.4 kilometers off the mainland Chinese coast,
to drum up support for Chen, currently a legislator who appealed for
help to turn around his "critical" situation as a result of
dogfighting competition.</P>
      <P>The visit to Kinmen marks the last leg of Lee's islandwide "oil
tank" campaign forays in the run-up to three-in-one elections for the
Republic of China's legislature, the mayorships of Taipei and
Kaohsiung, and city council seats in those two cities, slated for
Saturday.</P>
      <P>During a rally, Lee urged the Kinmen voters to cast their ballots
for Chen, whom, Lee said, will keep his promises to develop a
commercial port in Kinmen, subsidies to Kinmen's self-defense squads,
the overhaul of the Kinmen airport, and the building of a cross-sea
bridge between Kinmen and Liehyu Islet.</P>
      <P>Lee, meanwhile, also spoke to drum up support for Tsao Er-chung,
a KMT legislator representing Matsu who is seeking re-election. Matsu
is another ROC-held small island group located offshore of mainland
China.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General John Chang was among the KMT officials

    <HEADLINE>TAICHUNG COUNTY BOTHERED BY FOREIGN WORKER PROBLEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung, Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Central Taiwan's Taichung County, which so
far has introduced more than 18,000 foreign workers, has been hit by
increasingly serious instances of workers running away.</P>
      <P>Taichung County police said on Thursday that 988 of the
introduced laborers have run away from their contract jobs, and their
whereabouts have so far not yet been discovered.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the police indicated, 430 cases of foreign laborers
running away occurred in the county from January to November, while
during the period, 11 crimes involving foreign workers were reported.</P>
      <P>Although the latter figure is a 0.6-fold decrease from the same
period last year, crime involving foreign workers has become a thorn
in the side of law enforcement authorities, the county police said.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan opened the island's labor market in 1989, Taichung
County has been permitted to import more than 50,000 foreign workers,
while so far more than 18,000 persons have come in, a figure larger
than the entire population of the county's Shihkang village,
according to the Taichung County Department of Labor Affairs.</P>
      <P>The introduction of foreign laborers has brought tough troubles
to managers of foreign workers in the central Taiwan county, while
reports of workers' staying for prolonged periods on expired visas,
illegally working, running away and committing criminal activities
were consistently reported since their introduction, labor officials
of the county said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington, Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States is concerned about the
three critical elections to be held in Taiwan on Saturday, said ROC
Representative to United States Stephen Chen on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"According to my contacts and talks with Americans in various
fields, I feel that the Clinton administration and many Republican
and Democratic politicians are highly concerned about our Dec. 5
three-in-one elections," Chen told a news conference at Twin Oak.</P>
      <P>The de facto ROC ambassador said most Americans think that
Taiwan's upcoming elections symbolizes a "democratic China in
practice."</P>
      <P>Chen further said many Americans are curious about Taiwan's
political development in the wake of Saturday's elections for its
national legislature and the mayorships and city councils of its two
special municipalities -- Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, nearly all major American news organizations,
including the Washington Post, have sent journalists to Taiwan to
cover the hotly contested mayoral and parliamentary elections.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC representative office in Washington, D.C. will
set up an information center on Saturday to offer up-to-the-minute
election-related news services to the Chinese community and American
people in the greater Washington area.</P>
      <P>Richard Bush, chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT), is expected to visit the center on Saturday to get first-hand
information about the election returns, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"Bush is also expected to deliver a brief comment on the
elections based on his observation," said the ROC envoy.</P>
      <P>AIT is a quasi-official US organization authorized to
handle substantive relations with the Republic of China in the
absence of official ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN STANDARD OF LIVING SLIPPING, OECD WARNS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Canadian standard of living could fall
sharply during the next two decades, and the main cause is the
decline of productivity, the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) warned Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In its annual report on Canada, the Paris-based think-tank said
that unless action is taken, the Canadian standard of living could
drop substantially in comparison with the other 28 countries in the
organization.</P>
      <P>"The lack of productivity advancement combined with both the slow
growth of labor inputs and the capital stock could, if ongoing, lead
to a substantial decline in Canada's per capita income (measured in
purchasing power parities) relative to the OECD average," said the
report.</P>
      <P>One possibility envisaged by the report's authors is that the
Canadian standard of living could drop from about 110 percent of the
OECD average to just below the average.</P>
      <P>The report noted that compared with the major and the
fast-growing smaller OECD countries, "Canada has not kept pace on
several accounts over the 1990s." Those factors include a decline in
productivity, a situation unique to Canada among OECD members.</P>
      <P>The report suggested a number of policy priorities are needed to
"arrest, or at least slow," the anticipated fall in living standards.
One is that Canada's different levels of governments should consider
cutting taxes as long as the fiscal situation in the country
continues to improve.</P>
      <P>It also urged Canada to take measures to discourage people from
retiring early -- or even at 65 -- to forestall a projected decline
in the labor force.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is forecast to lead Asian
countries in economic growth in 1999 and 2000 while Taiwan and
India are rated among higher-growth countries in 1999 with South
Korea predicted to recover at a faster pace by the turn of the
century.</P>
      <P>In an article titled "Economies Slated for 2000 Recovery" in The
Australian on Thursday, the Australian's Asia business editor, Geoff
Hiscock, quoted Andrew Freris, managing director of the Hong
Kong-based Bank of America's global capital markets group, as
forecasting that every economy in Asia, except Japan and Indonesia,
will show positive economic growth rate in 1999 and even these two
countries should recover in 2000.</P>
      <P>But Freris predicted the economic performances across the region
will vary dramatically in the next two years with mainland China
taking the lead with a growth of 8 percent in 1999 and 8.5 percent in
2000.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was ranked second, with expected growth of 5 percent in
1999 and 2000, according to Freris.</P>
      <P>India was ranked third with a growth rate of 4.7 percent in 1999,
and its growth will further pick up to 5.5 percent by 2000. Korea is
expected to grow only 1 percent in 1999, but its growth will surge to
5.5 percent in 2000, according to Freris.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA EXPECTED TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC GROWTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  3  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australia government is expected to
revise its forecast of gross domestic product (GDP) growth higher in
fiscal 1998-99 and the official interest rate cut is seen as a signal
of slower economic growth in the following year.</P>
      <P>Federal Treasurer Peter Costello said the robust activity in the
third quarter of 1998 meant there was an "upside risk" to the
government's forecast of 2.75 percent GDP growth over the course of
1998-99.</P>
      <P>"We are living in difficult times. We haven't lived through an
Asian financial crisis before and it has global implications. And to
have weathered the first year with such exceptional strength in the
economy has been a major achievement," he told the Parliament on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Economists expect the federal treasury to revise its forecast for
1998-99 GDP growth up to at least 3.25 percent soon. But Costello and
Governor Ian Macfarlane of the Reserve Bank of Australia warned that
a downturn in the global economy over the next year was likely to
drag Australia's growth rate down.</P>
      <P>Economists said the official rate cut of 0.25 percentage points
to 4.75 percent from 5 percent was a preemptive strike against slower
economic growth in 1999.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister John Howard on Wednesday described the current
strong performance of Australia's economy as "the most golden of days
for the Australian economy."</P>
      <P>But Macfarlane warned the world economy was bound to slow next
year and it would drag Australian growth down, causing the country's
current account deficit to widen further.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING DETAINS LEADERS OF NEW OPPOSITION PARTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles, Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Lu-sheng Chu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"In a wide-reaching crackdown on one of
the Beijing regime's first opposition parties, police in three cities
have detained ten of its leaders, and the tearful wife of one of the
activists accused the communist regime today of 'cheating its people
and cheating the world,'" according to Wednesday's Los Angeles Times.</P>
      <P>The report, titled "Beijing detains leader of new opposition
party," said the crackdown indicated that any anti-Communist group
"will not be allowed to exist."</P>
      <P>Maggie Farley, a Times' staff writer stationed in Shanghai,
reported that the roundup came just days after Li Peng, the leader of
mainland China's Parliament, declared that any group opposing the
Communist Party "will not be allowed to exist," signaling the
official closing of a brief window of political tolerance in mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Intellectuals, artists and a handful of others have been allowed
to explore political pluralism in the past year or so. But with the
arrests of the members of the fledgling "China Democracy Party",
Beijing's leadership appears to have drawn a line between discussion
of political openness and actual organization to promote it.</P>
      <P>On Monday night, police entered the Beijing home of the chairman
of the party, Xu Wenli. They confiscated his computer, fax machine,
videotape and personal phone lists, his wife said, and took him away.</P>
      <P>The same day, authorities arrested or detained at least nine
other members of the party in Wuhan and Beijing, charging some with
conspiring to overthrow the regime, a serious offense that could
bring a life sentence.</P>
      <P>In Washington, the State Department criticized Xu's detention.
"We conveyed our strong views to officials in the (Chinese Ministry
of Foreign Affairs) today in Beijing and urged the authorities to
release Xu immediately," said State Department spokesman James Rubin.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Philippine President Joseph Ejercito Estrada
Wednesday said he has yet to decide on whether or not to free the 20
mainland Chinese fishermen arrested by the navy for poaching near
Mischief Reef.</P>
      <P>The chief executive said the request is currently under review by
the Department of Justice (DOJ) and still awaiting their
recommendation along with that of the Department of Foreign Affairs
and National Defense.</P>
      <P>"I will refer it to the DOJ who is studying the case, they will
give a recommendation to me by tomorrow. We will study first,"
Estrada said.</P>
      <P>A spokesman of the mainland Chinese foreign ministry, in a press
conference in Beijing, urged the Philippines to immediately release
all the detained mainland Chinese fishing boats and fishermen.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has proposed to share with the Philippines the
use of the fishermen's shelter they built at Mischief Reef, one of
the cluster of reefs in the Spratlys, which the Philippines is
claiming as part of its territory.</P>
      <P>Estrada said the government is likely to adopt mainland China's
proposal to share the use of the structure to ease tension between
two countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TINY BAND OF DEMOCRACY-SEEKERS GIVES BEIJING JITTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese authorities have launched a
major crackdown on dissidents trying to set up an opposition party,
detaining at least six members of the group in three cities, The
Globe and Mail reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Canadian newspaper said the detentions of the six and the
official arrest of China Democracy Party founder Wang Youcai are seen
as the Communist Party's attempt to squelch any notion that a
non-sanctioned political party can be set up in mainland China.</P>
      <P>By crushing a fledgling opposition movement, Beijing was accused
of violating "the basic criteria of human rights," the daily said. It
quoted protesting dissidents in Beijing as saying, "This contradicts
the international covenant on civil and political rights China has
just signed (in October)."</P>
      <P>Arrested were, among others, Xu Wenli, 56, and Qin Yongmin, 44.
"They are among the most influential figures in China's fractured
dissident community," the Mail noted.</P>
      <P>It said the tiny band of democracy-seekers has given Beijing the
jitters. For example, the CDP, launched in June, has only 500
official members in a country of 1.2 billion ruled for 49 years by
the Communists. Its open attempts to recruit ordinary mainland
Chinese have made the Communist Party nervous, particularly in
mainland China's present economic climate, the daily added.</P>
      <P>The National Post, another major daily in Canada, also gave a
prominent place to the reports, "Chinese police move against six
dissidents" and a "new party [is] muffled."</P>
      <P>The Post quoted the United States as saying, "It's a serious step
in the wrong direction." Washington urged Beijing to free Xu at once,
the newspaper noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is offering Indonesia help
on how to hold its first democratic elections in 1999, in which up to
130 million people will vote for their leaders.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Alexander Downer told the federal Parliament
on Wednesday that Australia would be willing to offer technical help
in the massive task of running the elections and advice on how to
develop a code of conduct to resolve differences and prevent disputes
in the conducting of the poll.</P>
      <P>Downer said Australian Electoral Commissioner Bill Gray recently
went to Jakarta to make a preliminary assessment of what was needed
for the 1999 elections in Indonesia, Australia's largest neighboring
country.</P>
      <P>"Australia after all is one of the world's oldest continuously
operating democracies and we have a lot to offer," Downer said.
"Our experience in holding elections means we are well placed
to assist in areas such as computerization of the compilation of

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian police have launched a hunt for
a man believed to be in a car in Sydney on Wednesday after extensive
searches located at least 25 letter bombs mailed from Canberra, one
of which exploded while being handled by a mail sorter.</P>
      <P>Police said 21 letter bombs were intercepted in Canberra, each
wrapped in white paper, measuring 11 cm by 11 centimeters by 2
centimeters, all carried the home addresses of Canberra-based people,
understood to include tax office and child support agency staff.</P>
      <P>The letter bomb was devised from a soda siphon bulb with some
mechanical device to cause it to trip -- and it had a quantity of
smokeless powder inserted in it, Police Commissioner Bill Stoll told
reporters.</P>
      <P>He warned more bombs could be in the mail heading for private
addresses in Sydney, New South Wales and Melbourne, and all of the
letter bombs came from Canberra.</P>
      <P>He said the dramatic event was unraveled after a female sorter in
Canberra suspected a small white parcel weighing about 100 grams and
threw it into an empty wheelie bin. The computer disk-shaped parcel
exploded, sending small chips flying through the room, injuring

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) stipulated on Thursday that investment in high
value-added industries is predicted to increase in the 1999 fiscal
year.</P>
      <P>In order to implement the Executive Yuan's Asia-Pacific Regional
Operations Center scheme, MOEA will select several high value-added,
technology-intensive and less-polluting industries with market
potential for promotion, said one MOEA representative.</P>
      <P>According to the MOEA's estimation, the number of industries
under promotion will reach 98, with a total investment value of
NT$87.6 billion (US$2.7 billion) in the 1999 fiscal year. This
represents 54 percent growth compared with 1998's figure.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, some 75 products will involve technology
transformation in 1999, a growth of 6 percent over 1998's figure.</P>
      <P>High value-added industries the MOEA have selected mainly include
aviation and space and high-quality screen industries. In addition,
promotion groups for information, biochemical technology,
pharmaceutical and precision industries will be respectively
established, one MOEA representative said.</P>
      <P>The utmost responsibilities of the promotion groups are to make
policies concerning the industry's development, technology research
and development, and investment in related industries, said the MOEA.
Other duties include creating a development environment and exploring
and integrating resources that are required by industries.</P>
      <P>There have been 35 investment projects under promotion as of the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court on Thursday sentenced
murder suspect Hung Hsiao-huei, who allegedly murdered and disfigured
her classmate, Hsu Chia-chen, to 18 years in prison and a deprivation
of her civil rights for 10 years.</P>
      <P>The sentence includes a 15-year imprisonment for an "obvious
intention of murdering" and 3.6 years for disfiguring the body.</P>
      <P>The judgment of the High Court is basically identical to that of
the Hsinchu district court, despite different opinions as to whether
Hung had the intention of murdering. But this did not affect the
final decision.</P>
      <P>The Hsinchu district court considered Hung's intention as
"unclear" while the High Court reckoned that Hung intended to kill
Hsu.</P>
      <P>The High Court believed that what led to the murder was Hung's
unauthorized use of Hsu's credit card.</P>
      <P>Regarding Hung's intent to murder, it was based on the fact that
the victim was brutally beaten before she had poured upon her a
powerful corrosive chemical, which disfigured her body and led to her
death, at the crime scene. The alleged murderer furthermore dragged
her body to the rear of the auditorium to keep it from being found.</P>
      <P>This cold-blooded and shocking murder happened in Hsinchu last
March. Hung, a graduate of National Tsinghua University's
radiobiology institute, allegedly murdered and disfigured the body of
Hsu, who was also a rival in a love triangle.</P>
      <P>The Hsinchu district court sentenced Hung to 18 years'
imprisonment, yet the prosecutor considered the conviction too
lenient and appealed to the Supreme Court. Hung also appealed to the
Supreme Court, believing her sentence too harsh.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's (KMT) candidate for
the Taipei City mayorship on Thursday stressed that the development
of cross-strait relations should be promoted under circumstances in
which Taiwan's dignity and safety is maintained.</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou said that if he wins the weekend election, he will
lead Taipei to engage in city-to-city diplomacy with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a press conference at his election
campaign headquarters, in which the hopeful introduced his experience
in joining the government's works on mainland affairs, including the
establishment of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and
the semi-official Strait Exchanges Foundation.</P>
      <P>He has also participated in drafting the "Guidelines for National
Unification," which outline the principles and steps that both sides
across the Taiwan Strait can take to expedite China's reunification,
and the "Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the
Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area" covering administrative, civil and
criminal affairs, the former MAC vice chairman said.</P>
      <P>With experienced knowledge on mainland affairs and contributions
to building systematized channels for cross-strait dialogues, the KMT
candidate introduced himself as one of the experts who can offer
suggestions on the government's current mainland policy.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed Taipei can never accept Beijing proposed "one China,
two systems" formula, while Taiwan must insist on its equivalent
status to mainland China as both sides seek China's reunification.</P>
      <P>"This is reality, not merely an opinion," Ma stressed, noting he
believes that the central government should be fully responsible for
the initiation and implementation of mainland policy, while the
Taipei mayor should not take part in making policy.</P>
      <P>The candidate for the city mayorship added, however, that if he
is elected to serve the position, he is willing to visit the mainland
in his capacity as city mayor as soon as the government ends its ban
on mainland China visits by local government leaders.</P>
      <P>But his visit must be on equal footing, meaning that if the
mainland side invites him on a mainland Chinese trip by merely
titling him "Taiwanese celebrity Ma Ying-jeou," he will never accept
the invitation, Ma stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES INCREASE US$4 BILLION IN TWO MONTHS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves increased
US$3.83 billion in the last two months, the highest rise since the
Asian financial turmoil began in the latter half of 1997, according
to government statistics.</P>
      <P>Reserves as of the end of November stood at US$88.07 billion, the
highest level for 16 months, and an increase of US$1.52 billion
over the previous month, breaking the record for single-month growth
since the start of the Asian crisis, according to the figures
released by the Foreign Exchange Department of the Central Bank of
China (CBC).</P>
      <P>The Asian financial turbulence caused Taiwan's foreign exchange
reserves to drop continuously since the second half of 1997, plunging
to US$82.92 billion at the end of October 1997 from July's US$90.25
billion.</P>
      <P>Recovery did not begin until the latter half of 1998, when the
reserves increased to US$84.25 billion by the end of September, and
rose again to US$86.56 billion at the end of October.</P>
      <P>Looking forward to the end of December, officials of the foreign
exchange department said that as long as the NT dollar remains strong
against the greenback, Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves should
break the US$90 billion mark again. Taiwan still enjoys the world's
third-largest foreign exchange reserves.</P>
      <P>The CBC's continuous purchase of foreign exchange, in addition to
incessant inflow of foreign capital into the domestic stock market,
were cited by foreign exchange traders as the reasons behind the huge
increase.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A number of ROC expatriates have returned in
the past week to campaign for their favorite candidates in the three
critical elections scheduled for Saturday, immigration sources said
on Thursday.</P>
      <P>As the Dec. 5 elections for the national legislature and the
mayorships and city councils of the island's two special
municipalities -- Taipei and Kaohsiung -- are expected to have a
significant impact on Taiwan's future political development, many ROC
nationals residing abroad have decided to make best use of their
voting rights.</P>
      <P>"The return of overseas eligible Taiwan voters has added to the
election fever here and is expected to reach a peak on the eve of
election day," said an immigration official.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the number of inbound passengers from
the United States has increased by about 10 percent in recent days,
while trade sources said many Taiwan business people in mainland
China have either already returned or will return before Friday
evening to exercise their "sacred right" to vote.</P>
      <P>Industry sources said the tight Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral
races are a primary driving force behind the recent "homecoming rush"
among mainland China-based Taiwan businessmen, particularly those in
southeastern coastal mainland provinces.</P>
      <P>Some Taiwan businessmen are only expected to stay in Taipei
overnight, and will return to the mainland as soon as they have cast
their ballots on Saturday, due to their busy schedules, industry
sources said.</P>
      <P>They further divulged that the hotly contested Taipei mayoral
race, and the recent spate of local corporate financial crises, have
been the hottest topics in the Taiwan business communities in
southeastern mainland provinces in the past few months.</P>
      <P>A senior executive with a Taiwan investors association in the
southern mainland city of Shenzhen told a local newspaper that most
mainland-based Taiwan businessmen are concerned about the island's
political development.</P>
      <P>"Most of them would like to see Taiwan continue to develop in a
secure, stable environment," said the executive, who preferred
anonymity.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, airline sources said many ROC expatriates residing in
the United States and Europe have also returned in recent weeks to
take part in the elections.</P>
      <P>One airline executive said that while the pre-Christmas period is
usually an off-peak season for US-Taiwan flight services, occupancy
rates for Taiwan-bound flights from the United States have remained
high in the past few weeks.</P>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL), Taiwan's former flag-carrier, said it has
offered special discounts for US-based ROC expatriates who are
eligible to vote.</P>
      <P>"Market response to our promotional program has been very
encouraging. The overall occupancy rate has increased by about 10
percent compared with the same period of last year," said a CAL
spokesman.</P>
      <P>EVA Airways said even though it has not offered any special
promotional package, the number of its Taiwan-bound passengers from
the United States has also registered a 10 percent rise in recent
weeks.</P>
      <P>The Overseas Affairs Department of the ruling Kuomintang has
worked hard over the past few months to mobilize eligible overseas
Chinese to return to campaign and vote.</P>
      <P>KMT officials said a number of overseas Chinese in 28 countries
around the world have returned to campaign for KMT candidates,
including a 212-member group from the US west coast which returned
earlier this week to campaign for Ma Ying-jeou, the KMT's candidate
for the Taipei mayorship.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, more than 200 supporters of the main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have also returned to
canvass votes for incumbent Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, a DPP
stalwart.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, airline sources said a record number of candidates for
the three elections and their campaign aides have also made
reservations for overseas trips after the vote.</P>

Taiwan to join the World Trade Organization (WTO), an Asian analyst
with a Washington think-tank said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Greg Mastel, vice president of the Economic Strategy Institute

admission is in line with President Clinton's "three noes" policy
toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Most importantly, Mastel noted, the United States' acceleration
on Taiwan's WTO admission can result in more pressure on Beijing to
open its own markets.</P>
      <P>At an ESI-sponsored workshop on mainland China's joining the WTO,
Mastel professed that the United States plays the "Taiwan card,"
saying that it is time for the Clinton administration to push forward
with Taiwan's bid to join the WTO.</P>
      <P>Mastel, an economist whose expertise includes US trade policy,
also wrote in The Commercial Times recently to urge Washington to
vigorously support Taiwan's bid to join the WTO. By doing so, he
said, Washington is intensifying the United States' long-heralded
policy of opposing political intervention in WTO operations and
simply considering the business and trade conditions of the applicant
nations.</P>
      <P>He noted that the United States' attempt to have Taiwan admitted
into the WTO before mainland China may not succeed, but Washington is
sending a strong message regarding its determination simply by making
the move.</P>
      <P>Mastel said since the United States has already expressed the
belief that Taiwan's trade regime is open enough to qualify itself to
enter the WTO, Washington should not be restricted by political
barriers from Beijing in the regard.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said, Taiwan is applying for a membership under the
name of a single customs territory, which does not run counter to
President Clinton's "three noes" policy of not supporting Taiwan's
independence, "one China, one Taiwan" or Taiwan's membership in
international organizations that require statehood.</P>
      <P>As Washington-Beijing bilateral consultations on mainland China's
WTO admission have stagnated, Mastel said the United States should
push for Taiwan's early WTO admission to intensify pressure on
Beijing on the one hand, while using trade weapons, such as its "301
list" to push mainland China to further open its markets on the
other.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WENG WILL DO A BETTER JOB: SHIH CHI-YANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Angel Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui nominated on Thursday
senior Grand Justice Weng Yueh-Sheng as Judicial Yuan president,
according to a news release from the presidential office.</P>
      <P>Incumbent Judicial Yuan President Shih Chi-yang said on Friday
that he is glad to be leaving the post and strongly believes that
Grand Justice Weng will do an even better job than Shih as Judicial
Yuan president.</P>
      <P>Both Shih and Weng graduated from the law department of National
Taiwan University, where Shih was two years ahead of Weng. In
addition, both of them pursued their graduate study in Germany's
Heidelberg University, where Weng was one year ahead of Shih. In
addition to having been friends for a long time, the two have also
been schoolmates and even roommates.</P>
      <P>Shih will still be a senior adviser to President Lee
Teng-hui after his resignation. Shih asserted that judicial reform
can never slow down and he will continue to promote this idea in
academic circles.</P>
      <P>Weng and some other grand justices called on Shih on Friday
morning to show their respect. "President Lee considers judicial
reform as important, and expects that judicial reform could be
accelerated," said Weng. Weng added that while he has less experience
in judicial administration, he will definitely do his best in this
post.</P>
      <P>Concerning Shih's measures to promote judicial reform, such as
holding national judicial reform conferences and imposing
restrictions on the chief justice's term of office, Weng pointed out
that his policies cannot be announced until the National Assembly
formally approves his appointment.</P>
      <P>Weng was born in the countryside of Chiayi in southern Taiwan in
1932. He was first appointed grand justice during the Council of
Grand Justice's third term and was re-appointed an unprecedented
three times. The senior-most grand justice, Weng is highly respected
in academic and legal circles.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO HOST SEMICONDUCTOR CONFERENCE IN US</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will host the Taiwan-US Semiconductor
Conference of 1998 from Dec. 9 to 10 in Santa Clara, located within
the United States' Silicon Valley, to help promote cooperative
relationships between semiconductor businesses and manufacturers in
Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>The two-day conference is being sponsored by the China External
Trade Development Council (CETRA) and the Ministry of Economic
Affairs' Committee for Information Industry Development, with the
support of several Republic of China commercial and industry
associations, including the Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association
(TSIA), the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers'
Association and the Monte Jade Science and Technology Association
(MJSTA).</P>
      <P>TSIA and MJSTA leaders have been invited to deliver speeches
during the conference on Taiwan's current semiconductor development.
Conference attendees will include representatives from various fields
within the semiconductor and electronic system industries.</P>
      <P>CETRA will lead a delegation comprising representatives from
Taiwan's top 12 enterprises in the semiconductor industry to the
high-profile meeting, in which the representatives are to present
their company's latest developments in areas such as integrated
circuit (IC) design, manufacturing, packaging and testing, as well as
global logistics and service.</P>
      <P>The companies are also scheduled to hold one-on-one meetings with
participating US businesses during the conference to discuss
technology transfers, procurement issues, joint ventures and original
equipment manufacturing (OEM) business opportunities</P>
      <P>Around 200 representatives of 140 US businesses are expected to
participate in the conference, which will be presided over by CETRA
General-Secretary Ricky Kao.</P>
      <P>Taiwan companies participating in the meeting are Acer
Semiconductor, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Macronix
International, United Micro Electronics, Powerchip, Winbond
Electronics, Global Uni Chip, Integrated Technology, Worldwide
Semiconductor, Orient Semiconductor, Advanced Semiconductor and
Walsin Advance, according to CETRA.</P>
      <P>The combined output of those 12 companies accounts for 58 percent
of the total output from Taiwan's semiconductor industry, CETRA said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's semiconductor production value is the fourth largest in
the world, following the United States, Japan and South Korea. Its
share of the global market, however, totals only 3 percent, which
means there is still ample room for Taiwan to push into global
markets, CETRA officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan semiconductor manufacturers have to globalize and enhance
their competitiveness by forging cooperation and strategic alliances
with large enterprises worldwide, they added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US CORRECTS ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES FOR TAIWAN STEEL PRODUCTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Commerce Department announced on
Thursday a reduction on anti-dumping duties on imported stainless
steel plates in coils from Taiwan from 67.68 percent to 3.08 percent.</P>
      <P>The department explained that the initial percentage was the
result of negligence in the filling out of administrative paperwork.
Due to this error, however, Taiwan's steel exports could not get
through customs until the guaranty money was paid.</P>
      <P>The department made a preliminary determination of anti-dumping
duties on Oct. 28, when it levied duties on imports from Taiwan,
South Korea, Belgium, Italy, Canada and South Africa. The duties
resulted from the United States' belief that those countries were
dumping stainless steel plates in coils on the US market at unfairly
low prices. The duties varied among countries, and Taiwan's was the
highest among the group.</P>
      <P>Tachen International Stainless Steel Co., a US-based affiliate of
Tachen Stainless Steel Co., was accused by the US steel industry of
helping its mother company and another Taiwan company to sell their
steel at unfairly low prices. The department determined Tachen
International was dumping steel on the US market, and as a result,
preliminary anti-dumping duties were also applied to this affiliate.</P>
      <P>A public hearing will be held in the middle of December to listen
to legal consultants from Tachen and the US steel industry before a
final decision on the matter is made.</P>

      <P>As a member of the Republic of China's
foremost academic research body, Academia Sinica President Yuan T.
Lee on Friday stated his position that academia should be neutral
when it comes to politics.</P>
      <P>Lee, who won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1986, said in a
formal statement he was in no way involved with campaign
advertisements that have appeared recently which show him supporting
Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Lee called the ads the "personal actions of the candidate."</P>
      <P>Lee made the statement after being besieged with phone calls and
inquiries about his political affiliation in the wake of the
appearance of ads, both in print and on television, showing him
speaking in support of Chen, a Democratic Progressive Party candidate
seeking re-election.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the campaign ads were Chen's doing and that his
stance on remaining neutral in politics has never changed.</P>
      <P>The ad depicts Lee praising Chen as a good mayor and is based on

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT TO MAKE TRANSIT STOP IN NEW YORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By David Wang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Vice President Lien Chan will make a
transit stop in New York on his way to a four-country Central
American visit, reliable sources said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Lien will arrive in New York on
Saturday (local time) and is scheduled to leave for Nicaragua via a
chartered plane on Monday.</P>
      <P>Lien is expected to abide by a tacit agreement with the US State
Department that he will neither engage in any public activities nor
meet with journalists during his transit stay in New York.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chinese-language media and Taiwan journalists
stationed in New York are still gearing up in preparations for
Lien's arrival. They hope to know whether Lien will secretly meet
with any VIPs during his New York stay.</P>
      <P>Taiwan journalists stationed here also plan to ask Lien about
his comments on the outcome of the island's Dec. 5 elections
for the national legislature and the mayorships and city councils of
Taipei and Kaohsiung, the island's two largest cities.</P>
      <P>Lien will leave Taipei right after casting his ballots for the
three critical elections. He is expected to be informed of the
election returns on his flight to New York.</P>
      <P>The Chinese community here is concerned about the election
outcome as it is expected to have a significant impact on
Taiwan's future political development.</P>
      <P>Lien will visit four hurricane-stricken countries --
Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador -- on behalf of
President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>In addition to extending the ROC government and people's concern
to the four Central American allies, Lien will discuss with their
top leaders feasible ways to assist them in reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Lien will be accompanied by a small entourage on his Central
American tour. Key members of his entourage will included Foreign
Minister Jason Hu and Su Chi, deputy secretary-general to President
Lee.</P>
      <P>Following his four-leg Central American visit, Lien will also
make a transit stop in Los Angeles on Dec. 12 on his way home.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear whether Lien has any undisclosed itinerary
during his upcoming overseas visit. In the past, Lien had often made
impromptu, unofficial visits to countries which recognize Beijing
instead of Taipei.</P>
      <P>In the face of mainland China's diplomatic strangulation strategy
against Taiwan, senior ROC officials have often had to keep their
overseas visits secret. In some cases, they were forced to cancel
their travel plans because of Beijing's protests to host countries.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China government has offered a total of US$2.6
million in relief aid to the four Central American countries after
they were ravaged by the hurricane. Moreover, several large
Taiwan charity organizations have also launched fund-raising
campaigns to pool private resources for various relief programs.</P>
      <P>The ROC's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also hosted a fund-raising
dinner earlier this week to help Central American victims. Many local
celebrities reserved seats at the NT$10,000 (US$308) per plate dinner
at Grand Hyatt Taipei hotel to throw their support behind the
fund-raising drive.</P>
      <P>The ministry has also launched a separate campaign dubbed
"Sending Our Love to Central America," to raise funds for the
hurricane victims, and has opened special accounts with the
International Commercial Bank of China and the Post Office, to which
members of the public can remit donations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The election battle in Taipei between
Mayor Chen Shui-bian and Ma Ying-jeou was featured as a highlight
recently in the largest business newspaper in Australia, and the
daily regards the competition as a possible warm-up for Taiwan's 2000
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Australian Finanical Review correspondent Rowan Callick reported
the focus is in Taipei where Chen, the highest-profile figure in the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is competing against Ma, a popular
and glamorous politician with the Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Whereas the DPP favors independence for Taiwan, the KMT prefers
eventual reunification with mainland China.</P>
      <P>The daily reported both Chen and Ma are regarded as likely
candidates to replace President Lee Teng-hui in 2000 when the next
presidential election takes place.</P>
      <P>Callick's three-column article, titled "The Bad Blood in Taipei,"
appeared on the "World Page" of the newspaper on Friday, along with a
Reuters picture showing Ma holding incense and praying to Kuan Kung,
a Chinese deity, for the good luck on election day, Dec. 5.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Martin Lee of Hong Kong's Democratic Party as
saying, "We always look at the mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong
together in terms of fundamental democracy, and of course here
(Taiwan) clearly ranks No. 1."</P>
      <P>The daily also mentioned Taiwan's economic growth of 5 percent
this year and its huge foreign exchange reserves, one of the biggest
in the world.</P>

      <P>The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) has
won the right to search Australian athletes' bags and clothing for
banned drugs at the 2000 Games in Sydney in a move to fight doping.</P>
      <P>AOC President John Coates said on Thursday his committee has put
a new clause in its Athletes Agreement for the 2000 Olympic Games, a
contract all athletes must sign before they are selected for
Australia, which gives the committee "search and seizure" powers.</P>
      <P>Coates said the search will also apply to team officials, because
the measure would prevent drug trafficking by the team and protect
athletes who may inadvertently pack a banned substance.</P>
      <P>Coates said the AOC would not use the power lightly. "We will be
very, very cautious about doing it. It's certainly not something we
would do as a matter of routine, but it does address difficulties

      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
received US congressman Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), on Friday and
said that he hopes the United States will maintain its defense
committments to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The Republic of China is already a real democratic and liberal
country," said Representative Rohrabacher, who is in Taiwan to
observe the island's "three-in-one" elections on Saturday.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of US President Clinton's state visit to
mainland China, the US Congress approved an unanimous resolution
reaffirming its support of the Republic of China, said President
Lee, adding that this resolution will greatly contribute to balancing
US policies toward mainland China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Communist China has never renounced its use of force against
Taiwan and even intimidated Taiwan through military exercises during
the 1996 ROC presidential election," said Lee. Lee said he expects
the United States will continue to provide defensive weapons to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Rohrabacher, a strong supporter of Taiwan in the US Congress, said
Taiwan should be considered the focus of the United States' security
concerns in Asia. He has also given full support to a proposal to
include Taiwan in the US anti- ballistic missile defense system.</P>
      <P>Rohrabacher also talked to President Lee about holding a "Free

stars from the United States as well as Asia. President Lee replied
that music is the best international language and that he is looking

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 80 percent of registered voters in
Taipei are expected to take part in Saturday's mayoral election, a
voter turnout higher than those in the 1994 mayoral elections in
Taipei and Kaohsiung, the top official of the Central Election
Commission (CEC) predicted Friday.</P>
      <P>Chien Tai-lang, CEC's secretary-general, said that since the
three candidates in the upcoming Taipei mayoral election are all
considered outstanding, voters are particularly inclined to go to the
polls.</P>
      <P>The total population of Taiwan as of June 30, 1998, numbered
21.83 million, of which 14.96 million were eligible voters, according
to statistics released by the CEC.</P>
      <P>On Saturday the 1,868,860 residents of Taipei City eligible to
vote will choose from among three candidates -- Ma Ying-jeou of the
ruling Kuomintang, sitting Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and Wang Chien-shien of the New Party (NP) --
for mayor.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, 1,004,872
registered voters will elect a mayor from among four candidates --
incumbent Mayor Wu Den-yih of the KMT, Hsieh Chang-ting of the DPP,
Wu Chien-kuo of the NP and independent candidate Cheng Teh-yao.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that 80.65 percent of Kaohsiung's voters and
78.54 percent of Taipei's voters took part in their cities'
respective mayoral elections in 1994, while 76.12 percent of voters
took part in national legislative elections, it is evident that
Taiwan has traveled quickly along the road of democracy, said Chien.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead to the forthcoming three-in-one elections --
mayoral and city councilor elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung, and
national-level legislative elections -- Chien pointed out that the
intense competition among candidates will surely stimulate voter
turnout. He predicted voter turnout on Saturday could hit a record
high of 82 percent.</P>
      <P>The current record is the 80.65 percent turnout recorded in
Kaohsiung's 1994 mayoral election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGNERS SHOULD NOT STUMP FOR CANDIDATES: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
official said on Friday it is inappropriate for foreign nationals to
stump for candidates in Taiwan's political elections.</P>
      <P>Shen Lyu-shun, director of the MOFA's North American Affairs
Department, made the statement in response to reports that Austrian
Trade Delegate to Taiwan Ingomar Locheshmidt stumped for Frank Hsieh,
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's candidate for the
Kaohsiung City mayorship, on Thursday evening.</P>
      <P>Shen said he will have to investigate further to determine
whether or not Locheshmidt's action violated Republic of China law.
"Nevertheless, even if such a move was legal, it was not
appropriate," he noted.</P>
      <P>Shen went on to say that some American and Canadian nationals
have voluntarily organized observation groups to watch the run-up to
the ROC's Dec. 5 elections for the national legislature and the
mayorships and city councils of Taipei and Kaohsiung, the island's
two special municipalities.</P>
      <P>"MOFA has not extended invitations to them, but we welcome their
visits," Shen said, adding that the ministry has adopted a neutral,
impartial stand in receiving foreign observation groups.</P>
      <P>For example, if a foreign group has asked to visit a specific
political party's campaign headquarters, the ministry has
consistently arranged for the group to also visit the campaign
offices of other major political parties.</P>
      <P>Many observation groups from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau
have also come to Taiwan in recent days to see for themselves the
island's three critical elections which are expected to have a
significant impact on the island's future political development.</P>
      <P>In addition, major news organizations in Hong Kong, Japan, the
United States, Europe, and many other countries have also sent
journalists to Taiwan to cover the elections, particularly the hotly
contested Taipei mayoral race.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PREMIER URGES WIDENING OF IT APPLICATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan on Friday urged
the information technology (IT) industry to improve Taiwan's
competitiveness by expanding the applications of information
technology.</P>
      <P>Liu made the statement during the inauguration of an "IT Month
Exhibition."</P>
      <P>The total output of Taiwan's IT hardware products ranks third
worldwide, yet Taiwan's IT industry produces only 6 percent as much
software as it does hardware.</P>
      <P>A widening of IT applications is needed, Liu said.</P>
      <P>To achieve this goal, the government has planned to spend NT$ 8.7
billion to speed up the construction of a national information
communication network.</P>
      <P>The island's communication network is expected to be completed by
the end of 1999, by which point all elementary schools will be
equipped with the necessary facilities for web surfing, Liu said.</P>
      <P>The number of people in Taiwan who use the World Wide Web is
expected to reach 2.8 million by the end of 1998, yet the number of
people in Taiwan who use other computer applications -- such as word
processing, video conferencing and e-mail -- lags far behind those of
other technology advanced countries, Liu added.</P>
      <P>It is critical for Taiwan to adapt to future challenges, such as
the Y2K crisis, brought about by the advent of information society.
The Republic of China government is drafting contingency plans in
anticipation of these challenges, Liu said, as he urged industries to
face these challenges with greater concern.</P>
      <P>The exhibition has entered its 19th year. It is the world's 
third-largest computer exhibition, trailing only the Comdex Show in
Las Vegas of the United States and an annual IT exhibition in
Hanover, Germany.</P>

      <P>The New Taiwan dollar hit a new high in
nearly nine months against the US dollar on the Taipei foreign
exchange market Friday to finish at 32.36, UP NT$0.044 on the previous
day's close.</P>
      <P>Interbank US dollar transactions amounted to US$589 million, the

      <P>The local currency opened at 32.386 and fluctuated between 32.315
and 32.395.</P>
      <P>The NT dollar's going strong Friday attributed mainly to heavy
selling pressure of the US dollar and the continuous inflow of
the hard currency from abroad.</P>
      <P>The local currency has got its stream for four consecutive
trading sessions with a cumulative gains of NT$0.069.</P>
      <P>Dealers said that the Central Bank of China will probably
intervene by buying the greenback in the next trading sessions in a

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S 1999 MACROECONOMIC POLICY HIGHLIGHTS ECONOMIC UPGRADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) has initiated "economic upgrade," "government
reform," and "social reform" as three key components of the country's
1999 macroeconomic policy.</P>
      <P>The government, meanwhile, is also urged to make more efforts to
expand the nation's diplomatic relations and to improve the links
between Taiwan and mainland China, according to the CEPD's newly
completed 1999 National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>The CEPD, the designer of Taiwan's economic development policy,
pointed out in the plan that the island's economy will continue to be
hammered by the continuing Asian financial crisis and that the island
will have to further strengthen development and accelerate its
national modernization to tide over the crisis.</P>
      <P>In order to achieve this, promoting a comprehensive economic
upgrade, expanding domestic consumer demand, and building up an
effective crisis management mechanism will be the top priorities in
the effort to stabilize economic growth.</P>
      <P>"Economic upgrade" was especially highlighted in the national
development plan, through an improved environment for scientific and
technological development, construction of science-based industrial
parks, and promotion of the development of the high-tech and
value-added industries.</P>
      <P>In addition, to further open the financial market and strengthen
the island's financial operation systems and legal controls, along
with continuing to promote the 12 major construction projects and set
up islandwide modern transportation networks, are also leading tasks
for the country's economic establishment in the coming year,
according to the plan.</P>
      <P>Under the heading "government reform," efficient service and
healthy financial administration are the principal goals, while tasks
for "social reform" include the improvement of social order, the
promotion of social welfare, and educational reform.</P>
      <P>As to how to expand the nation's diplomatic profile and improve
cross-strait relations, the national plan suggests the maintenance of
a powerful military deterrent force, while keeping up the efforts to
participate in international activities and promote cross-strait
exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA'S HUMAN RIGHTS STAND CRITICIZED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  3  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The biggest setback for the United
Nations' system for protection of human rights was mainland China's
successful lobbying to persuade its Western trading partners to
abandon any effort at a resolution at the Commission on Human Rights
session in Geneva critical of its practice, according to the Human
Rights Watch.</P>
      <P>The human rights watchdog group noted in its World Report 1999
released Thursday in Washington,D.C. that despite some encouraging
developments, mainland China's human rights practices remain cause
for concern.</P>
      <P>On the positive side, this past year intellectuals had greater
freedom to debate political and economic reform; some notable
prisoners were released, including the 1989 student leader Wang Dan;
community-based organizations continued to emerge; and the Beijing
government signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights.</P>
      <P>At the same time, however, the annual report said, strict
controls remained on expression, association and assembly, with
political and religious dissidents, labor activists, and supporters
of nationalist movements often facing arrest and detention.</P>
      <P>Western governments seized on tentative signs of tolerance to
strengthen calls for engagement, a desirable goal, but one that in
policy terms all too often meant silence on mainland China's egregious
human rights record. Visits of world leaders to mainland China were
marked more by symbolism than substance and were often accompanied by
preventive detention of known dissidents.</P>
      <P>In general, the Human Rights Watch wrote, mainland China "played
an obstructionist role in efforts to strengthen international human
rights," most notably in discussions on the International Criminal
Court. The government in Beijing took a largely hands-off approach to
the Special Administration Region (SAR) of Hong Kong, but this may
have been due to the generally pro-Beijing policies of the SAR
government.</P>
      <P>While the annual commemoration of the June 4 Tiananmen Square
massacre passed without incident in Hong Kong, and demonstrations in
general were permitted to go forward, many pointed out that no
incident had occurred in 1998 that really tested the "one country,
two systems" principle. As the economy continues to worsen and the
prospect of social unrest increases, "the test might not be long in
coming," noted the organization.</P>
      <P>President Jiang Zemin's apparently successful consolidation of
power during the year and the appointment in March of Zhu Rongji as
premier led to speculation that the two might work in tandem to
promote limited political reform.</P>
      <P>The human rights world report said the appearance of books that
would earlier have been banned, such as one linking corruption to the
lack of checks in the political structure, and greater tolerance of
public demonstrations during the year seemed to point in that
direction.</P>
      <P>But mainland China specialists pointed out that such openings,
followed by crackdowns, have happened so often in mainland China at
times when they served the interests of those in power that "it would
be foolhardy to conclude that this represented any lasting
liberalization."</P>
      <P>Greater scope for scholarly discussion of reform did not mean
increased tolerance of political dissent. Those who publicly
challenged the Communist Party, organized petitions to senior
officials on political issues, maintained links to dissidents abroad,
or had contacts with the foreign media were particularly vulnerable
to arrest and detention, added the report, citing many such
incidents.</P>
      <P>The Human Rights Watch continued that a few notable prisoners
were released at politically opportune moments, but hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of prisoners were still serving long sentences for
non-violent activities, and many dissidents were sentenced during the
year to re-education through labor.</P>
      <P>The human rights situation in Tibet also remained a major source
of concern, according to the report. At the end of 1997, Beijing
government officials made clear that a campaign against the Dalai
Lama and pro-independence forces would continue.</P>
      <P>Throughout 1998, a campaign was carried out to force Tibetans,
especially monks and nuns, to denounce the Dalai Lama, accept the
child recognized by mainland Chinese authorities as the Panchen Lama,
and admit that Tibet has always been a part of mainland China. Monks
and nuns who refused to be re-educated faced expulsion.</P>

      <P>Mainland China's arrests of key dissidents
and crackdown on an infant opposition party is set to sour its

      <P>Beijing authorities have accused one of the arrested dissidents,

another lengthy prison term.</P>
      <P>The crackdown has stunned the United States with the White House

a report by The Sydney Morning Herald from Beijing on Friday.</P>
      <P>The 55-year-old Xu is probably the highest-profile political
dissident remaining in mainland China, according to the daily. He has
served 12 years in prison after taking part in the ill-fated 1979

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States is to assist the Republic
of China in developing and launching eight small satellites to
upgrade Taiwan's weather forecasting capabilities, National Science
Council (NSC) officials said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The NSC's National Space Program Office (NSPO) will sign a
cooperative agreement with the US National Science Foundation in the
near future on the development of a constellation observation system
for meteorology and ionospheric climate (COSMIC), the officials said.</P>
      <P>Under the accord, the officials said, the US foundation will help
Taiwan manufacture and launch the eight satellites to collect
high-altitude temperature data and upgrade Taiwan's capabilities in
weather forecasting and global climatic change research.</P>
      <P>The NSC officials said the NSPO will employ personnel and
equipment used in the production of the ROC's first self-developed
research satellite -- ROCSAT-1 -- to manufacture the eight
COSMIC-related satellites. ROCSAT-1 will be launched in the United
States next month.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the NSC, Academia Sinica, and the Ministry of
Education will co-sponsor a ceremony on Dec. 22 to mark the
successful linkup between the two countries' very High-Speed Backbone
Network Services (vBNS).</P>
      <P>Taiwan will be the fifth country in the world to link up with the
US National Science Foundation's vBNS system, NSC officials said,
adding that the linkup will enable Taiwan to conduct state-of-the-art
technological research and help boost the effects of Taiwan's
national information infrastructure construction.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan is negotiating with the US Federal Emergency
Management Administration (FEMA) on the signing of a cooperative
agreement. Taiwan hopes to introduce FEMA's anti-disaster and
emergency rescue systems to help improve Taiwan's capabilities in
disaster control and relief work.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the United States will also assist the ROC in
establishing an advanced aviation weather forecasting system to
minimize flight risks.</P>
      <P>The ROC's Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) has commissioned
the US-based University Corporation for Atmospheric Research to
develop an Advanced Operational Aviation Weather System (AOAWS).</P>
      <P>The system is expected to effectively reduce climatic
change-related flight risks for Taiwan's civilian and military
aircraft, CAA officials said.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties, scientific and
technological cooperation between the ROC and the United States has
continued to grow since the two countries signed a bilateral
scientific cooperative pact in January 1969.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Washington have since signed a total of 106

believe that the major opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
may gain a great momentum in the Presidential election in March, 2000
if it wins the elections this Saturday. The DPP is known for its
pro-Taiwan independence position.</P>
      <P>Voters will cast ballots from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. Saturday to fill
the 225 seats in the Legislative Yuan, the nation's parliament. Of
the 225 seats, 41 will be allocated to major political parties under
the proportional representative system, and 16 will be reserved for
representatives of the aboriginal people and overseas Chinese. A
total of 383 candidates are competing for the remaining 168 seats.</P>
      <P>Most of the candidates are fielded by the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT), the DPP, and the New Party. Candidates of the
Taiwan Independence Party, the New Country Alliance, the Democratic
Union of Taiwan, and a few independent candidates are also competing
in the election for a four-year term. There are 14,962,000 eligible
voters.</P>
      <P>The KMT has been the ruling party in Taiwan for nearly 50 years,
during which time Taiwan grew up from the rubble of the Second World
War and became one of the four "little dragons of Asia." Established
in September, 1986, the DPP has become the second largest party in
the Legislative Yuan. In the last legislative election held in
December, 1995, the DPP won 33.2 percent of the vote, compared with
the 46.1 percent for the KMT. Formed by several former leaders of the
KMT in August, 1993, the New Party is the third major party, which
garnered 13 percent of the vote in the last election.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Independence Party and the New Country Alliance were
formed separately by former leaders of the DPP, while the Democratic
Union of Taiwan was established by local political figures who broke
away from the KMT. These three political groups are very young and
tiny.</P>
      <P>Officials of the ruling party said earlier this week that they 
believe the KMT will win more than half of the seats in the
Legislative Yuan. (more)</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN VOTERS GO TO THE POLLS SATURDAY (2)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT is running to unseat the incumbent
Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the DPP. Born in 1950, Ma graduated
from the National Taiwan University with a bachelor degree in 1972,
from the New York University with a master's degree in law in 1976,
and from the Harvard University Law School with a Ph D in 1981. He
served as minister of justice and minister of state from 1993 to
1996, and has taught at the National Chengchi University in Taipei 
since 1996.</P>
      <P>A prominent leader of the DPP, Chen graduated from the National
Taiwan University with a bachelor degree of law in 1974. Born in
1951, Chen served as a member of the Taipei City Council from 1981
to 1985, and as a member of the Legislative Yuan from 1989 to 1994.
He has been a member of the DPP Central Standing Committee since
1987. He was elected Taipei Mayor in 1994.</P>
      <P>Recent surveys indicated that the two candidates are neck and
neck, while candidate Wang Chien-shien of the New Party is lagging
far behind.</P>
      <P>Taipei is the capital city with a 2.62 million population, while
Kaohsiung is the second largest city in Taiwan with 1.45 million
people. The two cities are different from other cities in that they
are the only two cities under the direct jurisdiction of the central
government. The KMT is trying hard to regain control of Taipei in
this election.</P>
      <P>In the southern city of Kaohsiung, DPP candidate Frank C. T.
Hsieh (Hsieh Chang-ting) is running hard to unseat the incumbent
mayor Wu Deng-yih of the KMT.</P>
      <P>Born in 1948, Wu graduated from the National Taiwan University
with a BA degree in 1970. He worked as a journalist from 1971 to
1973, as a member of the Taipei City Council from 1973 to 1981, as
magistrate of Nantou County in central Taiwan from 1981 to 1989, and
as chairman of the KMT Taipei Municipal Committee from 1989 to 1990.
He has served as Kaohsiung mayor since 1990.</P>
      <P>Hsieh served as a member of the Taipei City Council from 1981
to 1989, as a member of the Legislative Yuan from 1990 to 1996, and
as a member of the DPP Central Standing Committee from 1986 to 1994.
He has been chairman of the DPP Central Advisory Committee since
1996. Born in 1946, he graduated from the National Taiwan University
with a bachelor degree in law in 1970 and with a master's degree in
law in 1974. He also studied in a doctoral law program at the Kyoto
University of Japan in 1975.</P>
      <P>Recent public opinion polls indicated that he and Wu are neck and
neck. Candidate Wu Chien-kuo of the New Party and independent
candidate Cheng Teh-yao are lagging far behind.</P>
      <P>Saturday's polls will also send 52 councilors to the Taipei city
council and 44 councilors to the Kaohsiung city council.</P>
      <P>Economic and social development prompted Taiwan to lift martial
law and the restrictions on formation of new political parties in
the late 1980s. Elections of all members of the Legislative Yuan were
held for the first time in December, 1992, and the president of the
Republic of China was elected by direct popular vote for the first
time in 1996. Taiwan has thus transformed into a full-fledged
democracy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's free election has made Beijing nervous and interested
many foreign mass media and scholars of political science. Mainland
China has sent dozens of researchers to Taiwan to observe Saturday's
elections and campaign activities. More than 150 foreign journalists
are also coming to cover the event. They are from the world's
leading news media, including New York Times, USA Today, CNN, BBC,
and the Voice of America.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TALKS ON HIGH-TECH PRODUCT DUTIES MISS DEADLINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva, Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior officials from 44 nations have failed
for the third time this year to meet a deadline for a pact to remove
all duties on a wide range of high-technology products, according to
reports from the Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) on
Friday.</P>
      <P>The talks' chairman, Martin Harvey, a New Zealander, has set Dec.
11 as the new deadline for an agreement on what he termed a "modest"
list. The new draft list contains only about 200 items, in contrast
to more than 400 originally demanded by participants, the WTO report
said.</P>
      <P>The Information Technology Agreement II (ITA II) talks failed
last month to meet demands set by developing nations. In particular,
Asian developing countries such as Malaysia and Thailand, hit by the
financial crisis, charged that the product list did not contain many
of their priority items, like color television picture tubes,
loudspeakers, and other consumer electronic items.</P>
      <P>Picture tubes have been kept off the list largely because of
pressure by the European Union, which has been lobbied by France,
Germany, the Netherlands, and other members, WTO trade officials
said. Manufacturers in those nations are seeking to protect
themselves from competition from Japan and the United States.</P>
      <P>As part of a trade-off, the EU would no longer insist on pushing
the United States to include fiber optics on the product list, the
officials said. A senior US official said "a lot of progress" was
made in the latest round of talks, but admitted more time might be
required to secure a deal.</P>
      <P>Disagreement also surfaced over radar and navigational equipment
and satellite parts, inclusion of which is favored by Canada, Israel,
Norway, the United States, and other nations, but opposed by India.
That country expressed "serious concern" about the presence of these
products on the list.</P>
      <P>To entice developing nations to support the package, a four-phase
tariff elimination period, scheduled to begin on Jan. 1, 1999, and
end in January 2002, will now not begin until next July 1.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the accord gives developing countries, in the case of
select products, until 2007 to phase out all duties.</P>
      <P>The original ITA I, brokered in 1997, called for the removal of
all duties on about 90 percent of global trade in high-tech items,
worth more than US$600 billion annually, and the ITA II is aimed at
extending the product list.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CBC EXPLAINS INTERVENTION IN NT DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the Central Bank of China
(CBC) said on Friday that the CBC's moderate intervention in the new
Taiwan dollar's exchange rate is carried out mainly to prevent the
nation's economic prosperity from suffering.</P>
      <P>In a regular news conference, Hsu Yi-hsiung, vice governor of the
CBC, said that in light of the recent oversupply of the US dollar in
the local foreign exchange market, the CBC has no choice but to
intervene in order to avoid the rapid appreciation of the local
currency.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports in the first 10 months of this year declined
more than 8 percent, Hsu pointed out, adding that if the local
currency appreciates too rapidly, export growth will be directly
affected.</P>
      <P>In response to criticism from the United States that the island's
CBC intervenes in the foreign exchange rate, Hsu claimed that the
central bank of any country would do likewise if necessary. The main
purpose of such behavior is to maintain order in the foreign exchange
market, he said.</P>
      <P>Asked if the CBC's continuous selling of the NT dollar and buying
of the US dollar will result in an oversupply of the NT dollar, Hsu
replied that the CBC would hedge against a local currency glut by
issuing negotiable certificates of deposit.</P>
      <P>Hsu indicated that heavy selling of the greenback resulting from
its weakness has led to the natural appreciation of the NT dollar.</P>
      <P>The NT dollar hit a new high in nearly nine months against the US
dollar on the Taipei foreign exchange market on Friday to finish at
32.36, up NT$0.044 on the previous day's close. Interbank US dollar
transactions on Friday totaled US$589 million, the highest single-day
level in two weeks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OUTGOING MINISTER RESPECTS DECISION TO PROMOTE HIM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Brushing off criticism that he was a stopgap
removed barely five months after taking up his portfolio at the
Ministry of Justice (MOJ), outgoing Justice Minister Cheng Chung-mo
said on Friday that he respected the president's decision to reassign
him.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who took over the helm of the ministry on July 15, was
named vice president of the Judicial Yuan by President Lee Teng-hui
on Friday.</P>
      <P>In a press conference called by the Government Information Office
to introduce new appointees to head the Judicial Yuan and the Control
Yuan, Cheng said that as a political official, he must obey the head
of state's decision to transfer him to a new job.</P>
      <P>At the request of the reporters present, he assessed his own
performance in his short-lived tenure as "not up to an acceptable
standard" because many of the tasks he envisioned have not been
completed.</P>
      <P>Describing a meeting with the president earlier this week, he
said Lee is very concerned about the lack of success of the
ministry's campaign to crack down on gangsters, illegal arms, drugs,
and vote-buying, and cautioned him that the public seem unimpressed
with recent judicial reforms.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Cheng said, the basic justice system under
the MOJ is quite sound, and needs only some technical improvements.
However, he went on, the Judicial Yuan needs an urgent revamp, but
said he would reserve judgment on this until he has taken office.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Jui-jen, the founder of a prosecutor's group
aimed at reforming the judicial system, admitted that Cheng's
promotion could snuff out the burgeoning "Five-year Judicial Reform"
program initiated by his group.</P>
      <P>He said he failed in an attempt earlier in the day to lobby Cheng
to stay in his post at the ministry until the full implementation of
the program which calls for an increase in the number of government
attorneys, an increase in the ministry's budget, and an improvement
in prosecutors' crime-investigation techniques.</P>
      <P>Criticizing Cheng for having set a bad example by pursuing a
higher position rather than addressing the problems at hand, Chen
said that his group, the Reform Association of Prosecutors, has come
to realize that judicial revamping lies more in the hands of
rank-and-file law enforcers than with the judicial head.</P>
      <P>He said the group will now weigh the idea of calling on future
justice ministers to sign a written promise not to use their office
simply as a step on the promotional ladder toward a more desirable
sinecure.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANDIDATES RALLYING FOR VICTORY ON EVE OF ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Braving pouring rain, more than 100,000
enthusiastic supporters geared up at the plaza of the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall in downtown Taipei on Friday evening to rally for Ma
Ying-jeou, the ruling Kuomintang's candidate for Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>Ma appeared on a stage erected at the center of the plaza at
around 8 p.m., drawing several rounds of hearty applause from the
public, who waved banners and flags and chanted slogans in praise of
Ma, who is posing a serious threat to the re-election bid of the
incumbent Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>ROC President and KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui also appeared to
stump for Ma, provoking further waves of applause and jubilant cries
from the spectators.</P>
      <P>Also noteworthy was the fact that backers of the pro-unification
New Party, brandishing the New Party's yellow flags, were also seen
among Ma's supporters, an indication that he has also attracted many
supporters from the pro-unification opposition party.</P>
      <P>Expressing his appreciation for the New Party supporters, and
stressing that he is fighting for all Taipei's citizens, Ma begged
the public to rally behind him and cast their ballots for him to
ensure his victory on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The New Party's hopeful for Taipei mayor, Wang Chien-shien, has
come under strong pressure to quit the race to help Ma defeat Chen.</P>
      <P>In his final campaign rally held at the Hsing Sheng Park in
downtown Taipei, Wang emphasized that the New Party is the sole
genuine opposition party, and the country's only remaining
counterbalance. With tears in his eyes, Wang vowed that he will stay
in the race until the last minute, and urged his supporters to
maintain a solid foundation for the ROC with their vote.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen, a DPP heavyweight, also appeared on three
occasions, including a mass rally with his supporters at the plaza in
front of the Taipei City Government, in a last-ditch effort to defend
his chance at a second term in the post.</P>
      <P>It is estimated about 100,000 attended the rally during which
several DPP heavyweights, including party chairman Lin Yi-hsiung and
former chairman Hsu Hsin-liang called on DPP supporters to rally
behind Chen to ensure the party's continued ruling status in the
capital city of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The latest public opinion polls showed Ma leading Chen by a
small margin.</P>
      <P>Voters in Taipei and Kaohsiung, Taiwan's two largest cities, will
go to the polls on Saturday to elect a new mayor and city council,
while voters in the rest of the island will elect the country's new
legislators.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, President Lee and Vice President and KMT Vice
Chairman Lien Chan stumped for the KMT's Kaohsiung mayoral candidate,
Wu Den-yih, who is competing fiercely against DPP challenger Frank
Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Wu, who has been in the post for two terms, or eight years,
appealed to Kaohsiung citizens to give him another four years to
allow him to accomplish several unfinished projects.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung, in conjunction with DPP
magistrates and township chiefs, also asked for public support for
Hsieh at their last campaign activity in the runup to Saturday's
election.</P>
      <P>The function was packed by thousands of DPP supporters, and
traffic in the surrounding area was paralyzed by the crowd.</P>
      <P>Both candidates, in addition to New Party contender Wu Chien-Kuo,
also launched caravan parades around Kaohsiung City to solicit votes
during the day.</P>
      <P>The New Party candidate categorically denied that he had backed
out of the competition, and a large number of backers gathered in
front of his headquarters to show their support for him. They later
conducted a torchlight parade through the city streets.</P>
      <P>Although there are four candidates for Kaohsiung mayor, Wu and
Hsieh are seen as the most likely contenders after one month of
campaigning.</P>

    <HEADLINE>26 PEOPLE INJURED IN BLAST AT FPG CHEMICAL PLANT IN TEXAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) Vice Chairman
Wang Chin-shu said on Saturday that all 26 FPG employees injured in
an explosion at the company's plant in the southern US state of Texas
are receiving proper care, and are now all in stable condition.</P>
      <P>Wang said that FPG, Taiwan's largest private conglomerate, has
authorized its Texas plant management to handle the aftermath of the
incident, including the care of the employees, none of whom were
seriously injured.</P>
      <P>Wang further said the FPG head office is still awaiting a
detailed report on the accident from its Texas-based personnel.</P>
      <P>According to a UPI report, an explosion and fire rocked the FPG's
ethylene dichloride (EDC) plant in Point Comfort, some 160 kilometers
southwest of Houston, at 8:45 a.m. on Friday (Texas time).</P>
      <P>The blast at the rear of the EDC plant caused minor injuries to
26 factory workers, the report said, adding that the injured were
first treated by a medical team at the plant and then transported to
area hospitals as a precautionary measure.</P>
      <P>The report quoted a plant spokesman as saying that the explosion
was in either the crude EDC tank or in a pipeline to the tank. The
spokesman further said that downwind air monitoring showed that the
level of EDC was well below Occupational Safety and Health
Administration levels for plant employees.</P>
      <P>The fire was extinguished by 11 a.m., according to the report.</P>
      <P>As a safety precaution, the report said, the entire FPG complex
along the Texas coast was shut down, and all employees were
evacuated. By 10 a.m., they began returning to restart operations.</P>
      <P>The US Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board says it
will investigate the cause of the accident.</P>
      <P>The raw material produced at the FPG plant is used in polyvinyl

      <P>FPG executives said earlier this year that the US federal
government and the Texas state government had already approved the
group's application in May this year to build a second naphtha
cracker at its Point Comfort chemical complex.</P>
      <P>Before giving the green light, the US authorities published a
notice in major Texas newspapers to soliciting residents' opinions
about the FPG's expansion project.</P>
      <P>"The US approval indicates that our plant operations and
environmental protection measures have met strict American standards,
and that Texas residents are not opposed to our US$750 million
expansion project," said an FPG executive.</P>
      <P>Construction of the new naphtha cracking plant is scheduled to
start early next year, and it is expected to become operational by

    <TEXT>
      <P>The final results of Saturday's
"three-in-one" elections will not be made public until Dec. 11,
the Central Election Commission (CEC) said.</P>
      <P>The CEC estimated that the results will be out before 11 p.m. on
Saturday, as the voting around the island ended smoothly at 4 p.m.</P>
      <P>Voting opened across the island at 8 a.m. for the people of
Taiwan to choose a fourth legislature, as well as mayors and city
councilors in Taipei and Kaohsiung, Taiwan's two largest cities,
which account for a quarter of the island's 21 million population.</P>
      <P>More than 1.86 million eligible voters in Taipei will elect a new
mayor from among the three hopefuls -- incumbent Mayor Chen
Shiu-bian of the major opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
Ma Ying-jeou of the ruling Kuomintang, and Wang Chien-shien of the
pro-unification New Party -- and 52 city councilors from 118
candidates.</P>
      <P>About 1 million Kaohsiung voters will decide who will be the next
mayor from four contenders -- incumbent KMT Mayor Wu Den-yih, DPP
challenger Frank Shieh, Wu Chien-kuo of the New Party, and
independent Cheng Teh-yao, in addition to electing a 44-member city
council from 105 candidates.</P>
      <P>A 225-seat parliament contested by 498 hopefuls will also be
elected by nearly 15 million eligible voters across the island.</P>
      <P>The CEC had estimated earlier that voter turnout in both Taipei
and Kaohsiung would surpass 80 percent, while the rate in the rest of
the island would hit around 65 percent.</P>
      <P>Ranking government officials, including President Lee Teng-hui,
Vice President Lien Chan, and Premier Vincent Siew, all went to the
polling stations near their residences in Taipei to cast their
ballots on Saturday morning, while Taiwan Provincial Governor James
Soong cast his ballot in central Nantou City.</P>
      <P>In the tight Taipei race, Mayor Chen, who is seeking a second
term, urged Taipei citizens to treasure his performance and hard work
over the past four years, and appealed for continued support to allow
him to carry out uncompleted missions.</P>
      <P>After casting his vote at the polling station near his residence
in the Wenshan district, KMT mayoral contender Ma said he is
confident of winning the race, as many enthusiastic supporters have
been campaigning for him.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang of the tiny New Party strongly criticized Liu
Cheng-wu, a prosecutor of the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office,
for stumping for Chen on Friday night. Prosecutors should remain
politically neutral in an election, and such behavior has gravely
violated this principle and tainted the image of law enforcement
authorities, Wang claimed.</P>
      <P>In the southern port city of Kaohsiung, all four mayoral
candidates called for support and urged the voters to use their
votes.</P>
      <P>In related news, the National Police Administration mobilized
nearly 60,000 police to help maintain order and security at the more
than 14,000 polling stations across the island. Prosecutors also
inspected polling stations in their districts to try to keep vote
buying and other irregularities out of the elections, and no major
incidents had been reported by the time polling wrapped up at
4 p.m.</P>
      <P>State Public Prosecutor General Ru Ren-fa called on the public
and all contenders to remain calm after the election results are
released. Any illegal activities will be harshly punished by judicial
authorities, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA WINS FISH WAR WITH SPAIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The World Court in The Hague has thrown out
Spain's challenge against Canada for actions that sparked an
international turbot war in 1995, saying it does not have the
authority to hear the dispute.</P>
      <P>Spain said Canada had violated the international law when it
seized a Spanish fishing trawler in international waters off the
coast of Newfoundland.</P>
      <P>The International Court of Justice's ruling supported Canada's
position that the court could not hear Spain's case because it does
not have jurisdiction over Canada on this matter.</P>
      <P>Canada's agent to the court, Phillippe Kirsch said: "This is the
end of the matter as far as the international court is concerned."
Spain cannot appeal the court's ruling.</P>
      <P>Canada justified the arrest by alleging the trawler was using
illegal nets. Canadian officials chased the boat and eventually
boarded it after warning shots were fired across its bow. The trawler
was seized and escorted into a Canadian harbor.</P>
      <P>Canadian authorities made the arrest under the Coastal Protection
Act, which gives officials the power to manage fish stocks in areas
that straddle international boundaries.</P>
      <P>Spain said the incident violated international laws which protect
freedom of fishing on the high seas.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ONE OF WORLD'S FREEST ECONOMIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is one of the top ten freest
economies in the world, and mainland China remains one of the least,
according to the 1999 Index of Economic Freedom just published by The
Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal.</P>
      <P>The annual survey measures how well 161 countries score on a list
of 50 independent criteria divided into ten broad economic factors:
trade policy; taxation; government intervention in the economy;
monetary policy; capital flows and foreign investment; banking; wage
and price controls; property rights; regulation; and black market.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that Hong Kong ranked first with a score of
1.25, followed by Singapore (1.30), Bahrain (1.70), New Zealand
(1.75), Switzerland (1.85), and the United States (1.90). Taiwan,
with 1.95, shared seventh place with Ireland, Luxembourg and the
United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Despite several years of progress, economic freedom decreased
rapidly in Asia in 1998, according to the survey. Of the 32 countries
graded, only seven improved their scores, while the others regressed.</P>
      <P>Four of the top ten freest economies in the world are in Asia --
Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand and Taiwan. However, it is
increasingly clear that some fallout from the Asian financial crisis
is resulting in decreased economic freedom for many Asian countries,
said the Washington-based think tank.</P>
      <P>The Heritage Foundation noted that Hong Kong, which consistently
has ranked first in previous indexes, appears in danger of
surrendering that position. In August 1998 and the weeks that
followed, the Hong Kong government spent some US$15.2 billion to
"ward off speculators" by buying private stock in the Hong Kong stock
exchange.</P>
      <P>Not only has the Hong Kong government failed to allow its
currency board to function properly, it has violated an important
rule of free-market economics: governments should avoid direct
ownership of private companies. In so doing, Hong Kong has
demonstrated that its commitment to the market may be weakening.</P>
      <P>The survey report added that most of the world's freest economies
are in North America and Europe, while most of the world's most
economically repressed countries are in Africa and the Middle East.
But North Korea and Cuba were at the bottom of the listing of 161,
with identical scores of 5.00, following Iraq, Laos, and Libya.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT TO CREATE NEW `PEOPLE'S ECONOMY'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Indonesia is embarking on a new program
to restructure the country's economic wealth, with the aim of
creating a "people's economy" or "ekonomi rakyat," according to
Singapore's The Business Times.</P>
      <P>The economic blueprint calls for at least 50 percent of the
country's distribution network to be in the hands of cooperatives and
small enterprises -- a move that would sideline the country's large
conglomerates controlled by ethnic Chinese Indonesians, it said.</P>
      <P>But officials of President B.J. Habibie's administration, led by
Minister of Cooperatives Adi Sasono, insist that the program is not
based on ethnic considerations.</P>
      <P>However, the proposals of "ekonomi rakyat" would see the nation's
assets and wealth redistributed to the 52,000 state-owned
cooperatives which have 39 million owners, who happen to be mostly
indigenous Indonesians.</P>
      <P>Frans Seda, economic adviser to Habibie, told the newspaper that
the concept of a "people's economy" is still being fine-tuned, but
forms the backbone of the reform process and the country's new
development strategy.</P>

      <P>Taiwan held three-in-one legislative,
mayoral, and city council elections on Saturday, the outcome of which
may be important to Australia, according to the Australian Financial
Review.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Taipei, the daily reported that Taiwan's
continued well-being is vital for Australia because it is the
fifth-biggest buyer of Australian exports, chiefly mineral products.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that Taiwan has evolved a unique style of
electoral politics: personalized, in-your-face, and of course
expensive.</P>
      <P>The daily said that Saturday's poll results will resonate far
beyond the island's 21 million people because their choices will help
frame the environment for cross-Taiwan Strait relations, which in
turn have a direct effect on stability in the Asian region.</P>
      <P>Neither the ruling Kuomintang nor the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party want to antagonize mainland China, which refuses to
drop its threat to use force to take Taiwan, the daily reported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT LIEN LEAVES FOR CENTRAL AMERICAN VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan left for New York
Saturday evening for a transit stop on his way to four hurricane-hit
Central American allies of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Lien will visit Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala
on behalf of President Lee Teng-hui to express the ROC government
and people's concern for the four Central American countries which
were hit hard by hurricane Mitch a few weeks ago.</P>
      <P>"I'll meet with the top leaders of the four countries to extend
our love and concern for their people," Lien said prior to his
departure, adding that he will tour hurricane-stricken areas near
the four countries' capital cities to look into their reconstruction
needs.</P>
      <P>Lien said the ROC government plans to assist the four countries
in building schools and hospitals, and in repairing damaged bridges
and highways.</P>
      <P>If necessary, Lien said, the government will also present
financial aid or loan programs through the ROC's International
Cooperation and Development Fund.</P>
      <P>Lien was accompanied by a group of senior ROC officials,
including Foreign Minister Jason Hu, Director-General Chan Chi-shean
of the Department of Health and Su Chi, deputy secretary-general to
President Lee, on his Central American visit.</P>
      <P>Representatives of several domestic charity and religious
organizations, including Chen Chang-wen, vice president of the ROC
Red Cross Society, World Vision Taiwan President Shao Ching-ming and
an executive of the International Fo Kuang Shan (Buddha Light)
Foundation, are also accompanying Lien on his overseas tour.</P>
      <P>Lien traveled to the southern port city of Kaohsiung Friday
afternoon to stump for incumbent Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yih. Upon
his return to Taipei early Saturday morning, he rushed to cast his
ballot for the Taipei mayoral election.</P>
      <P>Lien, a Kuomintang vice president, has campaigned strenuously
for KMT candidates for Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral elections, Ma
Ying-jeou and Wu Den-yih. He would be informed of the election
returns on his flight to New York.</P>
      <P>Lien is scheduled to leave New York for Nicaragua on Dec. 7via a
chartered plane. He will also make a stransit stop in Los Angeles on
his way home. The US government will offer Lien courtesy treatment
during his transit stay in New York and Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>The ROC government has offered a total of US$2.6 million in
relief aid to the four Central American countries after they were
ravaged by the hurricane. Moreover, several large Taiwan charity
organizations have also launched fund-raising campaigns to pool
private resources for various relief programs.</P>
      <P>The ROC's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also hosted a fund-raising
dinner earlier this week to help Central American victims. Many local
celebrities reserved seats at the NT$10,000 (US$308) per plate dinner
at Grand Hyatt Taipei hotel to throw their support behind the
fund-raising drive.</P>
      <P>The ministry has also launched a separate campaign dubbed
"Sending Our Love to Central America," to raise funds for the
hurricane victims, and has opened special accounts with the
International Commercial Bank of China and the Post Office, to which

    <HEADLINE>ROC-VIETNAM TIES CLOSER DUE TO INCREASED TAIWAN INVESTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5  (CNA)
(By Angel Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has become the
second-largest investor in Vietnam, Director Hung Dun-jen of the
China External Trade Development Council (CETRA) Branch Office In Ho
Chi Minh City said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The ROC is also Vietnam's third-largest trading partner, with
some 180,000 Taiwan businessmen visiting Vietnam annually, Hung said,
adding that the ROC-Vietnam relations have intensified as a result.</P>
      <P>Since Vietnam began switching to a market economy ten years ago,
it has been a rising market for foreign investors, said Hung. Eight
years ago, CETRA set up its branch office in Ho Chi Minh City in
order to attract Taiwan investment, making the ROC one of the first
countries to invest in the Vietnam market, he added.</P>
      <P>According to official statistics, Taiwan investment in Vietnam
amounts to US$4.26 billion, while unofficial statistics put the
figure as high as US$7 billion. In addition, the number of Taiwan
companies in Vietnam is estimated to be around 1,000.</P>
      <P>Hung pointed out that Taiwan's investment in Vietnam is mainly in
labor-intensive industries such as garment and shoe manufacture, and
cited examples such as Pou Cheng Corp., which employs some 10,000
workers on its enormous shoe production line, and Hualon Textile
Corp., which has started operating an artificial fiber factory with
US$200 million-worth of investment.</P>
      <P>In addition to export-oriented industries, some Taiwan
businessmen are also targeting Vietnam's domestic market, Hung said.
For instance, President Enterprises Corp. plans to invest US$140
million in three factories producing cooking oil, instant noodles,
and flour.</P>
      <P>Moreover, China Steel Corp. has signed a memorandum of
understanding with Vietnam, with the intention of setting up a joint
venture among Taiwanese, Japanese, and Vietnamese downstream steel
producers, Hung explained.</P>
      <P>Successful Taiwan investments in Vietnam to date include Vedan
Enterprise Corp.'s MSG production facility, with annual business of
US$185 million, while a Taiwan Sugar Corp. hog farm in the suburbs of
Ho Chi Minh City is also slated to start operations in January 1999.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan businessmen have become increasingly predominant
in Vietnam, and because marriages between ROC and Vietnamese
nationals have increased in frequency, ROC-Vietnam ties are expected
to intensify, Hung added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Saturday praised
voters for their democratic character as shown during Taiwan's
three-in-one elections.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks during an inspection tour of the
vote-counting center of the Central Election Commission (CEC) under
the Ministry of the Interior. He said the elections show the Republic
of China's democracy has become more mature.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen, who is
concurrently chairman of the CEC; Transportation and Communications
Minister Lin Fung-chen; Lin Cheng-chih, chairman of the Council for
Cultural Affairs; Chao Yang-ching, chairman of the Fair Trade
Commission; and Chen Chien-jen, director-general of the Government
Information Office, Siew inspected the center at the Police College.</P>
      <P>The premier stressed that due to the good demeanor of the
candidates and the highly democratic spirit of voters, the elections
ran smoothly and peacefully. They will enable the nation to travel
farther down the road of democracy in the 21st century, he said.</P>
      <P>Siew later extended his congratulations to all the winning
candidates in the elections. He also consoled those who lost, told
them not to be disappointed and urged them to respect the choice of
the voters.</P>
      <P>The focus of the election for mayors, city council members and
national legislators had been on the mayorships of Taipei and
Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) appeared headed to retake control of Taipei

    <HEADLINE>ELECTIONEERING CULTURE HINGES ON AWAKENING OF MASS MEDIA: NEW PARTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The three-in-one election on Saturday can be
called satisfactory; however, Taiwan's electioneering culture hinges
on the awakening of the mass media, which has been in these elections
an "accomplice" of those demonstrating unseemly campaign practices,
said the New Party's Taipei mayoral candidate, Wang Chien-shien.</P>
      <P>Wang said on Saturday that campaign activities on the eve of
election day by the other two candidates -- one each from the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) and the leading opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) -- were covered by the mass media, even though the events
violated election regulations by continuing past 10 p.m.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's mass media has become an "accomplice" to the KMT and DPP
"bandits," remarked Wang.</P>
      <P>Of the nearly two dozen penalty tickets issued by the Central
Election Commission under the Interior Ministry, incumbent Taipei
Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the DPP received 16, said Wang.</P>
      <P>The top official of Taipei's municipal government being at the
forefront of those violating regulations is woeful, said Wang.</P>
      <P>Wang expressed his hope that the media should censure those who
violated the rules.</P>

      <P>Candidates of the Democratic Alliance (DA)
won four seats in Saturday's legislative elections islandwide, but
failed to surpass the 5-percent threshold for the seats for
proportional representation.</P>
      <P>Election results released by the Central Election Commission

      <P>DA Executive General Chen Wei-chien lamented the outcome of the

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Incumbent Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian said
after losing his re-election bid that his defeat indicates that
Taipei citizens expect even higher quality of municipal
administration.</P>
      <P>Chen said "sorry" to a large crowd of his supporters for his
electoral defeat. "I feel sorry for failing to live up to your
expectation."</P>
      <P>Chen, a stalwart of the main opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), then offered his felicitations to his ruling
Kuomintang challenger Ma Ying-jeou, who won the tight mayoral race
with a lager-than-expected margin.</P>
      <P>Chen also offered his congratulations to his DPP commrade
Frank Hsieh, who managed to defeat incumbent Kaohsiung Mayor Frank
Hsieh to win the control of the island's second largest city.</P>
      <P>Chen said although he lost his re-election bid, it didn't mean
that his municipal government team was a failure.</P>
      <P>"During my four-year stint, the city government staff have
worked hard to make Taipei become one of the most liveable Asian
cities, and the city government's approval rating has consistently
stood above 70 percent," Chen said. "This means that the city
government team has not owed a debt to Taipei residents."</P>
      <P>Chen said the late British Prime Minister Winston Churchill lost
his presimership shortly after he led Britain to weather through his
country's darkest period and win World War II.</P>
      <P>In his farewell speech, Churchill said heartlessness to an
outstanding prime minister was a symbol of a great people. Chen said
he thought Churchill's remarks probably could also describe his
electoral defeat. "Heartlessness to the progressive,
hard-working city government team symbolizes that Taipei is a great
city," he noted.</P>
      <P>Chen said his defeat does not mean a setback to administrative
reforms. "On the contrary, it indicates that Taipei residents want
even faster, greater progress."</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes his successor will lead the city government
to an even brighter and more excellent direction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT WELCOMES RESULTS OF ELECTIONS, NEW PARTY ADMITS FAILURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Secretary-General John
Chang welcomed Saturday night the results of the elections for
legislators, mayors and city council members, saying it gave a small
boost to the party.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued after ballot counting drew to a close,
Chang said the KMT's share of votes had improved from 46 percent in
the last round of legislative elections to 51.27 percent, vindicating
the moderate and rational path followed by the party.</P>
      <P>Although the party's candidate lost the race for Kaohsiung mayor,
the KMT won back the mayorship of Taipei from the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and incumbent Mayor Chen Shui-bian. The KMT
also captured 97 of 176 contested legislative seats.</P>
      <P>The number of seats won by the KMT rises to 123 after taking into
account the seats awarded to political parties according to the
number of total votes they garnered.</P>
      <P>Chang said that 124 seats will give the ruling party a
comfortable majority in the 225-seat Legislative Yuan and ensure a
stable Cabinet and more efficient legislative process.</P>
      <P>Chang regretted the party's loss in Kaohsiung, where an incumbent
KMT mayor lost to a DPP challenger by only 4,565 votes, saying that
the party respected the voters' choice and would re-examine its
policy.</P>
      <P>The party official, however, took comfort in the fact that the
KMT held onto its majority in Kaohsiung's city council and achieved a
47-percent share in Taipei's city council.</P>
      <P>He said that the KMT would work to maintain voters' approval with
policies that are well thought out.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, New Party campaign manager Jaw Shau-kong said that he
accepts all the blame for the party's failure in the election. The
number of seats held by the New Party fell from 21 to seven, though
it will receive an additional four because of the number of total
votes the party obtained.</P>
      <P>Jaw admitted that the New Party's poor showing in the elections
rules out the possibility of it playing a vital role in the
legislature or of being a king-maker in the next presidential
election in 2000.</P>
      <P>The founder of the New Party, however, said the group will stick
to its aim of being a party for ordinary citizens to win back its
supporters.</P>

      <P>John Chang, secretary-general of the
Kuomintang (KMT), said on Saturday the ruling party will retain
control of the Legislative Yuan by winning 124 seats, compared with
the 116 seats held by the party in the present legislature.</P>
      <P>He made the remark after more than 60 percent of Taiwan's 14.9
million eligible voters went to the polls to elect candidates to the
legislature, which is being expanded from 164 to 225 seats.</P>
      <P>Of the total, 176 were directly elected, while 41 will be
allocated to parties according to the number of votes they obtain and
eight others will be awarded to representatives overseas.</P>
      <P>With the results still coming in, the KMT had already won some
100 of the 176 seats chosen directly by voters, while about 40 seats
had gone to the opposition Democratic Progressive Party and more than
20 to smaller parties, such as the New Party.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan province alone, the ruling party won 58 percent of the
votes by capturing a total of 83 seats out of the 143 seats being
contested.</P>
      <P>The heat generated by the mayoral races in Taipei and Kaohsiung
may have stolen thunder from the legislative elections, as voter
turnout averaged 65.11 percent, compared with 67.75 percent in the
last legislative elections.</P>

      <P>The main opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) admitted on Saturday that it suffered a defat in the
hotly contested three-in-one elections.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung said the loss of Taipei mayorship to
the ruling Kuomintang marked a significant setback to his party's
drive to become a governing party.</P>
      <P>Incumbent DPP Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian's defeat also dealt a
blow to Taiwan's democratic reforms and the DPP's efforts to promote
"Taiwanization," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said the DPP also performed poorly in the national
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence party garnered only about 31 percent of the
vote in the legislative elections, lower than 33 percent recorded in
the last parliamentary elections.</P>
      <P>The DPP managed to win 52 regional seats in the new legislature,
Lin said, adding that if at-large seats are caculated, the party
will have only 70 to 72 seats in the new legislature.</P>
      <P>"The DPP can only find a bit comfort from Frank Hsieh's win in
the Kaoshiung mayoral race," Lin said. "With Hsieh's win, all city

DPP."</P>

      <P>Lin further said the DPP should learn a lesson from its latest

    <TEXT>
      <P>New Taiwan Alliance (NTA) head Peng
Pai-hsien announced on Saturday resignation from his post within the
pro-independence group after candidates fielded by the group suffered
a humiliating defeat in two local elections.</P>
      <P>Expressing deep regret and sorrow in a public declaration, Peng,
who is also the incumbent Nantou County chief, said he decided to
quit the post to assume responsibility for the group's sweeping
defeat in Saturday's polls.</P>
      <P>The NTA, a splinter faction of the major opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), fielded 13 candidates for the first time in
the islandwide legislative race and five hopefuls in city council
elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung, Taiwan's two largest cities. Only
one NTA candidate was elected in the legislative poll.</P>
      <P>Urging NTA members to continue fighting for the future of Taiwan,
Peng said he is gravely worried about Taiwan's future, as the
election results showed that Taiwan's political activities are not
running on the right track and are symbolized by figureheads, black
money and factional struggles.</P>
      <P>NTA Secretary-General Hsiu Tien-tsai, a legislator representing
southern Taiwan's Tainan City and the only NTA candidate to win
legislative re-election, expressed surprise at the group's landslide
defeat in Saturday's elections.</P>
      <P>Public opinion polls prior to the voting showed that half the
NTA's candidates were likely to be elected, but the final outcomes
were a far cry from what they had imagined.</P>
      <P>Describing the NTA's defeat in Saturday's elections as a major
setback to Taiwan's democratic movement, Hsiu said that it is an
indication that room for "clean politics" in Taiwan is limited.</P>
      <P>Hsiu, however, said the NTA has no regrets over what it has
fought for, despite the group's electoral losses, because he is
confident that the NTA will continue to exist as a ray of hope in
Taiwan politics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee Ching-hsiung of the Taiwan Independence Party,
managed to win a legislative seat for the DPP splinter party in
Kaohsiung's first electoral district. Lee ranked at the bottom among
six elected lawmakers.</P>
      <P>All other Taiwan Independence Party candidates in both the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The just-concluded three-in-one
elections indicated that Taiwan has become a mature democracy with a
multi-party political system, American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
Chairman Richard Bush said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The top American liaison officer with Taiwan made the statement
at an election returns information center set up by the Republic of
China's representative office in Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Bush said Taiwan voters have made their choices in Saturday's
elections for the island's national legislature and the mayorships
and city councils of its two largest cities -- Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>"It is the most important that people's free will can be
expressed," Bush said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian's defeat, Bush said as
Chen, a stalwart of Taiwan's main opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), is young, he will still have a bright political future.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ROC Representative to the United States Stephen Chen
said the smooth, peaceful conclusion of the three-in-one elections
marks a step forward in Taiwan's democratic development. "We take
pride in our progress in this regard," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT, DPP EXCHANGE CONTROL OF TAIPEI, KAOHSIUNG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) exchanged control of
the island's largest two cities in Saturday's mayoral elections.</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou retook Taipei for the KMT, unseating incumbent DPP
Mayor Chen Shui-bian, while in southern Taiwan, incumbent KMT
Kaohsiung Wu Den-yih lost to DPP challenger Frank Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Chen beat the KMT's candidate, Huang Ta-chou, to grab Taipei's
mayorship, while Wu defeated the DPP's Chang Chun-hsiung in the last
mayoral elections four years ago.</P>
      <P>Celebrating his victory with thousands of supporters who gathered
at his headquarters, Ma said that his victory is a milestone for the
social integration. "It's a victory not for me, but for all the
citizens."</P>
      <P>Saying his election demonstrates the people's confidence in the
reform programs initiated by Republic of China President and KMT
Chairman Lee Teng-hui, Ma vowed to do his utmost to serve Taipei
citizens.</P>
      <P>He proclaimed that he will adopt some of the campaign promises of
other candidates, as long as they are feasible and good for the city,
in promoting the city's development.</P>
      <P>Outlining his "city government team" -- or the lineup of the new
city government -- Ma said that he will recruit talents, regardless
of their party affiliation and gender, as long as they are able and
uphold high moral standards.</P>
      <P>Chen meanwhile, admitted his failure as thousands of enthusiastic
supporters shouted "President Chen! President Chen!"</P>
      <P>Chen has been widely considered the most likely DPP candidate in
Taiwan's next presidential election, slated for 2000.</P>
      <P>Chen lost despite a 70-percent approval rating, as measured in
recent polls.</P>
      <P>"The relentless decision of the voters towards his 'progressive
city government team' just says that the citizens of a great city are
expecting much more and greater administrative efficiency from the
city government," Chen said.</P>
      <P>While congratulating Ma for the victory, the New Party's Taipei
mayoral candidate, Wang Chien-shien, urged Ma to take better care of
less fortunate groups in the future.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former finance minister, said that although he lost, he
succeeded in encouraging a "clean election" culture.</P>
      <P>Wang, who co-founded the New Party, said he would no longer
assume any post within the NP, but would instead help with the
development of the party as a volunteer.</P>
      <P>While in Kaohsiung, the DPP's Hsieh said that will enhance
Kaohsiung city's cooperation with the four other counties and cities
under the control of the DPP to establish a "new southern world" to
correct the long-standing imbalance between the development of
northern and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition to Kaohsiung City, the DPP now governs Kaohsiung,
Tainan and Pingtung counties and Taiwan City.</P>
      <P>Describing his victory as "a miracle," Hsieh said every vote he
has received represents the "deep expectation" of the voters, adding
that he would try his utmost to promote the development of the city.</P>
      <P>A disappointed Wu said that he hopes the mudslinging and trading
of accusations among candidates during the campaign period "will soon
be over" and that peace and calmness will return to the city.</P>
      <P>"We shouldn't try to find any excuse for the setback -- it's me
who should be blamed," Wu told his supporters.</P>
      <P>Wu, who has been governing the southern Taiwan port city for
eight years, extended his appreciation to Kaohsiung citizens for
giving him the chance to serve them. "I promised to be a Kaohsiung
man for the rest of my life and will always be concerned about, and
dedicate myself to the development of, the city," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, both the NP's Wu Chien-kuo and independent Cheng
Teh-yao said that their loss were not "beyond" estimation. Wu said he
will in the future serve as a voluntary worker and Cheng said he may
take part in other elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S RULING PARTY WINS IN ELECTIONS (1)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 5 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Saturday won an 
absolute majority in the Legislative Yuan, maintained its control of
Taipei and Kaohsiung city councils, and reclaimed Taipei city, but
lost the mayorship of Kaohsiung in elections.</P>
      <P>Voters in Taiwan, the Republic of China, went to the polls in the
day for the election of 225 legislators, 52 members of the Taipei
City Council, 44 members of the Kaohsiung City Council, and the
mayors of the two cities.</P>
      <P>Many political analysts see the KMT's victory in the elections as
an indication of Taiwan people's desire to maintain the status quo of
cross-strait relations and their confidence in the ruling party. The
KMT has been in power here for nearly 50 years, during which time
Taiwan developed from a poor agricultural economy after the
second world war into one of the world's major trading nations.</P>
      <P>The legislative election has been a focal point of attention. It
is generally believed that the election result may affect the
development of cross-strait relations, because there is a clear
difference in the policies of the KMT and the major opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) towards mainland China. The KMT
favors unification with mainland China in the future when it becomes
a free and democratic country, while the DPP prefers a permanent
separation from the Chinese mainland. It is feared by many people
that a victory for the DPP in the legislative election may push
Taiwan to confrontation with mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan, the nation's parliament, has 225 seats. It
takes 113 seats to win an absolute majority. In Saturday's
legislative election, the KMT won 46.43 percent of the vote, or a
total of 123 seats, exceeding the threshold for an absolute majority
by 10 seats. Voter turnout in the legislative election was 68.09
percent.</P>
      <P>In addition to the KMT and the DPP, four other political
organizations fielded candidates for the elections. They are the New
Party, the Taiwan Independence Party, the New Country Alliance, and
the Democratic Union of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Established in 1986, the DPP has become a major challenger to the
KMT in national elections. It won 70 seats, or 29.56 percent of
the vote in Saturday's legislative election. The New Party, which was
established by several former leaders of the KMT in 1993, is the
third largest party. It won 11 seats, or 7.06 percent of the
vote Saturday. (more)</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 5 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The three other political groups are rather new and small. The
Taiwan Independent Party and the New Country Alliance, which were
formed recently by former leaders of the DPP, won just one seat each
in the Legislative Yuan Saturday. The Democratic Union of Taiwan,
established by local politicians who broke away from the KMT,
obtained four seats. Independent candidates won the remaining 12
seats.</P>
      <P>The Taipei mayoral race is also a focal point of attention,
because it is believed by many observers that the DPP may gain a
great momentum in the Presidential election to be held in March,
2000, if mayor Chen Shui-bian of the DPP is reelected. However,
in Saturday's election, KMT candidate Ma Ying-jeou won 766,000 votes
to the 688,000 votes taken by incumbent mayor Chen.</P>
      <P>Ma, 48, is a US-trained scholar and politician. After graduation
from the National Taiwan University in 1972, he won a master's degree
in law from New York University in 1976, and a Ph D from the Harvard
University Law School in 1981. He served as minister of justice and
minister of state from 1993 to 1996.</P>
      <P>Candidate Frank C. T. Hsieh (Hsieh Chang-ting) of the DPP
successfully unseated mayor Wu Den-yih of the KMT. Hsieh was elected
Taipei city councilor in 1981 and member of the Legislative Yuan in
1990. He has been chairman of the DPP Central Advisory Committee
since 1996. Born in 1946, he graduated from the National Taiwan
University in 1974 with a master's degree in law. He also studied in
a doctoral law program at the Kyoto University of Japan in 1975.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Kaohsiung are the two largest cities of Taiwan. They
are different from other cities on the island in that they are
directly under the jurisdiction of the central government. The KMT
tried very hard to reclaim Taipei, which was lost to the DPP in
1994.</P>
      <P>There are 52 seats in the Taipei city council. In Saturday's
election, the KMT won 23 seats, while the DPP and the New Party took
19 and 9 seats respectively. The remaining one seat went to an
independent candidate. The KMT obtained 24 out of the 44 seats in the
Kaohsiung city council.</P>
      <P>Secretary General John Chang of the KMT said in the evening
that Saturday's successful elections are indications that Taiwan has
made considerable progress in democratization, and that the ruling
Kuomintang has won the confidence of the people in its
various moderate and effective policies.</P>
      <P>Economic and social developments enabled Taiwan to lift martial
law and the restrictions on establishment of new political parties in
the late 1980s. Taiwan has transformed into a modern democracy as a
result.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT'S CHAIRMAN CARD, NEW PARTY DESERTION SAID TO COST CHEN RACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Incumbent Mayor Chen Shui-bian lost his
re-election bid because of the "chairman card" played by the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) and because many New Party (NP) members abandoned
their party's candidate in favor of the KMT's, Chen's campaign chief,
Luo Wen-chia, said Sunday.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman and Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's
strong promotion of the party's candidate, Ma Ying-jeou, played
absolutely the key role in Ma's victory, Luo said, citing surveys
that indicated about 60 percent of the city's voters who had remained
undecided up until the end had voted for Lee in the last presidential
election.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) -- of which Chen is a
member -- also miscalculated the number of votes that would go to NP
challenger Wang Chien-shien, Luo said. The DPP had estimated Wang
would receive at least 5 percent of the vote, though he ended up
receiving only 2.9 percent.</P>
      <P>"It's really beyond our expectations," said a downtrodden Luo,
who was the executive secretary-general of Chen's campaign
headquarters.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that the number of votes Chen received in
Saturday's election rose 3 percent over the number he received four
years ago. The additional votes meant that Chen's support among the
middle-class increased, Luo said, adding that this indicates Chen's
administration was respected.</P>
      <P>That increased support was the most important factor for Chen's
camp in the race, Luo said.</P>
      <P>Chen, who lost to Ma by more than 78,000 votes, did not appear at
his campaign headquarters Sunday, but instead drove to Tainan,
southern Taiwan, to visit his father-in-law, who is ill.</P>
      <P>According to Chen's campaign base, he will begin a citywide tour
to thank his supporters Monday, and the tour will last three days.</P>
      <P>He is also scheduled to hold a party next Saturday evening to
thank those who voted for him, according to his headquarters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS SAY EXECUTION KILLS 'ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Human rights groups say the execution of a
man in mainland China on Sunday means the end of the concept of "one
country, two systems" in Hong Kong, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
(CBC) reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>The CBC was referring to the execution of Cheong Tze-keong, the
leader of a crime syndicate in Hong Kong, the former British
territory that has no death penalty.</P>
      <P>It quoted human rights activists as saying that Cheong should
have been tried where he committed most of his crimes -- Hong
Kong.</P>
      <P>Cheong and 35 of his gang members were convicted of arms
smuggling and of the kidnappings of two Hong Kong property tycoons.
Those kidnappings were never reported to Hong Kong police, according
to the CBC.</P>
      <P>Cheong and his gang were captured in the mainland Chinese city of
Guangzhou. The Hong Kong government did not seek extradition of
Cheong, saying it had no evidence of the kidnappings. Besides, Hong
Kong does not have an extradition agreement with mainland China.</P>
      <P>The CBC quoted lawyer and Legislator Martin Lee as saying that in
this case the Hong Kong government is sending out the wrong signal
and should have argued strenuously for Cheong's return.</P>
      <P>"The rule of law is the last ditch in our defense of human rights
in Hong Kong, and if that is the way the Hong Kong government plays
with the law, then I think we are in a very, very sorry state," Lee
was quoted as saying.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PARTY SUPERSTAR REGAINS GLORY FOR KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, the golden boy of the ruling
Kuomintang who announced his candidacy so late that prospects of
winning the Taipei mayoral race were considered shaky, upset the
city's incumbent mayor with an overwhelming victory in Saturday's
elections.</P>
      <P>Although other KMT members were considered running as the party's
candidate in the Taipei mayoral race, Ma, 48, had long been regarded
as the trump card in the ruling Kuomintang's (KMT) efforts to unseat
the formidable incumbent Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Ma defeated Chen, who has ruled
Taipei City since 1994, by more than 80,000 votes, a surprise to all
parties involved in the election.</P>
      <P>Ma did not announce his candidacy until late May on the grounds
that he saw no evidence of support from members higher up in the
party's hierarchy, which had him fearing there was "no goal to fight
for."</P>
      <P>After some serious soul searching, Ma announced his "sacred
mission" in May after hearing -- and heeding -- the "continuous calls
from ordinary citizens appealing to him to run."</P>
      <P>At an election victory press conference, Ma credited his victory
to all the citizens of Taipei and to President and KMT Chairman Lee
Teng-hui's latest speech on the "new Taiwanese."</P>
      <P>Ma said the concept of the "new Taiwanese" espoused by President
Lee during his last campaign rally won wide recognition from Taipei
citizens, leading to his final victory over the incumbent mayor.</P>
      <P>While one of his opponents challenged him over his ethnic
background, Ma said, President Lee's timely statement of the "new
Taiwanese" helped clear up confusion.</P>
      <P>Ma said although his parents are "mainlanders" who moved to
Taiwan after the Republic of China relocated its government seat to
Taipei in 1949, he considers himself a native Taiwanese after living
in Taipei for more than four decades.</P>
      <P>During the campaign, Chen, who is native Taiwanese, pointed out
Ma's mainland roots on several occasions.</P>
      <P>President Lee's concept of the "new Taiwanese," which refers to
all Chinese people who have settled in Taiwan -- however recently or
long ago -- is a doctrine full of tolerance and respect, Ma noted.</P>
      <P>He said the day of his election represents the beginning of a new
integration of ethnic groups in the city. "Ethnicity as an issue is
now history in Taipei," he stressed.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, Ma also credited those New Party
supporters who were willing to bury the hatchet on Ma's behalf.</P>
      <P>According to a post-election public opinion poll conducted by
The United Evening News, 77 percent of New Party supporters cast
their votes for Ma instead of New Party candidate Wang Chien-hsien,
who was running a distant third in the mayoral race.</P>
      <P>Only by voting for Ma could we voters recover Taipei from the
rule of the pro-independence DPP, New Party supporters said.</P>
      <P>Ma was particularly effusive in his appreciation of senior
Presidential adviser Wu Poh-hsiung. Ma said Wu has always been his
fan and supporter, even during Ma's time in the political wilderness
after leaving his post as justice minister. Ma's thanks to Wu
underlined previous speculation that Wu had been highly instrumental
in persuading Ma to enter the race.</P>
      <P>Ma shed tears when he was greeted by wheelchair-bound former
Premier Sun Yun-suan at his final campaign rally. Sun was stricken by
an apoplexy during his tenure as premier in 1984.</P>
      <P>Ma promised his voters that he will be a mayor who welcomes input
from all parties. All individuals of integrity and with ability may
be members of his staff, no matter what their political affiliation,
Ma noted.

    <HEADLINE>PARTY SUPERSTAR (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ma said he does not exclude the possibility of inviting his New
Party rival, Wang Chien-hsien, to serve as an adviser to his city
administration after he is sworn in on Dec. 25.</P>
      <P>Wang, formerly finance minister, is a man of integrity with
high-caliber expertise in finance, Ma said, adding that Wang could
lend expertise and experience to the new Taipei city government in
financial matters and in its efforts against corruption.</P>
      <P>Ma, a graduate of National Taiwan University, obtained an LLD
from Harvard University. He was the English translator and secretary
for late President Chiang Ching-kuo and became deputy bureau director
of the Presidential Office at the age of 31.</P>
      <P>Ma, who was fawned over in women's magazines for his charisma,
sense of humor and boyish good looks, was appointed to a
ministerial-level position at 38, making him the youngest Cabinet
member in the Republic of China. A charismatic official who regularly
jogs in the morning and maintains close relations with the public, Ma
has long been a superstar in Taiwan's political arena.</P>
      <P>Two years ago, at age 46, Ma was stripped of his post as Justice
Minister and was appointed minister-without-portfolio, possibly for
trying to go too far too fast in his campaign to fight crime.</P>
      <P>His war on crime and corruption had many skeptics, many of whom
thought Ma was a conscientious man who had been stuck with a
difficult -- or even impossible -- task.</P>
      <P>Ma, a soft-spoken man, said he considered quitting public service
once and for all after he was ordered to step down as justice
minister, a post in which he had been able to launch a nationwide war
against drugs and to step up law enforcement efforts to eradicate
violence and corruption.</P>
      <P>He told then Premier Lien Chan that he would give himself one
year to see how he could adjust to a situation that he considered
tantamount to "removing a player from the court." He overcame his
personal objections, accepting the minister-without-portfolio post
without letting any signs of discontent show for almost a year.</P>
      <P>But before a year had passed, however, Ma resigned as
minister-without-portfolio. The resignation was prompted by changing
political ethics and by a protest march by more than 50,000 people in
Taipei who were demanding an apology by President Lee Teng-hui and
the resignation of the premier for Taiwan's worsening social order.</P>
      <P>Although Ma had been widely considered the only challenger with
the potential to unseat Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian in the 1998
mayoral election, he had never been the "king's man," and had
received limited support from the power center in a potential
election.</P>
      <P>Ma's father, who retired many years ago from a senior KMT
position, once said that it would be a mistake for Ma to refuse to
run while still politically influential, but that it was a mistake
for the KMT to ask Ma to run after stripping him of all his political
resources.</P>
      <P>After resigning his minister-without-portfolio post, Ma did not
remain idle. He was a familiar face at more than 10 social
organizations, including the World Vision of Taiwan, the Garden of
Hope Foundation -- a prime mover behind Taiwan's anti-child
prostitution drive -- and several groups for the disabled.</P>
      <P>Ma also accepted a teaching post at National Chengchi University.
He never ceased in his academic research efforts, and he is
considered one of the most influential experts on the Tiaoyutais, a
chain of tiny islets in the East China Sea claimed by Taiwan,
mainland China and Japan, which have been a focus of on-and-off
diplomatic disputes over the last several decades.</P>
      <P>Not even Saturday night's election victory and a celebration that
lasted into the early hours of Sunday morning were enough to throw Ma
off track. Sunday morning he showed up at the park for his customary
morning jog, just like clockwork.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PEOPLE'S SELF-IDENTIFICATION INCREASING: US OBSERVER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A US scholar on Sunday said the victory of
Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT) in Saturday's "three-in-one"
elections would relax those from Beijing and Washington who were
worried that pro-Taiwan independence forces would dominate the
island.</P>
      <P>Andrew Nathan, a professor at Columbia University in New York,
made the remarks at a conference on post-election effects in Taipei.
Though the results of the election will dispel some worries, he
cautioned against dumping all the aspirins, as some headaches will
remain.</P>
      <P>Nathan reasoned that the current KMT is different from the one in
the past, saying the difference can be sensed from the "Taiwan First"
policy of Ma Ying-jeou, who beat a strong rival from the opposition
Progressive Democratic Party (DPP) in the Taipei mayoral election.</P>
      <P>The more democratic processes that the Taiwan people experience,
the greater their degree of identification with the island, Nathan
said, explaining that he believes the development will gradually lead
to a widening of distance between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Attention should be paid to this trend, he said.</P>
      <P>The election observer, meanwhile, noted that during this year's
elections, Taiwan voters enjoyed flexibility, meaning they did not
feel locked in to a single party or bloc of candidates.</P>
      <P>Nathan also foresees an atmosphere of "bi-party politics"
gradually shaping up in Taiwan, while the 15 independents elected to
the legislature must decide whether to ally themselves with the
pro-reunification KMT or the pro-independence DPP.</P>
      <P>As to the fact that Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the DPP lost
his re-election bid, the US political observer said that is not
necessarily a setback for the party, because Chen won a 46-percent
share of the votes in the election, up from a 43-percent share in
1994. In legislative elections, this time around the DPP won 31
percent of the vote, down only slightly from the 32 percent they won
in the last legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Nathan's opinion was echoed by Chu Yun-han, a political science
professor at National Taiwan University, who said in the conference
that the DPP has enjoyed an average support rate of 36 percent in the
capital over the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>Also noting that Chen received 46 percent of the vote in
Saturday's elections compared with 43 percent four years ago, Chu
said that fact indicates Chen fought a successful campaign battle.</P>
      <P>Overall the KMT's performance in the "three-in-one" elections was
mixed, Chu said. The ruling party won back some supporters of the New
Party, a splinter group of the KMT, but lost votes to independent
candidates, he said.</P>
      <P>The "three-in-one" elections comprised elections for the Taipei
and Kaohsiung mayorships, for city council seats in those two cities
and for the national legislature.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung's mayorship was taken by the DPP's Frank Hsieh, who
beat incumbent Mayor Wu Den-yih of the KMT by about 4,500 votes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CAUCUS WHIP URGES CHAIRMAN TO QUIT FOR DEFEAT IN ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP) caucus whip in the Legislative Yuan, Chou Po-lun, on
Sunday urged DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsung to resign to assume
responsibility for the party's loss in the Taipei mayoral election
and its loss of seats in the national legislature.</P>
      <P>Chou also called for incumbent Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, who
is still highly popular in the DPP, to run for the DPP's chairmanship
and to run for president in 2000.</P>
      <P>Chou made the statements at a press conference held at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The KMT won sweeping victories in Taipei mayoral and legislative
elections, while the DPP's share of seats in the legislature declined
to a record low of 29.55 percent. Chou described it as a devastating
defeat and urged Lin to set a good example by stepping down as
chairman.</P>
      <P>Despite the KMT's victory in the elections, there are plenty of
conflicts within the KMT, Chen should therefore lead a united DPP
against the KMT and on to the presidency, Chou added.</P>
      <P>The DPP said they would discuss the future of Chairman Lin next
week.</P>
      <P>But Chou said the matter was one of personal responsibility and
should not be settled by the party. He noted that two former DPP
chairmen, Shih Ming-teh and Hsu Shin-liang, resigned to accept
responsibility for election defeats.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong news media have prominently
reported and gave positive evaluations on the free elections held in
Taiwan Saturday.</P>
      <P>Voters in Taiwan went to the polls in the day for the election
of the mayor and city councilors of Taipei and Kaohsiung, as well as
the members of the Legislative Yuan. In the elections, the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) won an absolute majority in the Legislative Yuan,
the nation's parliament, retaining its control of the city councils
of the two biggest cities of Taiwan, and reclaimed Taipei, but lost
the mayorship of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The Oriental Daily News reported that the KMT took over 50
percent of the seats in the Legislative Yuan, and said editorially
that the elections have ushered "Chinese democracy" into a new era.
Hong Kong people are proud of Taiwan's success in promoting
democracy, since people on Taiwan are also Chinese, the editorial
said.</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou's election as the mayor of Taipei will be conducive
to the KMT's success in the presidential elections to be held in
March 2000, the newspaper said.</P>
      <P>The Ming Pao Daily News reported that the KMT won the Taipei
mayoral race and took more than half of the seats in the Legislative
Yuan. The newspaper also said in an editorial that Ma's victory in
the race will help cross-strait relations, and enhance the KMT's
political position.
 The Sing Tao Daily News said editorially that people in Hong Kong,
Macao, and mainland China are very concerned about the elections,
because the election results may have an impact on Taiwan's
presidential elections in the year 2000 and the development of
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong Standard, the South China Morning Post, the Apple
Daily, and three other newspapers of Hong Kong have also reported
the elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC VICE PRESIDENT LIEN CHAN MAKES TRANSIT STOP IN NEW YORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York, Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By K.C. Huang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Lien Chan
arrived in New York Saturday for a one-day transit stay before
heading for Nicaragua, to which he is bring humanitarian aid from the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Lien will visit Nicaragua and three other ROC allies in Central
America, all among those hardest hit by Hurricane Mitch a few weeks
ago.</P>
      <P>Just as in May when he stopped in New York en route to Costa Rica
for the inauguration ceremony of President Miguel Angel Rodriguez,
Lien kept a low profile regarding his Saturday New York transit to
avoid irritating Beijing, which has tried hard to isolate the
Republic of China in the international community.</P>
      <P>Under a tacit mutual understanding, Lien and his party engaged in
no public activities or press conferences during their two-night stay
in New York.</P>
      <P>Before arriving in New York, Lien and his entourage made a brief
stop in Seattle on the United States' West coast. During the stay, he
kept abreast of the latest election developments in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said he was thrilled to learn that Kuomintang candidate Ma
Ying-jeou defeated incumbent Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian with an
overwhelming victory, while he felt sorry that Kaohsiung Mayor Wu
Den-yih, also a KMT member, was upset in his re-election bid by
Democratic Progressive Party challenger Frank Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Lien is scheduled to fly to Nicaragua on a chartered flight
Monday morning on behalf of President Lee Teng-hui to express the
concern of the ROC government and its people for Nicaragua, Honduras,
El Salvador and Guatemala.</P>
      <P>Lien said the ROC government plans to assist the four countries
in building schools and hospitals, and in repairing damaged bridges
and highways.</P>
      <P>The ROC government has offered a total of US$2.6 million in
relief aid to the four Central American counties after they were
ravaged by the hurricane. Moreover, several Taiwan charity
organizations have also launched fund-raising campaigns to collect
aid.</P>
      <P>Lien was accompanied on his trip by a group of senior ROC
officials, including Foreign Minister Jason Hu, Department of Health
Director-General Chan Chi-shean, and Su Chi, deputy secretary-general
to President Lee.</P>
      <P>Also among his entourage were World Vision of Taiwan President
Shao Ching-ming; Chen Chang-wen, vice president of the ROC Red Cross

    <HEADLINE>SATURDAY'S ELECTIONS MAY IMPROVE TAIWAN'S IMAGE: BELLOCHI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  5  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Saturday's elections may help improve
Taiwan's image as a democratic country, Nataleh H. Bellochi, former
board chairman and managing director of the American Institute in
Taiwan, said here Saturday.</P>
      <P>Voters on Taiwan went to the polls Saturday to elect the mayor
and city councilors of Taipei and Kaohsiung, as well as the members
of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Bellochi said that Taiwan's democratic image is in sharp contrast
to the situation in mainland China, and that Beijing must quicken its
path of reform, otherwise the gap between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait will become even wider.</P>
      <P>When American people talk about Taiwan, they think of its
vibrant democracy nowadays, he said, adding that when they talked
about it 10 years ago, they thought of the goods "made in Taiwan".</P>
      <P>He pointed out that voter turnout in Saturday's elections
exceeded 80 percent, indicating democracy is flourishing in
Taiwan. This is a good development, and a good condition for
improvement of relations between the United States and Taiwan, he
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAMPAIGN LITERATURE HELPED HSIEH UNSEAT WU: ANALYSTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   6  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The narrow victory enjoyed by the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party's Kaohsiung mayoral
candidate, Frank Hsieh, over incumbent mayor Wu Den-yih of the
Kuomintang can be attributed largely to Hsieh's election literature,
which stressed the need for a change in leadership, analysts said on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>A member of Wu's camp said before Saturday that if Wu were
defeated, it would largely be the result of an eight-year incumbency
that has caused people in Kaohsiung to lose curiosity in him.</P>
      <P>Voters took to heart Hsieh's propaganda, and Wu was defeated by
himself rather than by Hsieh, analysis added.</P>
      <P>Wu's propaganda -- most notably a videotape voluntarily shot by
actress Pai Ping-ping in which she denounces Hsieh for acting as a
defense attorney for one of her daughter's killers, Chen Chin-hsing
-- also played a critical role in unseating Wu.</P>
      <P>Pai in the tape describes Hsieh as an accomplice of Chen.</P>
      <P>The kidnapping and murder of Pai's daughter, as well as the
pursuit of the killers, was one of the most significant events in
Taiwan last year.</P>
      <P>This videotape, originally conceived as Wu's trump card in his
propaganda war against Hsieh, ended up costing Wu votes.</P>
      <P>Even more damaging to Wu was a tape that purportedly contained a
conversation between Wu and a paramour. Even though analysis of the
tape indicated it may have been edited, the tape cost Wu 2 percent of
his supporters, according to a pre-election poll. The damage was
greatest among women voters.</P>
      <P>"Since the campaign became a war of words, there were no
so-called campaign strategies. All the municipal policies put forward
were waiting to be shown, but it was too late," said Chen Cho-ming,
Wu's campaign manager.</P>
      <P>According to Saturday's vote count, Wu beat Hsieh in only four of
the city's 11 districts. Four years ago Wu swept all Kaohsiung's
districts.</P>
      <P>Putting the wrong people in the wrong positions in Wu's election
camp also cost him, said one member of Wu's staff.</P>
      <P>Many chiefs and important staff members in Kaohsiung's city
government who campaigned for Wu knew nothing about communications,
despite their competence on the job. As a result, many proved
unpopular. Even worse, many bureaucrats enjoyed making tempests in
teacups and exploiting civil servants in the city' government.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who moved to Kaohsiung only two years ago and was not
highly popular among city residents, recruited former KMT members to
run his campaign. The former KMT members knew how the party
campaigned and helped Hsieh take over the reins of the southern port
city by a narrow margin of 0.58 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RESULTS OF TAIWAN ELECTIONS SEEN AS POSITIVE FOR CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of Taiwan's "three-in-one"
elections on Saturday are a setback for pro-independence political
powers on the island, a development that is conducive to stabilizing
cross-Taiwan Strait relations, sources from Beijing's academic sector
said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Professor Yu Keli of the Institute of Taiwan studies under the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said the election results will
help stabilize cross-strait relations as the Kuomintang's ruling
power is seen to be consolidated. A strengthened KMT will help ensure
there is "less chance for the unexpected to occur," Yu said.</P>
      <P>Yu said he is not sure whether the ruling KMT will actively
improve cross-strait ties after the elections. Nevertheless the
results will "not have an adverse impact" on the current state of
relations across the Taiwan Strait, he said.</P>
      <P>Professor Xu Bodong of Beijing University's Taiwan Research
Office, whose research focuses on Taiwan's opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), said incumbent Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian's
defeat represents the squelching of the DPP's ruling ambitions, which
"makes me happy." Xu said Chen is firm on Taiwan independence and is
opposed to the establishment of the so-called three links across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Other DPP spin-off parties, including the Democratic Alliance,
and the New National Alliance, were also badly defeated in the
elections for city council seats in Taipei and Kaohsiung and for
national legislators, Xu noted.</P>
      <P>Xu said the DPP's narrow-mindedness, both internationally and in
cross-strait relations, resulted in the opposition party's loss in
the elections.</P>
      <P>Professor Huang Jiashu of the Chinese People's University of
Public Security said the DPP's loss deals a death-blow to the party's
presidential aspiration in the 2000 elections. By comparison, Huang
said, Beijing is more friendly toward the KMT, which at least has
been willing to talk about cross-strait relations, while the DPP has
always referred the cross-strait relations as "the relations between
two countries."</P>
      <P>Huang accused Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian of trying to play the
ethnic card in the race and said some of Chen's slogans -- such as
one indicating two mainlanders were ganging up on Chen in the race
and one saying the other two major parties in the election intended
to sell out Taiwan -- were unjustifiable lies.</P>
      <P>The parents of both Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT, who successfully
wrested control of the city from Chen, and Wang Chien-shien, the
Taipei mayoral candidate fielded by the New Party, were born in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Professor Fan Xizhou of Xiamen University said Chen's defeat is a
great defeat for the DPP, as Chen represents the pinnacle of the DPP
and Taipei the pinnacle of the island's voting constituencies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S VOTERS APPROVE OF KMT'S STEADY POLICIES: NEW YORK TIMES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By David Wang and Angel Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prominent newspapers in New York credited
the performance of Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) in Dec. 5 elections,
saying that voters in Taiwan have approved of the KMT's firm and
steady policies to lead the island into the 21st century.</P>
      <P>The New York Times pointed out that the victory of KMT Taipei
mayoral candidate Ma Ying-jeou has frustrated the political future of
Chen Shui-bian, the incumbent Taipei mayor and Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP) prospective candidate in March 2000 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>The Times noted that if Chen, the DPP's powerful prospective
candidate and one who has always propagated Taiwan independence,
becomes president, cross-strait ties would become strained.</P>
      <P>Many supporters of the pro-unification New Party abandoned the
party's candidate in the race for Taipei mayor, Wang Chien-shien, and
instead cast their votes for Ma, the Times noted. The KMT's election
wins will help the party overcome the crisis of confidence it
encountered in the last Taipei mayoral election. The paper also noted
with amazement how deeply rooted is Taiwan's democratization, which
is only 10 years old.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, New York's Newsday carried on Sunday a story titled
"Taiwan is not ready for independence," in which it noted that Chen
was expected to win a second term and run in the 2000 presidential
election after President Lee Teng-hui's term ends.</P>
      <P>New York's Newsday noted that the KMT has added to its
majority in the Legislative Yuan in addition to unseating Taipei's
mayor. This has shown that Taiwan's voters support the KMT's
"big-stick and suspicious engagement policy" toward mainland China.
In the meantime, the outcome of the election may calm Beijing or even
Washington and Tokyo, according to the paper.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-language "World Journal" published a commentary
titled "New Taiwanese are molding the next presidential hopeful."
In it the paper argued that Chen would still be the DPP's candidate
in the 2000 presidential election, despite his failed re-election
bid.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, incumbent Vice President Lien Chan is a prospective
candidate for KMT. The commentary claimed Lien and Chen will battle
each other over "ethnicity," "image" and cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based "Ming Pao Daily News" thinks that the KMT's
win in the three-in-one election means that the majority of Taiwan's
voters support its policies. As for the loss by the KMT's candidate
in Kaohsiung's mayoral election -- incumbent Mayor Wu Den-yih -- the
paper noted that he was hurt by a tape that purportedly contained a
conversation between Wu and a woman with whom he was allegedly having
an affair.</P>
      <P>Wu was also hurt by his circulating a video made by television
actress Pai Ping-ping in which she called the DPP's candidate in the
city's mayoral race -- Frank Hsieh -- an accomplice in the murder of
her daughter.</P>
      <P>Hsieh acted as a defense attorney for one of the alleged killers,
Chen Chin-shin.</P>
      <P>Voters faulted Wu for circulating the tape in an attempt to sully
Hsieh's character.</P>
      <P>His failure to keep promises made when elected to a second term
in 1994 and a lack of support by three of the city's more prominent
families -- the Chen family, the Wang family and the Chu family --
hurt him as well, according to the paper.</P>
      <P>According to the paper, the victory in the Taipei mayoral race by
Ma was due to, as Ma asserted, the widespread acceptance of Republic
of China President Lee Teng-hui's ideas on the "new Taiwanese."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CITIZENS OF TAIPEI VOTE FOR STABILITY: NEWSWEEK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun and Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results in the election for Taipei's
mayor indicates that city residents prefer a stable living
environment to exposing themselves to the danger of attack by
mainland China, according to US-based Newsweek magazine.</P>
      <P>In its newest issue, the magazine reported that the victory by Ma
Ying-jeou of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) over incumbent Mayor and
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) member Chen Shui-bian
is a barometer of public opinion.</P>
      <P>The magazine said voters' rejection of Chen, whose
pro-independence position tends to irritate mainland authorities, in
favor of Ma means they are inclined to maintain the status quo and
desire peaceful relations with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Ma's victory may encouarge the belief by the mainland that Taipei
is not practicing democracy at the expense of its own security,
Newsweek added.</P>
      <P>The magazine also offered an overview of the DPP, from its days
as an underground opposition party that fought against the KMT in the
70s to its evolution into a legitimate party that won over many
supporters in the 80s, to its zenith -- Chen's election as Taipei
mayor in 1994.</P>
      <P>Although Chen has during his term tried to tone down the party's
independence overtures-- such as the holding of an islandwide
referendum to decide Taiwan's future-- and tried to obscure his
pro-dndependence leanings while serving as a mayor, it has not been
enough, according to the magazine. His failed re-election bid may
prompt the party to keep silent on the issue of independence in the
next presidental election in 2000.</P>
      <P>As for Ma, whose parents are from mainland China and is therefore
regarded as "mainlander" as well, Newsweek attributed his victory to
the endorsement he received from President Lee Teng-hui and to the
willingness of Taiwan's people to include non-native Taiwanese in the
establishment of the island's identity.</P>
      <P>The election results may also relieve slightly the Beijing
authorities, but the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are still far
from making peace.</P>
      <P>And despite Ma's mainland roots, he is not expected to be any
less wary of the mainland than are native Taiwanese, the magazine
noted.</P>
      <P>"What the people in Taiwan really want is peace and stability,"
Ma was quoted as saying. He is proved right by his victory, which
also shows Beijing that democracy does not necessarily mean chaos,
Newsweek said.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Vice President Lien Chan
successfully ridded himself of reporters and enjoyed a day of
rest in New York on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lien is leading an ROC delegation via New York to Nicaragua,
Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, four ROC allies in Central

and his delegation were slated to leave New York for Nicaragua on
Monday morning to convey the ROC's concern over the devastation and
to offer assistance.</P>
      <P>Lien left his hotel early Sunday morning, before reporters for
New York-based Chinese-language media showed up. Lien left the hotel
accompanied by Charles Teng, director of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in New York. That evening he appeared at a banquet
that Teng had arranged to welcome Lien's group.</P>
      <P>Members of the ROC mission, as well as officials in the ROC's New

Sunday morning were greeted by a casually attired Foreign Minister

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian dollar is on a downward
trend again and moving toward 60 US cents because of a slump and
weakening commodity prices in the world market, experts said.</P>
      <P>Australia is one of the world's major producers and exporters of
commodities.</P>
      <P>They said the fortune of the Australian currency started waning
last week as the threat of a blowout in the current account deficit
emerged once again and official interest rates fell by 02.5
percentage points.</P>
      <P>The Australian dollar fell considerably last week and closed at
61.75 US cents on Friday, and it was trading at 61.65 US cents on
Monday morning.</P>
      <P>The Australian dollar plunged to a record low of about 55 US
cents in August this year.</P>
      <P>Analysts predicted the outlook for commodities remains now bleak
with the global economy expected to slow significantly in 1999.</P>
      <P>"We think the Australian dollar has some further weakness in the
new term. The major factor is the weakness in commodity prices. The
second factor is the likelihood of further (Japanese) yen weakness or
US dollar strength," said Saul Eslake, chief economist at ANZ

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said on Monday that
Taiwan voters demonstrated their political maturity and sense in the
just-concluded "three-in-one" elections, which marked another step
forward in the Republic of China's democratic development.</P>
      <P>Lee said that although the campaign process was at sixes and
sevens -- fraught with noise and hullabaloo -- it also indicated the
Taiwan people's enthusiastic participation in democratic politics.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks when he met with Don Sundquist, governor of
the US state of Tennessee, who is currently visiting Taipei.</P>
      <P>The president praised candidates in the election for removing so
quickly the campaign banners, flags and signs that have engulfed the
city's buildings, streets and sidewalks in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>Candidates were required to pay to the election commission a
clean-up deposit to be refunded after their campaign material has
been removed.</P>
      <P>The quick removal of the banners has returned the city to its
normal state, and it indicates that the city and people of Taipei are
socially well developed, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Lee expressed a hearty welcome to Sundquist
and called for closer bilateral investment and trade exchanges
between Taiwan and Tennessee.</P>
      <P>Sundquist said he was impressed with the high voter turnout in
the Dec. 5 elections, which he said is living proof of Taiwan's
success in democratic reform, an achievement worth emulation by other
fledgling or aspiring democracies.</P>
      <P>Tennessee and Taiwan province have maintained close and cordial
relations since the two knotted sisterhood ties, Sundquist said. Both
are blessed with low tax rates, hard-working people, entrepreneurial
spirit, free markets and free societies, and the two should further

      <P>The ruling Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) of

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE FIRMS FORCED TO BORROW AT HIGHER COSTS AFTER US BOND RETREAT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's large businesses now face
higher costs when they turn to borrow from domestic banks thanks to a
shrinking US corporate bond market and the withdrawal of a handful of
foreign banks via the Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>The Australian Financial Review on Monday reported overseas
markets and foreign lenders in early 1990s have forced Australian
banks to cut margins on corporate loans to such an extent that they
were yielding negative returns.</P>
      <P>But these banks are now back in the driver's seat, forcing even
their biggest customers, including Broken Hill Proprietary Pty (BHP)
and North Ltd., to accept significantly higher borrowing costs, the
daily reported.</P>
      <P>Analysts attributed the higher borrowing costs to the loss of the
US corporate bond market, which has provided more than US$15 billion
in capital in 1992 on easier terms than Australian banks.</P>
      <P>But since July this year, the US markets, panicked by global
uncertainty, have effectively cut themselves off from all but the
most highly rated foreign bond issuers and forced most Australian
corporations to revive their relationships with domestic banks.</P>
      <P>The daily reported competition in the Australian banking industry
has also been reduced by the departure of half a dozen Japanese
banks. France's Credit Lyonnais is also on the way out with the
assets of several still in search of a buyer and at a deep discount
to their face value.</P>
      <P>Major foreign banks, including UBS, Bank America and Deutsche,
were burned by the twin disasters of the collapse of the Russian bond
market and the troubles encountered by Long-Term Capital Management,
adding to the scrutiny on the profitability of new loans, the daily
reported.</P>
      <P>Only two years ago, BHP paid a spread of between just 17.5 and
22.5 basis points over a five-year term for a loan of US$2 billion.
But now the biggest firm in Australia is willing to pay 50 basis
points over the bank-bill swap rate. But the local banks want 65
basis points, the daily reported.</P>

      <P>Making Taipei a place where women and
children will no longer be afraid is the first task to which
Mayor-elect Ma Ying-jeou will commit himself after his swearing-in
ceremony Dec. 25.</P>
      <P>Other campaign promises on which Ma is expected to deliver
include the reimbursement of up to NT$400 million (US$12.35 million)
in fees collected from motorists whose cars were towed over the past
year. People whose cars were towed were fined up to NT$2,000. Ma has
vowed to provide reimbursements of up to NT$1,500 per ticket for what
he has called excessive handling fees.</P>
      <P>Ma has also vowed that up to 300 licensed prostitutes whose
licenses were to be revoked will be granted a two-year grace period
in which to look for new work. At the end of the two years, however,
the government will nullify all licenses in the trade.</P>
      <P>He has promised that city residents who use the mass rapid
transport (MRT) system will be given free bus rides and that bus
fares will not be raised for at least eight years. Ma said he intends
to raise the number of city residents who use public buses or the MRT
from the current 23 percent to 50 percent.</P>
      <P>In urban development, Ma has said he will focus development
efforts on the city's dilapidated western district -- home to many of
the city's older communities -- rather than the eastern part of the
city.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ma promised that by the end of 2000, the Taipei city
government will be fully computerized, enabling city residents to
obtain official copies of census reports, birth and death
certificates and other documents via personal computers at home.</P>
      <P>Ma's city government will also establish an economic development

deputy mayor. He also made it clear that he is willing to retain
municipal bureau chiefs who have a high moral standard and performed
well over the past four years.</P>

Taipei citizens voted for him because they have high expectations in
his leadership.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  7  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's victory in
elections over the weekend offered a measure of satisfaction to
Beijing and marked a setback for the pro-independence movement,
Australian media reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>While opposition Democratic Progressive Party incumbent Taipei
Mayor Chen Shui-bian lost to Kuomintang candidate Ma Ying-jeou and
the KMT won 123 seats in the 225-seat legislature, incumbent KMT
Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yih lost to DPP Frank Hsieh after serving
nearly two terms.</P>
      <P>In an article headlined "Taiwan poll result a winner with
Beijing," The Australian said the KMT's victory is expected to please
the mainland leadership who feared a Chen victory would have boosted
the pro-independence advocate's presidential aspirations in 2000.</P>
      <P>Last week, Beijing issued a veiled warning to the DPP that
official separation from mainland China was impossible. On Sunday,
Beijing remained silent after the KMT won the elections in Taipei and
the majority of legislative seats.</P>
      <P>In an article titled "Taiwan keeps its distance from Beijing in
polls," the Australian Financial Review reported the KMT's victory in
two of the three elections at the weekend provided a measure of
satisfaction for Beijing, which regards the KMT as the party it can
best deal with efforts to reunify Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, the daily reported that the voting for the mayors of the
major two cities -- Taipei and Kaohsiung -- and for the Legislative
Yuan, saw Taiwan slip even further from the mainland's grasp.</P>
      <P>The Review said the smooth conduct of the weekend elections, 70
percent voter turnout and Taipei Mayor-elect Ma Ying-jeou's comment
last week that there was no need for an already independent country
to declare independence, indicated that unification is not
necessarily a foregone conclusion.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Lin
Yi-hsiung is not expected to resign despite the party's defeat in
Saturday's election as several DPP heavyweights said Lin's
resignation may spark a power struggle.</P>
      <P>You Hsi-kun, president of the Taipei Mass Transit Corporation, is
said to have visited Lin on Monday morning on behalf of outgoing
Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, asking Lin not to quit.</P>
      <P>Former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh said Lin should remain chairman
to maintain the power base within the party. "Resigning now is not
necessarily a gesture of responsibility," he noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin said he has convinced DPP Secretary-General Chiu
Yi-jen, to stay at his post. Other issues related to the election
losses will be discussed at the regular meetings of the party's
policy-making body, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Both Lin and Chiu offered to resign to assume responsibility for
the poorer than expected showing of the major opposition party in
Saturday's "three-in-one" elections.</P>
      <P>Incumbent DPP Mayor Chen was defeated by Ma Ying-jeou of the
ruling Kuomintang, while the number of DPP seats in the Legislative
Yuan dropped to 70, or 29.6 percent of the 225-seat legislature. The
KMT grabbed 123 seats, or 46.4 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>Sisy Chen, former head of the DPP's Propaganda Department, said
the DPP's "party contra party" campaign strategy dealt a fatal blow
to the DPP in Taipei's mayoral election.</P>
      <P>Four years ago, the DPP and the New Party together fought against
the KMT, but this time the KMT and the New Party joined forces in
battling the DPP, she pointed out.</P>
      <P>The DPP's major problem is the large number of figurehead party
members and the lack of enthusiasm among party members for party
activities, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>However, some DPP deputies at the National Assembly argued that
the ethnic issue played a critical role in Chen's defeat in the
Taipei mayoral race and they said Lin should step down as chairman
over the DPP's election losses.</P>
      <P>They said the "New Taiwanese" concept raised by President and KMT
Chairman Lee Teng-hui successfully attracted support from native
Taiwanese for Ma, while Chen's emphasis on ethnic differences and
independence sentiment in his campaign scared away many potential
supporters.</P>
      <P>Under such a backdrop, the DPP should adjust its policy to win
mainlanders' identification, DPP National Assembly Deputy Chiu

      <P>Year-end bonuses for military personnel,

and a half level, the Central Personnel Administration (CPA) said on
Monday.</P>
      <P>Officials of the CPA, the Ministry of Finance, the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, met to discuss a
proposal over government workers' year-end bonuses.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the nation's year-end bonuses for
military personnel, civil servants and teachers has always been fixed
at one and a half months and has always been offered equally in the
past, the head of the CPA suggested that year-end bonuses be offered
on a flexible basis.</P>
      <P>Wei Chi-lin, director general of the CPA, suggested that all
government organizations' budgets for year-end bonuses remain at the
one and a half month level while the Cabinet should authorize heads
of all government organizations to offer year-end bonuses according
to their staff's performance.</P>
      <P>According to the planned new regulations, from the end of 1999,
the highest year-end bonus level a government staff member can get
will be three months, the lowest will be one month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WAGES INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE IN ASIAN ECONOMIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Real wages in some Asian countries are
becoming even more competitive against the four "tiger" economies as
rising inflation compounds the effect of currency depreciation, the
results of a recent survey indicated.</P>
      <P>The Corporate Resources Group (CRG) found that wages in the four
tiger economies -- measured in US dollars per hour -- far outstripped
those in other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Wages in Hong Kong were the highest in Asia for workers,
professionals and managers, while South Korea came in second and
Taiwan third. Singapore wages were the fourth highest in the survey,
which did not take into account recent cost-cutting measures.</P>
      <P>Mainland China lagged far behind in fifth place with its wages
for office workers at roughly half those of Singapore's.</P>
      <P>Elaine Ng, CRG's regional director for North Asia, attributed the
high wages in Hong Kong to "past rising wages and the non-devaluation
of the Hong Kong dollar."</P>
      <P>"Hong Kong and China stand out as very expensive, compared to
other Asian countries," she said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Singapore wages were also higher as their currencies
have depreciated by 15 percent against the US dollars. The South
Korean won, however, fell 30 percent since the start of 1997.</P>
      <P>The survey found that apart from currency depreciation, wages in
other Asian economies were being eroded as rising inflation
undermined the purchasing power of workers.</P>
      <P>In Indonesia, for example, average salaries rose 17.4 percent
last year, but these were eroded by hyper-inflation of 85 percent.</P>
      <P>In Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea, inflation also outstripped
pay increases. Therefore despite nominal wage rises, real wages fell
between 1 percent and 7 percent, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>CRG is a human resources consultancy specializing in compensation
management. It polled 1,200 companies in this latest survey on
compensation trends in Asia.</P>
      <P>It found that real wage increases -- nominal wage rises less
inflation -- are expected to fall in 1999 in all 11 economies
surveyed.</P>
      <P>Even in mainland China -- where real wages are rising the fastest
-- higher inflation will mean a slower rise in real pay next year at
5.6 percent compared to 10.9 percent in 1998. Real wages are expected
to grow 3 percent in Hong Kong and fall nearly 5 percent in Malaysia,
Thailand and Indonesia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POOR SHOWING IN ELECTION REINFORCES HSU'S CALL FOR PARTY TRANSITION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The worse-than-expected performance of
Taiwan's main opposition party in Saturday's elections have
reinforced the calls of the Democratic Progressive Party's former
chairman for transition within the party.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hsin-liang, who stepped down in August from the post due to
growing criticism, predicted prior to Saturday's elections that
public support would drop to about 30 percent if the DPP were to
continue its ideological struggle against the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>The DPP's support declined from 43.32 percent in the 1997
elections for county heads to 29.56 percent in the weekend's
elections for legislators.</P>
      <P>Hsu said on Monday in an interview that his calls to move away
from the party's internecine ideological battle with the KMT were
mostly ignored by party candidates.</P>
      <P>He said he regretted that the DPP has been downgraded from a
legitimate power on the verge of taking over ruling-party status to a
mere opposition after Saturday's polls.</P>
      <P>The legislative elections were a litmus test of the party's path,
the former DPP chairman said, and it indicates he is correct in his
efforts to transform the party.</P>
      <P>Hsu has made no secret of the fact that he would like to run on
the party ticket for president in 2000 despite calls to groom the
party's star Chen Shui-bian -- who lost in his reelection bid for
Taipei mayor -- as the DPP's candidate for president. As it stands,
Hsu said he would wait and see before he makes any formal decision.</P>
      <P>In a separate interview on Monday, Hsu said Premier Vincent Siew
and his Cabinet should resign en masse to set a constitutional
precedent of accountability.</P>
      <P>Prior to an amendment to the Constitution last year, the
legislature was required to approve of the Cabinet's leader. However,
owing to the comfortable majority the KMT now enjoys in the
legislature, Siew announced on Sunday that he would not resign as a
legislative confirmation is no longer necessary.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT controls 123 seats in the 225-seat legislature
and is therefore able to approve of any party-selected premier, the
resignation of the Cabinet is necessary to establish a practice in
which the legislature is duly respected by the executive branch, Hsu
said.</P>
      <P>This is especially true when the legislature was first elected
under the revised Constitution, said Hsu who led the DPP in working
out the principles of Constitutional reform at the National
Development Conference in 1996.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the aim to get rid of the legislature's confirmation
right is to prevent lawmakers from blackmailing the administration by
using the right as a bargaining chip rather than to give the head of
state the privilege of ignoring the legislature's political makeup.</P>
      <P>To support his argument, Hsu said the French Constitution, on
which he said the ROC Constitutional amendments were modeled after,
also requires a vote of confidence by the parliament on the Cabinet
despite of the fact that French president has the sole power to name
a premier without the parliament's approval.</P>

of which are the lowest rates ever.</P>
      <P>He said the move was in step with the European Union members who
cut their key rates to 3 percent on Thursday which will hopefully

    <TEXT>
      <P>A ranking economics official on Monday
expressed optimism that Taiwan's economic growth, which has been
projected at 5.1 percent for 1998, will increase next year.</P>
      <P>Schive Chi, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD), stated that Taiwan's economic growth in 1999
is expected to surge based on global economic growth.</P>
      <P>The CEPD has predicted that Taiwan will sustain a 5.1 percent
growth in 1998, down from 6.8 percent in the previous year due to
lower exports and government investments, Schive reported in an
Executive Yuan meeting.</P>
      <P>He cited CEPD statistics as saying that Taiwan's foreign trade
suffered declines from January to October. Based on such activity,
the CEPD has formulated a series of plans aimed at expanding domestic
demand to pump up the island's energy for economic activities.</P>
      <P>With regard to Taiwan's future economic development, Schive said
global exports are expected to gradually increase next year, with the
exception of exports to Hong Kong and mainland China which will
continue to be affected by the Asian financial meltdown.</P>

mainland China and Taiwan, the Globe and Mail said on Monday.</P>
      <P>In the past few weeks as Taiwan politicians prepared campaigns in
the run-up to elections, Beijing authorities rounded up dissidents
who were trying to form a political party in a crackdown that
emphasized its one-party dictatorship, the paper reported.</P>
      <P>While the ruling Kuomintang's victory in elections is good news
for Beijing, as the party advocates in theory eventual unification of
the two sides, the ideological differences will be difficult to
bridge as Taiwan matures as a democracy, according to the Globe.</P>
      <P>Analysts were cited as saying that Beijing's goal of peacefully
absorbing Taiwan may be more likely today after Taiwan voters handed
the KMT a larger majority in the legislature and elected one of its
stars the mayor of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou's defeat of incumbent Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian of
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party is seen as proof that the
KMT has reinvigorated themselves with a new generation of leadership,
the paper said.</P>
      <P>While Beijing may be pleased with the overall election results,
it may run into trouble in its current dialogue on reunification with
the KMT government, analysts said.</P>
      <P>In his victory speech, Ma signalled a go-slow approach on the
unification issue. If that theme is picked up by other KMT leaders,
China may face years of frustrating talks with Taiwan, the Globe
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ITC VOTES TO CONTINUE TAIWAN DRAM DUMPING CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US International Trade Commission
(ITC) on Monday ruled to continue an investigation into dumping
charges of Taiwan-made dynamic random access memory semiconductors
(DRAMs).</P>
      <P>The ITC voted 5-0 in favor of going past the preliminary phase of
a dumping investigation. The case involves DRAMs of one megabit and
above from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a news release, the commission said it found reasonable
indication that the US semiconductor industry was materially injured
by Taiwan DRAMs which were allegedly sold in the United States at
below reasonable market prices.</P>
      <P>The US Department of Commerce will continue its investigations
with a preliminary determination due on or near March 31, 1999.</P>
      <P>The ITC instituted the investigation on Oct. 22, 1998 in response
to a petition by Micron Technology, Inc., Boise, Idaho, the top DRAMs
producer in the United States.</P>
      <P>According to the ITC, US imports of DRAMs of one megabit and
above from Taiwan in the January-September period of 1998 amounted to
US$290 million. Taiwan is the third largest supplier of DRAMs in the
United States, behind only South Korea and Japan.</P>

      <P>Chen, who was defeated by Ma Ying-jeou of the ruling Kuomintang

      <P>Lin is a man of high moral standard and talent, Chen said, and is
the right person for the post. He added that he fully supports Lin
retaining the chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Chen also said he hoped DPP supporters would not lose confidence

    <HEADLINE>ROC DONATES US$10 M. TO NICARAGUA FOR POST-MITCH RECONSTRUCTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Managua,  Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By C. P. Huang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China on Monday pledged to
donate US$10 million to Nicaragua to help with the reconstruction of
infrastructure damaged by Hurricane Mitch recently.</P>
      <P>ROC Vice President Lien Chan, who flew into the Nicaraguan
capital city on Monday, presented a US$2.5 million check to President
Arnoldo Aleman to accelerate the post-disaster reconstruction. The
US$2.5 million is the first installment of a US$10 million donation
the ROC government promised to Nicaragua over a one-year period.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ROC's International Cooperation and Development
Fund had earlier promised to grant a low-interest, 20-year loan of
US$6 million to Nicaragua to expedite the reconstruction.</P>
      <P>The ROC donation and loan are so far the largest cash aid
Nicaragua has received from around the world since Hurricane Mitch
left 4,000 people dead and 100,000 homeless.</P>
      <P>ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu and his Nicaraguan counterpart
Eduardo Montealegre both signed a memorandum on ROC aid in a ceremony
held at the Nicaraguan Presidential Office. President Aleman and Vice
President Lien witnessed the ceremony.</P>
      <P>During the ceremony, Aleman expressed Nicaragua's gratitude to
the ROC government and people, saying that Taiwan's assistance has
helped Nicaraguans feel that they were not alone. He said the cash
aid will be efficiently used to restore drinking water sources and
electricity systems, and rebuild roads, houses as well as other
infrastructure development.</P>
      <P>Upon his arrival in Managua, Lien presented 24 metric tons of
medicine to the Nicaraguan government as a token of goodwill from the
ROC government and people.</P>
      <P>Lien was met at the airport by Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique
Bolanos Geyer and other ranking officials.</P>
      <P>Lien told his Nicaraguan friends that in addition to US$6 million
that Taiwan has pledged to dispatch to Nicaragua in loans, Taiwan
will donate an additional US$10 million to Nicaragua to help the
Central American country.</P>
      <P>Besides that, Lien noted, the ROC Foreign Ministry has also
launched a separate campaign dubbed "Sending Love to Central America"
to raise funds for hurricane victims, and has opened special accounts
with the International Commercial Bank of China and the post office,
to which members of the public can remit donations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Chang-wen, vice president of the ROC Red Cross
Society, also donated US$30,000 to Nicaragua on behalf of the
philanthropic organization.</P>

(By Chang Hui-yen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's State Council on Tuesday
said in a statement that Beijing "fully respected" Taiwan's political
activities over the past years but has consistently opposed splitism
within the island.</P>
      <P>While Beijing closely watched Saturday's "three-in-one" elections
in Taiwan, the Taipei mayoral race was of particular interest.
Mainland authorities believe the race is related to Taiwan's
presidential elections in 2000.</P>
      <P>The State Council said it welcomes learned Taiwan individuals who
have great perspective to promote peaceful unification of China.</P>
      <P>It also said that Beijing is against anyone who advocates
separatism in Taiwan in the name of democracy.</P>
      <P>On reports that newly-elected Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou has
turned down an invitation to visit Beijing as a "renowned figure"
from Taiwan, State Council officials said they learned about the
reports but declined to comment on it. Ma was quoted by the reports
as saying that he would like to visit Beijing only in his capacity as
the mayor of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Despite their close scrutiny, mainland Chinese authorities
intentionally treated the Taiwan elections in a low profile manner,
and there was no significant coverage of the elections in media in

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While the United States praised Taiwan for
its anti-drug smuggling efforts, the island continues to be listed as
a major narcotics producer or transshipment hub, Vice Justice
Minister Chiang Hao said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In an open letter to US Congress, US President Bill Clinton
praised Taiwan's efforts in stamping out drug trafficking, Chiang
said.</P>
      <P>Clinton took both Iran and Malaysia off the list of major drug
producing or transshipment countries while Taiwan, Thailand and
Vietnam were kept on the list.</P>
      <P>A prime reason why Taiwan remains on the list is the strategic
location of the southern Kaohsiung Port, Ministry of Justice
(MOJ) officials said. The huge quantities of containers loaded and
unloaded at the dock far exceeds the handling ability of the port to
check every container, they noted.</P>
      <P>The MOJ is determined to strengthen its efforts to eradicate drug
trafficking by boosting information exchanges and cooperation with
its foreign counterparts, Chiang noted.</P>
      <P>Over the past six months, Taiwan's law enforcement authorities
seized over 55 kilograms of heroin, 322 kilograms of amphetamines,
and about two kilograms of marijuana, statistics compiled by the MOJ
showed. During the same time, 45 persons suspected of involvement in
16 drug smuggling cases were arrested.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MILITARY PURCHASES FROM US MAY CHANGE TO FOCUS ON SOFTWARE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan military is considering
substantially expanding a bilateral training program with the US
Department of Defense, the Defense News reported in its latest issue.</P>
      <P>The bilateral training project indicates that the Pentagon's
efforts in recent years to persuade Taiwan to shift its arms purchase
focus from hardware to software is now bearing fruit, the article
said.</P>
      <P>For years, Washington has tried to convince Taiwan to turn its
military purchase focus on highly-controversial large-scale arms
purchases to less prominent but more militarily significant 4CI --
command, control, communications, computers and information.</P>
      <P>The article quoted reliable military sources from the United
States and Taiwan as saying that the two sides intend to initiate a
new cooperative project before mid-1999, probably involving US
provision of training to Taiwan's Army personnel on intelligence
collection and electronic warfare.</P>
      <P>The sources quoted John Daniele, chief of security assistance at
the US Simulation, Training and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM,
Orlando, Florida), as saying that the US$400,000 training program is
aimed at providing STRICOM strategy know-how to the Taiwan Army in a
comprehensive perspective, enabling the ROC Army to acquire its own
STRICOM-related caliber, rather than giving training to individuals
on certain systems.</P>
      <P>Daniele said the ROC Army may become the first non-US military
unit to receive the STRICOM training.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the United States are currently engaged in an
collaborative training program in the air forces. A Taiwan F-16
squad is receiving piloting and logistics training at an Arizona air
base at the cost of US$280 million, according to the Defense News

    <HEADLINE>HONG KONG TYCOON HOPES TO RETURN HOME BEFORE END OF 1998</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Dec.  8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong business tycoon Lim Por-yen,
who has been detained by Taiwan authorities for nearly a year, told a
reporter recently that he is eagerly looking forward to returning to
Hong Kong soon, hopefully before the end of 1998.</P>
      <P>Lim, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Lai Sun Group and a major
shareholder of Hong Kong's Asia Television (ATV), said his trial is
scheduled to restart on Wednesday and he hopes it will be concluded
by the end of December.</P>
      <P>Lim was arrested last December on charges of bribery. According
to chief prosecutor Hsueh Wei-ping, evidence showed that Lim offered
some NT$300 million to Taipei County government officials so that his
Dollar Textile Manufacturing Company which occupied several hectares
in Sanshia, Taipei County could be rezoned to be included in an area
earmarked for development of the proposed National Taipei University.</P>
      <P>Hsueh said Chuang Yu-kun, director of the Taipei County Land
Administration Bureau, who was detained prior to Lim's arrest was
involved in another land rezoning scandal. Chuang reportedly received
NT$100 million from Lim for help in rezoning Lim's factory from cheap
industrial land into commercial and residential land.</P>
      <P>Lim admitted last year that after he received exceptionally high
compensation in the amount of NT$880 million for the acquisition of
his textile plant, he issued four checks with a total value of
HK$55.68 million to a broker named Lin Chin-jung as a commission.</P>
      <P>Lim claimed that he did not know Lin actually worked for Chuang
and that Lin remitted part of the money to the Taipei County
official.</P>
      <P>Lim's family members, who failed to seek bail for the Hong Kong
business tycoon due to his high blood pressure and other ailments,
wrote to Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa earlier this year
asking for help.</P>
      <P>Tung passed the letter to the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait as the case involved civilian
relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Tung said although he is concerned about Lim's case, he also
respects Taiwan's judicial system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US ADVISOR URGES AUSTRALIA TO RECONSIDER NUCLEAR WASTE SITE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking adviser to US President
Bill Clinton has urged Australia to reconsider an international plan
to establish a disposal site for the world's nuclear waste, the
Australian reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>Robert Gallucci said Australia was in a "unique position" to help
solve one of the world's biggest problems -- providing safe storage
for nuclear waste and plutonium from bombs dismantled at the end of
the Cold War.</P>
      <P>"If Australia could appreciate the concept, and decide it was in
the national interest, there would be enormous benefits for the
world," he said.</P>
      <P>Gallucci is Clinton's special envoy on weapons of mass
destruction and is intimately involved in international efforts to
find a secure home for nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>His comments added weight to a plan for the disposal site that
has been quietly promoted for two years in Australia by Seattle-based
Pangea to use Australia as a dumping ground for nuclear waste. Pangea
was forced to go public with its plan last week after interest groups
were leaked a promotion video extolling Australia's qualities as a
possible site.</P>
      <P>The Australian government has turned down proposals and requests
for the disposal site of the nuclear waster in Australia because any
formal consideration of the plan would attract intense opposition from
environmental groups and the Australian Labor Party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN VOTERS LEANING TOWARD STATUS QUO: LE MONDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By Tzou Ming-jhie and Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Saturday's elections in Taiwan have affirmed
the establishment of democracy on the island and the election results
have helped maintain the status quo as well as stability, the French
newspaper Le Monde reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>Frederic Bobin, the paper's Beijing correspondent, was in Taiwan
to report on the elections. He wrote that ruling Kuomintang Ma
Ying-jeou's victory in the Taipei mayor race, and opposition
candidate Frank Hsieh's victory in the Kaohsiung mayor election
implies that voters have confidence in the KMT but expect the DPP to
act as a check and balance for the KMT.</P>
      <P>Regarding the KMT's comfortable majority in the newly-elected
legislature, Bobin said voters showed their appreciation to the
ruling party for their economic management amid the region's
financial turmoil. Voters also indicated a preference for the KMT's
moderate policies in handing relations with mainland China to the
pro-independence agenda of the DPP.</P>
      <P>The KMT's overwhelming victory also hints at the rejection of
hardline pro-reunification and pro-independence sentiments by Taiwan
voters. Beijing and Taipei authorities can therefore follow fixed
communication channels to discuss the future of both sides, the paper
said.</P>
      <P>Voters also highly identified with "the new Taiwanese" concept, a
phrase President Lee Teng-hui coined during the election campaign.</P>
      <P>President Lee should take the credit for having transcended
provincialism by raising the issue of a new Taiwanese identity. Any
attempt by Beijing to ease tensions under the "new Taiwanese" concept
has been made more difficult.</P>
      <P>Beijing's goal of reunification, either by negotiations or the
use of force, will also be made more difficult as Taiwan's democratic
development advances, the paper reported. A notable result of the
elections was the dismal performance of the New Party which strongly
supports unification with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Bobin indicates that Beijing's only move now is to exert even
more pressure to isolate Taiwan in the international arena. In doing
so, Beijing may find Taiwan struggling even harder against this
pressure which will inevitably lead to a stalemate in cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Bobin predicts that the critical debate for independence and
unification will emerge in the next presidential election in the year
2000.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The execution on Saturday of notorious
Hong Kong mobster Cheung Tze-keung and his accomplices in the
mainland have raised doubt in the "one country, two systems" policy,
the Sydney Morning Herald reported.</P>
      <P>Human rights groups, pro-democracy advocates, and legal experts
said they were alarmed that the trial which led to the execution of
Cheung, also known as the Big Spender, set a dangerous precedent as
the offenses were mostly committed in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Amnesty International's Hong Kong branch chairman Alan Abrahams
told reporters that the Hong Kong government should have asked
Beijing to extradite Cheung so he could be tried in the jurisdiction
where the major offenses allegedly occurred.</P>
      <P>"What alarms us is the government seems incapable of recognizing
the problem," he said. "The crimes for which he's been executed were
committed in Hong Kong. These are very real concerns for people who
travel and do business in the mainland. Every time there is a
cross-border crime it could happen again," he added.</P>
      <P>In a cross-border crime spree, Cheung's gang reportedly extracted
more than US$200 million in ransom for the return of kidnapped
tycoons Victor Li Tzar-kuoi, the son of magnate Li Ka-shing and
property baron Walter Kwok Ping-sheung, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Cheung and his gang were also accused of smuggling ammunition and
800 kilos of explosives into Hong Kong along with other offenses that
included robbery.</P>
      <P>After the execution, the Hong Kong government released a
statement that said, "As these people were tried and convicted in the
mainland for offenses committed there under the mainland's criminal
laws, the mainland's laws regarding penalties for criminal offenses
apply."</P>
      <P>But there were suspicions among Hong Kong lawyers that the
outcome suited the post-colonial government, the kidnap victims and

(By Angel Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor-elect Ma Ying-jeou said on
Tuesday he will not discriminate against ethnicity, birthplace nor
party affiliation in the formation of his staff.</P>
      <P>Ma said he has already called on several current city government
officials, including Bureau of Transportation Director Ho Cheng-tan
and Bureau of Finance Director Lin Chuan, to remain in their post.
Both Ho and Lin tend to decline Ma's offer.</P>
      <P>The incoming mayor said in an interview with the Broadcasting
Corporation of China that his recruitment process depends solely on
capability, personal character and expertise.</P>
      <P>When asked about possible conflict between central and local
governments, Ma said Taipei City is under the jurisdiction of the
Executive Yuan so it should do its best to cooperate with the central
government. Any dispute between them should be solved by conciliation
and Taipei residents' interests must be the top priority, Ma said.</P>
      <P>In response to questions over whether Ma would be able to realize
some of his campaign promises due to a shortage of city funds, he
said the ruling party's management fund can be appropriated to solve
budgetary problems.</P>
      <P>During the campaign, Ma came under fire for having few supporters
within the city's cultural circle. Ma said he would make an effort to
make more friends among cultural figures and his cultural policies
will be made by cultural experts.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that on-going cultural activities will be
carried out as long as they help improve the quality of culture in
Taipei. Cultural activities should not be short-lived, but they must
take place for a long time to become a part of citizens' lives, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>Some people have attributed Ma's clean image to his indifference
to public conflicts. In response, Ma said as the minister of justice,
he helped put 5,000 criminals into jail in a bribery case during
legislative elections three years ago. However, the public appears to
have little recollection of this effort, he said.</P>
      <P>The public should evaluate a mayor strictly according to his
performance, Ma added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNOR APPROVES TALLEST TOWER PROJECT FOR MELBOURNE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Victoria State Premier Jeff Kennett has
given the greenlight to a US$1 billion project to build the world's
tallest tower in Melbourne.</P>
      <P>At 560 meters or 120 stories tall, the tower will more than
double the height of Australia's current tallest building -- Realto,
which is also in Melbourne. Construction magnate Bruno Grollo, who
built the Realto in the 1980s, is behind the plan.</P>
      <P>The tower is due to be completed in five years and will surpass
the Patronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur in height by more than 100
meters. However, it pales in comparison with the 677-meter-high World
Center for Vedic Learning planned for India by Grollo's fellow
transcendental meditation proponent, the Maharishi Yogi.</P>
      <P>The approval was met with mixed reaction from architects and
community members. Some labeled the tower as brave and progressive
while others expressed concern that the project would not fit in with
Melbourne's existing landscape and cafe culture.</P>
      <P>With the site at the Docklands near Melbourne Port, the tower
will contain 450 residential units, 320 six-star hotel room, 60,000
square meters of office space and 12,000 square meters of retail
space.</P>
      <P>So far hundreds of people, including Crown Casino boss Lloyd
Williams, have submitted deposits of US$3,125 each to buy residential
apartments.</P>
      <P>Grollo must prove within four months that he has enough financial
backing to pay for the tower construction before the Docklands
Authority of Melbourne offers its final approval.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC'S EXPORTS REACH OVER US$10 BILLION IN NOVEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Angel Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's export volume for the month of
November reached US$10.44 billion with a trade surplus of US$1.58
billion, the highest since June 1997, the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) statistics indicated.</P>
      <P>Based on statistics compiled by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics, MOF Department of Statistics
Director Hsu Kuo-chung predicted Taiwan's total export volume will
decrease by 9.3 percent in 1998 while imports by 9.4 percent, the
largest decreased rates in 18 and 16 years respectively.</P>
      <P>The reason for decreased exports and imports in November compared
to November 1997, is while Europe-bound exports have increased
slightly by 3.3 percent, exports to the United States, Japan and
ASEAN countries have all decreased. Moreover, a decreasing rate of
imports from Europe reached 26.4 percent.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that average daily value of goods passing through
customs was US$475 million, the highest since December 1997.</P>
      <P>Due to Asia's financial turmoil, global economies are in
recession and world trade is slowing down, said Hsu. Compared to 1997
figures, the ROC's export volume from January to November in 1998 has
decreased by 8.9 percent, with Asian-bound exports decreasing by 18.3
percent.</P>
      <P>Hsu added that since the United States and Europe are less hurt
by the financial crisis, the ROC's exports to the United States
remain stable while exports to Europe have declined by 7.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ROC's import volume has increased due to the
government's policy to expand domestic demand. Imports of capital and
facilities have increased by 14.5 percent while imports of raw
materials for agriculture and industry as well as consumer products
have declined as a result of a domestic recession.</P>
      <P>The ROC's exports are expected to increase if Southeast Asian
economies recover from the crisis in 1999, said Hsu.</P>
      <P>Wharton Econometric Forecasting Association of Philadelphia
predicted that the world economic growth rate will increase from 1.9
percent in 1998 to 2.5 percent in 1999, and global trade volume will
also increase from 4.1 percent in 1998 to 5.0 percent in 1999.
Taiwan's exports are expected follow the global trend and recover
steadily, Hsu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ELECTIONS PROVES CHINESE DEMOCRACY WORKABLE: WASHINGTON POST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While mainland China's leadership
threatens Taiwan with missiles, Taiwan threatens them by setting a
democratic example, the Washington Post said in an editorial Tuesday
after Taiwan's three-in-one elections.</P>
      <P>The editorial noted that while mainland Chinese authorities were
scheduling the trial of Wang Youcai, whose "crime" consists of
peacefully attempting to register a democratic political party,
Taiwan's authorities were analyzing weekend elections in which 80
percent of Taiwan's eligible voters participated.</P>
      <P>The Post pointed out that Taiwan's elections last Saturday for
parliamentary and municipal offices were its ninth successful round
of elections since a multi-party system was legalized in 1986.</P>
      <P>"This one, like the others, was free, fair and peaceful,"
according to the editorial.</P>
      <P>In the past Beijing's dictators used cultural differences as an
excuse for not permitting a multi-party political system, but the
Post said that the remarkable voter turnout in Taiwan's elections
suggests that there is nothing "Western," nothing particularly suited
to one culture or another, in people's desire to have a say in their
own governance.</P>
      <P>The editorial indicated that Taiwan's election results were said
to be reassuring to mainland China's leadership. The ruling
Nationalist Party handily defeated the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, which has been more outspoken in its calls for
Taiwanese sovereignty. But the facts are not so simple, the Post
noted.</P>
      <P>It said that few Taiwanese today favor an outright declaration of
independence, but few favor unification with the mainland either --
at least not as long as Beijing remains a dictatorship. In fact, the
Nationalists gained popularity because of their firm stand against
mainland Chinese bullying.</P>
      <P>The editorial said US President Clinton, in his eagerness to woo
Beijing's leaders, slapped down during a visit to mainland China
earlier this year Taiwan's ambitions to play a larger role in the
world. The message discouraged many Taiwanese, but it did not knock
them from their democracy-building path, according to the paper.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian financial crisis has contributed
to increased instability in the region, the commander in chief of the
US Pacific Command told the Australian Financial Review on Monday.</P>
      <P>Admiral Joseph W. Prueher, who is currently in Sydney, said
Indonesia was "very fragile economically, politically, militarily --
there are no constants, everything is in flux right now."</P>
      <P>Although President B.J. Habibie and the Indonesian Parliament are
working on plans for political reform, he said, they are hindered by
demonstrators' challenges to their legitimacy as remnants of
Suharto's rule.</P>
      <P>"The strategic location of Indonesia is important. If there were
to be more instability in Indonesia, it could manifest in the sea
lanes that are so important to all of us in Southeast Asia. We need
to not interfere but look for opportunities to be as helpful as we
can," he was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Responsible for US forces across 259 million square kilometers of
the Pacific and Indian Oceans, Prueher, who is based in Hawaii, said
he would meet Australia's Defense Minister John Moore during his
visit to Australia to discuss ways to strengthen cooperation in
collecting more information from troubled areas. He will also discuss
ways to maintain "inter-operability" of the two countries' forces in
the face of fast-changing technologies.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The newly elected president of the American
Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (AmCham) stressed on Tuesday that
promoting Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) as
early as possible has been a priority for AmCham.</P>
      <P>AmCham President Paul Cassingham added that the chamber also
supports Taiwan's joining the World Health Organization and other
international organizations, and will encourage US Cabinet members to
visit Taipei periodically.</P>
      <P>Cassingham made the remarks at a news conference, during which he
stated key issues related to AmCham's future activities.</P>
      <P>The president, who visited Washington in September on AmCham's
annual lobbying mission, said that both the Clinton administration
and the US Congress desire to help speed up the process of Taiwan's
WTO entry as Taipei has already completed agreements with Washington
on its terms for WTO membership.</P>
      <P>Cassingham pointed out, however, that Washington cannot control
the pace of Taiwan's accession into the world trade regulatory body
once its membership application enters the multilateral examination
portion of the application process.</P>
      <P>During that period, all WTO members, such as the European Union
acting as a whole and Japan, can influence to as great a degree as
the United States the pace of the application process.</P>
      <P>Different political and diplomatic powers are expected to
interfere with the current ongoing review of Taiwan's WTO
application, he said. He added, however, that the United States'
stance on the issue has been very clear -- it supports Taiwan's entry
into the international organization at the earliest possible date.</P>

ROCSAT-1, a satellite scheduled for launch late next January and
aboard which a variety of scientific experiments will be carried out.</P>
      <P>The 21-ton satellite and related surface support equipment,
packed into a total of 46 crates, were transported to Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport on Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chia-ming, director of the preparatory office for the
establishment of a space planning department under the Cabinet-level
National Science Council (NSC), said the satellite is scheduled to be

1999.</P>
      <P>The ROCSAT-1 satellite will be stationed at a plant belonging to
US-based Astrotech Corp. during pre-launch preparations.</P>
      <P>It will cost US$18 million to launch ROCSAT-1. Add to that the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The term of "New Taiwanese" was coined not
only to bolster support for ruling party during the elections but
also to boost the country's status, said President Lee Teng-hui on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In an official session at which Lee heard advice on national
policy from members of the National Assembly, he said that the term
is neither new nor designed specially to drum up support for the
ruling party's candidate for Taipei mayor, Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Rather, it is an idea he has repeated many times out of fear that
the rift between different ethnic groups in Taiwan would be used by
some candidates to muster votes at the peril of the country's
solidarity, said Lee.</P>
      <P>Lee is credited with having contributed significantly to Ma's win
in Saturday's election by calling for the unity of all "new
Taiwanese" while stumping for Ma. "New Taiwanese," he said, refers to
all the people who live in Taiwan, no matter when they immigrated to
the island.</P>
      <P>Ma, whose parents fled to Taipei from mainland China in 1949, was
considered by the majority of Taiwan people whose ancestors came to
the island from mainland China hundreds years ago as an outsider. But
Lee's support was considered an endorsement of Ma's legitimacy.</P>
      <P>Lee said at the National Assembly that the idea of the "new
Taiwanese" would help people to unite to face the threat from
Beijing, and solidify the country's status in the international
community.</P>
      <P>Lee made the comments in reply to questions from National
Assembly members.</P>

million to Honduras and grant it US$6 million in low-interest
long-term loans.</P>
      <P>Honduras was the hardest-hit of all Central America nations after
Mitch ravaged the region between Oct. 25 and Nov. 2. The hurricane
left 5,600 people dead, more than 8,000 missing and 1.4 million
homeless, according to official reports.</P>
      <P>Honduras was the second leg of Lien's four-nation whirlwind trip
to Central America, aimed at bringing ROC relief and conveying its
concern to its allies in the region.</P>
      <P>At the memorandum signing ceremony, Lien presented a US$3 million
check to President Flores as the first installment of the US$12
million donation.</P>
      <P>Before flying to Tegucigalpa, Lien and accompanying ROC officials
and religious and charity representatives visited Nicaragua. There
Lien on behalf of the ROC government and the people of Taiwan pledged
a US$16 million cash aid, 24 metric tons of medicine and other relief
package to Nicaragua.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Eduardo Montealegre,
Lien visited rural regions of the country where he saw for himself
the utter devastation Mitch wreaked in the country.</P>
      <P>Wearing a cap with the ROC national flag and the Red Cross
Society's emblem, Lien was interviewed by the Cable News Network
(CNN).</P>
      <P>Lien told CNN that the Republic of China is more than willing to
extend a helping hand to needy countries and peoples.</P>
      <P>In addition to Nicaragua and Honduras, Lien and the ROC mission
will also visit El Salvador and Guatemala on behalf of President Lee
Teng-hui to express the ROC government and people's concern for the
four Central American countries, all of which were hit hard by Mitch.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND HIJACKER MAY NOT BE REPATRIATED SOON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taoyuan,  Dec.  9  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese hijacker Yuan Bin, the
pilot who hijacked a Beijing-based Air China airplane to Taiwan on
Oct. 28, may not be repatriated in the near future, sources from the
Prosecutor's Office of Taoyuan, northern Taiwan, said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Taoyuan Prosecutor's Office on Tuesday completed an
investigation into Yuan's hijacking. It recommended a "proper"
penalty for Yuan, who "ignored passengers' and the flight's safety by
conducting the hijacking."</P>
      <P>The prosecutors, however, did not think that Yuan should be
repatriated soon on the grounds that the "motives behind his action
were simple and non-violent."</P>
      <P>Yuan's wife, Xu Mei, who sat behind the co-pilot in the cockpit
during the hijacking, was considered an accomplice to Yuan, and the
prosecutors recommended a lighter penalty for her.</P>
      <P>Chief Taoyuan Prosecutor Shih Mao-lin ruled out a speedy
repatriation of Yuan and his wife -- as had been rumored -- so that a
framework on the handling of cross-strait hijackings could be laid.</P>
      <P>Shih said that during the Yuan investigation process the Taoyuan
office had not received any instructions from government officials or
from the judiciary as to how Yuan should be charged.</P>
      <P>Yuan, 30, diverted Air China flight CA905 from Beijing to the
southwestern city of Kunming in the morning of Oct. 28. The flight
was originally destined for the Burmese capital of Rangoon.</P>
      <P>A total of 95 passengers, including 20 foreign nationals and nine
crew members, were aboard the Boeing 737. The plane left Taoyuan's
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport for mainland China about seven
hours after it landed in Taiwan. Yuan and his wife were taken away
for questioning.</P>
      <P>Yuan told investigators that he felt sad but not remorseful for
what he did, adding that he would do it again given his personal feud
with his airline's authorities.</P>
      <P>He complained that he had been treated unfairly by the airline
and that about half a month ago he and his wife concocted a plan to
hijack the plane and fly it to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yuan's co-pilot, Wen Fei, tried unsuccessfully to dissuade him
from hijacking the plane.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BLAZE CLAIMS LIVES OF TWO SCHOOLBOYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An early morning blaze on Wednesday in
central Taiwan's Nantou County claimed the lives of two boys on a
school graduation trip, while one other was left seriously injured.</P>
      <P>The fire started at around 5 a.m. in a wooden cabin located
within the "Little Shitou" resort village. It was believed to have
been caused by a short circuit, according to teachers at the scene.</P>
      <P>The dead were identified as Liu Hung-ming, 11, and Lee Ching-cho,
12, both of whom were students at Chiang Tsui Primary School in
Taipei County. One of their classmates who shared a room with them at
the resort village, 12-year-old Chen Yi-chin, was sent to Changhua
Christian Hospital after sustaining severe burns.</P>
      <P>Chen suffered second- and third-degree burns to 90 percent of his
body, doctors said. He remained in critical condition as of Wednesday
afternoon.</P>
      <P>A total of 401 students, all of whom were soon to graduate, took
part in the two-day travel, which was led by 24 teachers. They were
scheduled to return to school Wednesday afternoon.</P>
      <P>The incident cut short the trip, as students returned home early
and as police launched an investigation into the exact cause of the
fire.</P>
      <P>Besides being the result of a short circuit, the fire could have
been started by students playing with fire, police said.</P>
      <P>Chiang Tsui school executives said every student on the trip is
covered by a NT$2 million (US$61,700) insurance policy against
accidental death and by NT$500,000 worth of student insurance.</P>
      <P>As soon as he was informed of the incident, Taipei County
Magistrate Su Cheng-chang instructed officials to visit the accident
scene to help deal with the aftermath. He also extended his
condolences to the parents of the victims and pledged to push for a
complete review of the safety of tourist spots islandwide.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVES HOLD YEAR-END PARTY WITH TAIPEI REPRESENTATIVES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang and Angel Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 40 members of the Canadian Parliament
and Taipei's highest-ranking officials in Canada held a year-end
party at Capitol Hill on Tuesday in celebration of the past year's
steady relations between the Republic of China and Canada.</P>
      <P>Paul Szabo, chairman of the Canada-Taiwan Parliamentary
Friendship Group, said he appreciated the support the group has
received from the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Canada. The
office has helped Canada's members of parliament to understand
bilateral commercial and tourist relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Szabo wrote an article appearing in Canada's Hill Times
newspaper, saying that while there are no formal relations between
Taiwan and Canada, the group he chairs serves a quasi-diplomatic
function in relations between the countries.</P>
      <P>Taipei's representative to Canada, Fang Chin-yen, pointed out
that after the severing of diplomatic relations between the Republic
of China and Canada in 1970, neither side set up a representative
office in the other's territory until 1990, when doing so came to be
regarded as mutually beneficial.</P>
      <P>Fang added that Taiwan has become Canada's fourth-largest trading
partner in Asia and its ninth-largest worldwide, with a bilateral
trade volume of more than C$5 billion (US$3.25 billion) in 1997.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Canada is one of the main destination of Taiwan's
emigrants, and an increasing number of Taiwanese are going to Canada
to study or travel, noted Fang. He added that, as Szabo had
previously pointed out, intensive people-to-people relations will
help make up for the lack of formal relations between the Republic of
China and Canada.</P>
      <P>Also present at the party were Canadian Free Party member and
House representative Derek Lee; Inky Mark, a representative
belonging to the Reform Party; Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral, a
representative from Quebec; and Conservative Party Senator De Nino
Consiglio, who just returned from a visit to Taiwan to observe the
country's recent three-in-one elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA FACES HUGE TARIFFS ON ITS RICE EXPORTS TO JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is bracing for up to a tariff of
up to 1,300 percent on its rice exports if the Japanese government
bows to strong domestic lobbying efforts to impose restrictions on
foreign imports.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Tokyo, The Australian Financial Review on
Wednesday reported Japan is considering imposing a tariff of up to
1,300 percent on imported rice in a bid to limit its obligations
under the minimum rice access provisions agreed under the Uruguay
Round agriculture agreement.</P>
      <P>The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which derives its core
support from rural Japan, is under immense pressure from the
country's powerful farming union -- Zenchu -- to move quickly to
impose the tariffs in order to protect the rice industry in that
country.</P>
      <P>Since Japan opened its rice market to foreign imports a few years
ago, Australia, the United States and Thailand have been major
exporters of rice to Japan.</P>
      <P>Australian rice growers were hoping to increase their sales of
rice to Japan by 50 percent from 90,000 tons in 1997 to 136,000 tons
by 2000 under the minimum access provisions of the Uruguay Round.</P>
      <P>"Rice and the rice lobby is fairly powerful and you can't just
brush this tariff proposal aside," Richard Day, chief executive of
the Australian Rice Growers Cooperative, told the daily.</P>
      <P>Under the Uruguay Round agreement, Japan was obliged to import an
amount of foreign rice equal to at least 4 percent of its annual rice
consumption in 1995 and increase that amount by 0.8 percent a year to
as high as 8 percent by 2001.</P>
      <P>The daily reported the adoption of an early tariff plan would cut
the final figure of minimum access for foreign rice to about 682,000
tons, which is only 76,000 tons less than the total imports under
full minimum access.</P>
      <P>That indicates how desperate Japan's farming union has become.
The magnitude of increase in imported rice tariff could help protect
domestic rice growers who are competing against foreign importers,
the daily reported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DALAI LAMA REITERATES AUTONOMY, NOT INDEPENDENCE, SOUGHT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Tzou Ming-jhie and Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Dalai Lama indicated on Tuesday he
remains optimistic regarding his struggle for Tibetan autonomy, as
mainland China is undergoing profound changes.</P>
      <P>He made the remark after lunching with French President Jacques
Chirac and his fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureates at Elysee Palace on
Tuesday. The exiled leader came to Paris to participate in the 50th
anniversary celebration of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>Mainland China blasted France for inviting the Buddhist leader to
attend the ceremony, saying he was an exile engaged in "splittist
activities" and that he had violated human rights in Tibet.</P>
      <P>To avoid friction with mainland China, President Chirac had
planned to drop his lunch with the Dalai Lama, but kept the
appointment after the media reported on the issue, which stirred up
concern from human rights groups and other Nobel Peace Prize
laureates.</P>
      <P>Despite mainland China's protest, the Dalai Lama stressed he
would not abandon his aim of Tibetan autonomy.</P>
      <P>"My position remains the same. I am trying to promote meaningful
self-rule, not independence, through dialogue," he added.</P>
      <P>In light of mainland China's protest, a member of a Paris-based
Asian human rights support group indicated that mainland China
exerted pressure on France only to illustrate its fear of being
exposed as the one who truly holds human rights in contempt.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's behavior only complicates the Tibetan matter and
has made the Dalai Lama a martyr in prompting self-rule for Tibet,
the member added.</P>
      <P>France and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization are co-hosting a series of celebrations marking
the 50th anniversary of Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
including academic seminars, concerts, parades and plays. The main
commemoration event will take place Thursday at the Palais de
Chaillot, where the declaration was signed 50 years ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN PENSIONERS SAID WORSE OFF THAN OECD COUNTERPARTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian pensioners have significantly
lower incomes than their counterparts in most other developed
countries, according to a new report on retirees by an adviser to the
UK government.</P>
      <P>Paul Johnson, who prepared the report for the Institute of
Chartered Accountants, said his findings showed that Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries with good
retirement policies mostly taxed superannuation savings at the
end-benefit stage rather than when contributions were made as
Australia did.</P>
      <P>He said his report shows Australia makes poor provisions for
retirees without private superannuation. Pensioners account for
nearly half of the poorest 30 percent of people in Australia, a
higher proportion than in any of the other nine OECD countries
examined except Canada, he said.</P>
      <P>Australian pensioner couples were by far the worst off among
pensioners in OECD countries, with Australian pensioners receiving
only 68 percent of the income of non-pensioners, he said.</P>
      <P>But he said that is good news for the Australian government, as
payments to pensioners accounted for only 2.6 percent of Australia's
gross domestic product (GDP), compared with 13.3 percent in Italy.
The payments are forecast to rise to 4.5 percent of GDP for Australia
by 2050 compared with 20.3 percent in Italy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PETROLEUM STOCKPILES LEVELS TO REMAIN UNCHANGED BY LIBERALIZATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Angel Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Energy Commission under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) said on Wednesday that it will amend existing
measures to regulate Taiwan's export and import of petroleum as a
temporary stand-in to the draft of Petroleum Management Law (PML)
that is still pending in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Hung Chi-chang
and Kuomintang Legislator Ho Sheng-long expressed concern during
Wednesday's review committee meeting over Taiwan's petroleum stock
levels, sources said.</P>
      <P>Existing regulations call for the storage of at least 60 days'
worth of petroleum and at least 25 days' worth of liquid gas.</P>
      <P>Hung asked MOEA officials about temporary measures that would
regulate the volume of petroleum in stock if the Legislative Yuan
does not approve the PML by January 1999.</P>
      <P>MOEA Vice Minister Yin Chi-ming replied that minimum volume
levels will not be changed until the Legislative Yuan approves the PML.</P>
      <P>Executive secretary of the Energy Commission Chen Chao-Yih said
that the substitution measures would amend the "Measures on
Regulating Export and Import of Petroleum and Petroleum-related
Products."</P>
      <P>The market for petroleum for aircraft and fuel as well the market
for liquid gas will be liberalized in January 1999, said MOEA
officials. They added that private companies importing petroleum
should abide by regulations to maintain stable prices in remote
areas. The MOEA also noted that minimum levels of petroleum must be
stockpiled to prepare for national emergencies.</P>
      <P>According to the PML draft, importers and producers of
petroleum-related products must pay taxes into a petroleum fund,
while minimum storage levels would range between 60 days' and 90
days' worth of petroleum.</P>
      <P>The Energy Commission expects the PML to be approved as soon as
possible so as to provide laws to regulate the domestic petroleum
market.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The South Korean model of economic
development no longer suits mainland China, but the Taiwan model is
good for the mainland, according to a leading Korean economic
planner.</P>
      <P>In an interview with The Australian Financial Review on Tuesday,
Dr. Kim Kih Wan, South Korea's ambassador for economic affairs, said
the so-called Korean model of state-led development was obsolete and
that mainland China has been modeling itself on the Korean model.</P>
      <P>Kim, who is currently visiting Sydney, said South Korea was badly
hit by the Asian economic crisis as a result of its obsolete economic
model, but it is now embracing a "new paradigm" of policies based not
on protectionism and government intervention but on openness and
market forces.</P>
      <P>He recommended the more open and competitive Taiwan as a better
model for mainland China to follow.</P>
      <P>He also said that any country that decided to retreat from
globalization was committing economic suicide.</P>
      <P>He drew a parallel with the colonization of Asia in the 19th
century: "Many countries in East Asia made a big mistake when they
failed to adjust to the time called internationalization. When the
Western powers arrived with their boats, their railways and their
guns, they knocked on the doors of East Asia."</P>
      <P>"The countries that said 'no thanks' -- like Korea or China --
what happened? We were colonized. But Japan, which adapted rather
well to the change, did fairly well until World War II. The need
today to adjust to globalization is even higher than the need to
embrace 19th century internationalization." he said. "The country
that refuses to embrace globalization is digging its own grave."</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra, Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Indonesian government, hit hard by the
Asian financial crisis, is planning to increase substantially the
royalty it levies on new mining projects as part of its efforts to
wield greater control over mining operations and over revenue to
local communities.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Jakarta, The Australian Financial Review
reported hundreds of illegal miners last week attacked the facilities
of a mining project owned by PT Aneka Tambang in West Hava and that
the state-owned coal company PT Bukit Asam has also had trouble with
illegal miners in Sumatra.</P>
      <P>But the daily reported the changes do not appear to have hurt
Australian corporate interest in Indonesia as about 50 Australian
mining services companies dominated Indonesia's annual mining trade
fair and conference last week.</P>
      <P>The Indonesian government said that the mining royalties would be
increased to 5 percent of sales in the next generation of mining
contracts compared with the 1 percent to 3 percent royalties mandated
under various existing contracts.</P>
      <P>The new royalty system will apply only to licenses issued under a
new eighth generation of contracts, meaning existing operations will
continue to pay the various rates set by different regimes over the
past three decades, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Rozik Soetjipto, director-general of mining in Indonesia, said
the new royalty system would not discourage foreign investment
because it was still competitive with other countries and because
companies were more concerned about consistent regulations and
harmonious relations with Indonesian communities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>21ST CENTURY WILL NO LONGER BE ASIA'S CENTURY: P.K. CHIANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian financial turmoil that has evolved
beyond Asian countries' control and has had a serious impact
worldwide has frustrated Asia's attempt to reign in the 21st century,
said P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the statement in a speech delivered at a meeting
hosted by the Center for Insurance Business Development. He was
invited to give a speech on how Taiwan has managed to survive the
region's financial crisis.</P>
      <P>The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum did not
include substantial discussion on the burgeoning economic downturn
last year, yet this year APEC paid close attention to the matter,
underlining the influence the economic downturn has exercised and
showing that APEC is aware of the gravity of the crisis, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>In the past, it appeared to be natural to believe that Asia would
rule over the 21st century, since the region's economy developed
speedily. Many Asian countries therefore aimed to largely expand
supply and demand but only ended up hurting themselves in the end,
Chiang noted.</P>
      <P>To deal with the crisis, Asian countries adopted various
measures. Japan played the trump card of a tax cut that totaled 4
trillion Japanese yen, but the country still failed to survive the
crisis unscathed.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has suffered less amid the downturn, it has been
seriously affected by Southeast Asia, which accounts for more than 50
percent of Taiwan's export markets. Taiwan's exports to the region
dropped 9 percent for the first nine months of this year.</P>
      <P>Chiang pledged the need for an expansion of both civil and public
investments and an enlargement of domestic demand to boost the
economy.</P>
      <P>He claimed the government should be responsible for providing a
complete environment and a sound "economic infrastructure" for
enterprises.</P>
      <P>Speaking on Taiwan's positive economic growth rate of 5.1 percent
compared with the slight or even negative growth being experienced by
neighboring countries, Chiang said Taiwan's growth can be attributed
to its industrial and financial policies.</P>
      <P>He blamed the region's financial turmoil on overindulgent
financial liberalization that allowed for hot money flows but which
forced stock and foreign exchange markets to bear the brunt of
recessions, notably when foreign capital largely withdrew.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy mainly is supported by small- and medium-sized
enterprises, which differ from the conglomerates of Japan and South
Korea. The share of self-financed capitals in Taiwan's enterprise is
much higher than that of Japan's companies. These two factors have
also contributed to Taiwan's being less affected by the crisis,

    <HEADLINE>ETHNIC CHINESE GIRL LIVING IN SWEDEN VISITING TAIWAN TO FIND PARENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hanna Andersson, an ethnic Chinese girl
living in Sweden, returned to Taipei Wednesday to continue the search
for her biological mother.</P>
      <P>An earlier visit in October by Andersson -- or Hanna, as she is
commonly known in Taiwan -- proved fruitless.</P>
      <P>Andersson, a 22-year-old university economics major who has
studied mandarin at a language school in Stockholm, came to Taiwan,
alone, in hopes of finding her birth mother.</P>
      <P>Andersson said at a press conference at the Swedish Trade Office
in Taipei that her adoptive parents in Sweden have shown her
tremendous love and affection. But inspired by Kartya Wunderle and
Eimee Butler, a pair of ethnic Chinese teenagers living in Australia
who came to Taiwan separately to search for -- and ultimately found
-- their mothers, Andersson came to Taiwan in October to search for
her parents.</P>
      <P>Noting that her first visit was unsuccessful, Andersson said not
all the adopted children she knew were as eager as her to find their
biological parents. But she said she has long sought to find her
mother and that her heart would not be at peace until she has done
so.</P>
      <P>Andersson showed her ROC passport which identified her -- then a
two-month baby -- as Tseng Mei-li. As her birth certificate was found
bogus, she has no way to trace her biological mother.</P>
      <P>She was told that she was born out of wedlock to a 16-year-old
girl from Tainan, southern Taiwan. Her mother was taken to the
northern city of Hsinchu to give her birth, on June 22, 1976. The
midwife sold the newly-born infant at NT$20,000 to a Swedish
missionary couple. Later on she was taken to Sweden and given to the
Andersson family.</P>
      <P>Andersson said she worked at a haute couture shop for two years
after graduating from high school to save money to travel to Taiwan
to find her biological mother. She also enrolled in mandarin classes,
so that she might someday speak to her mother in the Chinese
language.</P>
      <P>Andersson and her Taiwan friends provided phone numbers --
02-27607160 and 0931064476 and e-mail address -- A
891@ms17hinet.net., hoping that her birth mother will come forward to
meet her. She said she will not leave Taiwan until her mother is
found.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Federation of Motion Picture Producers
in Asia-Pacific has decided to establish its standing secretariat in
Taipei as a part of efforts to help invigorate Asia's movie industry.</P>
      <P>Representatives from 12 member countries in the Asia-Pacific Film
Festival Committee met in Taipei on Wednesday. During the meeting,
members decided to give Taipei greater responsibilities for reviving
the movie industry in the region by making Taipei home to the film
producers' secretariat.</P>
      <P>The committee selected Vietnam to host the 2000 Asia-Pacific Film
Festival, marking a first such honor for that country. Thailand has
been authorized to sponsor a similar festival in 1999.</P>
      <P>All participating delegates agreed that the movie industry in
their respective countries are in an unprecedented slump,
particularly in the face of strong competition from Hollywood films.</P>
      <P>As of today, 95 percent of motion pictures shown in Thailand are
foreign made compared to a mere 5 percent of locally-produced films.
In Japan, the ratio between foreign and locally-made films was 7-3,
while in Taiwan and South Korea the ratio was 8-2.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, government spokesman Chen Chien-jen met with
world-renowned veteran director Robert Wise, and other foreign movie
heavyweights who have came to Taipei to take part in the 43rd
Asia-Pacific Film Festival and the 35th Golden Horse Awards, slated
for Dec. 9-12.</P>
      <P>Chen extended a hearty welcome to Wise, and praised him for
bringing extra glory to the annual events.</P>
      <P>Wise for his part said he was thrilled to visit Taiwan again. He
said he was in Taiwan to shoot a film several decades ago and has had
a good impression of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Other "bright stars," including Maki Miyamoto, best actress in
the 1998 Tokyo Film Festival, Joan Chen, a famous Chinese actress who
now resides in the United States, Sir Run Run Shaw, veteran producer
in Hong Kong, will also be arriving for the festivals.</P>
      <P>A total of 287 delegates from the 12 Asia-Pacific Film Festival
Committee member countries are expected to take part in the two
festivals.</P>
      <P>Twenty-four feature films and 16 other short films and animated
films have been entered in the 43rd Asia-Pacific Film Festival, while
six feature films were selected as nominees for best picture in the
35th Golden Horse Awards.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDIGENIZATION NOT TANTAMOUNT TO SEEKING INDEPENDENCE: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's indigenization movement is not
tantamount to seeking independence, a well-known international
relations expert from Taiwan said here on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It is "basically a mistake" to think that Taiwan will move toward
becoming an independent country because of its indigenization
movement, as some mainland Chinese and foreign scholars have stated,
said Y. M. Shao, director of the Institute of International Relations
under the National Chengchi University.</P>
      <P>Shao was speaking at a seminar held by a Chinese study center at
Maryland University on Taiwan's recent "three-in-one" elections.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's inclination toward indigenous culture is natural, it
should not be considered part of a separatist movement, Shao noted.
The people of Taiwan are very practical because 80 percent of them
are fully aware that pursuing independence will provoke serious
political consequences, he added.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan also believes it must boost its own strength so
it can have greater bargaining power in negotiations with mainland
China, he stated, urging the mainland authorities to have a better
understanding of the feelings of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Shao called on Beijing to thoroughly review why Taiwan cannot
accept the "one country, two systems" scheme and its rhetoric that
Taiwan is a province of mainland China. He proposed that Beijing
adopt a more pragmatic position to deal with these issues.</P>
      <P>As to the impact of the Dec. 5 elections, Shao said the most
important is that Taiwan has transmitted a message that Chinese are
democracy-loving people and are capable of implementing democracy.</P>
      <P>Shao, a renowned mainland affairs and international relations
expert, is currently visiting Maryland University as a visiting
scholar, and will return to Taiwan soon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MAKES LITTLE HUMAN RIGHTS PROGRESS IN 1998</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has made little progress in improving
human rights conditions in 1998, according to an annual report
released on Wednesday by the Chinese Association for Human Rights
(CAHR).</P>
      <P>The CAHR made public its eighth annual Taiwan Human Rights Index
Report on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>Despite Taiwan's outstanding achievements in democracy, as well
as economic and educational developments, there has been little
progress in improving the rights of Taiwan citizens over the last
eight years, CAHR Chairman Chai Sung-lin said.</P>
      <P>The report's results were divided into eight categories and
involved over 1,400 citizens islandwide. Respondents were asked about
the human rights situation in politics, economics, society, culture
and education, the judicial system, among women and children, as well
as the situation among the elderly and Hong Kong citizens.</P>
      <P>Report results showed that Taiwan flunked in all eight categories
this year as it has in the past.</P>
      <P>While the island demonstrated little progress for women,
children, society, education and economy, Taiwan scored the lowest
points in regard to the less fortunate groups in society.</P>
      <P>There are no adequate nursing facilities and policy for the
elderly in Taiwan, while women and children face an increasingly
dangerous environment here, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Based on a five-point measuring scale, Taiwan's human rights
index for elderly people averaged 2.5, the lowest rank among the
major eight human rights indexes. The index for nursing care for the
elderly was given a low of 2.35 points.</P>
      <P>The human rights index for women ranged between 2.12 and 3.18
points in six areas. While a 3.18-point approval rate was given to
women's human rights index in education, the lowest level of 2.12
points was given to women in the area of their personal safety.</P>
      <P>The government and society have failed to fully protect Taiwan
women from sexual offenses and violence on both the public and
domestic fronts, said Wang Li-jung, a professor of social science at
National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>However, the most worrying finding was that Taiwan children are
not happy as society expects them to be, pointed out Feng Yen, a
National Taiwan University professor who was in charge of the
report's investigation with children.</P>
      <P>The average human rights index for Taiwan children in 1998 was
2.72 points, a slight increase of 0.06 points from a year ago,
according to the report. But the index in the area of children's
personal safety received merely 2.46 points as a result of a series
of violent attacks against children over the past year.</P>
      <P>In addition to physical abuses, children in Taiwan are constantly
exposed to the danger of being abducted, kidnapped, and sold, the
report warned. A strings of events involving baby selling and
child abuse since the beginning of this year have eroded the
confidence of the assessment team in the government's implementation
of children welfare policy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the report gave 2.89 and 2.83 points to Taiwan human
rights in society and education, while the indexes for economics and
politics averaged 2.69 and 2.92 points, respectively, all below the
3-point approval rate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP HEAD OFFERS TO RESIGN OVER ELECTION SETBACK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Lin Yi-hsiung on Wednesday tendered his resignation to take
responsibility for the party's setback in the three-in-one elections
over the weekend.</P>
      <P>At a weekly meeting of the DPP's Central Standing Committee (CSC)
dedicated to reviewing the party's poor performance in the elections,
Lin abruptly read his letter of resignation and then immediately
walked out of the meeting.</P>
      <P>Lin's move surprised most of the members at the main opposition
party's policy-making body. They later unanimously approved a
resolution to retain Lin.</P>
      <P>At a news conference after the meeting, the DPP said all CSC
members will meet with Lin to urge him to stay on in his post.</P>
      <P>Lin said in the letter that the DPP did not do well in the
elections because of various factors.</P>
      <P>"I hope my resignation will prompt party comrades to make a
thorough review (of the setback) so as to create a promising future
for the party," he said.</P>
      <P>The DPP lost the mayorship of Taipei to the ruling Kuomintang but
it successfully captured the mayorship of Kaohsiung, the second
largest city in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DPP has been divided on whether or not Lin should quit to
shoulder responsibility for the party's dismal showing. However,
Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, who lost his reelection bid, said the
DPP needs Lin, who has a high moral standard, to lead the party into
the next century. A majority of DPP factional leaders are also in
favor of having Lin remain party chairman.</P>
      <P>In the legislative election, the DPP won 29.66 percent of the
votes cast, or 70 out of 225 seats in the expanded next legislature.
The results compare to 33.2 percent of votes or 54 out of a total of
164 seats in the current legislature which was elected four years
ago.</P>
      <P>However, DPP Secretary-General Chiu Yi-jen said unless Lin
withdraws his written resignation personally, the resignation should
be considered valid. Chiu added that chances are very slim that Lin
will continue as party chairman as he appears determined to quit.</P>
      <P>Chiu a by-election for chairman will take at least one and a half
months to complete.</P>
      <P>Lin was elected DPP chairman in May.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9  (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China must emphasize
strengthening its economic foundation to better cope with the
challenges of the new millennium, according to the ROC's top economic
planner.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), made the remarks on Wednesday at a
Kuomintang Central Standing Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Chiang pointed out that the ROC, which has suffered relatively
little among Asian countries struck by the economic crisis that began
last year, performed relatively well and its economy remains healthy
and solid.</P>
      <P>However, he said, problems within several local companies
recently have revealed that Taiwan's current economic regulations and
systems still urgently need to be seriously reviewed and reformed.</P>
      <P>The CEPD chief offered three main suggestions on how best to
enhance continued economic growth. They include creating a market
system full of vitality; improving the construction of a complete
infrastructure; and establishing a social environment full of concern.</P>
      <P>Chiang noted that the suggestions are aimed at fully implementing
the three administrative policies identified by Premier Vincent Siew
-- rebuilding government, boosting the economy, and reconstructing
society.</P>
      <P>The economic planner said at present, the government is actively
engaged in various activities such as speeding up the reorganization
of government, manpower and the revision of regulations.</P>
      <P>Chiang added that the government will accelerate the
implementation of public construction projects to stimulate domestic
demand and improve the climate for business operations.</P>
      <P>He predicted the international economic situation will improve
next year and the ROC economy will also perform better in 1999,
turning from "outside cold and inside warm" to "outside warm and
inside warm".</P>
      <P>The CEPD chief urged enterprises at home to be steady in their
business operations, pay attention to technological innovation, show
concern for society, and continue to maintain competitive superiority
in order to reach another economic summit.</P>

(By C.P. Huang and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has been invited
to attend a meeting in Washington aimed at helping hurricane-ravaged
Central American countries rebuild, the vice foreign minister said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>ROC International Cooperation and Development Foundation (ICDF)
Secretary-General Luo Ping-chang will represent the ROC at the
meeting slated for Friday, Vice Foreign Minister Francisco Ou said.</P>
      <P>Both Luo and Ou are currently accompanying ROC Vice President
Lien Chan on a visit to Central America to express Taiwan's concern
for Taipei's storm-hit allies -- Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and
El Salvador. The mission arrived in Honduras on Tuesday for the
second leg of its four-nation tour.</P>
      <P>Luo will submit Taiwan's aid project plans for the region's
post-disaster rehabilitation at the Washington conference which will
be hosted by the Inter-American Development Bank, Ou said.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan is not an IDB member, it is a close ally of several
IDB member nations which were devastated by Hurricane Mitch in
October. Taiwan's friendship with Central American countries and its
role as a source of aid allowed it to take part in the Washington
conference, Ou said.</P>
      <P>Beijing, which has been suppressing Taiwan's participation in
international activities, was not invited to the meeting, Ou added.</P>
      <P>The ROC vice president on Tuesday signed a cooperative memorandum
with Honduras under which the ROC government pledged to donate US$12
million to the Central American ally and grant it US$6 million in
low-interest long-term loans provided by the ICDF.</P>
      <P>Ou told CNA that Honduran authorities have decided to use the
loans to build new houses and they have asked the IDB to monitor the
construction. Meanwhile, the use of the donated funds will be decided
after the Washington meeting.</P>
      <P>Honduras was the hardest hit of all the Central American
countries after Hurricane Mitch devastated the region between Oct. 25
and Nov. 2. The hurricane left 5,600 people dead, more than 8,000
missing and 1.4 million homeless, according to official reports.</P>
      <P>Before flying to Tegucigalpa, Lien and the ROC mission comprised
of officials as well as religious and charity representatives visited
Nicaragua where Lien pledged a US$10 million cash donation on behalf
of the Republic of China government and the people in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Travel and tourism in India could create 8
million jobs and account for 12 percent of the country's exports by
2010 if the country were to implement a long-term strategy.</P>
      <P>The suggestion was made by Geoffrey Lipman, president of the

      <P>Travel and tourism currently accounts for 10 percent of India's

      <P>A WTTC study found that the industry's contribution to exports
was expected to grow from US$5.4 billion to US$37.3 billion by the
year of 2010.</P>
      <P>"This is not a leisure pursuit of the elite, it is a business

(By C.P. Huang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A top health official from the Republic
of China on Wednesday called for cooperation between the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the ROC in helping ease the health problems in
countries hit by Hurricane Mitch.</P>
      <P>Chan Chi-shean, director-general of the ROC Department of Health,
urged Honduras and its neighboring countries recovering from the
hurricane to call on the WHO to work with Taipei in addressing the
poor health conditions caused by the devastation in October.</P>
      <P>Chan, a member of ROC Vice President Lien Chan's mission to four
storm-hit allies in Central America, suggested that governments of
those countries ravaged by Mitch make the call to WHO via the
Pan-American Health Organization so that the world's top health body
may pay due attention to Taiwan's efforts.</P>
      <P>He said Taipei offered to provide vaccines and relevant medical
aid to countries in Central Asia in 1994 when the region was hit by
deadly epidemics. However, the efforts hit a snag because of
Beijing's intervention, he noted.</P>
      <P>Similar past cases of Taiwan being turned down simply because of
Beijing's intervention are numerous, Chan lamented. He said he is
planning to file a complaint to WHO's administrative head, asking the
health organization to acknowledge the fact that Beijing's efforts to
block Taiwan is hampering its efforts to help needy people around the
world.</P>
      <P>The ROC mission, currently visiting El Salvador, has pledged to
donate cash and other aid packages to Honduras and Nicaragua to help
them rebuild health and medical facilities as well as infrastructure.
The mission is scheduled to proceed to Guatemala after visiting El
Salvador.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADIANS BET C$6.8 BILLION LEGALLY EVERY YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  9  (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canadians spent C$6.8 billion (US$4.7
billion) on government-run gambling operations last year, making
legalized gambling one of the fastest growing industries in Canada.</P>
      <P>Statistics Canada (Statscan) said on Wednesday the figure
represents a threefold increase in legalized gambling in Canada since
1992.</P>
      <P>Residents of Quebec wagered an average of C$348 each in various
games of chance in 1997. Prince Edward Islanders were next, betting
an average C$340 each, according to the statistics.</P>
      <P>The federal agency said in a report that provincial revenue from
government-regulated casinos and video lottery terminals have more
than doubled in the past five years. Last year alone, the provinces
raked in about C$4 billion in profits, up from C$1.7 billion just
five years ago.</P>
      <P>The report noted that casinos and video lottery machines
accounted for 60 percent of all gambling activities in Canada in
1997, up from only 10 percent in 1992.</P>
      <P>It said employment in the gambling industry has tripled in the
five-year period, to 35,000 full-time jobs. In fact, Statscan noted,
it accounted for 2 percent of all job growth between 1992 and 1997.</P>
      <P>While gambling revenue is booming, critics said no one seems to
be keeping tracks of the social cost of gambling. Provincial
governments are only now beginning to work on treatment programs.</P>
      <P>The provinces defended the gambling business, saying the revenue
supported health care and other social programs.</P>
      <P>Anther attraction for the government is, unlike taxes, the money
they raise from gaming is voluntary, critics pointed out.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra, Dec. 10 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's foreign minister, in a speech
marking the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights in Sydney on Wednesday, criticized Asian leaders who used
Asian values as justification to limit democracy.</P>
      <P>Alexander Downer condemned authoritarian leaders who "would
challenge the universality of human rights ... in terms of cultural
relativism" -- a clear signal that Australia now feels less
restrained about openly criticizing its repressive neighbors.</P>
      <P>"For too long there have been people in Asia and elsewhere who
have clung to the misguided notion of 'Asian values' as a
justification for clamping down on democratic movements or the
natural inclination of people to participate in the democratic
process.</P>
      <P>"They have also used so-called Asian values as an excuse for not
allowing for an appropriate evolution of an open society. It is only
an open civil society which can be inclusive, tolerant and truly
outward-looking," he said.</P>
      <P>Without mentioning which country, Downer said, "It is not enough
for governments merely to hold elections to qualify as democratic. If
they follow those elections by erecting barriers to civil society --
such as suppressing dissent, hobbling the judicial system, cracking
down on the media or inhibiting transparency -- they are weighting
the scales unfairly and undermining democracy."</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA'S CRITICISM OF AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES SUPPORTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By  Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Analysts have come out in support of
Australia's criticism of authoritarian regimes which use Asian values
as an excuse to continue political repression and human rights
abuses, the Australian Financial Review reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The concept of Asian values was particularly seductive to
politicians, officials and businessmen who were anxious to exploit
Asia's economic boom, they were cited as saying.</P>
      <P>Over the past 20 years of Asia's economic growth, four Asian
countries have replaced authoritarian regimes with democratic ones.
They are two of Asia's largest economies -- Taiwan and South Korea --
and two smaller Southeast Asian economies -- Thailand and the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>Since the economic crisis began, Indonesians have removed former
President Suharto from power and ushered in a new era, they noted.</P>
      <P>The trend toward democracy can occur during good or bad weather.
Only Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has increased the
level of repression, the analysts stated, adding that they hoped he
would fail.</P>
      <P>Authoritarianism has never been an authentic Asian value, they
argued. Leading Asian scholars pointed out that the supposed father
of Asian values -- Confucius -- wrote about the importance of
individual freedoms while Mencius, a famous Confucius disciple, first
coined the phrase "people's power."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission
(OCAC) will not be sacrificed in the government reforms aimed at
improving administrative efficiency, the commission's minister
asserted on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chiao Jen-ho said there is a "consensus" among the ROC leadership
that the organization will be maintained. The minister was responding
to CNA questions over the possible abolishment of the OCAC.</P>
      <P>The OCAC was established to serve the interests of Chinese
nationals in foreign countries and areas, and to maintain cultural
solidarity with overseas Chinese. It plays the role of gluing the
strength of Chinese people who live all over the world, Chiao said.</P>
      <P>Maintaining and strengthening the OCAC's functions, which include
providing financial, investment, and educational assistance, has been
a consensus of the government, Chiao told CNA ahead of his departure
for Malaysia to meet with overseas Chinese who had been educated in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiao noted that he has been minister of the OCAC for 10 months
and five days, during which he has come into contact with Chinese
nationals all around the world. Through such interaction, he has
found his work very meaningful, Chiao said.</P>
      <P>For example, in Malaysia there are over 30,000 Chinese descents
who had studied in Taiwan. Those overseas Chinese have established a
gathering every year which reflects their attachment to the Republic
of China, Chiao said.</P>
      <P>At present, around 2,800 overseas Chinese students from countries
worldwide will come to study in Taiwan every year, Chiao added.</P>

urged the Bank of America (BOA) to protect its clients' rights after
the bank announced it would sell its Taiwan retail operations.</P>
      <P>As a part of plans to streamline its businesses in Asia after
merging with Nations Bank, BOA will sell off its consumer banking
activities in Taiwan, Singapore and India, while boosting operations
in Hong Kong and Macau, bank officials said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>BOA promised to keep its existing services in Taiwan unchanged
prior to any takeover by other institutions.</P>
      <P>As of late November, BOA in Taiwan issued 230,000 credit cards,
accepted NT$30 billion in deposits and provided NT$800 million in
loans. The retail business in Taiwan is estimated at about US$700
million</P>
      <P>Vice Finance Minister Sean Chen indicated that BOA had engaged in
wholesale operations and did not open business in retail banking
services until 1994. He added that it was a pity that the bank which
had been performing so well in Taiwan had to quit.</P>
      <P>The MOF also questioned BOA's withdrawal of capital, implying the
bank was operating at a deficit, but BOA has denied this speculation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Bank SinoPac has expressed interest in taking over the
market BOA is leaving, saying that they are confident of being able
to manage the operations since SinoPac has acquired Australian and
American banks previously.</P>
      <P>SinoPac said it would take several months to cope with the
acquisition before the terms could be settled. The bank was also
convinced this acquisition would be a boost SinoPac.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US EXPERTS SEE CHEN AS STRONG PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington  D.C.,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Angel Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian,
despite having lost his reelection bid, is still the strongest
presidential candidate in the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party, prominent US experts said.</P>
      <P>US observers of Taiwan's three-in-one elections which were held
on Dec. 5 gathered at a seminar in Washington D.C. to discuss the
election results.</P>
      <P>Robert Sutter, researcher at the US Library of Congress, said
Taiwan Vice President Lien Chan will likely be nominated by the
ruling Kuomintang as its presidential hopeful, but Lien may lose in a
race against Chen who is popular in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Lien Chan is not seen as a vote-getter and is someone who is not
a charismatic type of political leader," Sutter told seminar members.
"In fact, it's quite possible he would lose (in a contest with
Chen)."</P>
      <P>The researcher also noted that Taiwan Provincial Governor James
Soong, who is set to step down from his post in accordance to the
ROC's constitutional amendment, may take part in the presidential
election without the KMT's approval.</P>
      <P>"The scenario of a three-way race is something that we should
watch very carefully," Sutter noted, especially those in Washington
who are worried about Taiwan moving toward independence.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting whether or not the KMT will be able to
consolidate its members in time for the election, Sutter said.</P>
      <P>Ralph Clough, professor at the School of Advanced International
Studies at Johns Hopkins University, agreed that Chen would be the
DPP's candidate for president.</P>
      <P>Clough added that Chen's failure in the mayoral election
"releases him from the pledge" that if he were reelected he would
serve out his second four-year term. As it stands, Chen now has the
time to dedicate himself to the 2000 presidential campaign.</P>
      <P>Taipei's representative to the United States Stephen S.F. Chen
said at the seminar the election results have shown that neither
pro-independence nor pro-unification radicals have gained popular
support in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also present at the seminar was US House of Representative Gerald
B.H. Solomon (R-New York). He praised the KMT's performance in the
recent election and noted that while Taiwan was conducting free
elections, mainland China was arresting those trying to establish an
opposition party.</P>
      <P>Other notable members at the seminar included China affairs
expert Nancy Tucker who is a historian at George Washington
University, and Kenneth Leiberthal, head of the Asian Affairs
Department of the US National Security Council.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the "new Taiwanese," a phrase coined by ROC
President Lee Teng-hui during the campaign, Sutter said the concept
gained widespread support from voters.</P>
      <P>Saturday's elections have also made it less likely that the
United States will do anything to harm Taiwan's interests while
dealing with the mainland, Sutter commented, as democracy in Taiwan
has taken off to the extent that the US government is unable to amend
its policy toward Taiwan in relation to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's image as a "mature and responsible democracy will be a
more and more important factor in the American China policy
calculus," the researcher said.</P>
      <P>While Sutter and Tucker believed the US would have to change its
policy toward Taiwan due to its newly established engagement policy
with Beijing, Leiberthal argued that he does not see the US altering
its relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The election outcome should calm both Beijing and Washington's
fears over the possibility of Taiwan declaring independence, and
strengthen the concept of self-rule among the people of Taiwan, Clough
commented.</P>
      <P>After the election, Taiwan is seen moving to the center, Sutter
noted, "but the center is moving away from the mainland."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite a drop in the total value of
imports in November compared to October, the private investment
sector has shown signs of steady growth, Taiwan's Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The value of Taiwan's imports for November totaled US$8.86
billion, a decline of 12.6 percent from the previous month.</P>
      <P>On separate terms, the import of consumer goods registered a drop
of 42.3 percent compared with the month-earlier level, while that for
agricultural and industrial materials fell by 15.4 percent.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's import of capital equipment in November jumped
18.3 percent from the October level, the CEPD statistics indicated.</P>
      <P>Growth in this area indicates that local investment has not been
affected by sluggish economic development triggered by the Asian
financial crisis, CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials added that private investment is expected to remain
the island's key to economic growth.</P>

      <P>Later in the day, Lien and his mission visited a refugees shelter
in urban San Salvador to meet with people who fell victim to Mitch.</P>
      <P>Lien, speaking in fluent Spanish, told the El Salvadoran people

will soon recover from the worst disaster in recent years.</P>
      <P>Before arriving in San Salvador, Lien and his mission, which

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hanna Andersson, an ethnic Chinese girl
living in Sweden who has come to Taipei to search for her biological
mother, on Thursday submitted a DNA sample.</P>
      <P>The sample was submitted at the National Police Administration,
along with that of Tseng Lee Jung-mei, the woman who is named as
Andersson's birth mother in her adoption papers.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that years ago she gave up her youngest daughter for
adoption. Another infant, however, was adopted by a Swedish couple
using her daughter's name. Tseng said she is not sure whether
Andersson is the girl who was adopted under her daughter's name.</P>
      <P>NPA officials said it would take several days for them to
complete the DNA comparison, as the NPA lab currently has a heavy
backlog.</P>
      <P>Andersson, a 22-year-old college student majoring in economics,
has studied mandarin at a language school in Stockholm. She came to
Taiwan with her lawyer, in hopes of finding her birth mother.</P>
      <P>Andersson said at a press conference in Taipei Wednesday that she
was told that she was born out of wedlock to a 16-year-old girl from
Tainan, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Her mother was taken to the northern city of Hsinchu to give
birth, which occurred on June 22, 1976. A midwife sold the newborn
for NT$20,000 to a Swedish missionary couple. Later she was taken to
Sweden and given to the Andersson family.</P>
      <P>Andersson said she was inspired by Kartya Wunderle and Eimee
Butler, a pair of ethnic Chinese teenagers living in Australia who
came to Taiwan separately to search for -- and ultimately found --
their mothers. Andersson came to Taiwan in October to search for her
biological parents, but to no avail.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S 1998 ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE BETTER THAN IN MOST ASIAN COUNTRIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said on Thursday that if Taiwan achieves its
predicted economic growth of 5.1 percent this year it would put the
island ninth among world economies in terms of their performance this
year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth figure, a decline from an earlier CEPD
prediction of 6.7 percent, may still be larger than those of most
East Asian economies, excluding mainland China, the CEPD predicted in
its review on this year's key economic targets.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan's economic development is expected to be sluggish
this year, consumer prices will remain stable, said CEPD officials.</P>
      <P>The CEPD review indicates Taiwan's consumer prices in the first
10 months of 1998 grew 1.4 percent compared with year-earlier levels,
while annual growth this year is expected to amount to only 1.6
percent, below the government's ceiling of 3 percent.</P>
      <P>In analyzing the impact of the Asian financial crisis on Taiwan's
economy, the report said the financial sector was the first to be
hit, with the New Taiwan dollar falling 14.3 percent over the past
year and stock prices dropping 20.6 percent since last June.</P>
      <P>The impact then expanded, as commodity exports during the
January-October period plunged 9 percent from year-earlier levels,
and commodity and service export growth rates fell by 5.6 percentage
points.</P>
      <P>Unemployment in the third quarter of this year reached 2.99
percent, the highest level since the fourth quarter of 1986, while
the size of Taiwan's workforce, or its labor participation rate, fell
to 58.01 percent of its total population aged 15 or older. That
figure is the lowest level seen since 1983, the CEPD report showed.</P>

      <P>The Australian government has since 1948
helped 1.5 million migrants from many countries, including Taiwan,
mainland China and countries throughout Southeast Asia, learn English
so that they could settle in the country, Immigration Minister Philip
Ruddock said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a statement faxed to CNA Thursday afternoon, Ruddock launched
celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the Adult Migrant
English Program (AMEP) in New South Wales.</P>
      <P>"The AMEP is one of Australia's key migrant settlement schemes,
which has helped 1.5 million migrants since it commenced in 1948. The
program is going from strength to strength in helping vast numbers of
adult migrants and refugees learn English and therefore settle more
successfully in Australia, find employment and avoid social
isolation," he said.</P>
      <P>"The stories of these people tell all have one common thread --
the welcome and help they received through the AMEP program. Such

will urge all democratic nations to impose economic and political
sanctions against mainland China for its continued military buildup
in the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>"The presence of battle ships and structures constitute economic

where he conducted an aerial inspection of mainland Chinese-occupied
Mischief Reef, which is within the Philippine's exclusive economic

      <P>Rohrabacher said the Philippines and other democratic countries
should take harsh measures to dismantle the military structures and
to shoo away mainland Chinese naval ships in the Spratlys.</P>
      <P>Rohrabacher said that economic and political sanctions against
mainland China "are proper due to China's firm stand on Mischief

    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former New Zealand Prime Minister Mike
Moore is running a close second in the race to head the World Trade
Organization (WTO) after making the best impression on ambassadors in
Geneva nearly a fortnight ago, officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a complex procedure that makes selecting a pope look simple,
they said Moore could still win if he emerges as the compromise pick.</P>
      <P>Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panipchtpakdi is the
front-runner to replace retiring Director-General Renato Ruggiero
early next year.</P>
      <P>But the final result depends on which candidate the world's
biggest trading powers -- the United States and the European Union
(EU) -- choose to back.</P>
      <P>The officials said that although Moore has had good relations
with the United States, where he made a good impression during a
lobbying visit this year, it has yet to settle on a candidate.</P>
      <P>They said the EU looks far from being in agreement on the trade
watchdog's next leader, with about half of member countries, led by
influential France, supporting Moroccan candidate Hassan Abouyoub. A
few EU countries back the Thai candidate.</P>
      <P>If the United States and the EU disagree over their preferred
candidate, they would have to find a suitable compromise candidate.</P>
      <P>Importantly for Moore, as a former trade minister, France has
pledged not to veto his candidacy. It has turned the page on past
differences over New Zealand's butter and lamb exports to Europe, and
it seems untroubled by his free-trade stance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ATTENDS IDB MEETING IN WASHINGTON AS OBSERVER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation from the Republic of China
is in Washington, D.C. to attend an international meeting aimed at
helping hurricane-ravaged Central American countries recover.</P>
      <P>The meeting of the International Donor Community, the first of
its kind, is beginning on Thursday in Washington, with the Republic
of China attending as an observer under the name "Taipei, China" said
Peter Bate, a spokesman for the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB).</P>
      <P>Bate said the ROC was invited to the IDB-sponsored donors meeting
because it is a major donor and one of the countries that dispatched
aid packages to the storm-hit Central American countries at an early
stage.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Bate said it is a compromise that Taiwan was invited
to attend the meeting under the name of "Taipei, China" as Taiwan is
not full member in the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund,
or the United Nations, which maintain close links with the IDB.</P>
      <P>Bate noted that the ROC government could launch a protest over
the use of "Taipei, China" if it were unhappy with the arrangement.
He added that if Taiwan were to issue a protest, it would be
understandable.</P>
      <P>Cheng Po-jeou, the ROC's deputy representative in the United
States, and Luo Ping-chang, secretary-general of the ROC
International Cooperation and Development Foundation (ICDF), will
represent Taiwan at the donors summit meeting.</P>
      <P>Luo is scheduled to present Taiwan's aid and relief packages as
well as follow-up plans to the meeting on Friday. The packages
include aid to Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.</P>
      <P>Delegates from 27 countries and areas, as well as representatives
from 20-odd international organizations are expected to attend the
two-day meeting.</P>
      <P>The presidents of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica
and vice president of Guatemala will make speeches during the
meeting.</P>
      <P>Hurricane Mitch swept through Central America in mid-October, and
left more than 10,000 people dead, several hundreds of thousand
homeless and inflicted damages exceeding billions of US dollars.</P>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton sent first lady Hillary Clinton to the
region to inspect the aftermath of the devastation and pledged US$200
million in aid.</P>
      <P>ROC Vice President Lien Chan is also leading a Taiwan mission to
Taipei's four allies -- Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and
Guatemala -- and is offering cash and other aid packages to help the
countries rebuild homes and infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The IDB was established in December 1959 under the support of
former Brazilian President Juscelino Kubitschek. A majority of its
members are Central American, Caribbean and European countries with
Japan being the only member from Asia. Neither Taiwan nor mainland

      <P>The decision of whether the Cabinet should
resign en masse following last week's elections for legislators
ultimately resides with President Lee Teng-hui, Premier Vincent Siew
said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Siew said it was up

      <P>The Constitution empowers the president to appoint the premier,

    <HEADLINE>ROC VICE PRESIDENT PROCEEDS TO GUATEMALA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Guatemala  City,  Dec.  10 (CNA)
(By C.P. Huang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President
Lien Chan flew to Guatemala on Friday on the last leg of his
four-nation tour of Central America to bring relief aid to countries
hit hard by Hurricane Mitch.</P>
      <P>Lien met with Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen over a
luncheon. During the gathering, they signed a joint memorandum on
cooperation which mainly features a US$2 million donation and US$4
million in low-interest long-term loans from Taiwan to help Guatemala
rehabilitate from the devastation.</P>
      <P>Lien's visit to Guatemala has two purposes, said ROC Foreign
Minister Jason Hu, who is along with other officials and religious
and philanthropic delegates accompanying Lien on the current Central
American tour.</P>
      <P>In addition to bringing goodwill and cash aid from Taiwan to
Guatemala in the wake of the devastation inflicted by Hurricane
Mitch, Lien is trying to consolidate ROC-Guatemala ties as Beijing
has stepped up efforts to win the ROC ally over to its fold, Hu said.</P>
      <P>Other countries in that part of the world which Beijing has tried
hard to lure away from the ROC also include Panama and Costa Rica, Hu
added.</P>
      <P>Hu quoted Lien as saying after the luncheon meeting with Arzu
that the ROC-Guatemala ties are close and solid, and there are no
signs indicating that bilateral relations are "shaky" due to
Beijing's intervention.</P>
      <P>Prior to arriving in Guatemala City, the ROC vice president and
his mission visited three other ROC allies -- Nicaragua, Honduras and
El Salvador. On behalf of the ROC government, Lien pledged US$18
million in cash aid and other relief packages to Honduras, the
country hardest hit by Hurricane Mitch in October, US$16 million in
cash aid and loans to Nicaragua, and US$6 million to El Salvador.</P>
      <P>In November, the ROC government sent US$2.6 million in cash and
73 metric tons of medicine and other relief items to the four Central
American countries. The cash was mainly collected from fund-raising
activities throughout Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lien is scheduled to conclude his Central American tour on
Saturday. En route home, Lien will make a two-day one-night stopover
in Los Angeles, where he and members of his mission will not engage
in any public activities nor meet the media.</P>

(By Angel Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Enhanced ROC ties with the World Trade
Organization (WTO) or the World Health Organization (WHO) is not a
condition to the ROC's assistance to its allies, ROC Foreign Minister
Jason Hu asserted on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hu was responding to questions surrounding suggestions made
by ROC Department of Health Director General Chan Chi-shean that
Honduras and Nicaragua and other allies in the region call on the WHO
via the Pan-American Health Organization to work with Taipei in
addressing the poor health conditions caused by Hurricane Mitch which
devastated the region in November.</P>
      <P>Chan's suggestion is by no means adding a condition to
Taipei's aid efforts, Hu insisted.</P>
      <P>Taipei's communications with functional international
organizations are required for its bid to join these organizations,
Hu noted, therefore Taipei is willing to receive feedback from the
international community.</P>
      <P>Beijing has not relented in its suppression of Taiwan in the
international arena, the foreign minister said. For example, Taiwan
is not even a member of the International Red Cross due to the
mainland's boycott, Hu added.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the ROC's efforts to enter the United Nations, Hu
said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will take a more active role in
the bid rather than to wait for approval as has been the practice in
the past.</P>
      <P>Guatemala's Congress publicized their approval of a resolution on
Thursday in support of Taiwan's membership in the UN as well as other
international organizations. The announcement was made during banquet

    <HEADLINE>NOMURA ACCUSED OF TRYING TO EAT AUSTRALIA'S PUBLIC COMPANIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  11  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An Australian Federal Court ruled that
Nomura International Plc sought to ambush the Australian Stock
Exchange and wipe out US$10 billion off the value of Australian
public companies, the Sydney Morning Herald said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The London-based company is accused of dumping portfolio shares
worth US$460 million -- more than the normal total daily turnover --
in the closing minutes of trade on March 28, 1996.</P>
      <P>The Federal Court was told that Nomura executives and traders in
London and Hong Kong laughed and joked about instructions to 10
different brokers, which hoped to drive the stock exchange's All
Ordinaries Index of 353 stocks down by as much as 10 percent.</P>
      <P>Justice Ronald Sachville of the Federal Court said he found
"Nomura engaged in deliberately misleading conduct designed to
achieve illegitimate ends."</P>
      <P>Nomura International is a division of the scandal-plagued
Tokyo-based Nomura Securities Group, founded in 1872, which has
US$100 billion in assets. Sachville said Nomura Australia Ltd., the
Australian arm of Nomura, was not involved in the incident but is
registered here as a dealer.</P>
      <P>The Australian verdict is expected to trigger action against
Nomura in the two cities from which the "sting" was organized --
London and in Hong Kong -- where legal action has been launched by
the local securities regulators, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Alan Cameron, chairman of the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission, said the commission was unable to penalize
Nomura International because it is not registered in Australia. But
he expected that "our fellow regulators" in the UK and Hong Kong
would consider suspending or heavily fining Nomura as a result of the
Australian verdict.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDONESIA WANTS TO SUBSTANTIALLY CUT NUMBER OF BANKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While Indonesia would like to reduce the
number of banks from 200 to about 50, industry experts say the
country can afford to sustain fewer than 10 under new requirements,
the Australian Financial Review said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Jakarta is planning to offer up to 80 percent of the new capital
needed by about 45 private banks as long as they can raise the
additional 20 percent and provide business plans for the next three
years which move towards international capital adequacy standards,
the paper reported.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Finance Minister Bambang Subianto as saying that
of the 150 operating banks that had been audited, 54 had capital
adequacy above 4 percent, 56 were in the category eligible for
government capital assistance and 40 were below negative 25 percent,
which meant they were destined for closure.</P>
      <P>But the biggest burden comes from six state banks which will be
recapitalized at a cost of about US$17 billion despite falling into
the closure category for private banks, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Bambang said it was more effective to provide US$17 billion to
the state banks than simply to liquidate them and pay off depositors
an amount of US$44 billion. Four state banks are already being merged
into one new institution.</P>
      <P>Lippobank, owned mainly by ethnic Chinese in Indonesia, is
regarded as one of the strongest of the large private banks and has
kicked off the first rights issue capital raising to pave the way for
eligibility for government funding, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Several prominent economists in Indonesia have warned against
using a simple cut-off percentage to judge which banks were eligible
for new capital, saying the government should be more selective.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's unemployment rate rose to 8
percent in November thanks to the decline of employment, the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate jumped from an eight-year low of 7.7
percent in October to 8 percent due to a fall in employment by 49,800
in November.</P>
      <P>The drop represented the largest monthly fall in more than five
years and has raised doubts among some economists that a sustained
fall in the jobless rate in 1999 is likely regardless of booming
economic growth in Australia in recent months.</P>
      <P>Federal Employment Minister Peter Reith on Thursday tried to
downplay the significance of the rise in unemployment by referring to
the volatility of the monthly figures.</P>
      <P>But Labor Party's employment spokesman said the weak figures were
a reflection of the government's failure on the employment front,
pointing to the decline in the participation rate since the coalition
government of the Liberal and National Parties were first elected to
power in March 1996.</P>
      <P>"Australians who have lost jobs and are unemployed have
unfortunately clearly given up any hope of getting a job in the

global efforts to help the recovery of countries devastated by
Hurricane Mitch in October.</P>

the International Monetary Fund (IMF) attended the meeting, at which
ROC representatives presented Taiwan's aid and relief packages as
well as follow-up plans.</P>

was hardest hit by the hurricane.</P>
      <P>Flores made special mention and expressed his deep-felt gratitude
for Taiwan's donations and relief efforts in an interview with
reporters after the meeting.</P>
      <P>The acknowledgment means that Taiwan aid has been recognized and
has won respect, said ROC International Cooperation and Development
Fund (ICDF) Secretary-General Luo Ping-chang, who took part in the
meeting on behalf of the ROC government.</P>
      <P>Luo said ROC Vice President Lien Chan is now in Guatemala on the
last leg of four-nation visit to Central America. Prior to Guatemala,
Lien visited Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador. He pledged on
behalf of the ROC people and government a donation of US$10 million
to Nicaragua, US$12 million to Honduras, and US$2 million to El
Salvador, Luo said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the ICDF will grant Nicaragua low-interest loans
over 25 years worth US$6 million to rebuild homes, while providing
the same loans to Honduras, and US$4 million in loans to El Salvador.
The use of the loans will be monitored by the OAS, Luo said.</P>
      <P>He added that ICDF Chairman Jason Hu, who also serves as ROC
foreign minister, will hold a board meeting next month in Taipei to
certify the loans and have them released as a priority.</P>
      <P>Asked if the ROC was invited to the donors summit meeting under
the name of "Taipei, China," instead if its official name of the
Republic of China, Luo stressed the fact that he represented the ROC
at the meeting regardless of what the country is called.</P>
      <P>The most important issue is participating in the meeting and
offer our assistance to our Central American allies, Luo said.</P>
      <P>He stressed, "We are always the Republic of China. No matter what
it is called by the rest of the world." Luo was accompanied to the
meeting by Cheng Po-jeou, the ROC's deputy representative in the
United States.</P>
      <P>Meeting sponsor IDB Spokesman Peter Bate earlier said it was a
compromise that Taiwan attended the donors meeting under the name of
"Taipei, China" as Taiwan is not full member in the World Bank, the
IMF, or the United Nations, which maintain close links with the IDB.</P>

    <HEADLINE>0.53 BABY BORN PER MINUTE IN TAIWAN: 1998 WORLD POPULATION DATA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There are 4.3 babies born every second in
the world and 0.53 babies delivered in Taiwan every minute, according
to 1998 data released by US Population Reference Bureau Inc.</P>
      <P>The statistics indicated that Taiwan's infant mortality rate has
dropped to 6.4 deaths for every 1,000 births which is almost on par
with that in North America and Europe. Meanwhile, Taiwan's average
life expectancy is nine years over the world's average and ranks
among the world's top 30.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development said Taiwan's
crude birth rate for 1998 declined. They attributed the drop to the
Chinese superstition that babies born in the year of the tiger on
the lunar calendar, which falls on 1998, leads to ill fortune.</P>
      <P>According to the data, the 1998 world population totaled 5.92
billion, an increase of 1.4 percent. The world's most populated
countries are mainland China with 1.24 billion, India with 980
million and the United States with 270 million.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's 21.87 million population places it as the 45th most
populated among 201 countries worldwide.</P>
      <P>A total of 136 million babies were born in 1998 with a crude
birth rate of 2.3 percent while the world infant mortality rate stood
at 5.8 percent.</P>
      <P>The average fertility rate was 2.9 babies for every woman, a
reduction from 3 babies recorded last year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's fertility rate was 1.5 babies, far below the world level
of 2.1, figures showed. Fertility rates in Austria, Germany, Greece,
Italy, Spain, Japan and Hong Kong were even lower than that of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Average life expectancy at birth was 66 years, or 64 years for
men and 68 years for women. Life expectancy for Taiwan people was 75
years.

      <P>Newly
appointed Taiwan Governor Chao Shou-po is scheduled to take his
office on Dec. 21 in a ceremony to be held at the archives of the
Taiwan Provincial Government.</P>
      <P>Chao will succeed incumbent Governor James Soong, formally

      <P>Soong was the first -- and will be the last -- governor to be

      <P>After taking office, Chao will lead a provincial government that
will no longer enjoy the right of autonomy, as the result of
revisions to the Republic of China Constitution, under which the
governor will be appointed rather than elected.</P>

of 21 counties and cities under the jurisdiction of the Taiwan
Provincial Government. He will complete the tour after visiting
Nantou County on Dec. 14.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Provincial Government will hold a farewell party on

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although he has had a falling out with
Kuomintang Chairman Lee Teng-hui, outgoing Taiwan Provincial Governor
James Soong could still end up the running mate of incumbent Vice
President Lien Chan in the 2000 presidential election, said a
Kuomintang heavyweight on Friday.</P>
      <P>On a local radio program, Senior Adviser to the President and
former KMT Secretary-General Wu Poh-hsiung said that a Lien-Soong
ticket would be the best the KMT could present in the next
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Admitting that there is a "spat" between Soong and Lee, Wu
brushed aside questions on its depth. Instead he held out hope that
the dispute would not scuttle Soong's chances of appearing on the
ticket, since the party's victory in the election would outweigh any
personal considerations, he said.</P>
      <P>Soong was elected Taiwan provincial governor, with Lee's strong
endorsement, four years ago in Taiwan's first popular election for
the post. Back then it was thought he might be the party's standard
bearer in the 2000 presidential election, but he has been at odds
with Lee since the end of 1997 over Lee's decision to downsize the
provincial government and eliminate gubernatorial elections.</P>
      <P>His excellent job performance as provincial governor and his
willingness to challenge Lee won him approval around the island,
especially among those opposed to the provincial government's
downsizing.</P>
      <P>The falling out, however, is thought to have hurt his chance of
being selected as Lien's running mate.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the decision to sell its
retail business in Taiwan, Bank of America (BOA) still has strong
confidence in the Taiwan economy, a spokesman for the second-largest
bank in America said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The decision forms part of BOA's global restructuring program,
the spokesman said, assuring that its customers, 580 employees and
230,000 credit card account holders in Taiwan will be fully protected
after another bank buys BOA's retail business division.</P>
      <P>So far, all BOA's operations in Taiwan have remained normal
without any change, the spokesman added. He was reluctant, however,
to comment on press reports that Taipei-based Bank SinoPac is
interested in buying the BOA business.</P>
      <P>BOA announced on Wednesday that it will end its retail banking
and credit card services in Taiwan, India and Singapore. According to
Taiwan media reports, the Republic of China Ministry of Finance was
skeptical that BOA decided to pull out of Taiwan because of posting
operating losses in the domestic market.</P>
      <P>One quarter of BOA's 4,500 workers in Asia, including 143 in
Singapore, will be laid off as a result of its restructuring efforts
in the continent.</P>
      <P>The spokesman told CNA that BOA was profitable in Taiwan since it
entered Taiwan's consumer market in 1996. The bank decided to wrap up
its consumer financial services in Taiwan due to its belief that BOA
will fall short of becoming a dominant player in the Taiwan market in
the long term.</P>
      <P>A BOA press release made public on Wednesday said that the bank
decided to shift its operations to other, more profitable, markets
because BOA will fail to become a major player in the Taiwan retail
financial services market.</P>
      <P>Ken Lewis, head of BOA's consumer and commercial banking
division, said BOA still gives positive marks to the Taiwan economy
and that the bank is determined to further strengthen its bond and
foreign exchange services to corporations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIN YI-HSIUNG TO STAY AS DPP HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Lin Yi-hsiung on Friday agreed to stay at his post, fending off a
leadership crisis within the major opposition party.</P>
      <P>Lin, who was elected to the DPP chairmanship in May, tendered his
resignation at a weekly meeting of the DPP's Central Standing
Committee (CSC) Wednesday in what he called a move to take
responsibility for the party's setback in Taiwan's "three-in-one"
elections last weekend.</P>
      <P>Lin's attempt to quit immediately caused trouble for the DPP, as
it found party heavyweights, such as incumbent Taipei Mayor Chen
Shui-bian who failed in his re-election bid, were unwilling to assume
the chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Lin was originally very firm in his decision to leave, even after
the CSC, the party's policy-making body, passed a resolution urging
him to stay.</P>
      <P>But eventually, Chen and all the other CSC members persuaded Lin
to continue serving his term to maintain party stability.</P>
      <P>Although Lin will stay, a reshuffle of the DPP's other top posts
seems inevitable, according to Chen and CSC members, who met with Lin
for one and a half hours earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Party Secretary-General Chiu Yi-jen will quit Saturday. He is
likely to be succeeded by Taipei Mass Rapid Transit Co. Chairman and
former Ilan County Magistrate You Hsi-kun.</P>
      <P>Moreover, several department heads within DPP headquarters,
including those in charge of women, youth and organization affairs,
will be asked to step down for what some CSC members said was their
poor performance in the elections.</P>
      <P>The DPP under Lin's leadership will also establish a task force
to reform party affairs and to map out a strategy for the party's
participation in Taiwan's next presidential election in 2000.</P>
      <P>In the just-concluded elections, the DPP lost the mayorship of
Taipei to the ruling Kuomintang but successfully captured the
mayorship of Kaohsiung, the second-largest city in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But in legislative races, the DPP won 29.66 percent of the votes
cast, or 70 out of 225 seats in the next legislature. The results
compare to 33.2 percent of the vote, or 54 out of a total of 164
seats in the current legislature, which was elected four years ago.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Parliamentary reform should be finished no
later than the middle of 1999, said President Lee Teng-hui on Friday.</P>
      <P>Just as there are more than 10,000 cases pending trial in the
courts, there are 1,193 bills held up by the Legislative Yuan, a fact
that underscores the need to make adjustments to the Republic of
China Constitution to beef up the efficiency of the parliament, said
Lee at a regular meeting with members of the National Assembly.</P>
      <P>Although five measures aimed at expediting the legislature's
processes are now under consideration at the Legislative Yuan,
structural reform is necessary to reshape the country's legislature
and to solve the problems at their roots, said Lee.</P>
      <P>He urged the National Assembly, which was mandated to revise the
ROC Constitution, to study seriously a proposal submitted by a panel
of its own members and to ensure its proposals represent a consensus
of opinion among various political factions so that the changes can
be wrapped up by mid-1999.</P>
      <P>Friday was the last day of a four-day meeting between Lee and
National Assembly members.</P>

      <P>Philippine President Joseph Estrada is
expected to take advantage of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) leaders' forum that opens in Hanoi next week to drum
up support for peaceful options to ease the renewed tension among the
Philippines, mainland China and other countries that claim portions
of the Spratly Island chain.</P>
      <P>This comes even as Malacanang admitted that visiting US Rep. Dana
Rorabacher asked the US government to exert economic and political
pressure on Beijing. He said the comment "carries weight," but
refused to comment further.</P>
      <P>Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican on Friday said the
Department of Foreign Affairs is likely to recommend that the
president raise the Spratly issue so that ASEAN leaders can discuss
among themselves what options to consider.</P>
      <P>"It may be an appropriate forum for discussion of this and to
look for some kind of peaceful ways to solve it," Barican said.</P>
      <P>An exchange of views on international and regional political and
economic developments is on the agenda for the meeting.</P>
      <P>At least five of the six countries that claim all or part of the
Spratlys will attend the ASEAN summit: mainland China, Malaysia,
Brunei and Vietnam. Taiwan also claims sovereignty over the island
chains in the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>Earlier, the Philippines and mainland China agreed to convene an
expert group that would work out confidence-building measures to ease
the tension between the two countries over their territorial
conflict.</P>
      <P>Estrada broached the matter with mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin when they had a bilateral meeting in Malaysia last month, but
said he would bring it up again when he meets with Jiang at the ASEAN
meeting.</P>
      <P>Barican, meanwhile, said the US representative's comments should
not be dismissed.</P>
      <P>Rorabacher, who flew over the Spratlys together with several
Philippine military officials, said the military structures built by
Beijing are a "bullying" tactic, adding that they should be
immediately dismantled.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN 2ND MOST VIGOROUS ECONOMY IN ASIA: PERC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Over the shadow of Asia's financial crisis,
the Taiwan economy has been rated the second most rigorous in Asia,
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The MOEA, citing an October report by the Hong-Kong based
Political and Economic Risk Consultancy Ltd. (PERC), said Taiwan
lags behind only mainland China, but is ahead of Singapore, Japan and
Hong Kong, in that category.</P>
      <P>The PERC gauges its economic vigor index based on each country's
real growth potential in gross domestic product, inflation rate, risk
in foreign exchange rates, growth potential in export and import,
risk in foreign debts and risk in its current account.</P>
      <P>In the category of investment risk, Taiwan was ranked fourth
lowest among Asian countries, after Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan,
but one notch ahead of mainland China. Malaysia was given the sixth
spot, followed by the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, India,
Vietnam and Indonesia.</P>
      <P>In the category of social and political systems, Taiwan was
ranked third after Singapore and Japan, an advance of three notches
from last year.</P>
      <P>Unlike Japan's and South Korea's, Taiwan's economy is backed
mainly by small- and medium-sized businesses, the PERC report said.
The island has showed a high degree of economic clout and proved its
sound structure amid Asia's financial turmoil, which has plagued most
of the region's countries since the second half of last year.</P>
      <P>The report, however, pointed out that politics sometimes
interfere too much in the process of economic policy-making in
Taiwan, singling out the case of the German-based Bayer Group.</P>
      <P>The world-class biochemical giant was forced to withdraw an
investment plan worth of billions of dollars in Taiwan last year as a
result of a threat from the central Taichung County government to
hold a public referendum to decide the fate of the project.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's investment environment is freer than South Korea's, and
the level of Taiwan's workforce is quite high, according to the
report. Labor disputes do not occur frequently in Taiwan, while the
strength of local labor unions are not so strong as in other
countries.</P>
      <P>For many Taiwan businesses, Taiwan's relations with mainland
China play a critical role in their operations, but properly handling
cross-strait ties will help Taiwan firms become more stable, the PERC
commented.</P>

Taiwan's Wang Shi-ting immediately in the second match 6-2, 6-1,
which resulted in a 1-1 draw.</P>
      <P>This set the stage for a showdown in the remaining doubles match,

    <HEADLINE>MA YING-JEOU VOTED MAN OF 1998 BY HONG KONG NEWS WEEKLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong, Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Newly elected Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou
has been voted the man of 1998 by a Hong Kong-based news weekly.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-language Yazhou Zhoukan, in an article to be
published Saturday, made the decision because of Ma's image of
integrity and his charisma, which helped him defeat the also-popular
incumbent mayor, Chen Shui-bian of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Ostensibly, Ma's victory is his personal success. But it has
helped check the momentum of the Taiwan independence movement, which
is closely identified with the DPP's platform, and expressed the
majority's sense of moderation. That should be helpful to peace on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait, the article said.</P>
      <P>The article noted that Chen has suffered his first setback in a
successful political career, saying the defeat is a blow to his
attempt to ride into the 2000 presidential elections on the crest of a
successful re-election bid as Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>The article said that the victory of Ma has drawn the attention
of the media worldwide because the race was highly symbolic. The news
media at home and abroad has interpreted the fierce contest as a
warm-up to the presidential election in 2000.</P>
      <P>Chen's winning the race would have been taken to mean that the
middle-of-the-road are in favor of Taiwan independence. This would
give the movement a major boost, and the independence wave would be
unstoppable.</P>
      <P>The victory of Ma will not only affect the fate of Taiwan, but
will affect cross-strait relations, the article said.</P>
      <P>The article said that Ma's victory will also result in delicate
changes to Taiwan's political ecology and that Vice President Lien
Chan should also jump on the wagon of democracy soon.</P>
      <P>The article said that Ma, who earlier had said repeatedly that he
would not run because he failed to see support from the KMT's top
brass, announced his bid only in late May after responding to calls
from the grassroots.</P>
      <P>This kind of strong appeal from the grassroots has broken a
long-standing KMT decision-making process in which decisions were
traditionally made by only a few members.</P>
      <P>The article also noted that Ma suggested after the election that
the KMT should consider using popular elections to choose a party
chairman.</P>
      <P>The victory of Ma comes at a critical time, as the KMT begins to
engage in reforms. His strong support from the grassroots, and the
victories by most KMT Taiwan Provincial Assembly deputies in their
bids for seats in the expanded legislature, has highlighted the
democratic progress of the decision-making processes of the old grand
party, the article said, This is the gist of Ma's victory, it added.</P>

      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Friday described
people in show business around the world as "engineers who make
dreams come true."</P>
      <P>Premier Siew made the remark at a luncheon he hosted at the Grand
Hotel to entertain representatives attending the 43rd Asia-Pacific
Film Festival and the 35th Golden Horse Film Festival.</P>
      <P>The award ceremonies of the two festivals are scheduled to be
held simultaneously on Saturday night.</P>
      <P>Siew said he was glad that on the eve of the award ceremonies of
the two festivals people in show business -- both domestically and
internationally -- could get together.</P>
      <P>Siew said that the fascination of movies attracts people the
world over. He quoted a movie maker as saying that to shoot a movie
is a hard work; however, the only goal of movie makers is to make
dreams come true.</P>
      <P>He, therefore, commended world movie makers as engineers who not
only make their dreams come true but also make the dreams of movie
fans worldwide come true.</P>
      <P>Siew also said that although the Asia-Pacific region has suffered
from financial turmoil since the end of last year, which has resulted
in fewer movies being produced, there are still a lot of excellent
movies being shot by the world's movie makers.</P>
      <P>Siew paid tribute to movie makers who have long dedicated
themselves to the movies and hoped that through the two film
festivals people can understand the development of the Asia-Pacific
region's movie industry at the turn of the 20th century. He said he
also hoped that through cooperation and exchanges of views, the
Asia-Pacific region's movie industry could have a bright future.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra, Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The depreciation of the Australian dollar
has helped boost the country's wine exports worldwide, but sales to
its four major markets are showing signs of slowing, according to the
Winemakers' Federation of Australia (WFA).</P>
      <P>WFA Chief Executive Ian Sutton said wine exports from December
1997 to November 1998 registered a 26 percent surge to A$860 million
(US$540 million) compared to the previous year.</P>
      <P>He attributed the surge to the depreciation of the Australian
dollar, which has dropped about 18 percent against the US dollar over
the past year.</P>
      <P>Sutton said the depreciation resulted in more competitive prices
for Australian wines in world markets such as Taiwan, mainland China
and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Despite rising exports, wine sales to Australia's four major
markets -- the UK, United States, New Zealand and Canada -- were
rising modestly because of the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Sutton said an advantage of the currency depreciation was that
Japanese importers had switched their purchases to Australian wines
from French ones as they sought to cut costs due to the recession.</P>
      <P>Australian winemakers believed their exports would reach A$1
billion (US$625 million) by 2000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR-ELECT SHOULD VISIT HONG KONG: ROC REPRESENTATIVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By M. N. Wang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor-elect Ma Ying-jeou should
visit Hong Kong to improve bilateral communication and
understanding, ROC representative to Hong Kong Cheng An-kuo said on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who made the comments in an interview on a local radio
station, said the Kuomintang's victory in Taiwan's Dec. 5 elections
will help the island maintain political stability in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Ma, the KMT candidate in the Taipei mayoral race, defeated
incumbent Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the leading opposition Democratic
Progressive Party by a wider-than-expected margin while the KMT
grabbed 55 percent of the 225-seat legislature in the islandwide
legislative elections, 53 seats more than the DPP garnered.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the people of Hong Kong have an affinity for Ma as he
was born in the former British colony. Cheng added that Ma has
already voiced an interest in visiting Hong Kong since his election
victory a week ago. The suggested visit has subsequently aroused a
high degree of interest among the Hong Kong people.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, many Hong Kong residents do not understand
why Ma was denied entry last year when the former British colony was
to return to Beijing rule. Citing the results of a recent public
opinion survey conducted by the Hong Kong University on the issue,
Cheng said 78 percent of respondents thought the government should
have allowed Ma to visit Hong Kong, while only 5 percent voiced
opposition to such a visit.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Hong Kong should further boost bilateral exchanges as
Taiwan has a lot to learn from Hong Kong's administration in urban
development, public construction, finance, housing and traffic
policies, harbor facilities, and its handling of garbage. Meanwhile,
Taiwan is a good example for political reforms, as well as
industrial, educational and high-tech policy development, Cheng
noted.</P>

Pacific islands to assist with local agricultural projects, efforts
which have received attention from the Solomon government.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese authorities in charge of
an Internet news service have signed their first contract with a US
Internet provider, GTE Corp. of Stamford, Connecticut, the Journal of
Commerce reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>The agreement with the China Internet Information Center (CIIC),

allow CIIC to more easily provide information about China to Web
users in North America and Europe using GTE's network," the Journal
said.</P>
      <P>One-quarter of the two million visitors to the CIIC Web site,
which opened in January 1997, are in the United States, it added.</P>
      <P>A survey by International Data Corp. (IDC) showed the
Asia-Pacific region, excluding Japan, will have 35.3 million Internet

    <HEADLINE>MURDOCH'S MAINLAND FREEZE THAWS IN MEETING WITH JIANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian-born media magnate Rupert
Murdoch met with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Thursday
after a five-year grudge sparked by Murdoch's comments on satellite
technology, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.</P>
      <P>In 1993, Murdoch reportedly told a News Corp. shareholders'
meeting in Adelaide that satellite television was "an unambiguous
threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere." His remarks made him
unwelcome in Beijing and News Corp. was unable to conduct any
business on the mainland.</P>
      <P>After years of trying to open closed doors against him and his
media empire, Murdoch's meeting with Jiang appears to have signaled a
tacit approval of such efforts.</P>
      <P>The meeting won coverage from the People's Daily, the official
mouthpiece of the mainland. The report praised Murdoch for his
objectivity and welcomed his efforts to expand cooperation with the
mainland media.</P>
      <P>To get back in the mainland's good graces, Murdoch first dropped
the BBC from his Star TV service in North Asia in 1994 after the
British broadcaster produced programs critical of the mainland. He
also refused to publish a book written by former Hong Kong Governor
Chris Patten, who infuriated Beijing by introducing democratic
reforms in the final years of colonialism.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND'S CRACKDOWN ON DISSIDENTS CRITICIZED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,   Dec.   12  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese prosecutors are
preparing formal criminal charges against Xu Wenli, a key dissident
who has been trying to establish an opposition party, the Sydney
Morning Herald reported on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The move has forced Australia to lodge a formal protest over Xu's
arrest, the paper said.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong representative for Human Rights in China, Sophia
Woodman was quoted as saying that the Chinese authorities had moved
to crush the opposition party as soon as Beijing had satisfied its
diplomatic goal of silencing criticism from Western governments over
its human rights abuses.</P>
      <P>The mainland's new assault on Chinese dissidents, which began
last week, is an embarrassment to Western governments who had
abandoned public criticism of China's human rights violations in
favor of private, low-key dialogue with Beijing, the Herald reported.</P>
      <P>The Howard administration this week was forced to condemn the
crackdown and send officials from Australia's Embassy in Beijing to
the Chinese foreign ministry to lodge an official protest.</P>
      <P>Chinese authorities have rejected foreign protests from Australia
and the United States as security forces intensify their sweep
against the leaders of the new opposition party and their supporters,
the Herald said.</P>
      <P>Xu, 55, has already served 12 years in jail for his role in the
1979 Democracy Wall movement. He will likely face charges of
incitement to overthrow the state government, an offense which
carries a life sentence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EFFECTS OF INCREASED PUBLIC SPENDING TO SURFACE NEXT YEAR: CEPD HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The effects of government efforts to expand
domestic demand and increase public spending will be apparent in the
first half of next year, the Council for Economic Planning and
Development chairman said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>P. K. Chiang noted that although the regional financial crisis
has affected Taiwan's economic growth, economic activities have
returned to normal thanks to government efforts to expand domestic
demand and the adoption of several measures to stabilize the economy.</P>
      <P>He predicted that economic growth this year could reach 5.1
percent and 5.5 percent next year.</P>
      <P>However, the government must continue to push for increased
public construction to boost domestic demand and thus ensure stable
economic growth of the nation, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>According to current plans, the government will increase public
construction spending by NT$63.8 billion (US$1.93 billion) next
year which is expected to create 60,000 jobs and stimulate such local
sectors as the cement and steel industries, and generate tax revenues
estimated at NT$5 billion (US$1.5 billion), the chairman noted.</P>
      <P>He added that the government is mapping out a new four-year
project which will start by 2001.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging a downturn in Taiwan's economy, Chiang said the
island's trade surplus this year will likely be cut to US$6 billion
and export declines will cause a negative effect on economic growth.
But compared with South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and
other Asian countries, Taiwan has no foreign debt and has a sound
economic structure, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BANK WOES MAY TARNISH TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC LUSTER: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  Dec.  11  (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite outperforming most of its
neighbors amid the Asian financial crisis, recent signs may indicate
growing problems for Taiwan's economy, the Los Angeles Times reported
on Friday.</P>
      <P>The high profile struggles of several large Taiwan business
groups, the failure of two finance companies and a run on the
regional Taichung Commercial Bank have all contributed to speculation
that Taiwan has contracted the Asian disease.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Paul Chiu has emphatically said, "The situation
is not directly related to the Asian financial crisis."</P>
      <P>Other banking and financial experts agree, at least for the short
term, but they warn that unless the island's banking system is
consolidated and restructured, Taiwan could face serious economic
problems by the middle of next year, the Times reported.</P>
      <P>Unlike most of the other Asian trouble spots, Taiwan does not
have a foreign exchange problem. It enjoys one of the world's biggest
foreign reserves, at US$88 billion. It has almost no foreign debt due
at least in part to its political isolation. Despite a 9 percent
decline in exports, it still enjoys a healthy trade surplus, and
consumer prices have remained remarkably stable.</P>
      <P>However, some experts contend that Taiwan does have a crisis in
its banking system, marked by a dangerous proliferation of
nonperforming loans. Too many of Taiwan's new private commercial
banks, brought into the system under banking liberalization policies
in the early 1990s, are controlled by business groups that have
dipped too far into bank assets.</P>
      <P>The government has moved quickly and massively to stop the
bleeding in its banking and financial sector. Early last month, the
government issued a rescue plan calling for financial institutions to
extend short-term loan deadlines by six months to give struggling
businesses some breathing room. It also created a US$8.7 billion
emergency stabilization fund to be injected into the economy or stock
market where needed, the Times reported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PROMISES NEARLY US$50 MILLION IN AID TO CENTRAL AMERICA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Loh Ping-chang, secretary-general of
the Taipei-based International Cooperation and Development Fund
(ICDF), said on Friday that the ROC government will provide a total
of US$49.8 million in aid to hurricane victims in Central America.</P>
      <P>Loh made the remarks in the closing ceremony of a two-day
Consultative Group meeting for the Reconstruction and Transformation
of Central America at the headquarters of the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) in Washington.</P>
      <P>"The people and government of the Republic of China immediately
joined the relief efforts for Central America. Cash donations of
US$2.8 million was sent within days of the disaster. Material
supplies, including medicine, food and clothing from our private
sector people were air-freighted within one week. The supplies are
still being shipped as an ongoing operation.</P>
      <P>"We have begun our efforts for the reconstruction phase of the
affected countries. President Lee Teng-hui has asked Vice President
Lien Chan to visit Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala
this week to finalize arrangements for grants and concessional
financing for the reconstruction projects in these countries.</P>
      <P>"As a result of Vice President Lien's discussions with presidents
in Central America, agreements have been reached that a total amount
of US$28 million in grants and US$20 million in long-term
concessional credit will be applied to the construction of houses,
medical facilities, roads, bridges, and to the rehabilitation of
agricultural production. Together with the donations and supplies
provided earlier, a total of US$49.8 million are being provided by
the people and government of the Republic of China to Central
America," Loh said in his three-minute speech.</P>
      <P>The ICDF secretary-general also noted that the ROC government
will closely cooperate with multilateral and bilateral donors. For
instance, the governments of Nicaragua and Honduras have agreed that
the Organization of American States be responsible for implementation
of the housing projects financed by the ROC.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the ROC government's hope of being able to work
with World Health Organization and Pan-American Health Organization
in carrying out health and medical projects.</P>
      <P>IDB President Enrique V. Iglesias praised Taiwan's assistance to
the hurricane-hit victims in Central American countries in a news
conference following the closing ceremony.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that after the two-day meeting, the
international community has promised to provide US$6.3 billion in aid
to central American countries affected by the hurricane. The IDB will
hold the next Consultative Group meeting in Stockholm in May 1999 to
review the reconstruction and transformation of Central America over
the next six months.</P>

      <P>EVA Airways Corporation on Friday

Jan. 8, due to an internal business adjustment.</P>
      <P>A number of Asian airlines have been beleaguered with huge losses

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHAIRMAN STAYS, ANNOUNCES NEW SECRETARY-GENERAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lin Yi-hsiung, chairman of the Democratic
Progressive Party, said on Saturday he will remain in the post for
the stability and long-term interests of the largest opposition party
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin, who earlier tendered his resignation to take responsibility
for the DPP's setback in the three-in-one elections, made the remarks
in a news conference.</P>
      <P>He was accompanied by outgoing Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian,
Legislator Chang Chun-hsiung, National Assembly Deputy Chiu Yi-ying,
and Liu Shih-fang, director of Bureau of Environmental Protection of
Taipei City Government. Lin met with the prominent DPP members after
disappearing from public eye three days ago.</P>
      <P>Lin apologized over the uneasiness caused by his resignation. He
said it was tradition for the chairman to resign after an election
defeat, but he must stand up to his unshirkable responsibility to his
party comrades and supporters.</P>
      <P>The biggest challenges facing the DPP is the presidential
elections in 2000, the chairman said, adding that he will establish a
party development study team to map out a strategy to win the
presidential election in 2000.</P>
      <P>The team will hold its first meeting on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The nomination period for the DPP's candidate will be determined
by the study team, he said, dismissing rumors that the nomination
process will be delayed until next August.</P>
      <P>Some DPP Central Standing Committee members have said that since
the ruling Kuomintang will decide on its candidates for president and
vice president in August, it is necessary for the DPP to make its
selection process in August instead of March according to previous
practice.</P>
      <P>The DPP must begin preparing for the presidential elections at
once, Lin said, adding that the party will contact cities and
counties run by DPP members and reach out to the grassroots to unite
the reform forces of society and address the needs of the public.</P>
      <P>Lin also announced You Hsi-kun, chairman of the Taipei Mass Rapid
Transit Co. (MRT), as the DPP's new secretary-general. You will
replace Chiou I-jen who resigned after the Dec. 5 election.</P>
      <P>Lin described You, who will assume the new job on Jan. 1, as a
trustworthy man who excels in coordinating operations.</P>
      <P>Mayor Chen also lauded the former Ilan magistrate, saying that
under You, the MRT has served 230,000 passengers so far.</P>
      <P>Chen, who failed in his reelection bid for Taipei mayor, also
said he was not anxious to seek a new post for the moment, and that
he would be content in his work as a DPP Central Standing Committee
member.</P>
      <P>On whether he would run for president in 2000, Chen said he hopes
there is not too much pressure for him to do so. He added that he
needs time to review the past and determined why he failed and
consider his future options.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA INCREASES MINIMUM INVESTMENT FOR IMMIGRANTS TO C$500,000</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  11  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada on Friday increased the minimum
investment required of all investor immigrants to C$500,000
(US$325,000), regardless of which province receives the capital.</P>
      <P>The Department of Citizenship and Immigration also increased the
minimum net worth required of the investor to C$1 million -- to
secure provinces and territories against possible loss.</P>
      <P>The regulations governing the current investor program are
repealed but will continue to apply to previously approved businesses
and funds. The redesigned Immigrant Investor Program is expected to
take effect on April 1, 1999.</P>
      <P>In accordance with these new regulations, the federal government
will act as an agent on behalf of the provinces and territories, who
will determine where to invest the money.</P>
      <P>The changes were designed to increase the benefits derived from
the program, and to reduce the potential for abuse as well as the
level of federal and provincial resources required to administer the
program.</P>
      <P>The new program will allow provinces to direct investor funds
toward their own economic priorities.</P>
      <P>The current program will be extended to March 31, 1999, to allow
sufficient time for public comment following Friday's pre-publication
of the new regulations.</P>

      <P>Manila is expected seek support of the

Spratly Island's Mischief Reef, reports said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Philippine Senate Committee Chairman on Foreign Relations Blas

the dispute over the islands an international matter.</P>
      <P>ASEAN leaders cannot afford to ignore the dispute over the

Ople said.</P>

      <P>Ople is part of the Philippine delegation that will travel to
Hanoi for the ASEAN summit on Dec. 15. He heads the Senate delegation
that includes Senators Francisco Tatad and Robert Jaworski.</P>
      <P>The move is apparently aimed at keeping Beijing off-balance in
its claim over the islands. Mainland China has insisted that Manila
and Beijing discuss the dispute on a bilateral level.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, senate leaders led by Ople have demanded that

    <HEADLINE>OUTGOING TAIWAN GOVERNOR WOULD DEFEAT CHEN IN ELECTION: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>According to the results of a recent
opinion poll, Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong would defeat
outgoing Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian in a presidential election.</P>
      <P>If an election were held today between the Kuomintang's Soong and
the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party's Chen, Soong would
receive 55.4 percent support compared to 23.7 percent for Chen, the
poll indicated.</P>
      <P>The survey, jointly conducted by Gallop (Taiwan) Organization
Inc. and the National Open University, said Soong enjoys a high
degree of popularity among the Taiwan population regardless of age,
education level, ethnicity and area of residence.</P>
      <P>If the KMT were to field President Lee Teng-hui in a race against
Chen, Lee would receive 32.4 percent support, lower than Chen's 35.4
percent, according to the survey. If Vice President Lien Chan were to
challenge Chen, the DPP stalwart would score a comfortable win by
43.8 percent against Lien's 25 percent.</P>
      <P>The poll showed that Soong would be the sole challenger within
the KMT capable of defeating Chen in the next presidential election.
Chen may have a chance of winning the presidency if the KMT cannot
field a "Lien-Soong" ticket, according to the survey results.</P>
      <P>Soong will step down from his current post by the end of this
year due to the downsizing of the Taiwan Provincial Government. Chen
was defeated by KMT contender Ma Ying-jeou in the Taipei mayoral race
last week.</P>
      <P>Although many of Chen's supporters have encouraged him to take
part in the 2000 presidential race, the outgoing Taipei mayor has not
yet made clear his intentions in this regard. However, Chen's
post-election islandwide tour which will kick off in central Taiwan's
Taichung on Saturday evening has been widely viewed as a move to
gauge public response to his possible presidential bid.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the survey also found that 60.3 percent of the public
are satisfied or very satisfied with the performance of the current
Cabinet led by Premier Vincent Siew. Siew's approval rate is higher
than President Lee's 56.4 percent and Vice President Lien's 34
percent.</P>
      <P>The poll was carried out from Dec. 7-9 after the Dec. 5
"three-in-one" elections. More than 1,500 Taiwan residents aged over
20 were surveyed, with an error margin of about 3 percent.</P>

shame for wrongdoing. If, on the other hand, in government you depend
upon moral sentiment, and maintain order by encouraging education and
good manners, the people will have a sense of shame for wrongdoing
and moreover, will emulate what is good."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-profile official legislative mission
form Outer Mongolia is scheduled to arrive in Taiwan later this month
to promote business and trade exchanges, sources from the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Mongolian mission, to be headed by Mongolian Agriculture and
Industry Minister Altankhuyag, will meet Republic of China officials
from the MOEA and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, as
well as local business leaders, for a trade and investment promotion
meeting on Dec. 21.</P>
      <P>The visit of the Mongolian mission bears particular significance,
as relations between Mongolia and Taiwan have been considered
sensitive over the past years, MOEA officials noted. The officials
attributed the sensitivity to the geographical and political
characteristics of Mongolia, which is located between Russia and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Altankhuyag will introduce the investment
climate, relevant statutes and incentives to invest in Mongolia,
while Da Ganbold, head of the Mongolian Parliament's Economics
Committee, will speak on his country's economic policies and
investment environment.</P>
      <P>Former Mongolian Ambassador to the United Nations Erdenechuluun
will broach the subject of Mongolia's political environment and
Munkhbat, director-general of customs, will speak on the nation's
investment tariffs and customs affairs.</P>
      <P>Galbaatar, secretary-general of Mongolia's Academy of Sciences,
will introduce Mongolian scientific and technological developments,
as well as its high-tech industry.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA officials, Mongolia has aggressively developed
its economy and trade since the nation launched democratic reforms in
1990.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businesses, particularly wool and textile manufacturers,
are being urged to take the advantage of Mongolia's abundant wool
supplies and other natural resources by relocating their production
lines to Mongolia.</P>
      <P>A relatively skilled yet inexpensive workforce in Mongolia is
also something that should be attractive to Taiwan investors, MOEA
officials noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SERVICE IN COMMERCIAL SHIPPING COULD BE MILITARY SERVICE ALTERNATIVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  13  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) is studying a proposal that would allow young
men to serve aboard commercial maritime shipping vessels in lieu of
compulsory military service.</P>
      <P>If enacted, the proposal would likely ease manpower shortages in
Taiwan's maritime transport industry.</P>
      <P>The proposal was inspired by the introduction of other
alternatives -- such as community service and research and
development work in government-run scientific research
institutions -- to mandatory military service, said officials with
the MOTC's Navigation and Aviation Department.</P>
      <P>An average of 500 people graduate each year from National Taiwan
Ocean University and other marine technology colleges around the
island, but less than one-tenth actually join Taiwan's maritime
transport industry, they said.</P>
      <P>Maritime regulations stipulate that all officers working aboard
Republic of China ocean-going vessels must be ROC nationals. Many
Taiwan shipping companies have been unable to recruit enough ROC
nationals to serve as officers aboard their ships and, as a result,
have been forced to have their vessels registered in foreign
countries to get around the regulation.</P>
      <P>To encourage more maritime college graduates to join the maritime
transport industry, the MOTC officials devised the maritime service
proposal.</P>
      <P>As the proposal now stands, the graduates would be given the
opportunity to serve aboard ROC vessels for four years instead of
performing conventional military service, which usually lasts about
two years.</P>
      <P>Time spent aboard shipping vessels as interns would be counted as
part of their four years of service, officials pointed out.</P>
      <P>By the third year of service, maritime college graduates would
receive an average monthly salary of about NT$70,000 (US$2,154).</P>
      <P>Before the MOTC formally proposes the initiative, it will first
consult local shipping companies and officials from the Ministry of
the Interior on the feasibility of the idea, MOTC officials said.</P>

      <P>European Commission Vice Chairman Leon
Brittan is expected to visit Taiwan next year for a Taiwan-European
Union (EU) industrial round-table conference, said Wang Chih-kang,
Minister of Economic Affairs, on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The EU is considering whether to set up an office in Taiwan,
which reveals the EU's interest in upgrading cooperation and
relations with Taiwan, said Wang.</P>
      <P>The EU has kept a distance from Taiwan because of pressure from
mainland China. But, as Taiwan's economic development continues
steadily and as its economy remains stable amid the region's
financial turmoil, the EU has perceived the necessity of
re-evaluating the bilateral relationship.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has completed bilateral trade talks with the EU for its
bid to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO), and a formal
agreement on the matter is to be signed in the near future, which
will also strengthen the EU's ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Regarding the timetable for Taiwan's membership in the WTO, the
EU has withdrawn its insistence that mainland China be admitted prior
to Taiwan so that Taiwan will not be hampered by the mainland's
sluggishness in opening its markets.</P>
      <P>According to a news source, the European Commission is impatient
with mainland China over its failure to open its markets widely
enough to warrant WTO membership, while preventing others, such as
Taiwan, from attaining membership in the body.</P>
      <P>The EU has never openly expressed its willingness to establish an
office in Taiwan, though Brittan said during a visit to Brussels by
Wang last June that there is a high degree of interest in doing so.</P>
      <P>Despite this, the proposal is still being evaluated, due to the
sensitiveness of the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER URGES LIFELONG LEARNING TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVENESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Sunday that
the "lifelong learning" concept is the steppingstone for Taiwan to
conquer new challenges to be encountered in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>Only through lifelong learning can a society adapt to transitions
and keep competitive, Siew added.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks in a speech delivered at a conference at
National Taiwan Normal University for educational and academic
groups.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has evolved into a country featuring economic prosperity
and democracy, and what has contributed to this achievement is not
its natural resources but appropriate educational policies.
Maintaining Taiwan's competitiveness therefore lies in a series of
promising educational policies, Siew noted.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the knowledge people receive becomes
outdated within five to seven years from the time it is learned,
which makes lifelong learning essential to avoid lagging behind.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the universality of the lifelong learning concept,
Siew cited the existence of programs in Japan, which promulgated in
1990 an act on lifelong learning; the United States, which in 1994
embraced the concept as one of six educational goals; and Singapore,
which pledged to build itself into a "learning-type country."</P>
      <P>Siew praised the Ministry of Education for having marked this
year as the "year for lifelong learning." He also stressed that
designing a series of suitable courses for people in all walks of
life is a great task for all educators.</P>
      <P>Education Minister Lin Ching-chiang and some 200 people in the
educational sector were present at the conference, at which prizes
for best teachers and best services were awarded as well.</P>

      <P>A visit to Taiwan next spring by Wang
Daohan, chairman of the Beijing-based intermediary Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), will be conducive to
better relations across the Taiwan Strait, a local expert on mainland
Chinese affairs said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Professor Pao Tsung-ho of National Taiwan University's department
of political sciences said that if Wang, the top mainland Chinese
negotiator with Taiwan, visits Taipei early next year as is widely

relations, as Wang would probably exchange views on many key issues
with Republic of China officials. He would also likely meet key
leaders in Taiwan during his visit, Pao said.</P>
      <P>Pao said Taiwan has demonstrated unprecedented sincerity and
goodwill toward Beijing, before and after Taiwan's top negotiator,
Koo Chen-fu, visited the mainland in mid-October. He said he hopes
that mainland Chinese authorities will reciprocate Taiwan's goodwill
gestures by arranging for a visit by Wang.</P>
      <P>Koo, a Taiwan business tycoon and an adviser to president Lee
Teng-hui, is chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF).</P>
      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, also said that Wang is widely expected to visit Taiwan in
due time, as agreed upon by the two sides during Koo's visit to
Shanghai in October.</P>
      <P>During that visit, SEF and ARATS agreed to the resumption of a
regular dialogue; the strengthening of exchanges of visits by SEF and
ARATS personnel; an acceleration of exchanges of opinions and
information on cross-strait incidents or accidents; and the
acceptance by Wang of SEF's invitation for him to visit Taiwan in the
following spring.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said, Taipei will continue promoting bilateral
exchanges and negotiations with mainland China so that cross-strait
ties will be further improved, paving the way for eventual
reunification.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the state of cross-strait relations, President Lee
said in a recent speech to the National Assembly that equal footing
for Taiwan and mainland China and mainland China's democratization
are prerequisites to reunification.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>New York-based Radio Free Asia (RFA) will
on Wednesday begin broadcasting an Uighur-language news and
information program that will focus on Uighurs living in mainland
China and in other countries and areas around the world.</P>
      <P>This will be the world's first Uighur-language broadcast program,
said an ethnic Uighur living in Turkey, who was on Saturday hired by
the RFA as a Turkey-based reporter. The reporter is also an activist
of Xinjiang.</P>
      <P>The Uighur are a tribe of Turkic people mainly inhabiting the
Xinjiang region in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Turkey has been a gathering center for Uighurs from areas around
Xinjiang, because of its geographical location next to Central Asia
and because it is a place where people speak Turkic languages, such
as Uighur.</P>
      <P>At present more than 400 Uighur traders travel between Turkey and
mainland China every year, said the RFA reporter.</P>
      <P>They have provided the activist's Xinjiang organization with news
and information related to Xinjiang, an area in which authorities in
Beijing have been accused of violating human rights and of strictly
censoring the press.</P>
      <P>The RFA's Uighur broadcast will be in the program lasting 30
minutes. Eventually, the program will expand in length to 60 minutes
and be broadcast daily, said the RFA reporter.</P>
      <P>The RFA has been under the sponsorship of the US Congress, which
was reported by The Los Angeles Times in its Saturday issue to have
given US$390 million to the station to support its advocacy of human
rights and democracy in communist countries, such as mainland China.</P>

      <P>A visit by Wang Daohan, chairman of the
Beijing-based intermediary Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), to Taiwan will most likely take place in next
 March, an official in charge of mainland affairs said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, made the remarks in a two-day seminar on cross-strait
relations at National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), during his visit to mainland China in October,
invited his counterpart, Wang, to visit Taiwan. Wang agreed and said
he would visit in due time.</P>
      <P>The top charter of mainland policy also said that the government
is sincere in inviting Wang to visit, but the timing of his visit
will have to be discussed between SEF and ARATS, the two intermediary
bodies set up to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of
official ties.</P>
      <P>Chang also noted that the government will continue to push for
exchanges and consultations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, especially for normal exchanges between SEF and ARATS.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang also said that he regretted that mainland
scholars who had agreed to attend the seminar were absent. He urged
the mainland not to refuse scholarly exchanges between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>NTU, which sponsored the seminar, contacted Beijing University a
full year ago in regards to the event, which several mainland
scholars had agreed to attend.</P>
      <P>The scholars submitted several papers and were preparing to

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian pig farmers can now breed a
better class of swine for export to Asia and elsewhere after an
Australian scientist made a major breakthrough in the development of
a new insemination technique.</P>
      <P>Professor Ranald Cameron of the University of Queensland said the
embryo-freezing process would allow pig breeders to get around
Australia's tough quarantine laws and compete with Canadian pig
breeders.</P>
      <P>He said the process would provide a boon for Australian pork
producers who would be able to grow the redder, more marbled meat
that appeals to Asian tastes.</P>
      <P>"Australia urgently needs a fresh gene pool to compete with the
high meat quality and large litter producing strains in America and
Europe," Cameron told reporters.</P>
      <P>"Because of quarantine regulations in Australia, we can't import
genetic materials other than by frozen embryos, so this will open up
the whole field as far as introducing new genetic material into the
Australian industry," he said.</P>
      <P>Australian pork producers have been calling for more trade
protection from the federal government, claiming the market is being
swamped by cheaper Canadian imports. Australia's producers have said
they are struggling to survive.</P>

Committee (IOC) make an inquiry into a claim that Sydney spent
millions of dollars to buy votes to secure the right to host the 2000
Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>The demand was made by Phil Coles, an Australian delegate on the

Lausanne, Switzerland, on Sunday that Sydney (2000), Atlanta (1996),
Nagano (1998) and Salt Lake City (2002) were involved in the offering
of bribes to win the rights to serve as host sites to the Olympic

    <TEXT>
      <P>The average age of a person in Taiwan
infected with AIDS is falling, and the Republic of China's Department
of Health (DOH) has indicated that adolescent sexual relations is the
cause of most youngsters' infections.</P>
      <P>AIDS education will therefore be targeted at youngsters, said DOH
officials. In line with the World Health Organization's international
AIDS day promotional campaign, the DOH will launch a series of
activities to better educate young people about AIDS.</P>
      <P>Under the initiative, medical experts, government officials,
public figures and movie stars will be invited to speak out on behalf
of AIDS prevention, DOH officials said at a press conference Monday.</P>
      <P>The young are the country's future and Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome has no cure, said the wife of ROC Premier Vincent Siew, Chu
Shu-hsien, who was invited to attend the conference. She noted that
every day 7,000 youngsters aged between 10 and 14 are reportedly
infected with the AIDS virus.</P>
      <P>She said the best means of preventing infection was to make
youngsters aware of safe sexual behaviors.</P>
      <P>From 1984 when Taiwan's first AIDS case was discovered, 2,131
people have identified as being infected with AIDS. Of that number
1,908 were ROC nationals, most of whom were older than 13, said DOH
Bureau of Communicable Disease Control Director Hsu Kuo-hsiung. Most
of these infections were reportedly related to sexual intercourse,
Hsu added.</P>
      <P>The most effective means of preventing the further spread of AIDS
among youngsters is to teach them of the need to practice safe sex,
he said.</P>
      <P>Hsu also called for everyone in society to help young people in
the fight against AIDS.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WEI JINGSHENG HERALDS 'DOCTRINE OF NEW TAIWANESE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Dec.  13  (CNA)
(By M.J. Tzou and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wei Jingsheng, mainland China's most
prominent dissident, said on Sunday that the "concept of a new Taiwan
people" espoused recently by Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui, is a doctrine full of political wisdom.</P>
      <P>Wei, who is currently visiting France, said the Kuomintang
demonstrated commendable political wisdom during the "three-in-one"
elections held in Taiwan on Dec. 5, retaining its status as Taiwan's
ruling party and regaining political ground lost over the past
several years.</P>
      <P>President Lee is particularly praiseworthy for his timely
espousal of the "concept of a new Taiwan people" or the "doctrine of
the New Taiwanese" before the elections, Wei told CNA.</P>
      <P>Lee's latest doctrine, which calls for a sense of esprit de corps
among all the Chinese people who have settled in Taiwan -- however
recently or long ago -- has helped erase ethnic rifts and create a
harmonious atmosphere among the Taiwanese people, Wei pointed out.</P>
      <P>Wei rejected suggestions that the doctrine would promote Taiwan
independence, which will in turn affect the reunification of the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait. He said the sovereignty of Taiwan resides
with all the people in Taiwan, just as the fate of mainland China is
held in the hands of all mainland Chinese people.</P>
      <P>Wei said he did not think reunification should be the ultimate
goal of mainland China. He said happiness and good living are what
the Taiwanese and, in fact, all Chinese are striving for.</P>
      <P>The "new Taiwanese" concept cannot hamper efforts to reunify
China, he added, noting that there had been no trouble when people in
the mainland referred to the "new Shanghai people" or the "new
Beijingese."</P>
      <P>It has been rumored since January 1998 that Wei would visit
Taiwan, and he said he will likely pay a visit in early 1999.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Taiwan, Wei said, he will have two messages to
people in Taiwan. One is that while emphasizing they are "new
Taiwanese," the Taiwan people need not stress that they are not
"Chinese." By saying they are not Chinese, the people of Taiwan
people would disappoint people in mainland China, and such a
pronouncement could have disastrous consequences, he warned.</P>
      <P>Another message, he said, is that while Taiwan independence may
be the right of the Taiwan people and something that would be
supported by Chinese democracy activists overseas, it is not and will
never be acceptable to the authorities in mainland China.</P>
      <P>For the moment, Wei said, he suggests that people in Taiwan help
with democracy activities in mainland China so as to help accelerate
democratic development there.</P>
      <P>Wei, a former Nobel Peace Prize nominee, is visiting Paris,
mainly for activities marking the 50th anniversary of the United
Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>Wei on Sunday joined groups calling for the formation of an Asian
human rights alliance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CBC LEAVES MARKET TO DECIDE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) would only
intervene in currency markets if the New Taiwan dollar was affected
by seasonal factors or short-term fluctuations or if rumors of
irrational expectations continue hanging around the market, said CBC
Chairman Perng Fai-nan on Monday.</P>
      <P>Perng made the remarks at a joint meeting of the Legislative
Yuan's budgetary, financial, diplomatic and judicial affairs
committees screening the CBC budget for the next fiscal year.</P>
      <P>In response to questioning by a legislator of the opposition New
Party, Perng said Taiwan has a small-sized developing economy that is
easily affected by other economies.</P>
      <P>The fact that many people rushed to exchange New Taiwan dollars
for foreign currencies in June amid the region's financial crisis
best illustrates how influence-prone Taiwan's economy is and the
irrational expectations of the people, he said.</P>
      <P>There is therefore a need for the CBC to intervene to moderate
fluctuations, Perng added.</P>
      <P>Perng said such moves are in line with international practices,
pointing out that the United States, Japan and other Group of Seven
countries have enacted similar controls on currency exchange rates.</P>
      <P>He reiterated the importance on keeping the New Taiwan dollar
stable, but he agreed to leave foreign exchange rates to the market.</P>
      <P>A lawmaker from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
questioned the CBC, saying that interest rate reductions in the
second half of the year were aimed at helping Kuomintang candidates
in the island's "three-in-one" elections on Dec. 5.</P>
      <P>Perng answered that the CBC would decide to cut the interest
rates to stimulate the economy according to the principles of stable
prices and exchange rates and that such decisions are not influenced
by political factors.</P>
      <P>He said the CBC was under strong pressure to cut interest rates
last June, but it did not do so, because the foreign exchange markets
were still vibrant at that point. This shows the central bank's
neutrality when it comes to politics, he stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUNGARY HOPES TO DEVELOP SUBSTANTIAL RELATIONS WITH ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hungary is positive of the economic clout
of the Republic of China and would like to develop substantial
relations between the two countries, ROC Representative to Hungary
Rock Leng said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Leng said Hungary is impressed with the ROC's economic
development over the past five decades and its economic strength amid
Asia's financial crisis over the past two years, which he said will
be conducive to the strengthening of bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Reporting to the joint Foreign and Overseas Affairs Committees in
the Legislative Yuan, Leng also said that Hungary has set the joining
of the European Union (EU) as its top foreign policy priority. This
has hampered the development of ties with the Republic of China
because its laws, regulations and policies will have to be in
accordance with those of the EU.</P>
      <P>But Leng said that Hungary would consider strengthening
substantial relations between the two nations so long as such
exchanges will not violate its "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>On whether it is possible to promote high-level visits, such as
ones involving presidents, vice presidents or ministerial-level
officials, between the two nations, Leng said that the possibility of
high-level exchanges is there so long as such visits do not violate
Hungary's "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Leng also reported that Hungary has criticized mainland China's
human rights record on occasion, but it has been unwilling to
confront the mainland on other issues.</P>
      <P>In view of the mainland's status as a regional power, and because
of the trade opportunities it affords, Hungary has believed that it
should maintain normal and positive relations with the mainland, Leng
said.</P>
      <P>But Hungary hopes Taiwan will invest in its manufacturing
industry and has chosen automobile parts and electronic parts as the
areas targeted for bilateral cooperation.</P>
      <P>Leng also said that Hungary is scheduled to join the EU in 2002,
which means that it will enjoy preferential treatment when doing
business with EU countries.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Representative Office in Hungary is willing to provide
all assistance to Taiwan businessmen who want to invest in Hungary
and use it as a base to make inroads into the European market.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that two-way trade between Taiwan and Hungary
totaled US$196.3 million in 1997, up 56.3 percent from the same
period the previous year. Taiwan's exports to Hungary totaled
US$135.3 million, while its imports from Hungary totaled US$61
million.</P>
      <P>Leng said that bilateral trade accounted for only a fraction of
the overall trade of the two nations. Hungary, however, has
complained about the trade deficit it is suffering in trade with
Taiwan, while Taiwan has agreed to increase its imports from Hungary
to lessen the imbalance.</P>
      <P>He also said that Hungary has changed its attitude toward
bilateral trade after Taiwan increased its imports from Hungary
twofold last year, especially since Hungary's exports to Taiwan were
three times the amount of its exports to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Leng said that Hungary hopes especially that Taiwan businessmen
will invest in its manufacturing industry, noting that there are 15
Taiwan businessmen investing in Hungary, mainly in the import of
consumer goods and in computer sales. But so far no Taiwan businesses
have invested in its manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Leng also said that there is
"ample room for development" between the Republic of China and the
former Yugoslavian republic of Slovenia.</P>
      <P>He noted that a Double Ten party was held in Ljubljana, the
capital of Slovenia, to mark the ROC's national day, Oct. 10, this
year. Many Slovenian parliamentarians and academics were invited to
the party, he said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Representative Office in Hungary also covers Romania,
Bulgaria and the five former Yugoslavian republics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPANESE LAWYERS GATHER FIRST-HAND INFO ON WARTIME SEX SLAVES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An eight-member group of lawyers from Japan
arrived in Taipei on Monday to gather first-hand information from
former Taiwan comfort women in an effort to collect a larger
compensation from the Japanese government.</P>
      <P>The Japanese members, all of whom are working voluntarily, are
here to collect relevant data which will be used in lawsuits against
the Japanese government next spring, said Attorney Yukiko Shimizu,
leader of the mission.</P>
      <P>Wang Ching-feng, leader of a consortium of lawyers representing
the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation (TWRF), said the Japanese
mission's visit here will help accelerate efforts in seeking justice
for former comfort women in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang, a 1996 vice presidential election candidate who teamed up
with presidential candidate Chen Li-an, said she and the TWRF group
have visited Japan six times this year to express Taiwan's concerns
in this issue and meet with relevant Japan interest groups to form a
cohesive strategy.</P>
      <P>So far, she said 30 of the 44 surviving comfort women in Taiwan
have contacted the TWRF lawyers, who are also working on a voluntary
basis, to fight for their rights.</P>
      <P>Comfort women are the Japanese euphemism for some 200,000 Asian
women who were forced into working as sex slaves for the imperial
Japanese army during World War II. Many comfort women were from
Taiwan, South Korea and other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government admitted in 1993 that the Japanese army
did recruit comfort women and operated military brothels during
wartime. While some Japanese officials have on several occasions
apologized for such practices, the Japanese government has been
reluctant to offer legal compensation for surviving comfort women.</P>
      <P>Japan set up an Asian Women's Fund in 1995 which offers each
surviving comfort woman 2 million Japanese yen (about US$14,285) in
compensation. However, most surviving comfort women have turned down
the offer because the money does not come from the Japanese
government.</P>
      <P>Other members of the Japanese mission also include Kunio Aitani,
a lawyer and a senior official with the National Lawyers' Association
of Japan; four other lawyers; Yoshiaki Yoshimi, a history professor
with Chuou (Central) University of Japan who is also the author of a
book about wartime comfort women; and Yoko Shiba, a social worker who
has spent years on the comfort women issue.</P>
      <P>During their four-day stay, the Japanese delegation will meet all
30 comfort women individually in meetings to be held in northern,
southern and eastern Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An additional 81 patients with the AIDS
virus were reported in Taiwan from October to November, bringing the
total number of AIDS patients in the island to 2,131, the
Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) announced on Monday.</P>
      <P>Of the 81 recent cases, 76 are ROC nationals while five are
foreigners, according to the DOH. Seventy-five of the carriers are
male and the remaining six are female. Twenty carriers contracted the
virus through heterosexual activities while 17 and five contracted
the virus through homosexual and bisexual activities respectively.
The other 39 people contracted the disease through other means.</P>
      <P>The AIDS virus appears to be spreading among the younger
population with 251 of the total 1,908 Taiwan nationals diagnosed
with AIDS aged between 10 and 24 years old, the DOH's Bureau of
Communicable Disease Control said.</P>
      <P>It added that of the 251 young AIDS patients, 81 are
heterosexual, while 131 are male homosexuals and 41 are male
bisexuals. The other 116 cases involve hemophiliacs, drug users, and
those infected through injections.</P>
      <P>Of the 1,908 infected patients, 692 have shown symptoms of the
disease and have fallen sick. AIDS stands for acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. It involves the attack of the victim's immune
system by a virus which leaves the victim susceptible to a variety of
infections and cancers.</P>
      <P>The DOH reported a total of 349 new AIDS cases in the first 11
months of this year, up 13 percent from the same period last year.
There were an average of 29 new cases reported each month.</P>
      <P>Among the young AIDS patients, about 70 percent contracted the
disease through sexual activity, the bureau said, adding that the DOH
has stepped up efforts to promote safe sex among youths to counter
the fatal disease.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, about 50 percent of sexually active
youths do not use condoms when having sex with their partners for the
first time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT SHIPPING MEETING SLATED FOR JANUARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China have tentatively
agreed to hold a fourth cross-strait shipping meeting early next
year, the ROC Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC)
said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hung-lie, secretary-general of the Taiwan Strait Shipping
Association (TSSA), said the meeting may be held next month in Hong
Kong but the actual date and meeting venue are still under
negotiation between the TSSA and its mainland Chinese counterpart --
the Association for Shipping Across the Taiwan Strait (ASATS).</P>
      <P>The TSSA and ASATS held the third cross-strait shipping meeting
in January this year in Bangkok. The two sides agreed to exchange
indirect cross-strait shipping services through a third area or
country between Taiwan's southern Kaohsiung port -- Taiwan's offshore
transshipment center -- and Fuzhou and Xiamen ports in mainland
China's Fujian province.</P>
      <P>Wu Jung-kuei, head of the MOTC's Navigation and Aviation
Department, said the planned meeting will focus on opening more ports
on both sides to conduct conditional direct shipping services across
the Taiwan Strait. Wu added that he may attend the meeting as a TSSA
advisor.</P>
      <P>As current cross-strait shipping volumes remain low because of
the small handling capabilities of Fuzhou and Xiamen, Wu expressed
the hope that the mainland will allow larger ports such as Shanghai
and Guangzhou to exchange shipping ties with Taiwan, while Taiwan
will open its central Taichung port in response.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Share prices fell on the Taipei stock
market on Monday despite the government's earlier declaration that it
would take every effort to support the market.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Stock Exchange's (TAIEX) weighted price index, the
market's key barometer, dropped 50.24 points to close at 6,889.5.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Paul Chu conveyed a task force meeting on Monday
morning, aimed at formulating strategies to pump up stock buying.</P>
      <P>However, the market failed to respond positively to the effort,
registering a 0.7 percent loss.</P>
      <P>Chu said the drop in Taipei was smaller than a 1.7 percent plunge
in Hong Kong's stock market in Monday's session, a 1.1 percent loss
in Japan, and a 1.71 percent drop in Thailand.</P>
      <P>Compared with the region's stock trading, Chu stressed, Taiwan's
share prices were relatively stable with the support of the
government stock-stabilization fund.</P>
      <P>The fund, established on Dec. 12 to shore up share prices against
the expected impact of the Dec. 5 elections, will continue acting as
a stock stabilizer, the minister said. He added that Taiwan enjoys
more sound economic fundamentals than other Asian markets, calling on
investors to keep their confidence in the Taipei market.</P>
      <P>The Taipei bourse opened higher at 6,985.87 on Monday. It then
saw drops as investors stayed on the sidelines with weak confidence
following the index's slump to put it past the 6,900-psychological
mark.</P>
      <P>In all, 1.42 billion issues changed hands while the turnover of
the market shrank to NT$50.66 billion (US$1.57 billion), against the
previous session's NT$64.97 billion.</P>
      <P>Electronic engineering stocks posted the largest drop of 1.5
percent followed by construction shares which plunged 1.1 percent;
foodstuff issues, 0.7 percent; banking shares, 0.6 percent; and
textile issues, 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Plastic and chemical shares enjoyed the only gain of 0.8 percent
among the eight major stock categories, while both cement stocks and
paper-making issues remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, trading on Taipei's stock index futures was mixed.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Capitalization Weighted Stock Index Futures (TAIEX Index
Futures) for December posted a modest decline of six points, closing
at 6,959, with 1,576 contract transactions.</P>
      <P>The TAIEX Index Futures for January moved up 11 points to close
at 7,062, with 1,524 transactions, while those for March declined 41
points to 7,041 with 74 contract transactions.</P>
      <P>No trading was registered for June and September.</P>
      <P>Reference levels provided by the Taiwan International Mercantile

    <HEADLINE>EXPECTED WAVE OF ASIAN TAKEOVERS FIZZLES OUT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Predictions that western multinationals
were going to pick up some bargain assets during the Asian financial
crisis this year have fallen short of expectations, The Business
Times reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>The total volume of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) for 1998 is
significantly lower than in 1997. Latest figures from Securities Data
Company, a New Jersey-based company whose data is widely used by
banks, put the value of deals up to Oct. 25 at US$49 billion in
Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan, Australia and New Zealand.</P>
      <P>However, there has been a spurt of activity since October.
Estimates by Morgan Stanley Asia, a leading bank in M&amp;A, showed that
the year is likely to finish off with about US$60 billion worth of
deals, down a fifth from 1997.</P>
      <P>Bankers and management consultants interviewed by The Business
Times all agreed the pace of M&amp;As this year has been disappointing. A
record 1997 had buoyed expectations early this year and many
investment banks and accounting firms had diverted resources into the
business. But thus far, the hype has exceeded the reality.</P>
      <P>The most active target countries for M&amp;A deals are Japan, South
Korea and Thailand. Bankers noted that there have been more
transactions announced in South Korea than actually completed. This
is the same for Indonesia where none of the major bank mergers
announced early in the year have come to fruition except for the
interest consolidation of the Bank Bali group.</P>
      <P>The fall-off in transactions is not for a want of buyers. Indeed,
soon after the economies of Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia
tanked last year, many multinational companies rushed into Asia with
their check books.</P>
      <P>There are two reasons often cited in explaining why deals are not
getting done. One is the huge gap that still exists between sellers'
asking price and what buyers are prepared to pay; and two, the slow
progress in debt restructuring across Asia.</P>

      <P>Mainland Chinese authorities detained him on Nov. 2 soon after
he met with another dissident Wang You-cai. Li Li, a mainland
dissident from France, was also arrested at that time.</P>
      <P>The information center said that mainland Chinese authorities
used to expel the dissidents who had sneaked back to the country,
but this time they chose to arrest Wang and Li. It is possible
that the authorities did this to warn overseas dissidents not to
sneak back to the country to make trouble, it added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang has selected Su
Nan-cheng as the party's candidate for National Assembly speaker and
Chen Ching-jang as deputy speaker, party Secretary-General John Chang
said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The decision will be submitted on Wednesday to the KMT's
policy-making body, the Standing Central Committee, for approval in a
move seen as a formality, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>Both Su and Chen are currently National Assembly deputies. If
elected, they will replace outgoing Speaker Fredrick Chien, who has
been designed as the new Control Yuan president, and Deputy Speaker
Hsieh Lung-sheng who has fallen sick and has been confined to bed for
a long time.</P>
      <P>Chien is expected to offered his resignation on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>To ensure that the party's nominees will cruise through the floor
of the assembly, the KMT will mobilize its deputies to support Su and
Chen after their nominations are formally presented, said a party
official.</P>
      <P>Although the opposition Democratic Progressive Party countering
the KMT's decision by announcing that it will put forward its own
candidates before the year end and another opposition the New Party
saying that the deputy speaker would be better to be an opposition,
the passage of the KMT's nominees is almost certain given the
party enjoying a majority of 183 seats in the 334-seat assembly.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile the three parties at the assembly have decided through
negotiations on Monday to cast ballots for speaker and deputy speaker
on Jan. 13.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SWEDISH GIRL ARRIVES IN TAINAN TO SEEK HER BIOLOGICAL MOTHER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan, southern Taiwan, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An ethnic Chinese girl who
was born in Taiwan and taken to Sweden by a missionary couple 22
years ago, arrived in Tainan city on Monday in a bid to find her
biological mother.</P>
      <P>Hanna Andersson said she hoped her biological mother, who is
probably still living in Tainan, will take the initiative and try to
communicate with her.</P>
      <P>Shortly after her arrival, Andersson distributed copies of her
baby photos in downtown Tainan and marketplaces to publicize her
cause.</P>
      <P>The police have also posted the photographs at each of their
branches with the hope that people who knew Andersson or her mother
would come forward with details.</P>
      <P>Based on information from the missionary, Andersson said she was
born between March and June of 1976. She said in a news conference in
Taipei last Wednesday that she was told she was born out of wedlock
to a 16-year-old girl from Tainan.</P>
      <P>Her mother was taken to the northern Taiwan city of Hsinchu to
give birth and a midwife reportedly sold the newborn to a Swedish
missionary couple. The baby later was taken to Sweden and given to
the Andersson family for adoption.</P>
      <P>Prior to going to Tainan, Andersson, who has been in Taiwan since
October, sent a sample of her DNA to the National Police
Administration (NPA) along with that of Tseng Lee Jung-mei, the woman
who is named as Andersson's birth mother in her adoption papers.</P>
      <P>It will take several days for the NPA to complete the DNA
comparison.</P>
      <P>It is the third such case where a Taiwan-born girl who was sold
then adopted by an overseas family has returned to the island in
search for her birth mother. Kartya Wunderle and Eimee Butler, both
ethnic Chinese living in Australia, came to the island separately to
find their birth mothers. Both were successful.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MUST KEEP WATCHFUL EYE ON REGIONAL ECONOMIC CRISIS: CBC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan has been the least affected
economy amid the Asian crisis, it should avoid complacency and keep a
watchful eye on the storm, said Perng Fai-nan, governor of the
Central Bank of China (CBC) on Monday.</P>
      <P>In an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan, Perng said
Taiwan's steady economical expansion -- marked by its sizable current
account surplus, which reflects increasing debts owed by other
countries to the island -- is more than its Southeast Asian neighbors
can hope to match.</P>
      <P>A series of defaults by some high-profile listed companies which
sent shock waves through the island's financial markets last month
stemmed from isolated failed speculation which reminded the CBC the
need to tighten its financial inspection of listed companies, Perng
noted.</P>
      <P>The governor acknowledged the attraction of financial
liberalization, but since a Washington-led campaign promoting open
markets in Asia was seen as a cause behind the Asian financial
crisis, there is no question of a hands-off approach by the CBC "when
the market overreacts to an extreme extent," Perng said.</P>
      <P>Arguing that central banks routinely intervene in the United
States and Japan, Perng emphasized the questions of when and to what
extent the government should step in.</P>
      <P>He dismissed the problem of capital exodus, pointing out that
Taiwan holds foreign assets totaling over US$160 billion, including
US$90 billion in the government and US$70 billion in the private
sector.</P>
      <P>Most of these private sector's funds are invested in mainland
China and Southeast Asian countries, while some have been funneled
into the real estate markets in the United States, said Perng.</P>
      <P>As to the coming launch of the single European currency, the
euro, Perng said the central bank is weighing the possibility of
converting part of the country's foreign reserves into euro, but he
did not believe it will acquire a status equal to that of the
greenback because of the relatively small share it has in the world's
foreign reserves mix.</P>
      <P>Perng made the remarks in defense of the CBC's NT$60.64 billion
(US$1.86 billion) budget for fiscal year 1999 which cruised through
the joint review of several committees on Monday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEE PLEDGES EFFORTS TO EXPAND TRADE TIES WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 14 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said the Republic of
China will make three-pronged efforts to expand its trade and
economic relations with foreign countries.</P>
      <P>"We will aggressively seek to take part in international
organizations, to increase exchanges and cooperation with foreign
countries and to make contributions to the international community,"
Lee told a dinner party in honor of some 160 foreign ambassadors and
representatives stationed in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lee also called on foreign countries to throw their support
behind Taiwan's membership in the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>He urged all countries and international organizations concerned
to adopt effective measures to help weather the financial turmoil
that has battered countries beyond Asia, including Latin America and
Russia.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang, who hosted the party at the
Taipei Convention Center, thanked the foreign envoys for their
support of Taiwan over the past year in the trade and economic arena.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan attended 21 regular governmental or
non-governmental economic conferences with 21 countries, and struck
strategic alliance relationships with over 60 leading international
companies.</P>
      <P>Wang said the Asian financial crisis will also serve as a turning
point for the world to reform its existing economic and trading
systems. He added that Taiwan hopes to enhance its cooperation with
other countries so as to jointly create greater prosperity.</P>
      <P>Citing President Lee's comments made at a charity fund-raising
event on Nov. 24, Wang said, "Love is borderless as long as we keep
the world in our heart."</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan will spare no effort to strengthen its ties
with all countries to make the world better.</P>
      <P>At the end of the party, Wang presented his guests with a crystal
rabbit, an animal symbolizing swiftness, wisdom and optimism on the
Chinese lunar calendar. The coming lunar new year in 1999 is the year
of the rabbit.

    <HEADLINE>THOUSANDS FLOCK TO EXHIBITION OF ITEMS THOUGHT TO BE MADAME CHIANG'S</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By David Wang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thousands of people, most of them
Chinese, flocked to New York's Long Island last Sunday to view an
exhibition of furniture and other household items in a residence once
occupied by Madame Chiang Kai-shek, even though the objects on
display had no connection with either Madame Chiang or the Republic
of China government.</P>
      <P>Some 4,000 people converged on the house, located on a 27-acre
plot of land, in Long Island's Locust Valley. Protests from neighbors
resulted in the pre-auction exhibition being wrapped up earlier than
scheduled, as police tried in vain to clear clogged roads and
maintain order. In all more than 20 police cars and helicopters were
called in try to direct traffic.</P>
      <P>The items, which are to be auctioned on Jan. 2-3 by Braswell
Auction Company of New York, belong to the house's present owner, who
bought the property from Madame Chiang's niece last year and who has
put the house up for sale.</P>
      <P>The sponsors of the exhibition were asked to call a halt to the
activity, which was scheduled for Saturday through Monday.</P>
      <P>An admission fee was charged on the exhibition's first day, in
which about 400 people showed up. On Sunday admission was free and
the number of visitors swelled tenfold.</P>
      <P>Some of the people who visited the residence drove for five or
six hours to see the exhibition, motivated mainly by their interest
in Madame Chiang, who played an important role in the Republic of
China's history during and after World War II.</P>
      <P>But Kung Ling-yih, Madame Chiang's niece, sold the house last
summer for a sum believed to be slightly less than US$3 million.
After the sale, all of Madame Chiang's belongings were removed from
the house.</P>
      <P>The house has been put on the market by its owner, who expects to
sell it for more than US$6 million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT WRAPS UP 'LOVE' TRIP TO 4 CENTRAL AMERICAN ALLIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan said on Tuesday
that his visit to four Central American nations has expressed the
love and concern felt for them by the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks in a press conference after returning from
a 10-day visit of the four Republic of China allies hard hit by
Hurricane Mitch recently.</P>
      <P>Lien led on a visit to the four nations a delegation, which left
on Dec. 5, to express the ROC's love and concern for them and to
submit substantial plans to help them rebuild after the ravages of
the hurricane.</P>
      <P>Lien said the visit by the delegation is significant in that it
included charity, religious and industrial groups. The visit not only
conveyed the concern of the ROC government but also showed the love
of the ROC people toward its allies.</P>
      <P>During his visit to Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and
Guatemala over the last 10 days, Lien observed that the level of
damage varied from country to country, he said.</P>
      <P>Lien added that it is hard to comprehend the degree of damage,
the death toll and the number of people injured in the two most
seriously hit countries, Nicaragua and Honduras.</P>
      <P>Lien said that after the hurricane, droves of countries came to
the rescue of the four nations, but the wave has since subsided. The
visit by the ROC delegation was warmly welcomed by the four Central
American allies.</P>
      <P>The vice president is also positive of enthusiastic responses
from private groups called on to participate in the relief efforts,
adding that "love knows no boundary, and the heart of Taiwan goes
toward the world."</P>
      <P>Lien said that his visit to Central America also reflects
President Lee Teng-hui's idea of people diplomacy.</P>
      <P>He said that a nation of love will not be alone, and a nation of
love will not be isolated, noting that even the US government has
lauded the Republic of China as a country that exports love, adding
that he was proud of the nation and its people.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, Lien was again asked if he intends to
run for president in 2000.</P>
      <P>Lien, considered an heir apparent to President Lee Teng-hui,
would not answer the question directly, saying only that the most
important thing now is to "talk less and do more," adding that the
time is "not yet ripe" to announce anything on the matter.</P>
      <P>As to why the ROC government did not do more to provide relief to
flood victims in mainland China, Lien stressed that private groups
from Taiwan have more than once traveled to the mainland to assist in
relief efforts in the past. The ROC government itself could not get
involved directly in relief efforts because of political concerns, he
said.</P>
      <P>The aid to Central America was purely out of humanitarian, not
pragmatic, concern, Lien said in response to suggestions that
diplomacy has taken precedence over cross-strait relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S DEMOCRACY HAS MATURED: US SCHOLARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington  D.C.,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Angel Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's recent "three-in-one"
elections shows that its democracy has matured, said Stephen Yates
and Robert Sutter, two US experts on Chinese affairs, on Monday.</P>
      <P>Yates, a senior policy analyst with the Heritage Foundation, a US
think-tank, said at a round-table discussion held by the foundation
that the US government is likely to make a statement in support of
Taiwan's participation in international organizations during the next
Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) review, which is an annual event.</P>
      <P>The US government's attitude toward the Taiwan question is still
that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should solve their disputes
through "peaceful means," said Yates. Democracy is gaining in
significance in discussions about the Taiwan question, which
indicates that the will of the Taiwan people will be respected to a
greater extent, he said.</P>
      <P>But the US government's conservative attitude toward changing the
TRA suggests a supplement, rather than an amendment, will be added to
it, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sutter, a senior researcher at the United States'
Library of Congress, said the US administration has "shaved" its
relations with Taiwan during the past 30 years in order to establish
cordial ties with mainland China. But Taiwan's democratic development
will make it harder for the US government to maintain this policy, he
said.</P>
      <P>Sutter called on Taiwan to be a "responsible" democracy and to
work to prevent large-scale military conflicts. Taiwan must not
provoke any military attacks from the mainland, he said, adding that
a responsible Taiwan is the precondition for stable US-ROC relations.</P>
      <P>Both men commented on the "new Taiwanese" concept espoused
recently by ROC President Lee Teng-hui. Yates said the idea reflects
the maturation of the Taiwan people's sense of self-identity, though
he said the issue should not be over emphasized so as not to annoy
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Sutter added that while the "new Taiwanese concept" is widely
supported in Taiwan, the New Party's advocacy of unification is
"dead." Although this does not amount to a push for Taiwan
independence, it does show increased support for the separatism of
Taiwan from mainland China, Sutter said.</P>
      <P>Concerning a re-election bid by President Lee, Sutter noted that
several people, including officials within the ruling Kuomintang,
consider such a move possible, especially if it appears the surest
means of preventing a victory by the most likely candidate of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party, Chen Shui-bian. Both Sutter
and Yates, however, said that there is less than a 10-percent chance
Lee will run again.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA STRUGGLES AS GLOBAL PRICES CRASHING (1)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  15 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is struggling after the crash
of global commodities prices to 21-year lows last weekend and the
country's exporters, particularly exporters of coal, oil, nickel and
copper, are growing increasingly worried in the face of shrinking
sales and plunging profits.</P>
      <P>Industry analysts said Australia's coal exporters are expected to
substantially reduce export volumes, as some of their main markets,
such as Japan, are in recession.</P>
      <P>To make matters worse, the prices of crude oil, copper, nickel
and aluminum have also dropped, which has further impacted
Australia's economy.</P>
      <P>Precious metal prices are also softer, cotton prices have crashed
to five-year lows and grain markets have retreated as well -- pushing
all commodities-listed company prices lower on the Australian stock
market.</P>
      <P>Two major coal producers -- Shell Australia and MIM Holdings Ltd.
-- have been forced to reduce the price of their coking coal by as
much as 18 percent to win contracts from Japanese steel mills after a
series of hard-fought negotiations between Australian exporters and
Japanese buyers.</P>
      <P>They said other major coal companies, including BHP Coal Ltd.,
will have to follow the lead of Shell and MIM and substantially
reduce the prices of their coking coal to win Japanese orders.</P>
      <P>The 18 percent drop is expected to cost Australia about US$1.3
billion in export revenue, and it could even force some mines to shut
down, analysts said. Shell and MIM have agreed to lower their coking
coal prices by US$5.60 a ton to US$25.60 per ton, they said.</P>
      <P>The report of a sharp cut in coal prices on Monday affected
Australia's financial and securities markets, driving the All
Ordinaries Index down 53.5 points on Monday to close at 2,676.5.</P>
      <P>The Australian currency also ended lower, dropping 0.23 US cents
to close at 61.85 US cents during the same period.</P>
      <P>The Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union on Sunday night
launched a two-day strike in order to pressure the government to
intervene to demand that coal mining firms secure contracts before
developing new mines or expanding existing ones so that production
will not greatly exceed demand.</P>
      <P>The union has claimed that there is an excess of 20 million tons
in Australia's coal production. This has driven down prices in
international markets and could cost jobs, they said.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Australian Workplace Relations Minister Peter
Reith has condemned the strike, saying it has not only resulted in a
production stoppage but has also hurt Australia's image as a reliable
supplier of coal and other energy products.</P>
      <P>"All they are doing is threatening our reputation as a reliable
supplier, and they are putting in jeopardy their members' jobs," he
said.

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian Coal Association said the market outlook in the
traditional market in Asia is very tough because the Japanese steel
industry is still depressed.</P>
      <P>Coal is Australia's important export earner and Japan is its
largest market, followed by Taiwan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Australian iron ore producers and thermal coal producers will
also face a similar fate and encounter difficult negotiations with
Japanese steel mills and power utilities this week, analysts
predicted.</P>
      <P>Japan's coal imports from Australia are expected to drop by as
much as 30 percent because its steel production is set to fall to 92
million from 102 million tons next year.</P>
      <P>Demand for Australian coal from other countries, including Taiwan
and Korea, is expected to drop because their economic growth rates
are slowing as a result of the impact from the Asian financial
crisis.</P>
      <P>Crude steel production in the West in October also fell nearly 7
percent year-on-year, the biggest monthly decline since January 1987,
analysts said.</P>
      <P>This has made it a tough environment for any suppliers of raw
materials to the steel industry. These include the iron ore
suppliers, which are lined up for discussions with Japanese steel
mills, they said.</P>
      <P>Gold prices also fell, though the fall was not much smaller than
those of most other commodities. Australia is the world's
third-largest gold producer and exporter with an annual production of
about 300 tons.</P>
      <P>Analysts believe commodity prices could fall still further
because of no apparent supply adjustment as Japan and other major
Asian countries are set to reduce production of their steel and other
industrial products in response to weakening demand.</P>
      <P>Oil prices are also on a downward trend due to slackening demand
and the inability by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to reduce daily production in order to rein in prices,
analysts said.</P>
      <P>So far cotton prices have dropped by nearly one-fourth over the
past five months, and they are now at their lowest levels in five
years. This does not bode well for Australia's struggling wool
industry, they said.</P>
      <P>In the United States, orders for aluminum sheets and plates in
October were down a year-on-year 16 percent. Total orders from the
United States for mill products were down 6 percent, analysts said.</P>
      <P>The base-metal markets have fared poorly as well, as copper
prices have fallen to their lowest levels since May 1987, while
nickel is at its lowest level in nearly 12 years. Aluminum,
meanwhile, is at its lowest level since February 1994, they said.</P>
      <P>"The past two months have brought a considerable deterioration in
the orders for copper and aluminum products in Europe and the USA,"
said commodity analysts.</P>
      <P>Commodities sales account for about 60 percent of Australia's
overall exports, so lower commodity prices and slackening demand
could affect the country's economy, they said.</P>
      <P>"Australia is entering a difficult time now and it will be a long
way for us to substantially reduce dependence on commodities," one
analyst said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-TAIWAN STRAIT TUNNEL 30 YEARS AWAY: MAINLAND EXPERTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  15  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Disregarding political and economic
factors, a tunnel linking Taiwan and mainland China could be built in
30 years, the Hong Kong-based Wen Wei Po daily quoted mainland
experts as saying on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a purely construction point of view, it would take about 30
years to build the tunnel if the governments and private sectors on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait work together, the pro-Beijing daily
quoted Professor Fang Hueijian and Professor Wu Zhiming as saying.
The professors are part of a mainland Chinese academic group studying
the feasibility of a cross-Taiwan Strait undersea tunnel.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that Qinghua University of Beijing and National
Taiwan University will collaborate to jointly study the development
of an undersea tunnel, the Wen Wei Po article said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is separated from the Chinese mainland by the Taiwan
Strait which is about 220 kilometers at its widest point and 130
kilometers at its narrowest.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, mainland Chinese experts have identified four
possible routes that a cross-strait tunnel can be built. One links
Fujian province's Pingtan and Taiwan's Hsinchu, the second links
Fujian's Nanri and Taiwan's Miaoli, the third links Fujian's Jinjiang
and Taiwan's Nantou, and the fourth links Taiwan's front-line Kinmen
Island, which is located off mainland China's Fujian province, and
Taiwan's Chiayi.</P>
      <P>The linking or starting points across the strait were chosen in
consideration of their geographical and geological characteristics,
as well as their transportation and economic functions.</P>
      <P>Wu said he personally favors the first route which he described
as the most feasible and cost-efficient to build.</P>
      <P>If planning were to begin today, it would take about 16 years for
the first-stage of research and designing work to be completed, and
another 16 years will be required for the actual construction and
trial, Wu said. It would mean that cars could be expected to drive
across the Taiwan Strait by 2030, according to the report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING FEARS DEMOCRACY INFECTION FROM TAIWAN: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei may worry about an unlikely mainland
Chinese invasion, but the old men in Beijing have far more to fear
from the democratic virus drifting across the Taiwan Strait, a major
Canadian newspaper commented Monday.</P>
      <P>The Globe and Mail was commenting on Taiwan's latest elections,
held on Dec. 5, saying the vote was "free and fair, the campaign was
intense and vigorous, and national and international media were
unhindered by state censorship. Just another day in the democratic
China."</P>
      <P>"Or just another day in the China that is democratic: the
Republic of China, otherwise known as Taiwan." The piece, written by
Anthoy Keller, assistant editor of the paper's editorial board,
appeared in The Globe and Mail's "Free Expression" column.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan has had free elections for more than a
decade. "Year after year, Taiwan successfully practices the
democratic politics that China -- or rather mainland China, the
People's Republic -- has always maintained is unsuitable to the
Chinese people," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan registering political parties and sending out political
publications over the Internet is "how you play politics, not how you
end up in jail," he said, referring to Beijing's arrests of Wang
Youcai and Lin Hai.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's democracy is far from perfect, but these imperfections
can be discussed openly in the media, thereby helping to bring about
changes that deepen democracy's foundations, Keller said.</P>
      <P>He quoted the once-vilified Chiang Kai-shek as saying, "The kind
of freedom and way of life that people enjoy on Taiwan have not only
become the object of envy and hope for their compatriots on the
Communist mainland, but more important, the assurance [that] the
great enterprise of anti-Communist national recovery and restoration
shall be realized in the near future."</P>
      <P>Though Chiang was long ago discredited by his critics, yet on
this point about China's future "he was probably right," according to
Keller.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MILITARY SUBSTITUTIVE SERVICE TO BE ENACTED IN 2000</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) has
drafted a substitutive military services plan to address the excess
in manpower that will result from a new streamlined conscription plan
by the Ministry of National Defense (MND).</P>
      <P>The new plan is to be implemented in 2000, ministry officials
said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, those who fail their military physicals, as well
as those who constitute an excess in manpower, may be assigned to
serve under one of four different categories designed by the MOI's
Conscription Department: national defense and construction, social
security, public health and social services.</P>
      <P>Service terms would range from two years to three years.</P>
      <P>Under the streamlined conscription plan of the MND, the MOI and
the MND have agreed to determine by drawing lots who may opt for
substitutive service. A preliminary calculation indicates some 20,000
people may serve in the substitutive services.</P>
      <P>Under the national defense and construction category, a
"technological service" suggested by Academia Sinica will be
included. Due to the difficulty of this type of service, applicants
will be admitted into the program not by random drawing but based on
their qualifications.</P>
      <P>The social security services category comprises service in either
fire or police departments. As this type of service tends to be more
dangerous, the service term would last only two years.</P>
      <P>Those who are unwilling to serve in the military service for
religious reasons may work in the social service sector for a period
of three years. The MOI will draft regulations to ensure that people
do not come to view a stint in this sector as a way of dodging
traditional military service.</P>
      <P>As this plan involves several ministries and departments, the MOI
will therefore establish a special committee to keep track of the
manpower needs of various institutes and handle the substitutive
service assignments for all counties, as well as for the cities of
Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Payment for those in the substitutive service will be on a par
with what those performing conventional military service earn.</P>

    <HEADLINE>70% SAY CAMPAIGN LITERATURE DOESN'T AFFECT VOTE: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 70 percent of respondents in a
recent survey said campaign literature did not affect their decision
of which candidate they would support, the results released on
Tuesday said.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by Shih Hsin University at the
commission of the Quality Life Foundation.</P>
      <P>Chien Hsi-chieh, president of the foundation and an opposition
Democratic Progressive Party legislator, said local elections
typically require astronomical spending by each candidate.</P>
      <P>Such practices have stopped many enthusiastic candidates and
minority groups from taking part in politics, he said.</P>
      <P>To improve the quality of elections, Chien suggested that
legislation be drafted to set a ceiling on campaign literature and
provide equal access to media among the candidates from all parties.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, up to 60 percent of those polled believe
that elections cost a lot of money compared with only 10 percent who
said they do not cost much money.</P>
      <P>Some 41 percent of those polled said candidates must spend a lot
of money if they want to be elected.</P>
      <P>Nearly 70 percent of respondents said campaign literature does
not affect their decision of which candidate they will support. The
ratio of DPP and New Party supporters in this category is much higher
than Kuomintang supporters, according to the poll results.</P>
      <P>Among all the campaign tools, 39.4 percent said they believed
television ads have the greatest impact on voters, while the
influence of flags and banners was less than 2 percent.</P>
      <P>Over 67 percent said the legislature should set a ceiling on the
number of campaign literature a candidate can produce, and the
government should provide equal access of electronic and graphic
media to candidates.</P>
      <P>Regarding the effect of the large quantity of campaign literature
has on the environment, 44.9 percent said the impact was "big." The
effect on the city's landscape and the waste of valuable resources
were ranked 1st and 2nd on the list of bad effects.</P>
      <P>On whether campaign activities have any good effects, 28.1
percent said they can advance democracy while 26.4 percent said they
are beneficial to public understanding of policy and administrative
ideals.</P>
      <P>Poll respondents said the bad effects of campaign activities
included the proliferation of rumors and smear campaigns (35
percent), and the waste of resources (13.1 percent).</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between Dec. 7 and 8, after the Dec. 5
three-in-one elections. It offered questionnaires to 23 counties and
cities across the island and received 1,087 valid responses with a
margin of error of 3 percent.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 15 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The people of Taiwan should be proud of the
love and care the ROC mission conveyed to the four hurricane-hit
Central American countries, Vice President Lien Chan said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks in a news conference at the Taipei Guest
House after returning from a 10-day visit to Guatemala, Honduras,
Nicaragua and El Salvador, which were seriously devastated by
Hurricane Mitch in October.</P>
      <P>Lien, at the head of a delegation composed of ranking government
officials and representatives from private charity and religious
organizations, offered financial aid and presented concrete
reconstruction assistance and projects to the four Central American
countries.</P>
      <P>The ROC mission's donations and assistance were not only warmly
received by hurricane victims, but were also highly praised by the
international community.</P>
      <P>According to Lien, Nicaragua and Honduras were the hardest hit.
The damage and devastation caused by Mitch in the countries'
agriculture, public construction, property and lives of the local
residents were beyond imagination, he noted.</P>
      <P>In Honduras, more than 7,000 people were killed and around 15,000
remain missing. A city mayor lost his life during a damage-control
tour, and the Honduran Education Ministry building was washed away by
torrential rain, Lien continued.</P>
      <P>About 80 percent of the ROC delegates also fell sick after
touring the "land of death" in those four countries, as described by
the international media, Lien noted. Many victims' bodies in some
areas were not yet buried, and everything within eyesight was highly
polluted, he added.</P>
      <P>The "quick and comprehensive" love and care that the ROC
delegation demonstrated has touched many people and their countries,
the ROC vice president claimed, stressing that such an act is without
border and has put to practice the type of "all out push by all
people" toward pragmatic diplomacy President Lee Teng-hui has
advocated.</P>
      <P>"A country with love will never be left alone, and we are very
proud that Taiwan is a 'love export' country," Lien said.</P>
      <P>Speaking of his transit stops in the United States, Lien said he
was well treated and there were no difficulties experienced during
his stay.</P>

from small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will attend a meeting

the financing of troubled companies.</P>
      <P>Several large conglomerates in Taiwan have experienced financial

      <P>The MOEA has planned several measures to help bail out troubled

technology, offering research and development as well as marketing
and accounting, officials noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth is expected to remain above 5 percent in

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About a dozen expatriates, mostly
foreigners working in Taiwan and those with local spouses, took to
the streets on Tuesday to fight for their children's right to reside
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The group, waving banners saying "We love Taiwan," "Our foreign
spouses are new Taiwanese," and "No age restriction on permanent
residence," converged at the Legislative Yuan where they appealed to
lawmakers to not let their children become "international orphans."</P>
      <P>They said Taiwan's restriction against automatic residence to
children of international parents violated the principles of human
rights. They demanded an overall amendment to the Republic of China's
statutes governing immigration and relevant affairs.</P>
      <P>Under existing ROC laws, children of international couples enjoy
no automatic rights of residence in Taiwan and can legally stay in
Taiwan until they are 20. After that age, they become foreigners
illegally staying in Taiwan. Children of ROC-national women who are
married to foreigners are also not entitled to ROC nationality.</P>
      <P>Wang Chu-huei, chairperson of the Taiwan-Japan International
Exchange Promotion Association, said under existing ROC rules, if the
father of children from an international marriage is an ROC national,
the children will receive their ROC citizen identification card by
the age of 10 and are later able to work legally when they are older.</P>
      <P>But children who have mothers of ROC nationality and foreign
fathers are not that lucky, Wang said. They cannot stay after they
are 20, and there is no mention of their legal rights to work in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang said the practice is not only violating international human
rights, it is a form of sexual discrimination as well.</P>
      <P>Wang and others argued that there is no age restriction on
expatriates' application for permanent residence in the United
States, Japan, Canada and Britain. They appealed to the ROC
government to amend relevant immigration statutes which rule that
children of international marriages can apply for permanent residence
in Taiwan only after they are 20.</P>

on Dec. 5, Director General Chen Chien-jen of the Government
Information Office said here Monday.</P>
      <P>Voters went to the polls on that day to elect members of the
Legislative Yuan as well as the mayors and city councilors of Taipei
and Kaohsiung. Voter turnout was about 80 percent. The ruling
Koumintang won an absolute majority in the Legislative Yuan and
continued to be the majority party in the councils of the two cities.</P>
      <P>Chen said the elections have won the applause of opinion leaders
at home and abroad. The results of the elections have indicated that
most voters want stability, progress, prosperity, and reform, and
that they have confidence in the ruling party's moderate and
effective policies and reform programs.</P>
      <P>He also said that the government will vigorously carry out
its policies, including the policy to improve cross-strait and
international relations.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks when he met with Chinese-language media
reporters in New York.</P>
      <P>Chen, who arrived here Sunday, is busy visiting American news
media leaders in the city. He will leave here for Washington
Tuesday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui received Australia's
goodwill ambassador Tan Le on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>President Lee welcomed Le and said he hoped she will introduce
aspects of Australia's diverse culture and society here as well as
enlighten people in Taiwan about the living situation of Australia's
population.</P>
      <P>President Lee added that Australia now has a reputation for
discriminating against foreigners, and Australians should spare no
effort to eradicate such misunderstandings.</P>
      <P>Ties between the Republic of China and Australia have made great
progress in recent years as trade, investment, and tourism between
the two sides have increased, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Although Australia's natural resources makes it a suitable
country for investment, it is the country's diverse society and
culture that are major factors that attracts foreign funds, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Le, agreeing with the president, said during her visit she hoped
to gain insight into the ROC's culture and folklore in an effort to
make various exchange between the two sides more cohesive.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN LOOKS TO BUY MORE PATRIOT MISSILES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 15  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is seeking to purchase additional
Patriot defense systems to enhance its anti-missile capability, a
spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense confirmed on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan already has three sets of the US-made Patriot anti-missile
systems deployed in the northern part of the island.</P>
      <P>If the purchase goes through as planned, the new missiles will be
deployed in the central and southern parts of the island, Major
General Chiang Ming, a senior ministry official, said.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese missiles still pose a great threat to Taiwan, he
said, "But it would be the people's psychology that is the most
fragile in case of a Beijing missile attack."</P>
      <P>Beijing's missile test-firings in waters around Taiwan in the
run-up to Taiwan's presidential election in early 1996 caused panic
in the island, sending the local foreign exchange and stock markets
into a nose-dive.</P>
      <P>The mainland's middle-range M-family missiles is currently the
greatest threat to Taiwan, but such missiles would cause only limited
damage to the island, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>For example, an M-family missile with a 500 kg warhead would
create a hole only 10 meters in depth and 20 meters in width after
hitting the ground. If were the case, it would take at least 50
missiles to destroy a military airport, he explained.</P>
      <P>Currently, Beijing owns 200 M-9 (DF-15) missiles and 48 M-11
(DF-11) missiles, which have a range of 600 kilometers and 300
kilometers, respectively.</P>

      <P>The Philippine government is set to declare
a 45-day cease-fire with communist rebels which will begin Tuesday at
midnight, according to reports.</P>
      <P>President Joseph Estrada is expected to approve a recommendation
by Gen. Joselin Nazareno, chief of staff of the armed forces of the

truce with rebel groups, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said.</P>
      <P>"We're communicating this with the president. We expect the
president will approve this sometime this afternoon, so by midnight
tonight this should be effective," Zamora said after a meeting of the
Office of the President Executive Committee in Malacanang on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Zamora chairs the committee, a multi-agency body tasked by
Estrada to advise him on critical national issues while he is abroad.
The president is currently in Vietnam to attend the Association of

    <HEADLINE>DIRECT TRADE BETWEEN OFFSHORE ISLANDS, MAINLAND NOT PERMITTED: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will not open offshore
islands to low-level trade with mainland China, Chang King-yuh,
chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks in response to questions by Tsaur Eel-jong
of the ruling Kuomintang in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Tsaur asked the MAC to address the issue of allowing offshore
island residents to trade in small amounts with their counterparts on
the other side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Although Taipei bans all direct trade with the mainland, it is an
open secret that offshore island residents have been trading fish and
agricultural products with people from the mainland.</P>
      <P>The government must first consider cross-strait relations, Chang
said, as the offshore islands shoulder the responsibility of guarding
the safety of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also said the reason why there are still no "three direct
links" -- no direct trade, communication and transportation links --
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is because the time is not
yet ripe for such links.</P>
      <P>A "small amount of trade" is basically smuggling, the MAC
chairman said, adding that such activities have created new problems
for both sides.</P>
      <P>Chang explained that the "go slow, be patient" policy was not
targeted at the offshore islands of Kinmen and Matsu, but was mainly
aimed at the large investments in the mainland which has little to do
with trade.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two cases of indigenous hemorrhagic dengue
fever were reported in Tainan, leading the Department of Health to
issue a warning to residents to prevent the further spread of the
disease, reports said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Symptoms include headaches, painful joints, and most noticeably,
hemorrhaging beneath the skin. Dengue fever is transmitted by
mosquito carriers.</P>
      <P>The National Institute of Preventive Medicine said the mortality
rate for adult victims of hemorrhagic dengue fever range from 10
percent to 30 percent, while that for infants is a mere 50 percent.</P>
      <P>There are four different types of dengue fever and they are not
immune to each other, which means a victim of one type of tengue
fever can be susceptible to another type thereby exacerbating their
condition.</P>
      <P>Repeated infections to dengue fever can also make a victim more
susceptible to the dangerous hemorrhagic tengue fever, the institute
warned, as some victims can develop an allergic reaction to the
disease.</P>
      <P>Up to now, a total of 71 cases of dengue fever have been reported
in Tainan, exceeding the 51 cases reported in Kaohsiung.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An Feng Kingstream will continue to
target Taiwan as its major market following its restructuring which
frees the group from its Taiwan entity under a new deal.</P>
      <P>The Australian Associated Press on Monday reported An Feng
Kingstream will lose its chief shareholders and its 92.3 percent
stake in the Kaohsiung-based An Feng Steel Co. after the group
implements a fresh debt and equity plan to turn around a first-half
loss of about A$111.6 million (US$77 million).</P>
      <P>The deal puts a cloud over the future of An Feng Kingstream's
proposed A$1.5 billion Midwest Iron and Steel Project at Oakajee in
Western Australia.</P>
      <P>Despite its restructure, An Feng Kingstream will target Taiwan as
its main export market, selling about 2 million tonnes of steel slab
a year to An Feng Steel at a commercial price after its mill comes on
stream by 2000.</P>
      <P>However, the restructure will see the cancellation of up to
435.8 million or 64.7 percent of An Feng Kingstream's fully paid
ordinary shares.</P>
      <P>Under the new deal, An Feng Kingstream will acquire and cancel
the 435.8 million shares from its major stockholders, Chu An-hsiung
and his wife, Wu Teh-wei. In turn, An Feng Kingstream will transfer
back to Wu Teh-mei its 92.3 percent stake in An Feng Steel Co.</P>
      <P>All loans owed by An Feng Kingstream to An Feng Steel or any
associated party will be forgiven in full and all unexercised options
held by Wu Teh-mei in An Feng Kingstream will be canceled.</P>
      <P>Wu Teh-mei's interest in An Feng Kingstream will be dismantled,
but other Taiwanese shareholders, including Central Investment
Holdings Co., Ltd., would remain as shareholders of the steel group,

      <P>Warmer temperatures in Canada's northern
region could displace wildlife, increase pollution and destabilize
infrastructure across the country's sub-Arctic, a study warned on
Monday.</P>
      <P>"The Canada Country Study," released by Canada's Department of
Environment, outlined how northern indigenous people would be
affected by the ecosystem shifts that may be outside the limits of
historical experiences.</P>
      <P>Warmer temperatures could reduce the size and stability of ice
floes which may push many species out of traditional habitats. Also,
over many years forest ranges could spread further north, reducing
range land available to caribou herds.</P>
      <P>Hunters, fishers and trappers depend on their knowledge of animal
migration, snowfall patterns, and timing of freeze-up and breakup.
Changes in climate make it almost impossible for hunters to know
where to find game and when the ice is safe to hunt on.</P>
      <P>Many Inuit communities depend on hunting as both a source of
income and protein. If less fresh meat is available, the Inuit would
likely suffer from less nutritious food.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CAPABLE OF SUSTAINING HIGH GROWTH: AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  15  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China will not be derailed in
its economic growth rate and can maintain growth of 7 percent to 10
percent for several more decades, a prominent Australian economist
said on Monday.</P>
      <P>However, Professor Ross Garnaut, director of the Asia Pacific
School of Economics and Management at the Australian National
University in Canberra, warned that mainland China will not be able
to sustain the current deficits it is running to offset recessionary
effects of the Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>He said as in the past 20 years, "the realization of the national
and personal benefits of growth and of the conditions that sustain it
will be sufficiently widespread and strong to return China to a
growth path whenever it is temporarily knocked from it."</P>
      <P>He said the mainland's average 7 percent to 10 percent growth in
the past two decades will be sustained for several more decades.
"Output will double each decade. In another two decades, China will
be the world's second largest economy by conventional national
account measures in output and foreign trade, or third if the
European Union by then is seen as a single entity," he said.</P>
      <P>Garnaut said Asia's financial crisis was the greatest external
challenge of the past 20 years to the mainland's stability and
growth. But it had come at a good time because mainland's inflation
was low, the balance of payments was in strong current account
surplus, its foreign reserves were high and foreign direct investment
was high, he said.</P>
      <P>"So far, China has had a good crisis, sustaining growth at high
levels (although slightly down from the 20-year average) in the
second half of 1998 through massive fiscal expansion, and winning
much international kudos for this and for holding the pre-crisis US
dollar value of the renminbi," he said.</P>
      <P>The economist added that it was unlikely that economic, political
and social problems would "crystallize into a collapse of growth in
the East Asian crisis. But there will be plenty of other risks and
challenges, some arising when China is less well placed to handle
them than in 1997."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The introduction of the euro, the single
European currency, on Jan. 1 will decrease Taiwan traders' exposure
to fluctuating foreign exchange rates, said Chen Ruey-long, director
general of the Board of Foreign Trade on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a seminar organized by a local business association to inform
businessmen how to take advantage of the new currency, Chen, who just
returned from Europe, said the launch of the euro is the most
important international event after the Y2K computer issue. Many
European restaurants have already reprinted their menus with euro
prices.</P>
      <P>Noting that the deutschemark is the strongest and the lira the
weakest currency in Europe, Chen said the circulation of the euro
will cut red tape and the cost of trading with European states by
sparing dealers the trouble of exchanging currencies.</P>
      <P>Chen said the birth of the euro will consolidate the strength of
the European Union which with a population of 295 million people and
an economy of US$6.57 trillion, is almost the equal to the United
States in terms of market size. Taiwan investors should diversify
their business by aggressively exploring European markets, he added.</P>
      <P>Na Ho-chung, a vice manager of the Taipei Branch of Deutsche
Bank, predicted at the seminar that the euro, currently fixed at
about US$1.10, will compete with the greenback as a tender of
international trade and a reserve currency. He said it will probably
replace the dollar's role in 35 percent of the world's international
trade in the first year of its debut.</P>

      <P>Australia's richest man and one of the
world's leading gamblers, Kerry Packer, has offered to buy the
financially troubled Crown Casino in Melbourne.</P>
      <P>In the past, Packer has been thwarted in his efforts to buy a
casino, including Star City Casino in Sydney. This time, he is
determined to cash in on Crown Casino, the largest gambling operation
in the Oceania and one of the largest in the world.</P>
      <P>Packer plans to buy a 37 percent stake in the casino in exchange
for a 5.5 percent stake in his Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd. media
empire and he plans to merge the two companies.</P>
      <P>The latest offer is Packer's second attempt since shareholders of
Crown Casino turned his first offer about three months ago. But the
second offer is designed to buy out Crown's chairman Lloyd Williams,
Packer's close friend.</P>
      <P>The offer is worth about A$750 million (US$470 million), up from
Packer's initial offer to buy the casino at about US$290 million in
September. Gambling industry experts said the offer was too good for
Williams and other shareholders to refuse.</P>
      <P>For years, Packer's exploits at the gambling tables in Las Vegas,

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's economy is performing better
than many Asian countries as its growth rate will reach 4 percent in
1998 which is higher than the earlier forecast of 3 percent, the
governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia said.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the House of Representatives on Tuesday, Ian
Macfarlane said the current account deficit appears to average at 5
percent of the country's gross domestic products in calendar 1998,
which is lower than 5.5 percent projected earlier.</P>
      <P>Australia's inflation is low at 2 percent and the unemployment
rate has continued to edge down rather than staying flat, he said.</P>
      <P>Macfarlane said in a statement faxed to the CNA that the
country's economic performance exceeded the bank's expectations and
those of virtually all other forecasters.</P>
      <P>He attributed the economic performance to several factors. One
was the timing. The Asian crisis hit at a time when the Australian
economy was in good shape, partly for cyclical reasons.</P>
      <P>Australia benefited from the flexibility of its exporters who
switched from the contracting Asian markets into the expanding North
American and European ones and into a number of other markets.</P>
      <P>Australia also benefited from a greatly improved perception of
the soundness of its economic policies, including good regulation of
banks, other financial institutions and stock exchanges.</P>
      <P>The country's economy seems to be more flexible and adaptable
than before because of rising productivity. Another reason is the
depreciation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar, which
has helped local exporters improve their competitive edge in the
world market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Aid from Taiwan to
hurricane-devastated Central American countries continues even after
ROC Vice President Lien Chan returned from a mission to the region
offering long-term loans and donations.</P>
      <P>Three relief teams from Taiwan's private Tzu Chi Association are
currently helping the Honduras Red Cross Association clean up the
environment and with some of the reconstruction work, according to a
Tzu Chi report.</P>
      <P>Honduras sustained the worst damage and the greatest loss of life
in Hurricane Mitch which struck in late October. Since the disaster,
the Buddhist compassionate organization has shipped at least one
cargo container filled with relief supplies to the stricken areas
from Los Angeles each day, the report said.</P>
      <P>In the past one and a half months, the Tzu Chi group has shipped
a total of 1,200 gallons anti-dengue serum, 30,000 kilograms of
medicine to fight mosquito bites, 10,000 portions of quinine to
combat malaria, 10,000 antibiotics, and equipment for emergency
treatment and sterilization, according to the report.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Tzu Chi Association, the Hsi Lai Temple in Los
Angeles has also held several charity events to raise funds aimed at
helping the four storm-ravaged Central American countries --
Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador -- recover.</P>
      <P>The Hsi Lai Temple is a branch of Taiwan's prestigious Buddhist
Fukuangshan Temple.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESTIGIOUS SCRAP COLLECTOR WANG KUAN-YING DIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang Kuan-ying, an honored resident of
Taipei who raised a small fortune to promote literacy and Chinese
culture by collecting recycled goods, died on Tuesday of heart
failure at a local hospital at the age of 96.</P>
      <P>The one-time Kuomintang soldier will be granted a funeral service
complete with national and party honors in recognition of his
chivalrous contributions to society, KMT officials said in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The veteran, who never married, began scrap collecting since he
concluded his service in the army.</P>
      <P>It was during China's eight-year war against Japan that Wang
pledged to devote the rest of his life to the promotion of Chinese
culture in an effort to strengthen the nation.</P>
      <P>Since then, rain or shine, Wang became a familiar sight in the
streets of Taipei. The retiree, who suffered from poverty, drove a
simple cart through the streets and alleys, collecting garbage to be
sold for recycling.</P>
      <P>Although he earned only small change, he collected enough to
spend tens of thousands of dollars on books of Chinese culture and
philosophy.</P>
      <P>In a period of 50-odd years, the scrap collector donated a total
of more than 300,000 books to domestic and foreign academic
institutions. Over 30 countries have benefited from Wang's donations.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wang helped build a private library in downtown
Taipei in 1976 and set up a scholarship for underprivileged students.</P>
      <P>When President Lee Teng-hui was Taipei mayor, he granted Wang
with the title of honored resident in recognition of Wang's enormous
efforts, making him the first such person in Taiwan's capital city.</P>

(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Unprecedented efforts to expand economic
relations between Japan and South Korea are underway following recent
improvements in political relations, according to reports from the
World Trade Organization (WTO) on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The developments come as South Korea tries to pull itself out of
an economic recession and encourage the inflow of foreign capital.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks, Japanese and South Korean officials have agreed
to begin negotiations over what would be a free-trade zone between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>Japanese officials see a stronger relationship with South Korea
as a way of helping balance mainland China's increasing strength in
the region, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>"Japan and South Korea traditionally had been unable to hold
comprehensive trade and investment talks," Junich Wada, deputy
director of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry's
international trade policy bureau, was quoted as saying. "But the
relationship between Japanese and South Korean governments has become
completely different from what it was. We will take this opportunity
to achieve economic integration between the two nations."</P>
      <P>By economic integration, Wada referred to the free movement of
goods, capital and people. He also referred to the development of
close relations between companies of the two countries.</P>
      <P>Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry is working
to push Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to endorse the initiatives. The
positions of other Japanese government ministries are still
uncertain, but some are expected to vigorously resist the removal of
protection from South Korean imports, the WTO report said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Dean Hirsch, president of World Vision
International, paid tribute on Tuesday to Taiwan's generosity in
offering aid to the Central American victims of Hurricane Mitch.</P>
      <P>He urged Taipei authorities to help relieve the Latin American
countries' foreign debts with the same vigor.</P>
      <P>During a news conference held by World Vision Taiwan, Hirsch
expressed appreciation for the donations of tents, blankets, and
medicine made by the local public to those in Honduras, as well as
the offerings made during Vice President Lien Chan's recent visit to
the storm-devastated region.</P>
      <P>There are more than 300 million children worldwide who are on the
verge of death due to malnutrition or a lack of medication, another
300 million children who go to bed hungry every night, about 200
million between 4 and 15 work in mines or plantations every day, some
800,000 children in Asia are forced into the sex trade every day, and
about 2 million children died in wars in the last decade, he said.</P>
      <P>In Ulan Bator, the capital of the Mongolia, Hirsch said the local
World Vision found nine runaway children living in the sewage system
who survived by stealing, begging or doing odds jobs. They bathed
with water that leaked from a hot water pipe and were often burned by
the sudden burst of steam.</P>
      <P>As a Christian body, the World Vision believes that no one, much
less child, should live in such a misery, Hirsch said, adding that
children also have an inalienable right to have access to an
education.</P>
      <P>Hirsch, who arrived in Taiwan on Monday to promote the
organization's cause, urged the public to dig deep into their pockets
to help relieve those living in misery.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FRANCE RESUMES INVESTIGATION IN TAIWAN FRIGATE GRAFT CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By M. J. Tzou and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>French authorities on Tuesday resumed their
investigation into a graft scandal involving a 1991 Lafayette-class
frigate sale to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Judge Eva Joly summoned Christine Joncour, a key figure in the
case, for further questioning with the hopes of determining whether
former French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas abused his post and
received a commission or bribes from parties involved in the frigate
deal</P>
      <P>Court sources noted that Joly's questioning focused on Joncour's
role in distributing the commissions, particularly on whether she had
succeeded as a public relations broker in bribing Dumas, then foreign
minister, to give his consent to the frigate sale.</P>
      <P>In a previous probe, French judges sought to establish the former
state-run oil company ELF's role in lobbying France's Foreign
Ministry, on behalf of the Lafayette-class frigate maker Thomson-CSF
Group, to approve the sale of the warship to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Investigation results showed that in 1991, after Thomson-CSF
Group decided to sell six Lafayette-class frigates to Taiwan, Dumas
introduced Joncour, his friend, to work at ELF as a PR executive.
Joncour proceeded to exclusively lobby the government for its consent
in the frigate deal.</P>
      <P>In early 1992, according to the probe, Joncour obtained 45
million French francs (US$8.2 million) in commissions.</P>
      <P>Joncour said under questioning that ELF hired her as a PR
executive because she maintained close relations with Dumas, who was
then known to strongly oppose the frigate deal.</P>
      <P>Joncour admitted that she received a total of 66 million francs
(US$12 million) from ELF since the deal was struck. The amount
included commissions, her salary and other PR expenses, she said.</P>
      <P>In 1991 and 1992, despite Dumas' opposition, the French
government approved the sale with the consent of then President
Francois Mitterrand.</P>
      <P>Joncour was taken into police custody last November for five
months on the grounds that there was no reason for her to obtain such
a large amount of money from the deal.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Dumas -- who now heads France's highest judicial
watchdog, the Constitutional council -- has been stripped of his
right to leave the country since April 29 this year due to charges of
fraud and abuse of corporate assets.</P>
      <P>Dumas told Le Figaro daily earlier this year that he never
changed his position, stressing that the go-ahead was given by the
then French president and prime minister. He further said that the
details concerning the deal had been consigned to a secret file, and
called for it to be made public "to wipe away all doubts."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
is paying close attention to reports from Phnom Penh stating that
Cambodia is being used by other countries as a toxic dumping ground.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, 3,000 tons of waste
believed to be toxic were left 185 kilometers southwest of Phnom Penh
on the outskirts of the port town of Sihanoukville last week.</P>
      <P>The waste materials, reportedly imported from Taiwan by a
Cambodian company, pose a serious risk of contaminating water sources
in the area, said Cambodian Environment Minister Mok Mareth on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>If the shipment is found to be toxic and indeed from Taiwan, it
will be shipped back to the island, Mareth added.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Roy Wu said on Wednesday that the ministry has
instructed officials stationed in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City to look
into the allegations to determine whether the shipment originated
from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Once the findings are delivered and if Taiwan is the source of
the waste, MOFA will contact the Environmental Protection
Administration, the Ministry of Finance and the Directorate General
of Customs to work out a suitable course of action, Wu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GLOBAL SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY TO RECOVER IN SECOND HALF OF 1999</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Angel Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The slumping global semiconductor industry
will likely rebound in the third quarter of 1999, IDC Japan predicted
on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Akira Minamikawa, IDC Japan's senior analyst in the semiconductor
industry, said during a seminar on Tuesday that the world's
microchips production will continue to exceed market demand during
the first two quarters in 1999.</P>
      <P>Contributing to the oversupply in the world market is a huge
production increase of semiconductors by South Korea's Hyundai Group
and Samsung Group, as well as a moderate expansion in the world's PC
market, Minamikawa added.</P>
      <P>However, excess supply will turn to excess demand in the second
half of 1999, the IDC Japan analyst predicted, as microchip makers
have been cutting their capital investment budgets and production
rates will remain level due to little advancement in production
technology.</P>
      <P>While the global semiconductor market is expected to recover,
Taiwan's DRAM makers will continue to be challenged by Samsung Group
and US-based Micron Technology, both of which have more advanced
production technology than Taiwan, Minamikawa noted.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is not strongly competitive in DRAM production,
there is something to be learned from the island's microchip
industry, IDC Japan said. For example, Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company is recorded as earning the world's highest
profit margin against such stiff competition as Micron Technology,
Motorola Electronics, Texas Instruments, and Philips Electronics.</P>

      <P>Despite some success in switching its sales to North America and
Europe, Australia's commodity exports remain tied to the economic
turbulence in Asia which is expected to experience continued lower
demand for commodities.</P>
      <P>Sheales said the fall of Australia's commodities exports would
have been greater if the Australian dollar had not depreciated
against the greenback to make prices more competitive in the world
market.</P>
      <P>He noted that the value of minerals and energy exports are
expected to fall 2.3 percent to A$40.2 billion although minerals and
metals producers should be better off than energy producers. The
average prices for minerals and metals exports are tipped to drop 0.5
percent, compared with a 7.5 percent fall for energy exports.</P>
      <P>Aluminum, copper, lead, nickel and uranium prices are all
expected to drop, but gold should firm slightly. Iron ore exports are
expected to rise 2 percent on rising demand in China and Japan and
steel markets are expected to remain depressed, resulting in a 4
percent drop of Australian steel exports, Sheales said.</P>
      <P>Australia's wool exports are expected to plunge about 26 percent
due to a weakening demand from major markets, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN POWER COMPANY ADJUSTS PRICE SYSTEM TO CONTROL LOAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run Taiwan Power Company (TPC)
presented plans to adjust its pricing system to the Ministry of
Economic Affairs' (MOEA) Energy Commission for approval.</P>
      <P>Under the new scheme, the three-category pricing system will be
changed to a four-category system whereby high-end energy users will
be charged higher rates than low-end users, TPC officials said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The fourth category of users, namely those who consume more than
500 kilowatt/hour per month, will be charged NT$0.3 more per
kilowatt/hour while those in the first category, who consume less
than 110 kilowatt/hour per month, will have their charges reduced by
NT$0.2 per kilowatt/hour.</P>
      <P>TPC officials estimated that 9.8 million users islandwide will
benefit from lower rates while nearly 3.3 million users will fall
into the fourth category and pay higher rates. If calculated based on
peak season prices, category-four users will pay 35 percent more than
category-one users, they noted.</P>
      <P>The new pricing scheme has been devised to promote more
resourceful energy consumption particularly as plans for a fourth
nuclear power plant and a thermal power plant have met with strong
opposition among residents living near proposed sites. Such
construction projects have also been hindered by environmental
protection regulations, the TPC officials noted.</P>
      <P>Both residential and industrial energy users will be affected by
the new pricing program as peak-hour and off-peak-hour charges have
also been adjusted. As industrial users normally operate during peak
hours, they will likely face higher charges.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the program includes the limitation of power
use for central air condition systems for whole buildings and the
voluntary disconnection of service for high-end users such as steel
plants during summer months. These two moves will save ordinary users
from being limited in their use of energy, officials stated.</P>
      <P>The plans for the new pricing scheme must first be checked by the
Energy Commission's Consultant Committee of Petroleum Product and
Electric Power Price before being put forward for approval.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, lawmakers expressed concern over the new scheme and
the joint conference of committees in the Legislative Yuan's budget
and economic affairs requested that the MOEA explain the new program.</P>
      <P>The MOEA said this draft for the new pricing program will be
thoroughly discussed by the Consultant Committee prior to any further
progress in obtaining approval.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP MAY REVISE PARTY PLATFORM IN A BID TO WIN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) may revise its party platform in a bid to win the presidential
election in 2000, party sources said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Calls have been made for the DPP to revise its platform, chapters
and relevant statutes following the party's dismal performance in the
Dec. 5 "three-in-one" elections.</P>
      <P>The DPP Central Standing Committee met on Wednesday to establish
a "party reform task force," to discuss strategies in winning the
2000 presidential election and further reflect why voter support was
lower than expected.</P>
      <P>Members of the committee said no matter who is selected to run on
the party ticket for president, the primary source of concern and
doubt of most constituents is the DPP's platform supporting Taiwan
independence. The issue must be dealt with if the party intends to
win elections in the future, they added.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-nan, former director of the DPP's Organization Affairs
Department, suggested that action guidelines be added to the party's
platform to clearly state the fact that Taiwan already has de facto
independence. The only part left to be completed to that end is a
nationwide plebiscite to decide the new name of the "independent"
nation, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Sisy Chen, former DPP publicity chief, recommended that
provisions be added to the platform to define the DPP's efforts in
seeking conciliation with the ruling Kuomintang and other opposition
parties.</P>
      <P>The DPP Central Standing Committee meeting, which was continuing
at press time, may also discuss a cancellation of Article Seven of
the DPP statute governing the candidacy of elections for public jobs.
It rules that party members can choose to run in only one among
the presidential election and mayoral election in Taipei and Kaohsiung
in four years.</P>
      <P>If the revision, called the "Chen Shui-bian statute," is
approved, it will be a move by senior DPP members to pave the way for
outgoing Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian to run on the DPP ticket for
president in 2000.</P>

      <P>The move is part of a package designed by the Ministry of

    <HEADLINE>JAPANESE LAWYERS TO REPRESENT TAIWAN COMFORT WOMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of voluntary Japanese lawyers said
on Wednesday it will file a lawsuit against the Japanese government
in the spring on behalf of former comfort women in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Members of the group said they are aware it will be a tough
fight, but added that they will hold on until the end to achieve
their goal of winning compensation for the women.</P>
      <P>The eight-member group arrived in Taiwan on Monday to collect
information and meet with women who were forced into working as sex
slaves for the Japanese army during World War II.</P>
      <P>So far, they have visited about 30 former comfort women in
Kaohsiung, Hualien and Taipei, and will call at the Executive Yuan
and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday to exchange opinions
with relevant officials.</P>
      <P>Kunio Aitani, spokesman for the group and head of Japan's
National Lawyers' Association, said a number of lawyers in Japan have
voluntarily teamed up and divided into several groups to defend those
filing complaints against the Japanese government over wartime
offenses.</P>
      <P>At present, they are preparing to file eight lawsuits on behalf
of former Asian comfort women, including some from Taiwan, he added.
The lawyers are also representing an additional 30 plaintiffs
involved in incidents which occurred during World War II.</P>
      <P>Wang Ching-fung, a well-known Taiwan lawyer and a long-time
anti-child prostitution advocate, said she hoped the Japanese group
will be able to speed up the pace of progress in the case as former
comfort women on Hainan Island in southern mainland China will also
launch a suit next year.</P>
      <P>In a public declaration, the Japanese group stated that it will
sue the Japanese government next spring on behalf of surviving
comfort women in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Japan established the Asian Women's Fund in 1995 providing 2
million Japanese yen (about US$14,200) worth of compensation to each
surviving comfort women. But most of the former sex slaves, about
200,000 from across Asia, have refused to accept the money because it
is not from the Japanese government.</P>
      <P>Tokyo has long been reluctant to offer legal compensation for
surviving wartime comfort women despite the fact that some government
officials have apologized for such practices.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is well qualified for membership in
the World Trade Organization (WTO), said Paul Scholten, newly elected
chairman of the European Council of Commerce and Trade (ECCT) in
Taipei, on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Scholten, who was named president of the Taiwan branch of ABN, 
AMRO Bank of the Netherlands in 1996, said that the Executive
Commission of the European Union (EU) has decided to set up a Taiwan
office to deal with the sharp increase in trade and mutual investment
between Taiwan and EU member countries.</P>
      <P>Saying the ECCT will serve as a "bridge" between Taiwan and the
EU, Scholten said that Taiwan's WTO membership will benefit not just
Taiwan but also European businesses with connections to the island.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan has made great progress in economic
liberalization and that its WTO membership should not be connected
with mainland China's. Mainland China is also seeking WTO membership
and has insisted that it be admitted into the world trade regulatory
body ahead of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Scholten suggested Taiwan revise its outdated regulations on
allowing the marketing of newly developed medicines, improve its
build-operate-transfer systems and give greater protection to
intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>The banker also praised Taiwan for being more willing to accept

      <P>Newly appointed Republic of China
Representative to Israel R. T. Yang on Wednesday vowed to push for
increased exchanges of visits by high-ranking officials of the two
nations.</P>
      <P>Yang, during his report at a parliamentary meeting, said he will

ROC's membership in international organizations, and to provide
smooth communication channels between two sides.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China, which has no official diplomatic relations
with Israel, established its representative office in Tel Aviv in
June 1993.</P>
      <P>Despite a lack of formal ties, officials from Taiwan in Israel
have been granted a number of diplomatic privileges, a fact that
reflects Israel's friendship with Taipei, Yang noted.</P>
      <P>It is still difficult, though, for ROC officials to contact
Israel's vice foreign minister or other ministerial-level officials
due to Beijing's political pressure.</P>
      <P>Beijing forged official links with Israel in November 1992, and

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth will reach 5.08
percent next year, a higher level than will be seen this year, the
Taiwan Research Institute (TRI) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>TRI said that faced with a financial crisis in Asia, Taiwan's
economy will not bottom out until the second half of next year.</P>
      <P>TRI, working with Japanese research institute Daiwa, made the
forecast. The growth figure is slightly lower than those from most
private forecasting institutions, and is much lower than economic
growth forecasts by government agencies.</P>
      <P>The Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research and the Taiwan
Institute of Economic Research have put Taiwan's economic growth next
year at 5.35 percent and 5.41 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the government's Directorate General of the Budget,
Accounting and Statistics and the Council for Economic Planning and
Development have estimated next year's growth will amount to 5.24
percent and 5.32 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>TRI said world commodity exports have, in the past two months,
achieved negative growth, indicating that the world economy has
slowed. In addition, economic growth in mainland China this year is
not as good as in past years, and Taiwan's indirect trade with the
mainland via Hong Kong has slipped. All these factors have affected
Taiwan's overall export performance.</P>
      <P>But Premier Vincent Siew's push to expand domestic demand will
result in dramatic investment increases by the government and state
enterprises, TRI said.</P>
      <P>TRI estimated that quarterly economic growth next year will be
4.84 percent, 4.24 percent, 5.33 percent and 5.84 percent,
respectively. This means the economy's downward slide will bottom out
in the third quarter of 1999.</P>

    <DATELINE>Manila,  Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Philippine President Joseph Ejercito
Estrada said Wednesday the Philippines favors a multilateral
agreement among claimants to the Spratlys group of islands as a way
of resolving the long-standing dispute, a Malacanang press release
said.</P>
      <P>Estrada said his proposal for the establishment of a high council
to resolve these types of potential conflicts among countries in the
region might be taken up Wednesday afternoon when the heads of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meet high-level
representatives of their dialogue partners, South Korea, Japan and
Mainland China, in separate closed-door conferences.</P>
      <P>In his opening statement at the sixth ASEAN leaders' summit,
Estrada called for the establishment of such a council to help defuse
conflicts that strain relations among its members and affect regional
peace and security. One of the issues such a council would contend
with are overlapping claims to islands in the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>The Philippines and three other ASEAN members -- Brunei, Malaysia
and Vietnam -- have laid claim part or all of the Spratlys. Mainland
China and the Republic of China on Taiwan have also laid separate
claims on the island chain.</P>
      <P>In a press briefing on Tuesday, Presidential spokesperson Jerry
Barican said the ASEAN leaders' declaration, to be issued Wednesday
afternoon, would include a statement calling on Spratly claimants to
exercise prudence and to avoid any activities that may raise tensions
in the disputed area.</P>
      <P>"As far as the Spratlys is concerned, the ASEAN leaders are going
to issue a statement which calls on all parties in the South China
Sea to be very prudent, to be careful and to avoid any approaches
that may increase tension in the area," Barican said.</P>
      <P>He said the Hanoi declaration will be directed "in general at all
the parties to the dispute."</P>
      <P>The remarks came in response to questions as to whether the ASEAN
leaders' statement would contain a direct reference to Beijing, which
has recently made its presence felt in Mischief Reef, a portion of
the disputed area that the Philippines considers as part of its
200-mile exclusive economic zone.</P>

      <P>He said that Wei originally was scheduled to come to Taiwan just
days before Taiwan's "three-in-one" elections on Dec. 5 to see for
himself Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>But the trip was postponed, as Taiwan's political parties were
busy campaigning for their candidates at the time, Jao added.</P>
      <P>Until his release on medical parole and his deportment to the
United States last year, Wei had served all but six months of the
last 18 years in jail for his pro-democracy stance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASEAN LEADERS PLEDGE PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF SOUTH CHINA SEA DISPUTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila,  Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Philippine President Joseph Ejercito
Estrada and eight other leaders of Association Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) member states pledged Wednesday to support peaceful
and diplomatic efforts to settle territorial disputes in the South
China Sea, even as they called on all parties concerned to refrain
from disturbing the peace in the region, a Malacanang press release
said.</P>
      <P>This commitment forms part of a "package of bold measures"
intended to move the 31-year-old organization to a "higher plane" of
regional cooperation and solidarity to combat enemies such as poverty
and the Asian economic crisis, and to meet the challenges of the 21st
century.</P>
      <P>Estrada and his co-leaders signed the Hanoi Declaration of 1998,
which also sealed their decision to admit Cambodia as the 10th member
of ASEAN, at the end of the two-day sixth ASEAN leaders summit at Ba
dinh Hall in Vietnam.</P>
      <P>They likewise adopted the Hanoi Plan, which puts flesh onto ASEAN
Vision 2020, and directed their respective ministers and senior
officials to implement this "package of bold measures" starting Jan.
1, 1999. They agreed to review its progress in 2001.</P>
      <P>To highlight ASEAN's key role in the well-being of individual
members, the leaders declaration reaffirmed their view of the group
as "indispensable to regional peace and prosperity, an association
with a history of demonstrated dynamism and close cooperation, a
force for peace and stability in our part of the world."</P>
      <P>The ASEAN leaders also vowed to "promote efforts to settle
disputes in the South China Sea by peaceful means in accordance with
international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea, and the spirit of the 1992 ASEAN Declaration on
the South China Sea."</P>
      <P>"We call on all parties concerned to exercise restraint and to
refrain from taking actions that are inimical to the peace and
security and stability of Southeast Asia-Pacific region," according
to the statement.</P>
      <P>"We welcome efforts to develop long-term constructive
relationships among the major powers. ASEAN shall enhance its
dialogue partnership and cooperation with other countries as well as
with other regional and international organizations, on the basis of
equality, non-interference, mutual respect and mutual benefit," the
leaders said.</P>
      <P>They agreed, moreover, to prevent disputes and resolve current
problems "in the ASEAN way and in accordance with international law
and practice."</P>
      <P>In pursuit of this goal, they agreed to strengthen the ASEAN
Regional Forum as a venue for political and security dialogues in the
Asia-Pacific region; to expedite the rectification of the second
Protocol to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia;
and to intensify consultations nations possessing nuclear weapons,
with an eye toward their accession to the Protocol to the Treaty on
the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapons-Free Zone.</P>
      <P>Aside from President Estrada, the declaration was also signed by
Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei Darussalam, President Bacharuddin
Jusuf Habibie of Indonesia, Prime Minister Sisavath Keobounphanh of
the Lao Peoples' Democratic Republic, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
of Malaysia, Prime Minister Than Shwe of the Union of Myanmar, Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong of Singapore, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpal of

    <HEADLINE>ROC SPOKESMAN IN US TO SPEAK ON JUST CONCLUDED ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although mainland Chinese authorities
are relieved over the Dec. 5 election results in Taiwan, they
continue to harbor hostility toward the island, the Republic of
China's top spokesman said here on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Director General C. J. Chen, who is
visiting the United States to discuss the three-in-one election
results, noted that mainland China has not changed its practice of
isolating Taiwan internationally.</P>
      <P>He said that the prospects for cross-strait dialogue could be
described as "lukewarm," adding that there is nothing to indicate
that relations are warming.</P>
      <P>During a lunch with editors and reporters from the Washington
Times, Chen said Ma Ying-jeou's victory in the Taipei mayoral
election showed that voters were unwilling to confront the mainland
directly. Ma, who is from the ruling Kuomintang, is said to symbolize
the status quo while outgoing Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party advocates Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>In legislative elections, the KMT's wide-margin majority proved
that 80 percent of the population want to maintain the status quo,
the GIO director general said.</P>
      <P>Later, during a visit with the Heritage Foundation, a US think
tank, Chen said the success in holding the elections proved once
again that democracy has triumphed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ROC's accomplishments in democracy should earn the praise,
encouragement and support from the United States, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan voters have embraced the moderate and rational course as
reflected in the results of the elections, Chen said, adding that
voters are supportive of the KMT in democratic reforms, national
development and its mainland policy.</P>
      <P>The KMT's victory also showed that Taiwan will continue to
promote a constructive dialogue with the mainland according to the
agreement reached in October between the heads of the two
intermediary bodies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also work toward maintaining peace in the strait,
increasing cross-strait exchanges, and creating more opportunities to
enhance bilateral understanding.</P>
      <P>Stephen Yates, a senior analyst from the Heritage Foundation,
suggested that Chen Shui-bian's defeat had actually cleared the way
for him to run in the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Yates added that Chen was elected four years ago because of a
split within the KMT, while Ma's victory was due in part to an
undivided support from the KMT leadership.</P>
      <P>The ROC's top spokesman, who arrived here on Tuesday, met with
US officials from the State Department in charge of Southeast Asian
policy over breakfast on Wednesday. Although the contents of the
meeting is unknown, it is believed that the US has expressed
satisfaction over the Dec. 5 elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IRAQ TENSION SAID UNLIKELY TO AFFECT TAIWAN ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Escalated tension in the Middle East will
not likely severely affect Taiwan's economy as the impact of crude
oil prices on the local economy has been minimized in recent years,
statistics officials said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Crude oil futures on Wednesday posted their largest gain in six
months as the United States and Britain were on the brink of
launching air strikes on Iraq which took place Thursday morning.</P>
      <P>Even if a war breaks out in Iraq, a nation located in the
oil-producing Middle East, the affect to Taiwan's economy is seen to
be limited as world oil prices have little impact on local inflation
and commodity prices, said Hsu Chang-yao, a bureau chief of the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>Hsu said if the joint US-British air strikes do not continue for
long, the impact on world markets would be limited. But if Iraq and
the United States engage in an all out war, turning the Middle East
into a war zone, the impact could be sizable and the aftermath
remains to be seen, he added.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that in 1996 when the US-Iraq war erupted and Iraqi
crude oil was embargoed, world oil prices skyrocketed to US$21.7 per
barrel but growth in Taiwan's consumer prices remained a stable 3.1
percent.</P>
      <P>In November this year, when the price of Taiwan's imported oil
averaged at a low of US$11.1 per barrel, the local consumer prices
did not consequently decline, indicating that the impact of world oil
prices on Taiwan's inflation and economy is limited, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Chao-wei, chairman of the state-run Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (CPC), said domestic oil prices are expected to
remain unchanged in the next week despite the Middle East tension.</P>
      <P>Chen said although Brent North Sea crude prices on the
International Petroleum Exchange rose US$0.77 on Wednesday to
US$11.23 per barrel, Taiwan has a 70-day stock of crude oil. Coupled
with CPC's higher-than-expected revenue surplus in December, the
local oil prices are expected to remain unchanged at least for one
week, he added.</P>
      <P>Vice Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang said the attack on Iraq
launched by the United States and Britain on Thursday morning should
be a temporary development.</P>
      <P>Yen also termed Taiwan's bearish stock market on Thursday as a
temporarily psychological situation. He said investors should have
confidence in Taiwan's economy which has been weathering the regional
financial storm fairly well compared with other Asian economies.</P>

release all dissidents and urged governments to condemn the regime's
recent crackdown on dissidents.</P>
      <P>The Free China Movement, which represents dissidents both in and

mistake for the Clinton administration and the European Union to
believe that China has improved its human rights record and legal

      <P>"This is an absolute myth. The recent crackdown on the Chinese
Democratic Party members and the trial of Lin Hai shows that the PRC
is still a brutal communist dictatorship that only holds power

185 km southwest of Phnom Penh. According to a customs invoice, the
material was described as construction waste shipped from Taiwan last
month by a local company which has not yet been named.</P>
      <P>Cambodia's government has been approached several times by
companies interested in disposing their industrial waste, including a
proposal for the construction of a sophisticated waste incineration
plant in the country.</P>
      <P>Mok Mareth has repeatedly said the government will turn down any
waste-related business proposals.</P>
      <P>"Industrialized nations have difficulty in finding space within
their countries to discard toxic waste, that's why they dump it in
poor countries. Cambodia is well aware of this and cannot let this
happen on a whim," he said.</P>
      <P>Deputy Prime Minister Sar Kheng has ordered the creation of a
government commission to investigate the dumping, Mok Mareth noted.</P>
      <P>Those found responsible for the dumping will face millions of
dollars in fines for environmental destruction, and will be forced to
pay compensation to anyone living in the area whose health has been
affected by the mess, Sar Kheng said.</P>
      <P>Whether the material is found to be toxic or not it will be
shipped back to Taiwan, Mok Mareth stated.</P>
      <P>"As a lesson for waste exporters it must be cleaned up and
transported back, regardless of whether it is toxic or non-toxic," he
said.</P>
      <P>A chemical expert from Singapore's environmental protection
agency examined the site on Tuesday and samples of the material were
flown to Hong Kong on Wednesday for analysis, Mok Mareth said.

    <HEADLINE>BREAKTHROUGH MADE IN TAIWAN COLOR FILTER PRODUCTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,   Dec.   17  (CNA)
(By Angel Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In what has been described as a
breakthrough in Taiwan's production technology, Chi Mei Electronics
announced on Thursday that it will produce about 30,000 color filters
in the first quarter of 1999.</P>
      <P>Color filters are a required layer in the colorization of liquid
crystal displays (LCD) most commonly found in notebook computer
monitors. They have traditionally been imported from Japan, but local
LCD producers have been troubled by a language barrier and technology
gap in dealing with such importers, Chi Mei Deputy General Manager Wu
Bin-sheng explained.</P>
      <P>With advances made in the local production of color filters, Chi
Mei can make Taiwan a self-sufficient source of key computer
components, company president Hsu Wen-long said.</P>
      <P>Unlike production in the petrochemical industry, the production
of color filters can be accomplished without seriously polluting the
environment, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>Plans are underway for Chi Mei's second plant located in the
Tainan Science Park. Once completed, the plant is expected to produce
60,000 color filters a month, he added.</P>
      <P>The initial investment for such an undertaking is substantial as
technology in LCD development continues to change rapidly, a company
representative said. Chi Mei Corporation has invested NT$20 billion
(US$619 million) in its subsidiary Chi Mei Electronics and Chi Mei
OPTO Electronics, a TFT-LCD producer.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Thursday met with
Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong and encouraged the outgoing
official to show further support for the nation's goals.</P>
      <P>Seeking the Republic of China's survival and sustainable
development are universal goal of all ROC citizens, Lee said, adding
that, "The goal is not negotiable, and most importantly, it requires
the concerted efforts from all of us."</P>
      <P>Lee gave Soong, who is scheduled to bow out from his post on Dec.
21, a scroll of eight Chinese characters he wrote personally in
calligraphy. The words read, "Everything, solid or subtle, is empty,
and you should feel free and easy at every moment."</P>
      <P>According to a Presidential Office statement, Lee spoke to Soong
about his future after stepping down from office. Lee agreed that
Soong's new appointment would not be discussed or decided until Soong
returns from his vacation overseas, the statement said.</P>
      <P>It was the first time the two had met since early last year when
Soong voiced his intention to resign after the ruling Kuomintang
decided to downsize the provincial government in an effort to boost
administrative efficiency and the island's competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Since then, rumors have circulated over a rift between the two.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Lee thanked Soong for his devoted service to
the provincial government over the past five years and nine months.</P>
      <P>Soong, Taiwan's first and only elected governor, was sworn in on
Dec. 20, 1994 after winning an overwhelming victory in the first
popular gubernatorial election. A year and nine months prior to that,
Soong was appointed by the Cabinet to head the provincial government.</P>

      <P>The state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC) will conduct an overall evaluation of its investment projects
in January during a board of directors meeting, company chairman Chen
Chao-wei said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The CPC will take decisive action against those investment

project in Kazakhstan as well as others that the CPC has tried to
offload without success.</P>
      <P>Chen made the comments during an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan in response to questions from opposition Democratic
Progressive Party Legislator Tsai Ming-hsieh over the return rate of
17 local and overseas CPC investment projects.</P>
      <P>According to DPP statistics, a total of NT$515 million has been
invested in mines in Kazakhstan over the last five years, but the
rate of return on the investment has been zero. The same is true for
NT$533 million invested in Ecuador mines, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The rate of return in US mines reached 11.08 percent over the

      <P>Australian Prime Minister John Howard
threw his support behind the joint US-British military action against
Iraq, saying there were no other alternative after Iraq refused to
comply with United Nations resolutions.</P>
      <P>Neither Washington nor London had asked Australia to send any
troops to the Middle East in the latest offensive, Howard said, but
he would consider it if asked to do so,</P>
      <P>Australia dispatched two warships to help blockade the Red Sea in
the 1991 Gulf War when the US and its allies attacked Iraq after
Baghdad invaded Kuwait.</P>
      <P>In early 1998, Australia also sent its elite troops to the Middle
East to stand by as rescuers of injured American and British troops in
the event of conflict. Iraq backed down and allowed the UN team to

      <P>A total of NT$40 million worth of medicine and US$10,000 was

      <P>Upon leaning of the disastrous health conditions suffered in
these countries, the Taipei City Government requested its Bureau of
Health to approach pharmaceutical companies for donations.</P>
      <P>The mayor said during the ceremony that Taiwan does not enjoy
international status in proportion to its economic and democratic
achievements which is why he began practicing "city diplomacy" after

      <P>Mayor Chen has visited 19 countries during his 4-year tenure and

    <HEADLINE>DPP DEBATES OVER PLATFORM AMENDMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's largest opposition party, the
Democratic Progressive Party, on Thursday was overwhelmed by debate
over whether to change its official platform which advocates
independence.</P>
      <P>Calls for an amendment emerged after the party's dismal
performance in the Dec. 5 "three-in-one" elections for lawmakers
islandwide, as well as mayors and city councils in Taipei and
Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung, who chairs the DPP's faction "Justice
Alliance," led the calls for changes in the existing platform.</P>
      <P>Shen suggested that the wording be revised from "whether or not
to realize Taiwan independence should be decided by national
referendum" to "whether or not to deal with the issue on changing the
national flag and the state name under the laws should be decided by
the whole people in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The heavyweight DPP legislator from Taipei, who won in his
reelection bid, said his idea was triggered by the fact that the
party has always been criticized by opponents as being a "violent
party for Taiwan independence" during elections.</P>
      <P>Changing the platform's wording will help the DPP be more
acceptable to voters, while continuing to be consistent in supporting
de jure independence, Shen said.</P>
      <P>Opposing Shen's view, DPP lawmaker Lin Chuo-shui said the party
should not have to amend its official platform merely because of
setbacks in elections. What should be changed are the party's
campaign strategies, he insisted.</P>
      <P>The legislator from Taipei said he believes the DPP's basic
attitude illustrated by its existing platform is quite mild, rational
and pragmatic.</P>
      <P>What the voters disliked in the latest elections were the party's
radical strategies used in promoting Taiwan independence, rather its
Taiwan independence stance, Lin said, adding that this is the aspect
the party should be re-examining in depth.</P>
      <P>He argued that the act of revising the DPP's political platform
will raise doubt and be translated as the party's move away from its
basic stance -- supporting the island's independence.</P>
      <P>Lin's opinions were echoed by Yeh Chu-lan, another DPP
heavyweight in the legislature. Yeh stated that the DPP should not
change its "founding spirit" only to please voters in the 2000
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Even if the DPP were to revise its Taiwan independence platform,
no voter would believe the party, which has been a consistent
supporter of Taiwan independence, will keep its hands out of
independence issues, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>She added that the best way to decide Taiwan's future is still
mentioned in the existing DPP platform -- allowing the public to make
a decision through a national referendum.</P>

      <P>The handing out of unemployment insurance
is set to begin Jan. 1, said Chang Hou-sheng, chairman of the Council
of Labor Affairs, on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In explaining the council's budget to the legislature, Chang said
the council has reversed an earlier decision not to accept claims for
compensation until one year after the program's inauguration. The
change was made to demonstrate the government's concern for workers,
he said.</P>
      <P>The regulations, however, must be approved by the Executive Yuan,
and that approval should come before year's end to ensure the program
can begin as scheduled, said Chang.</P>
      <P>Kuo Feng-yi, general manager of the Labor Insurance Bureau, which
will oversee the program, estimated NT$3 billion in unemployment
compensation would be awarded during the first year of the program.
That figure is based on a government estimate of 2 percent
unemployment next year.</P>
      <P>To allay legislators' suspicions that the program would prove
short-lived because of a lack of funding, Kuo said the Labor
Insurance Bureau can cover the claims that will be made and that 1
percent of employees' wages would go toward the program. An
additional NT$11.1 billion in reserves has been earmarked by the
government's budget.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, those who lose their jobs will remain covered by the
government's national health insurance program, with their premium
payments coming from a government-created Employment Security Fund
pool, said Chang.</P>

are reducing the scale of their operations in Taiwan, Citibank will
increase its staff in the near future to bolster its presence in
Taiwan, the official said.</P>
      <P>The Citibank-affiliated life insurance company is to be set up in
February 1999, while the investment trust company is scheduled to be
formed in May 1999.</P>
      <P>The establishment of two additional Citibank branches will bring
to 11 its number of branches in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Affected by general declines in global stock markets, earnings
for Citibank's Taiwan branches were down in this year's third
quarter. But cumulative earnings for the first three quarters have
been enough for Citibank to achieve its 1998 growth target, the
official said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The second phase of de-mining operations on
the Republic of China-held front-line island of Kinmen formally
kicked off Friday, according to the Kinmen Defense Command.</P>
      <P>British de-mining company Specialist Gurkha Services UK Ltd. has
begun removing mines from the No. 1 and No. 2 minefields of Hsiputou
village and have called for people in the vicinity of the Gen. Lee
Kuang-chien Temple, located behind the fields, to keep away from the
work site.</P>
      <P>The de-mining is scheduled to be completed before Feb. 13, 1999,
according to the staff of Gurkha Services, which won a US$1.7 million
contract through an open tender in 1997 to clear the minefields
scattered in front of the temple.</P>
      <P>Gurkha Services said the company will ensure the de-mining
operations proceed safely, with traffic possibly being redirected
during the course of their work.</P>
      <P>Gurkha Services completed in May this year the first phase of the
de-mining operations, which concentrated on the No. 6 minefield, also
located in front of the temple.</P>
      <P>Over the nearly five-decade rivalry between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, the Kinmen command has deployed thousands of
anti-personnel and anti-tank mines on the front-line island's beaches
to deter an invasion by mainland forces.</P>
      <P>The ROC Ministry of National Defense has budgeted US$14 million
for the removal of all landmines from eight abandoned minefields on
Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Gurkha Services is staffed mainly by retired Nepalese veterans

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, MAINLAND AND HONG KONG CALLED ON TO ENHANCE COOPERATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong Kong, Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By Wang Man-na and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Hong Kong trade official has suggested
that Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China further enhance cooperation
to help one other overcome their economic difficulties amid Asia's
financial storm.</P>
      <P>T.H. Chau, Hong Kong's supervisor of the Trade and Industry
Bureau, made the suggestion in a trade and economic conference with
representatives of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and Hong Kong
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>He explained that mainland China enjoys abundant technological
resources, which Hong Kong can import to help to upgrade its
industrial technologies. Moreover, mainland China and Taiwan can
cooperate on research in such areas as Chinese medicine, computer
software and biological technology, Chau said.</P>
      <P>In addition, competitive businesses from Taiwan and Hong Kong can
help mainland Chinese state-run companies improve productivity, while
Hong Kong can provide not only capital but also its legal knowledge
and know-how in international business operations, the Hong Kong
official said.</P>
      <P>Chau's views on cooperation among the three Chinese economies
were echoed by the conference's participants, most of whom were
members of chambers of commerce in Hong Kong, Taiwan or mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong are all major trade partners
of one another, while Hong Kong is the mainland's largest source of
foreign capital and Taiwan the second-largest source, according to
the Association of Chinese Businesses in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>A representative of the association revealed at the conference
that investments from Hong Kong and Taiwan in the mainland account
for more than 60 percent of all foreign investment in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Affected by the Asian financial meltdown, Taiwan's exports
dropped by 9 percent in the first 10 months of this year, while those
of Hong Kong slid 5 percent. Mainland China, however, achieved modest
export growth of 1.3 percent over the same last-year period.</P>
      <P>Boosting the level of trade and cooperation among the three
economies would help them the combat the ill effects of the region's

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN STRAIT STABILITY IS IN US INTEREST: PRESIDENT LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said on Friday
that the development of relations across the Taiwan Strait has a
direct bearing on the well-being of all Chinese and is also critical
to the stability of the entire Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>"At the moment, maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan
Strait is crucial and complies with the US national interest," Lee
said while meeting with a US congressional delegation headed by
Senator Tim Johnson (SD-D).</P>
      <P>Lee told his guests that the Republic of China has continued
promoting democratic reforms and human rights protection over past
years.</P>
      <P>"In other words, the ROC's persistent political ideals are
consistent with the traditional US spirit of upholding democracy,
fairness and justice," Lee noted.</P>
      <P>The president went on to say that although Taiwan has limited
arable land and natural resources, it has managed to emerge as an
economic powerhouse in East Asia. "For instance, the ROC
outpaces mainland China in per capita purchasing power," he added.</P>
      <P>For his part, Senator Johnson said this is his second visit to
Taiwan. "I first visited here in 1991. I found that the ROC has made
phenomenal progress in various fields over the past seven years,"
Johnson said, adding that he was particularly impressed by the ROC's
strength and resilience in withstanding the year-long Asian financial
turmoil.</P>
      <P>In reply, President Lee said the Asian financial and economic
woes have resulted from a variety of factors. "The basic reason
behind the ROC's ability to shun the brunt of the Asian financial
crisis is its pragmatic and down-to-earth economic development
strategy," he said.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that he personally does not agree with the
so-called "Asian value" concept. "All men are created equal. All
people, regardless of their races or colors, should be subject to
same human rights and behavior standards."</P>
      <P>Noting that political democratization and economic liberalization
and globalization are the ROC's consistent national policy and
stance, Lee said the ROC will continue striving for sustained
economic growth and for entering major international organizations.</P>
      <P>Lee also expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the long-term US
congressional support for the ROC's national cause. "We'll always
remember the friendship and goodwill the American people have shown
to us," he added.</P>
      <P>Johnson arrived in Taipei on Thursday for a four-day visit. He
told Lee that he will continue to promote closer economic
exchanges and cooperation between the United States and Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STABLE GROWTH, INDUSTRIAL UPGRADING KEEP TAIWAN ANCHORED AMID STORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Stable and steady economic growth and the
continual upgrading of Taiwan's industrial structure are two reasons
why Taiwan's economy has been among those least affected by the Asian
economic crisis, Vice Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Other factors that have enabled Taiwan to weather the present
storm better than many of its Asian neighbors are the island's
sizable current account surplus, large foreign exchange reserves, low
levels of foreign debt, dynamic development of small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and correct government policies, Yen
said.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on Taiwan's monetary market development,
Yen said Taiwan's well-established economy, whose foundation is sound
and which has sustained stable growth over recent decades, is the
major reason Taiwan has remained relatively unscathed by the regional
economic turmoil.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth, which has averaged 6 percent annually
over the last 10 years, is the second highest in Asia, behind only
that of mainland China. It is also among the world's top 10 economies
in terms of sustained growth, Yen said.</P>
      <P>The successful upgrading of Taiwan's industrial structure, from
labor-intensive industries to capital- and technology-intensive ones,
is another source of strength for Taiwan's economy, Yen noted. Taking
companies listed on the Taipei Stock Exchange as an example, Yen said
most of the high-performing blue-chip companies on the market 10
years ago are no longer stars.</P>
      <P>The island's sizable two-way trade surplus and current account
surplus, which reflects a rise in debts owed by other countries to
Taiwan, have also made it financially strong, he added. The current
account is composed of merchandise and service trade, as well as
unrequited transfers.</P>
      <P>Compared with Taiwan, Yen said most of the hard-hit Southeast
Asian countries have high levels of foreign debt. On the contrary,
Taiwan holds foreign assets totaling more than US$160 billion,
including US$90 billion owned by the government and US$70 billion
owned by the private sector, he said. But Taiwan's foreign debts,
owed as the result of public development projects, total only US$74
million.</P>
      <P>SMEs have been the backbone of Taiwan's economic growth, Yen
noted. Unlike South Korea, whose government encouraged the
development of business and industrial conglomerates, Taiwan's
government gave full support to SMEs, he said.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan's SMEs stress profit and flexibility in their
operations and management, they have been able to withstand the
adversities encountered during the region's financial troubles, Yen
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yen said the results of the government's efforts to
expand domestic demand are expected to become apparent in the second
half of next year. By then, Taiwan's economy will outperform by an
even wider margin those of other Asian countries, he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Dec. 17 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien toned
down his initially enthusiastic support Thursday for US-British air
strikes against Iraq.</P>
      <P>Chretien qualified his position by saying the situation did not
make him happy. His initial response to the first bombings Wednesday
in Baghdad was that Saddam Hussein "asked for it."</P>
      <P>The change in language a day later brought Chretien's position
closer to that of visiting French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who
has expressed concern over the human costs of the military action.</P>
      <P>"We also deplore to a certain point that the Americans and the
English were forced to act," Chretien told a news conference, using
Jospin's words. "We wish Saddam Hussein had not caused this attack by
the British and the Americans."</P>
      <P>While Chretien felt the attack was inevitable, his guest did not
think so. "We have from one side American frustration, on the other
side Iraqis' irrationality. It looked in the last few days that it
was inevitable, but inevitable does not mean necessary," said Jospin.</P>
      <P>"Of course, we hope that Saddam Hussein eventually respects the
obligations that the international community imposed on him, so that
the situation can become normal and the embargoes can come to an end
and the population will not suffer as it suffers," said Chretien.</P>
      <P>Chretien played down any differences in the French and Canadian
response to the attacks after meeting Jospin, saying it was a matter
"we interpret somewhat differently."</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVER 70 PERCENT OF TAIWAN YOUNGSTERS HAVE SEEN PORNOGRAPHIC FILMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Youngsters in Taiwan are greatly curious
about sex, and up to 71.5 percent have seen a pornographic film, a
survey released by the Youth Development Foundation on Friday showed.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by National Chengchi University at the
request of the foundation, also found that the number of male
youngsters who have seen pornographic films is higher than that of
female youngsters, with 81.6 percent of young men and 60.7 percent of
young women saying they have seen one.</P>
      <P>In terms of age, 80.9 percent of those between 18 and 22, and
56.8 percent of those between 15 and 17 have seen pornographic
films.</P>
      <P>Seventeen percent of the youngsters polled said they have had
sex. The number was significantly higher among those aged 18-22
(25 percent) than among those aged 15-17 (4.5 percent).</P>
      <P>Wang Li-jong, one of the scholars who participated in the
survey, said that several surveys have shown that Taiwan
youngsters have an attitude toward sex that is more open than the
attitudes of youngsters in some other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>The survey also said that youngsters worried most about their
school homework (41.2 percent), followed by jobs (11.3 percent)
and their individual financial situation (6.2 percent).</P>
      <P>Some 17.5 percent said that they have thought of committing
suicide. The youngsters also said they would seek opinions from
friends (48.6 percent) and their families (22.6 percent) if they have
problems. While only 0.4 percent said they would confide in their
teachers.</P>
      <P>Wang said a worrying phenomenon is that youngsters are seeking
views from their peers, who are considered the least able to offer
solutions to problems. This indicates that youngsters have no trust
in their families and schools.</P>
      <P>As for future careers, 9.9 percent said they would like to work
in the information sector, 7.1 percent in the education sector, 4.9
percent in the service sector, 4.8 percent in the commercial
sector. 4.1 percent in the financial or banking sector and 3.7
percent in the arts.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between Nov. 28 and Dec. 3 with

    <HEADLINE>ROC REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES IN MIDDLE EAST HEIGHTEN ALERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
on Friday that it has ordered all of the Republic of China's
representative offices in the Middle East to heighten alert in the
wake of fresh air strikes against Iraq by US-led forces.</P>
      <P>"We have instructed our representative offices in the Middle East
to strengthen protection for ROC nationals in the region as the
US-British forces launched two rounds of punitive air raids on the
Iraqi capital of Baghdad on Thursday," said MOFA spokesman Roy Wu.</P>
      <P>Wu said even though the ROC is not a member of the United
Nations, it hopes Iraq will allow special UN inspection teams to
examine its arsenal in line with UN resolutions.</P>
      <P>"Only an immediate compliance with the UN resolutions can save
the Muslim country from further punitive attacks and restore regional
peace," Wu noted, adding that the ROC fully supports the UN
resolutions on the inspection of Iraqi weapons.</P>
      <P>In order to protect the personal safety and property of ROC
expatriates in the region, Wu said the ministry has ordered its nine
outposts in eight Middle East countries to reinforce contacts with
and services with ROC nationals there.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said the ROC's representative offices in Jordan,
Kuwait, Israel and Saudi Arabia have informed the ministry of their
various protective measures for ROC expatriates in those countries.</P>
      <P>"All those offices have set up emergency hotlines to facilitate
contacts with expatriates," a MOFA official said, adding that the
ROC's representative office in Israel has advised people there not to
travel to that country for the time being.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the two Taiwan carriers that provide flight services
over the Middle East said on Friday that US-British air strikes
against Iraq have so far not incurred any traffic disruption apart
from a few detours.</P>
      <P>EVA Airways has adjusted its routes for European-bound flights
that fly over the controlled zone of Bahrain, while China Airlines
reported no change as all its flights destined for Europe have always
flown over Abu Dhabi instead of Bahrain.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPC TO EXPLORE OIL IN MAINLAND CHINA, SOUTHEAST ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC)
is substantially reshaping its overseas oil exploration plans,
abandoning non-profitable projects and accelerating those in mainland
China and the Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>CPC Chairman Chen Chao-wei, who was delivering a report at the
Legislative Yuan, said the CPC will take decisive actions against
those investment projects that are losing money, such as the one in
Kazakhstan, and others that it has tried to offload without success.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CPC has decided to accelerate cooperative projects
in mainland China, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, South America and
North America, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The projects in mainland China are likely to kick off first if
the two sides agree that joint ventures will be undertaken on equal
footing and the sovereignty issue will be put aside, the CPC chairman
said.</P>
      <P>Initially, the CPC's offshoot, the Overseas Petroleum Investment
Corp. (CPIC), and mainland China's National Offshore Oil Corporation
(CNOOC) will jointly pitch in US$900,000 into a project on physical
prospecting in the Chaoshan oil structures near mainland China's
coastal Guangdong province, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Under an agreement signed by the CPIC and CNOOC last March and
has been endorsed by the ROC Mainland Affairs Council, the two sides
will conduct physical exploration in an area of 15,400 square
kilometers to the south of Zhuhai to determine the volume of oil and
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) deposits in the area.</P>
      <P>During a series of questions at the Legislative Yuan, legislators
from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) expressed
skepticism over the CPC's efficiency in designing and engaging in
exploration projects overseas. They said the return rate of the
prospect project in Kazakhstan, valued at US$515 million, was zero,
while a similar one in Ecuador, which cost US$533 million, was also
zero.</P>
      <P>Currently, the CPC maintains 10 oil-drilling and related
exploration projects in six countries overseas, which include
Indonesia, Ecuador, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17  (CNA)
(By Angel Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
expressed concern Thursday on the possible effects US-British air
strikes on Iraq may have on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lee said ROC ministries should monitor the situation in the Gulf,
as well as mainland China's response to the US military strikes
against Iraq.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks after listening to briefings from officials
with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of National
Defense and the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Present at the briefings were ROC Vice President Lien Chan,
Premier Vincent Siew, Secretary-General to the President, Huang
Kun-hui, National Security Council Secretary-General, Ding Mou-shih,
Foreign Minister Jason Hu, Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling,
Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang, deputy Secretary-General to the
President, Su Chi, and National Security Bureau (NSB) Director Yin
Tsung-wen.</P>
      <P>The United States and Britain launched a series of air strikes
against Iraq on Thursday.</P>
      <P>At the same meeting, Lien reported on his recent visit to the
ROC's four allies in Central America hard hit by Hurricane Mitch. He
also reported on how Washington is assisting nations in the region,
as well as on mainland China's attempted diplomatic suppression of
Taiwan, according to a high-ranking ROC official. Lien conveyed
during the meeting the US State Department's appreciation of Taiwan's
efforts in providing relief to Central American countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ministries of defense, economic affairs and
foreign affairs, as well as the NSB, submitted evaluation reports on
the air strikes' effects on Taiwan's domestic oil supply, on regional
security and on cross-strait relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC GROWTH TO SLOW IN 1999: ECONOMIC INSTITUTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Angel Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy faces tough times ahead
which will put the estimated rate of economic growth below 5 percent
in the first quarter of 1999, the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic
Research predicted on Friday.</P>
      <P>However, the economy could rebound in the second quarter after it
reaches a record low of 4.43 percent growth in the first quarter,
according to the institution.</P>
      <P>The dismal expectations are based on low investor confidence in
the local economic situation in the new year, Chung-Hua
representatives said. They added that a decline in investments will
lead to decreases in production and imports.</P>
      <P>Another reason for the pessimism is an expected downturn in
global trade in 1999, leaving Taiwan's export and import growth rate
stagnate at 2.95 percent and 2.79 percent respectively, the institute
noted.</P>
      <P>However, Chung-Hua economists foresee a 9.43 percent growth in
private sector investment in the new year. The figure will likely
reach only 0.21 percent in the first quarter of 1999 due to the delay
in construction of an express railway and businesses postponing their
investment plans, the institute added.</P>

      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Friday asserted
that he was not seeking to run as vice president on the ruling
Kuomintang ticket in Taiwan's vice presidential elections slated for
2000.</P>
      <P>Siew was responding to questions from Democratic Progressive

      <P>Speaking at the Legislative Yuan's plenary session, Siew also
said he would announce his decision on the cabinet's resignation
before the new legislature convenes on Feb. 1, 1999.</P>
      <P>Previously, appointment of cabinet members required approval by
the legislature and the Executive Yuan traditionally resigned en
masse to facilitate such an approval after a new legislature was
elected. However, amendments to the ROC Constitution do not include

    <HEADLINE>GULF TENSION WILL NOT AFFECT CROSS-STRAIT TIES: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The current tension in the Persian Gulf
will not have any adverse impact on relations across the Taiwan
Strait, Premier Vincent Siew said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Siew made the statement in response to questions in
the legislature from Legislator Lin Jui-ching from the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Lin said while Beijing has angrily denounced US-British air
strikes against Iraq, Taiwan has thrown its support behind the
attacks due to the Middle Eastern country's refusal to allow United
Nations inspection teams to examine its arsenal.</P>
      <P>"I suspect that the conflicting attitude toward the Iraqi issue
may strain cross-strait relations," Lin said, adding that he was also
concerned whether the government has made an overall review of the
possible impact of the current Persian Gulf situation on crude oil
prices.</P>
      <P>In reply, Premier Siew said the United States and Britain have
launched air raids on Iraq in line with UN resolutions.</P>
      <P>"While not a UN member, the Republic of China is a member of the
international community. We respect UN resolutions and therefore
support the US-British bombing of Iraq for its defiance of the UN
rules," Siew explained, adding that the ROC is hopeful that Iraq will
cooperate with the UN weaponry inspection teams and abide by all
related rules to restore peace in the region as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The premier further said even though the ROC's stance on the
US-British air strikes against Iraq differs from mainland China's,
such differences are not expected to have any negative bearing on
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>As for the crude oil price issue, Siew said the current Persian
Gulf tension is a temporary phenomenon. "As long as the weapons
inspection dispute can be resolved soon, crude oil prices are not
expected to fluctuate drastically," he said, adding that the
government will closely monitor the situation.</P>
      <P>The ROC relies heavily on imports for its crude oil supply and
Middle East countries are its major source of import.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said it has
ordered all of the ROC's representative offices in the Middle East to
heighten alert in the wake of fresh air strikes against Iraq by
US-led forces.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has poor records in protecting
women and children, according to a study by the World Vision of
Taiwan released on Friday.</P>
      <P>The study shows that an average of 112 child abuse cases and 65
women abuse cases has been reported in Taiwan per month over the
past three years.</P>
      <P>The World Vision of Taiwan issued the report to mark the third
anniversary of the founding of its children and women protection
center.</P>
      <P>The organization said it has handled a total of 4,067 appeals
for sheltering abused children through county and city governments
over the past three years. During the same period, it has also
received 2,259 applications for protecting abused women through
various local governments.</P>
      <P>Among the child abuse cases, 27.8 percent were related
inappropriate parental nurturing; 15.5 percent related to physical
maltreatment; 7.1 percent related to spiritual abuse; 6.3 percent
related to sexual abuse.</P>
      <P>Of the child abusers, 1,841 were men and 1,395 were women.
Moreover, the study shows that parents accounted for 75.8 percent of
alleged child abusers, with fathers making up 56.1 percent and
mothers forming 19.7 percent.</P>
      <P>Among the reported women abuse cases, 68.8 percent were related
to physical abuse; 25.6 percent related to spiritual abuse; and
sexual abuse accounted for 3.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Most noteworthy was that an overwhelming majority of 95.5 percent
of the women who have sought the World Vision's assistance over
the past three years have been abused by their husbands. About 3
percent were abused by their live-in lovers and slightly more than 1
percent were abused by their former spouses.</P>
      <P>The study also found that 34.9 percent of those women began to
endure domestic violence within the first year of their marriage and
that about half of the abused women aged between 31 and 40. Some 16
percent of abused women had married for more than 20 years.</P>
      <P>The World Vision of Taiwan said it will expand its current
youngsters and women protection center into a family protection
center. Under its expansion project, the organization will open a
new women's counseling hotline on Dec. 28.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Chinese Association for Human Rights also said on
Friday that Taiwan has failed to live up to the world children's
rights standards this year.</P>
      <P>The non-profit organization uses four measurements to gauge
the children's rights situation in Taiwan in 1998 -- basic human
rights, social rights, education rights and health rights.</P>
      <P>The organization sent questionnaires to 100 experts in eight
related professions. According to their evaluations, Taiwan
received a score of 2.7 points for its children's rights protection
in 1998. The minimum passing score is 3 points.</P>
      <P>The organization said the outbreak of the enterovirus epidemic
earlier this year was to blame for the retrogression in Taiwan
children's health rights.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the survey found that Taiwan has made progress in
children's social rights over the past year, with youngsters
enjoying increased opportunities to take part in social activities.</P>
      <P>The association also said that local mass media's failure to pay
attention to their role or function in children's education has
undermined local youngsters' educational rights.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US TRADE DEFICIT WITH TAIWAN HITS NINE-YEAR HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US exports to Taiwan have dropped for
eight consecutive months, a rarity in the last 20 years of bilateral
trade, according to the latest US trade report released on Thursday.</P>
      <P>A further decline is expected to increase the US trade deficit
with Taiwan to a record high since 1989, the US Department of
Commerce (DOC) report said.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan was the top Asian tiger in terms of total export
value and export growth to the United States in the first 10 months
of this year, Taiwan imports from the US posted negative growth from
March to October.</P>
      <P>US exports to Taiwan did not begin to undergo negative growth
until March, with double-digit figures appearing in the months from
June to October.</P>
      <P>US exports to Taiwan dropped by 24 percent in June, 27 percent in
July, 24 percent in August, 19 percent in September, and 10 percent
in October, according to the DOC report.</P>
      <P>During the January-October period, US exports to Taiwan fell a
total of US$1.72 billion, or 10.4 percent, from record levels set
during the same period last year, the report showed.</P>
      <P>Due to lower demand in Taiwan for US goods and moderate growth in
Taiwan export to the United States, the US' trade deficit with Taiwan
reached US$12.67 billion in the first 10 months of this year, the
highest compared to the same period over the last nine years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is now the US' fourth largest source of trade deficit,
following Japan, mainland China and Canada. Last year, the island was
the US' sixth largest source of trade deficit.</P>
      <P>The growing trade imbalance has reportedly raised concern in
Washington. DOC Undersecretary David Aaron recently said that
Congress will take a more active role in setting up bills in support
of trade protection measures to help US businesses compete with their
foreign counterparts.</P>
      <P>According to the DOC's trade statistics during the first 10
months of this year, Taiwan is at present the United States' seventh
largest trading partner after Canada, Japan, Mexico, Britain,
mainland China and Germany.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was listed as the US' seventh largest market for exports,
and the seventh largest import resource, the statistics showed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FLIGHT EXPERTS CALL FOR GREATER SAFETY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Noting that Asia has a higher air accident
rate than other parts of the world, participants at a flight safety
conference on Friday called for greater efforts to improve flight
safety.</P>
      <P>The 8th Annual National Airline Safety Conference, sponsored by
Formosa Airlines, included representatives from airlines, scholars
and government officials in charge of aviation.</P>
      <P>Yuan Hsin-yuan, president of Flight Safety Foundation in Taiwan,
said according to statistics collected by aircraft manufacturer
Boeing, there is an average of 1.4 air accidents in the world for
every one million flights.</P>
      <P>In terms of regions, Africa is the most dangerous with 9.5
accidents per million flights followed by Latin America with 4.7, 2.7
in mainland China, 2.3 in Asia (not including the mainland), 1.9 in
the Middle East, 0.8 in Europe, and 0.5 accidents in North America
and Oceania, Yuan said.</P>
      <P>With the recent advances in technology, accidents have been kept
to relatively low rate over the past decade but as air transportation
volume is expected to double in the next 15 years, accident rates are
expected to increase. Therefore, it is important that flight safety
be effectively increased along with volume to minimize accidents,
Yuan noted.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the conference, Chang Kuo-cheng, deputy director of
the Civil Aeronautics Administration, agreed that the air accident
rate for Taiwan is too high. He added that the CAA has set as its
target zero accidents in the future.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is concerned about the recent
arrests of Wang Youcai, Qin Yongmin, and other dissidents in mainland
China, Vice Chairman Hseu Ke-sheng of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) in Taipei said Friday at a press conference.</P>
      <P>Wang and Qin were recently arrested and put on trial for
attempting to set up an opposition party called the "China Democracy
Party."</P>
      <P>Hseu said that democracy is based on the respect for human rights
and the rule of law, and that democratization has become a trend in
the whole world. He expressed the hope that mainland China will
initiate democratic reform as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>He also refuted certain mainland Chinese articles criticizing
Taiwan for playing the "democracy card." Taiwan is pursuing national
unification under the principles of democracy, freedom, and an
equitable distribution of wealth for all Chinese people, he said,
adding that the results of the elections held in Taiwan on Dec. 5
will not affect Taiwan policy toward mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'NEW TAIWANESE' IS NOT PRECURSOR TO INDEPENDENCE: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui's "New Taiwanese" is
in line with his support of an "esprit de corps" and is not a
precursor to a declaration of Taiwan independence, Premier Vincent
Siew said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Lee first coined the phrase during the campaign period for the
Dec. 5 elections, calling for people from all walks of society in
Taiwan to unite under a common identity.</P>
      <P>It is a natural derivative of Lee's calls for a united front
rather than a trick to gain support from voters, Siew said in an
interpellation session at the legislature.</P>
      <P>He rejected a suggestion by a pro-independence legislator that
the idea of a "New Taiwanese" should be developed as a basis for
Taiwan independence, saying that Lee used the term to create a common
identity for various parochial groups on the island.</P>
      <P>Siew said any attempt to fit the concept of a "New Taiwanese"
into a pro-independence platform would be taking it completely out of
context as Lee has stated that, "Taiwan independence does not make
any sense" because the Republic of China on Taiwan has long been a
sovereignty recognized by at least 27 nations around the world. Siew
was referring to comments Lee made to the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri
Shimbun on Friday.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the democratic process in
Taiwan is young and full of flaws, the Dec. 5 elections proved that
democracy can be implemented in an East Asian setting, the Straits
Times said on Friday in a commentary.</P>
      <P>If democracy means that people get to exercise the right to elect
the candidate they like best, then the Taiwanese model has surely
passed the test.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to elections for legislators, as well as city
councils and mayors in Taipei and Kaohsiung, a variety of people
ranging from scholars to the man on the street engaged in active
debate.</P>
      <P>Voters were eager not only to cast their ballots, but were also
engaged in expressing their views -- even dissenting non-mainstream
ones, the daily noted.</P>
      <P>The recent elections showed that people were not coerced in any
way in their selection of candidates, for this, the Taiwan government
can truly be proud of its democratization efforts.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of democracy displayed in Taiwan was the
multi-party system in which parties compete to win support for their
platforms. Theoretically, such competition ensures that the most
suitable, if not the best, candidate holds public office, the paper
said.</P>
      <P>This was true in the Taipei mayoral race. Ideological issues
aside, almost all Taipei residents agreed that they were lucky to
have such a high quality of candidates running for the post, it
added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) sees no
immediate need to lower its rediscount rate, secured loan rate or
bank reserve requirement, Deputy Governor Hsu Yi-hsiung said during a
regular news conference.</P>
      <P>As the current interbank offered rate is at around 4.9 percent,
down more than 2 percent from early January's 7.33 percent, the CBC
considers this level reasonable, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>He indicated that the CBC has proceeded with offsettings in the
capital market which has resulted in a glut in Taiwan's capital
market -- another reason why the CBC does not need to lower rates.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Cabinet's request for the CBC and other
related Cabinet-level units to offer their plans for the recovery of
domestic economy, Hsu said the CBC has been adopting a loose monetary
policy, including lowering bank deposit reserves, rediscount rates
and secured loan rates on numerous occasions, as well as releasing
NT$30 billion from the postal savings deposits into the capital
market.</P>
      <P>The CBC has even proceeded with open-market operations in

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MAY OFFER TAX CREDIT TO INVESTMENTS DEALING WITH Y2K</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is considering offering tax
credit to businesses invested in solving the Y2K issue which is
expected to cripple computer systems worldwide on Jan. 1, 2000,
Premier Vincent Siew said on Friday.</P>
      <P>In an opening speech at a seminar organized by a local business
magazine, Siew said the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry
of Finance are working out a program to relieve the burden in dealing
with the problem, in addition to soft loans offered by several local
banks to help industries update their computer systems.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Y2K bug -- which stems from the computer's
failure to differentiate the year 2000 from zero due to a two-digit
dating system -- was one of the most urgent issues facing the world,
Siew said the Executive Yuan has set up a panel to deal with the
problem.</P>
      <P>Noting that the magnitude of the issue cannot be overstated, Siew
cited experts' estimates that the bug will seriously affect about 90
states worldwide, crash the computer systems of about half of the
world's firms, and wipe out about 10 percent of them outright at the
start of 2000.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan ranked third in the world in the manufacture of
computer hardware and 10th in the manufacture of software, it lags
far behind in 20th place in software development, noted the premier.</P>
      <P>Warning industries not to make little of the problem, Siew said
the complexity and difficulty of the Y2K bug were underlined by the
unexpected glitches in software designed by Microsoft to tackle the
problem, and the US$1 trillion set aside by the United States
government to cope with it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC POISED TO STEP UP REFORMS: SIEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One of the reasons why Taiwan has escaped
the Asian financial crisis is due to its reforms, and the island is
poised to continue with them, ROC Premier Vincent Siew said recently
in an interview with US-based Business Week magazine.</P>
      <P>In the magazine's latest issue released on Friday, Siew stressed
that the Republic of China government has undergone a series of
reforms and the ruling Kuomintang's victory in recent elections
showed that the people of Taiwan has strong confidence in the KMT.</P>
      <P>The party's success in winning over a majority in the 225-seat
legislature will help the government boost political stability in
Taiwan and forge stable relations with mainland China, Siew stated.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the election results will help forge closer ties
with the mainland, Siew said the ROC government has always been very
pragmatic in its dealings with mainland China and the future of
bilateral ties depends on whether Beijing will respond with the same
attitude.</P>
      <P>Turning to the impact of Taipei's pragmatic diplomacy on
Washington-Beijing ties, the premier made it clear that Taiwan should
enjoy a higher standing in the international community as the island
is the world's 18th-largest economy, is the seventh-largest
investment source, and has the third-largest foreign exchange
reserves.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are ruled by
two separate governments and each is a political entity, Siew said he
does not understand why the international society cannot accept this
fact. Foreign nationals wishing to visit Taiwan must apply for visas
through Taipei, not Beijing, and the currency used in Taiwan is New
Taiwan dollars, not renminbi, he added.</P>
      <P>The KMT's victory in the Dec. 5 elections has ensured its
position as Taiwan's ruling party, and the island's outstanding
performance amid the Asian financial turmoil is a major reason why
voters showed such wide support for the KMT over the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party, Business Week pointed out.</P>
      <P>With only 15 months left until the next presidential election,
KMT leaders including President Lee Teng-hui are fully aware that
they cannot afford to make any mistakes in the run-up to the race,
the magazine said, adding that Siew, one of Lee's top aides, is also
doing his best to continue Taiwan's economic development.</P>

      <P>Anti-dumping duties imposed on
stainless steel plate coils from Taiwan are the lowest among the
eight countries accused of dumping such products into the US market,
the US Commerce Department said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Duties levied on steel coils from Taiwan are 2.94 percent while
those for Japan are 35.61 percent, Mexico 23.27 percent, Germany
21.34 percent, Britain 13.45 percent, South Korea 12.35 percent,
France 11.73 percent and Italy 6.25 percent.</P>
      <P>Of the Taiwan companies targeted in the US anti-dumping measures,
Yeh-lien Co. and Tachen International Stainless Steel Co. must pay
2.94 percent duty, Dong-mong Developing Co. 0.07 percent, and
Chang-ming Ltd. Co. 0.57 percent, according to the US Commerce
Department.</P>
      <P>The department also announced that all of the German companies
and three of the Japanese firms were seen as committing the "worst
mistakes," and will therefore be required to pay duties retroactively
from Sept. 18.</P>
      <P>Stainless steel plate coils are widely used in a variety of
products such as automobile exhaust pipes, ovens, dish-washers,

      <P>The US International Trade Commission made a preliminary
determination on July 25 that imported stainless steel plate coils

      <P>Mainland China, the world's tenth largest
trading power, must joint the World Trade Organization (WTO) before
2000, a mainland trade representative told the world trade body on
Friday.</P>
      <P>"It is of the utmost importance that (mainland) China becomes a

representative of the mainland Chinese mission, was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>If the mainland becomes a member by the start of the WTO's next
session, it would help the trade body reach its goal of "achieving
universal membership," Li said.</P>
      <P>For almost 12 years, the mainland has tried and failed to meet
entry requirements for the Geneva-based WTO, which call for broad
liberalization in the trading of goods and services.</P>
      <P>WTO members are duty-bound to start liberalization negotiations
in numerous sectors including agriculture and services by 2000 under

    <TEXT>
      <P>The increasing number of foreign laborers
and illegal immigrants poses a serious threat to public security in
Taipei County, police authorities said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to Taipei County police, there are currently about
45,000 foreign nationals living in the county, 38,000 of whom are
legal foreign laborers. However, there are 1,657 reported cases of
foreign workers who have illegally left their places of employment
and have fallen into a black hole, they added.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year, Taipei County authorities have
arrested 2,029 illegal foreign laborers, as well as 71 foreign
nationals involved in 42 criminal cases. Of the 71 foreigners, 49
were Thai workers suspected of involvement in 25 criminal cases.</P>
      <P>Over the past 18 months, 42 foreign women were arrested on
prostitution charges in Taipei County. Thirty of them entered Taiwan
under the guise of marrying ROC nationals, the county police said,
urging relevant authorities to take more effective action since the
number of such cases represents a big jump from the same period last
year.</P>
      <P>Of the 30 "false foreign brides," 26 were from Thailand and four
were from Malaysia, police said.</P>
      <P>Hsintien precinct officials said the government should pay more
attention to rampant smuggling and health problems which may occur
from the rise of illegal immigrants in Taiwan. One Thai prostitute
was found to have entered Taiwan with a forged passport after having
been deported, while another Thai woman entered the island as a
stowaway, they said.</P>
      <P>In a bid to further crack down on foreign prostitutes, the Taipei
County police said they will increase their inspection of hotels,
Thai restaurants and pubs under their administration, and prosecute
operators found harboring prostitutes.</P>
      <P>County police also called for greater cooperation from the
public, adding that any valuable information they receive from the

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO FURTHER DEMOCRATIC REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC President Lee Teng-hui reaffirmed his
commitment to furthering Taiwan's democratic reforms under the
principle of the "new Taiwanese" during an interview with a Japanese
daily on Friday.</P>
      <P>Lee said in the two-hour interview with the mass-circulation
Yomiuri Shimbun that the outcome of the Dec. 5 three-in-one elections
indicated that Taiwan's democratization and multi-party political
system have gradually matured.</P>
      <P>"In the future, all of our people, regardless of their origins,
will continue to stand united and pursue further political reforms
and national development under the principle of 'new Taiwanese,'" the
outspoken, strong-willed president said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the people of Taiwan will create their own future,
a confident Lee said the Republic of China government has moved in
right direction toward democratization and "Taiwanization" over the
past 10 years.</P>
      <P>"We will continue these policies and promote further reforms in
various fields in a pragmatic, gradual manner," Lee stressed.</P>
      <P>Lee coined the phrase "new Taiwanese" during the campaign period
for the just-concluded elections for the national legislature and the
mayorships and city councils of Taipei and Kaohsiung in an effort to
foster a common identity for various parochial groups on the island.</P>
      <P>The Yomiuri Shimbun said the principle of new Taiwanese embodies
Lee's basic political ideas and concepts. Under his leadership, the
paper said, Taiwan has forsaken its unrealistic sovereignty claim
over the Chinese mainland and has managed to accomplish
Taiwan-centered democratic reforms over the past decade.</P>
      <P>The Japanese daily pointed out that all these developments will
certainly influence Taiwan people's views and opinions about the
island's relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lee made it clear in his interview with the paper's
editor-in-chief Shouichi Oikawa that a declaration of Taiwan
independence will not make any sense since the Republic of China on
Taiwan has long been a sovereign state.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Lee also stressed that he is in no hurry to
consider the issue related to the unification of the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait. "Only when the time is ripe should the issue be
tackled," he asserted.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee emphasized the need to conduct regular dialogue
with Beijing to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lee said even though there is only one China, the Beijing
government should recognize that Taiwan and the Chinese mainland have
been separately ruled by two equal political entities since 1949.</P>
      <P>While explicitly ruling out any radical, extremist policies and
strategies, Lee said Taiwan will continue promoting cross-strait
dialogue and exchanges through the two semi-official intermediary
bodies -- Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation and Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say that the two sides of the strait will be
unified only under the principles of freedom and democracy. "And
before that goal is realized, Taiwan and mainland China must be
treated on an equal footing," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Touching on the possibility of a cross-strait summit meeting, Lee
said he hopes to meet with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
whenever the opportunity presents itself.</P>
      <P>"I will not mind meeting Jiang at any place," Lee said, adding
that the most feasible setting for the proposed cross-strait summit
will be the annual informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum.</P>
      <P>Lee further stated he will not seek re-election after his current
term expires in May 2000, saying "I'll do my best to complete
Taiwan's full democratization during the rest of my four years in
office."</P>
      <P>After completing his presidential term, Lee will have two years
left to serve as chairman of the ruling Kuomintang. He said he will
continue to dedicate himself to national service in his capacity as
KMT chairman after ending his presidential stint.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Expressing his deep gratitude for the
public's support, outgoing Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong bid
farewell to all Taiwan Province residents on Saturday, his last day
in office.</P>
      <P>Wearing the same red tie which he wore when he was sworn into
office as the first popularly elected Taiwan provincial governor four
years ago, Soong thanked President Lee Teng-hui and the ruling
Kuomintang for nominating and supporting him, and the public of the
Republic of China for voting for him.</P>
      <P>Soong, who loses his job due to the downsizing of the Taiwan
Provincial Government, stressed that the feelings he has for all the
people of the Taiwan Province will never fade away. Voicing the hope
that the public has been satisfied with his past service, Soong
wished the public good luck and health and made his final farewell.</P>
      <P>Soong's emotional speech in Mandarin, Taiwanese and Hakka was
interrupted several times by enthusiastic applause from the audience
which packed the stadium in Chunghsing Village, headquarters of the
Taiwan Provincial Government in central Nantou County.</P>
      <P>Recounting that when he was first elected governor, Soong said he
vowed to do his best to learn to speak Taiwanese fluently and he has
accomplished what he had promised.</P>
      <P>He also said although he was not born in Taiwan, he felt
"completely Taiwanese."</P>
      <P>Explaining why he was wearing the same red tie from four years
ago, the governor said he wanted to show that Taiwan is a place where
there is justice, love and tolerance.</P>
      <P>The new Taiwanese will respect and love each other and have a
high degree of self-esteem, he claimed, concluding that "we may have
a different past, but it is certain that we will share a common
future."</P>

US Senator Tim Johnson on Saturday for wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>Siew thanked the senator for US support of the Republic of China,

      <P>Johnson, who was accompanied by Vice Foreign Minister David Lee,
said he will continue to support Taiwan's bid to enter the WTO as

be mutually beneficial.</P>
      <P>On the issue of how Taiwan has managed to survive the Asian
financial crisis, Siew mentioned four reasons.</P>
      <P>First, he said the island's economy is supported primarily by
small- and medium-sized enterprises which can easily adapt to market
fluctuations. Second, Taiwan's banks and financial institutions are
healthy. Third, the government's policy is transparent. Fourth,
Taiwan has been able to sustain a trade surplus and abundant foreign

    <HEADLINE>MOST PEOPLE OPPOSE EXTENDING TENURE OF INCUMBENT PRESIDENT: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Over half those polled oppose a proposal to
extend the tenures of the incumbent president and National Assembly
(NA) deputies so elections for the posts would coincide with those
for legislators, an opposition NA deputy said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Liu Ming-lung, a member of the right-wing New Party, said he
commissioned the Public Opinion Poll Foundation earlier this month to
look into public opinion about the tenure extension proposal.</P>
      <P>Results from a telephone poll of 1,062 adults residing across the
island found that 57.3 percent of the respondents opposed extending
the tenures of the incumbent president, vice president and NA
deputies to match that of newly elected legislators.</P>
      <P>Only 22.6 percent of those interviewed threw their support behind
the proposal, according to the poll results.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 42.1 percent gave a thumbs-down to the suggestion that
the tenure of newly elected legislators be shortened by a year and
seven months to match that of the incumbent president, vice president
and NA deputies. In contrast, 37.7 percent voiced support for the
proposal.</P>
      <P>Liu said the extension of tenure usually symbolizes the expansion
of power. "If the proposal is really adopted, it would mark a setback
to Taiwan's much-touted democratic reforms," he noted.</P>
      <P>The NA deputy from the minor opposition New Party went on to
demand that President Lee Teng-hui clearly express his opposition to
the extension proposal.</P>
      <P>Liu also urged the public to stop discussing or speculating on
this "unjustifiable" topic immediately.</P>
      <P>The same survey further found that 48.4 percent of the
respondents supported the proposal to abolish the National Assembly,
compared to 27.9 percent who opposed the idea.</P>
      <P>"The figures indicate that the National Assembly has failed to
fulfill its functions or to live up to public expectations," Liu
commented.</P>
      <P>The dispute over the presidential term and parliamentary system
arose recently after reports suggested that the ruling Kuomintang was
considering amending the country's Constitution to make the tenures
of the president, NA deputies and legislators coincide by changing
the term of legislators from three years to four starting with the
next legislative election.</P>
      <P>In what would be a transitional step, the KMT reportedly planned
to extend the four-year tenures of the incumbent president, vice
president and NT deputies by 19 months until December 2001 so
elections for the posts would be held at the same time as those for
legislators, who were elected on Dec. 5.</P>
      <P>Also as part of the constitutional reform package, the KMT
reportedly is thinking about "improving" the existing parliamentary
system to make it resemble a bicameral legislature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONFIDENCE IN SINGAPORE HIGH: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singaporeans polled recently are more
confident about the economy now than when the economic crisis first
broke out in mid-1997, The Straits Times reported.</P>
      <P>Eight in 10 respondents said they were more confident, while nine
in 10 said Singapore will recover more quickly than other Asian
countries.</P>
      <P>Despite the rising number of layoffs, eight in 10 said they were
"quite confident" or "very confident" that they would keep their
jobs. A total of 15 percent said they were not worried about losing
their jobs while 4 percent said they were "not at all confident" that
they would still have a job by March.</P>
      <P>While the majority of the 451 people polled were confident about
Singapore's long-term prospects, many were bearish about the next
three months. Six in 10 said they expected the job market to worsen
in the next three months and one in three said the economy would be
in worse shape than it is now.</P>
      <P>About half of those polled expect the economic situation to
remain unchanged and do not think their own financial position will
be affected.</P>
      <P>These generally cautious sentiments were also reflected in
respondents' answers on how they planned to spend their money. The
vast majority were in no mood to part with their money, saying that
they did not plan to buy property, cars, brand goods or go
overseas on holidays in the next three months.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Singapore Press Holdings Research

      <P>Hsia goes into vivid details of Soong's personality traits and

    <HEADLINE>CBC GOVERNOR ADDRESSES ASIA-PACIFIC SECURITY FORUM IN MANILA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila,  Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's top banker said
here on Saturday that Taiwan has been relatively immune to contagion
from the Asian financial crisis mainly because of its robust
economic fundamentals.</P>
      <P>Perng Fai-nan, governor of the Central Bank of China, made the
statement in a keynote speech delivered at the 1998
roundtable of the Asia-Pacific Security Forum being held in Manila.</P>
      <P>The forum is co-sponsored by four international organizations,
including the French Institute for International Affairs and
the Institute for Strategic and Development Studies.</P>
      <P>Perng said although Taiwan, like many other Asian countries, has
also experienced currency depreciation, rising interest rates and
falling stock prices in the past two years, these problems have not
crippled the Taiwan economy to the same extent.</P>
      <P>"Despite the turmoil, the Taiwan economy last year still grew by
6.8 percent with consumer prices rising by only 0.9 percent. While
the impact of the crisis will become more evident this year, an
economic growth rate of 5.1 percent with an inflation rate of 1.6
percent is still projected," Perng noted.</P>
      <P>As the manufacturing sector in Taiwan is mainly made up of
small- and medium-sized firms, its resilience and ability to adapt
have made it capable of responding to external shocks quickly, Perng
said, adding that efforts by both the government and the private
sector in research and development since the early 1990s have also
helped set up Taiwan as the technology island.</P>
      <P>"This competitive edge, along with low inflation, has helped
sustain high economic growth and a current account surplus since
1981," Perng said, adding that the huge foreign exchange reserves
built up over the years have enabled Taiwan to weather the currency
crisis.</P>
      <P>In his speech titled "the security implications of the East
Asian financial crisis," Perng said the ROC, as a member of the
international community, fully understands its obligation to offer
assistance to afflicted countries.</P>
      <P>"Beginning from this year, we have deposited a total of US$1
billion in the branches of our commercial banks in Southeast Asia to
aid the business community there. The total credit extended by these
banks adds up to US$2.4 billion. Our commercial banks have also
contributed to the co-financing programs of the Asian Development
Bank and the syndicated loans arranged by leading international
banks," Perng said, adding that by the end of 1998, Taiwan's direct
investment in Asia had already reached US$58 billion.</P>
      <P>In addition, Perng said, Taiwan has initiated a proposal on a
collateralized bond obligation (CBO) scheme at the 1998 meeting of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum held in Kuala
Lumpur in November.</P>
      <P>"As asset-backed securities, CBOs can effectively diversify
risks and inject the foreign funds needed to reconstruct economies
in Southeast Asia," Perng noted.</P>
      <P>He further said major Asia-Pacific countries should implement a
variety of policies to enhance the international cooperation
mechanism to resolve their financial woes and promote economic
well-being.</P>
      <P>"These include strengthening the information exchange system in
the international economy, establishing a regional early-warning
system and firewalls, and proposing programs for the international
division of labor and cooperation. These are future directions for
policy that deserve our attention," Perng added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>83 PERCENT OF TAIWAN RESIDENTS SATISFIED WITH SOONG: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eighty-three percent of the people of
Taiwan polled in a recent survey said they are satisfied with Taiwan
Governor James Soong's administrative performance over the past four
years.</P>
      <P>Though Soong, who is Taiwan's first and the only elected
provincial governor, stepped down Sunday, he is one of the few top
administrators who has consistently received a high approval rating
from the public.</P>
      <P>The most recent poll was conducted by the United Daily News from
Dec. 15 to 16.</P>
      <P>If Soong chooses to remain in politics, a run for president in
Taiwan's 2000 presidential elections is what the public most expects
from him.</P>
      <P>As for rumors that he will be appointed senior adviser to the
president after "retiring" as governor, 43 percent of those polled
said they would be dissatisfied with the arrangement, while 31
percent said they would be satisfied and 25 percent said they had no
opinion.</P>
      <P>In the poll 87 percent of respondents said they felt there
existed a closeness between Soong and the ordinary people of Taiwan.
Meanwhile, 82 percent said Soong's leadership while governor was his
most praiseworthy quality, while 73 percent said he should be lauded
for his administrative performance.</P>
      <P>Less than 10 percent of respondents said Soong is unkind or his
leadership insufficient, and an equally small number had an
unfavorable view of his administrative performance.</P>
      <P>Seventy-nine percent of respondents said they hope Soong will
remain in politics, while 5 percent said he should retire.</P>
      <P>If Soong were to remain in politics, 39 percent said they hope
Soong will run for president, 20 percent said they hope Soong will be
appointed premier and 12 percent said he should run as Lien Chan's
vice-presidential candidate in the 2000 presidential election.
Meanwhile, 25 percent said they did not have an opinion on the
matter.</P>
      <P>The United Daily poll of 1,440 people around the island was
carried out on the evenings of Dec. 15 and 16. A total of 1,182
people participated in the poll, which had a margin of error of 2.9
percent.</P>
      <P>Soong was sworn in on Dec. 20, 1994 after an overwhelming victory
in Taiwan's first popular gubernatorial election. One year and nine
months prior to that, he was appointed head of the provincial
government by the premier.</P>
      <P>During the time he served as a governor by appointment, his
approval rating was around 65 percent, according to polls conducted
at the time. During the first two years of his term as an elected
governor, his approval rating rose to 78 percent.</P>
      <P>His approval rating shot up to 90 percent in early 1997 after he
submitted his resignation in the wake of the ruling Kuomintang's
announcement of plans to downsize the Taiwan provincial government.</P>
      <P>Soong later agreed to serve out the remainder of his term, and
his approval rating remained at around 83 percent, with only 5
percent of those polled expressing dissatisfaction with him.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 10,000 people in southern
Taiwan over the weekend toured a Taiwan sailboat that will embark on
an around-the-world voyage starting Thursday.</P>
      <P>Visitors signed their names on the mainsail and the jib of the
"New Era" as they wished the boat success on its journey.</P>
      <P>The 16-foot long, two-sail "New Era" is a white sloop. Sailing
aboard the ship will be four crew members, including former painter
Liu Ning-sheng, who will be the boat's skipper, and a German sailing
friend of his.</P>
      <P>The "New Era" is scheduled to sail Thursday from Kaohsiung and
will visit 20 major ports around the world during its 21,250-nautical
mile journey, which is to last 82 weeks. It is scheduled to return to
Kaohsiung in November 2000.</P>
      <P>A marine corps brass band will perform Thursday as the boat pulls
out of the harbor, and well-wishers will hang strings of tiny paper
cranes from the boat in a gesture indicating wishes for a safe and
pleasant journey.</P>
      <P>Liu said he and his friends have prepared for three years for the
cross-century trip, which is expected to further attest to the
bravery of those Chinese living in Taiwan.

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BANKS TO BEGIN LISTING ECUS ON JAN. 1, 1999</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The euro, the single European currency,
will be listed on local banks' foreign exchange tables beginning Jan.
1, 1999 under the name European Currency Unit (ECU), sources from the
Central Bank of China (CBC) reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>Beginning on Jan. 1, a total of 879 banks around the island,
including 807 local and 72 foreign-invested banks, will have ECUs
listed on their daily foreign exchange lists for free trade,
officials from the CBC's Foreign Exchange Department said.</P>
      <P>To cope with the introduction of the euro on Jan. 1, the CBC set
up an ECU task force in May to provide Taiwan banks authorized to
conduct foreign exchange deals with all necessary information
regarding the new single European currency.</P>
      <P>The 20 percent of government-held foreign exchange reserves that
are held in Deutsche marks -- about US$18 billion worth -- will
automatically be converted into ECUs on Jan. 1, CBC officials noted.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Deutsche mark is the strongest and the lira the
weakest currency in Europe, CBC officials said the circulation of the
euro is expected to cut red tape and the cost of trading with
European states as fewer currency exchanges will be required.</P>
      <P>The birth of the euro is also poised to consolidate the strength
of the European Union, which has a population of 295 million people
and an economy worth US$6.57 trillion -- making it nearly equal in
terms of market size to the United States. Taiwan investors should
diversify their businesses by aggressively exploring the European
market, CBC officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BIG MAINLAND DRUG SMUGGLER SEIZED IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A suspected drug ring was apprehended on
Saturday in Taoyuan and its alleged mastermind, Yang Chien-wu, was
arrested, Taoyuan police said.</P>
      <P>Acting on a tip, Taoyuan police arrested Yang, who has allegedly
smuggled drugs into Taiwan from mainland China several times using
phony travel documents. Sources indicated that another drug smuggler
was preparing to smuggle 300 kilograms of amphetamines into Taiwan or
into other neighboring countries.</P>
      <P>According to police, Yang, who has a previous criminal record for
drug dealing and assault, started to mass produce amphetamines with
his conspirators in the mainland's Guangdong province three years
ago. He also bought heroin in the mainland and shipped it to Taiwan,
and his customers can be found in many Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Yang became wanted two years ago when the Investigation Bureau
captured some 40 kilograms of smuggled amphetamines from Yang's
factory. But the bureau was unable to capture him, because Yang was
traveling under phony travel documents, different from the ones he
had used previously.</P>
      <P>The police suspect there exists another crime ring, which
provided Yang with a stolen car and a phony driver's license and ID
card. That ring is suspected of backing Yang up while he smuggled
drugs into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Several drug dealers were arrested in Taoyuan and Taipei County,
and police believe Yang is the source of all the dealers' drugs. The
police arrested him in Taipei last week, at which time he was still
struggling to escape under a phony ID card and driver's license.</P>
      <P>Yang admitted that he mass produced amphetamines in the mainland
and that he took charge of transporting the drug. Yang's conspirator
is still wanted.</P>

      <P>A cow-breeding plan by Taiwan Sugar Co.
and an Australian company is beginning to generate profits, and
Taiwan Sugar plans to introduce its frozen beef product to Taiwan
markets in the beginning of next year, Taiwan Sugar officials said.</P>
      <P>Those raising livestock in Taiwan face various challenges, such
as environmental regulations, increasing breeding costs and pressures
for the market to be further opened amid Taiwan's drive to join the
World Trade Organization. To survive the challenges, Taiwan Sugar
moved its breeding operations abroad, opting to cooperate with
Australia to breed 30,000 cows per year.</P>
      <P>Marketing channels and promotional plans for the beef products
have been fully developed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan consumers have a preference for fresh, rather than
processed, meat. Taiwan Sugar therefore plans to market mainly
freshly packaged meat, while a certain proportion will be processed,
according to market demands.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Sugar also plans to engage in a cooperative pig-breeding

      <P>The new governor made the remark after he attended a seminar on

      <P>Chao will take office on Dec. 21. He indicated that his first job

their posts.</P>
      <P>Anyone who wishes to stay is most welcome, Chao said.</P>
      <P>Regarding the future employment of the former provincial
government staff, he reiterated the central government's pledges to
take good care of them. He said that the Fair Trade Commission of the
Executive Yuan will set up a branch in central Taiwan, while the
Council of Aborginal Affairs, whose clients mostly live in central
Taiwan, also has the need to set up a branch here.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Water Resources under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs can make good use of water experts from the old Water
Conservancy Department of the provincial government and establish a

      <P>With the establishment of these three branch institutions, there
will be many vacancies that could be filled by former provincial
government staff, Chao added.</P>
      <P>Chao has long been viewed as Vice President Lien Chan's
confidant, and his appointment is seen as a means of paving the way

      <P>Yang has called the exhibition another milestone in her struggle
to find new territory in which to express herself after deciding to
quit the movie industry at the peak of her career. The former movie
star received Taiwan's Golden Horse Festival award for best actress
two years in a row and has been named best actress at the
Asia-Pacific Film Festival.</P>
      <P>Yang, along with her film director husband Chang Yi and several
other friends, in 1987 established the Liuligongfang (formerly named
the Newworkshop) -- Taiwan's first professional glass arts studio --
not knowing that they would one day revolutionize the glass industry
on the island.</P>
      <P>Nearly NT$75 million (US$2.32 million) has been pumped into the
studio's glass sculpture research and development efforts, according
to Liuligongfang members.</P>
      <P>Yang's glass works, often featuring her favorite images of
Buddhas and Buddhisattvas, have been displayed in Asia, America and
Europe. Her London exhibition, which took place at the Victory and
Albert Museum, was the museum's first display by a Chinese artist
since 1857.</P>
      <P>In addition, seven of Yang's sculptures were added to the
collection of Beijing's Palace Museum in honor of her contribution to
the promotion of the beauty and spirit of Chinese culture.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'BEIJING SPRING' NIPPED IN THE BUD: GLOBE AND MAIL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin made
a hard-line announcement Friday that puts the final chill on the
recent flowering of democratic rights that was dubbed the "Beijing
spring," a major Canadian newspaper reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Globe and Mail was referring to Jiang's speech in which he
vowed that ,mainland China will not copy Western-style democracy and
stressed that the Communist Party must remain the guiding force in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>After pro-democracy dissidents were rounded up and put in jail in
recent weeks, Jiang told mainland China's 1.24 billion citizens that
they need to fight against foreign influences seeking to erode the
Communist way of life, the Mail said in a story with a Beijing
dateline.</P>
      <P>"The system must not be shaken, weakened or discarded at any
time," he was quoted as saying. His 75-minute, nationally televised
speech signals that mainland China's government wants to keep a tight
lid on dissent for next year, which will mark the 10th anniversary of
the Tiananmen Square massacre as well as the 50th anniversary of the
Communist revolution, the report said.</P>
      <P>"The government wants to avoid domestic protests on the
anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre, in which soldiers killed
hundreds or thousands of pro-democracy students," the daily added.</P>
      <P>The speech was meant to commemorate 20 years of economic reform,
but lacked any major pronouncements of economic or political reforms,
the Mail pointed out.</P>
      <P>In sharp contrast to his usual image as an aggressive reformer,
Jiang chose the high-profile moment to warn against foreign
influences that might destabilize the country from within or disrupt
the Communist Party's grip on power, it noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier
Vincent Siew said on Monday the streamlining of the Taiwan Provincial
Government's structure and functions is an important milestone in the
nation's modernization.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remark in a swearing-in ceremony for newly
appointed Taiwan Provincial Governor Chao Shou-po, Vice Governor
Chiang Ching-hsian, seven commissioners of the Provincial Council,
Secretary-General Chen Wu-hsiung of the provincial government, and
the heads of all provincial government departments.</P>
      <P>With Premier Siew presiding, the ceremony began at 9:17 a.m. at
the archives of the provincial government and was attended by the
heads of counties and cities under the provincial government's
jurisdiction and by other dignitaries.</P>
      <P>Chao met the press after the swearing-in ceremony and outlined
his plans for pushing provincial administrative affairs.</P>
      <P>Chao said in the ceremony that the adjustment of the provincial
government's organization and functions is the first step in, and
will serve as a locomotive for, the reconstruction of the entire
government. Trifling matters must not derail the process, and the
methods that will be used to bring the reconstruction about must be
well explained, he said.</P>

government employees, as well as coordinate actions with the central
government and respect the points of view of the heads of counties
and cities under the jurisdiction of the provincial government in the
implementation of provincial affairs.</P>
      <P>Chao thanked past provincial governors, especially his
predecessor, James Soong, and the staff of the provincial government
for their contributions to provincial administrtion and development.

in creating the "Taiwan economic miracle."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA, TAIWAN SET TO STRENGTHEN COOPERATION ON ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Bilateral cooperation on aboriginal affairs
between Canada and Taiwan is set to be further strengthened after the
two sides signed a memorandum of understanding Sunday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The memorandum of understanding on cooperation in addressing
aboriginal affairs -- signed jointly by David Mulroney, director of
the Canadian Trade Office in Taipei, and Hua Chia-chih, chairman of
the Republic of China's Cabinet-level Aboriginal Affairs Commission
-- took effect Sunday and will remain valid for 10 years.</P>
      <P>Under the memorandum of understanding, the two sides will
alternately hold workshops on issues involving the educational,
cultural, economic and social development, as well as the
environmental protection, of Canada and Taiwan's aboriginal
populations.</P>
      <P>In addition, the two sides will strengthen exchanges in
activities, including handicraft production and marketing, contests
in traditional skills, and traditional festivals.</P>
      <P>Witnessing the signing ceremony were several Canadian guests to
Taiwan, including Inuit President Okalik Eegeesiak, and Indian
chieftain Larry Sault. Also witnessing the ceremony were R. Axwell, a
parliamentarian from New Zealand, and representatives from Japan's
Ainu people.</P>
      <P>Mulroney said that with the signing of the memorandum, exchanges
and cooperation between peoples of Taiwan and Canada will become
closer, which will consequently further bolster bilateral relations
between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Shen Lyu-shun, North American affairs director at the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, also attended the signing ceremony and wished the
cooperation project great success.</P>
      <P>Shen said there are many things common to the aboriginal peoples
of both Taiwan and Canada. For example, the Canadian natives have a
famous ice wine while Taiwan's aboriginal people have millet wine,
and the number of aboriginal people in each country constitutes 2
percent of that country's total population.</P>
      <P>One difference between the two countries is the relative size of
their economies: Whereas Taiwan is a small island and Canada a very
large country, Taiwan has a gross national product (GNP) that is
about half that of Canada, Shen noted.</P>

      <P>The

government will have a brand new look as it serves as an example for
the entire government's reconstruction, Premier Vincent Siew said
Monday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NTU HOSPITAL CELEBRATES 105TH HEART TRANSPLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) Hospital
threw a party on Monday to mark the successful completion of its
105th heart transplant operation.</P>
      <P>A number of recipients of heart transplants at the NTU Hospital
and their families also attended the party to celebrate their
"rebirth."</P>
      <P>NTU Hospital Vice President Chu Shu-hsun, who also heads the
hospital's heart transplant panel, said the biggest obstacle to
organ transplants in Taiwan is the limited supply of healthy organs.</P>
      <P>"Organ donation, particularly heart donation, has remained rare
in Taiwan. As a result, many local heart patients have died in
waiting for a suitable organ for transplant operations," Chu
regretted.</P>
      <P>The heart disease expert said he hopes heart donation will
become increasingly prevalent here to facilitate transplant surgery.
At present, only five out of every 1 million people here would donate
hearts. "We hope the ratio of heart donation would increase to 25 out
of every 1 million people to match the US level in the not too
distant future," Chu said.</P>
      <P>NTU Hospital completed the island's first heart transplant on
July 17, 1987. It has since completed a total of 105 heart
transplants. The oldest surviving transplant recipient is aged 68,
while the youngest surviving recipient is only 3 years old.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 19-year-old Hou Ching-sung is the longest surviving
recipient of heart transplant at NTU Hospital. He received the
transplant at the age of 13 with a heart donated by a female student
died of a car accident.</P>
      <P>The youngest recipient is 3-year-old Hsu Wei-chun who received a
heart transplant when he was just 14 months old.</P>
      <P>Among the heart transplant recipients at NTU Hospital, four were
aged under 10, and 20 aged between 60 and 69. Shu Fu-hsien, now 68
years old, was the oldest recipient who underwent a heart transplant
two years ago at the age of 66.</P>
      <P>Chu said the success rate for heart transplants stands at 95.5
percent. The five-year survival rate is 74 percent, while the 10-year
survival rate is about 73 percent. According to Chu, major reasons
for those who died after heart transplants included rejection,
infection and suspension of taking medicine.</P>
      <P>NTU Hospital tops other domestic medical institutions in terms
of the number of completed heart transplants.</P>
      <P>A medical team headed by Wei Cheng, incumbent president of Chen
Hsin General Hospital in suburban Taipei, has completed 131 heart
transplants. But the figure included those performed when Wei still
worked at Tri-Service General Hospital.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WEI JINGSHENG ARRIVES TAIPEI FOR NINE-DAY VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's exiled leading dissident,
Wei Jingsheng, flew into Taipei Monday for a nine-day visit, the
first of its kind by the "father of democracy in mainland China."</P>
      <P>Wei, 48, is visiting Taiwan at the invitation of C.Y. Rau,
president of the World League for Freedom and Democracy's Republic of
China chapter. Wei was met at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport
by Rau and Chang Jung-kung, director-general of the Kuomintang's
Department of Mainland Research.</P>
      <P>Now living in the United States after being released by Beijing
on medical parole in 1997, Wei will view for himself during his stay
the development of democracy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He will also meet with President Lee Teng-hui, receive an
honorary doctorate from National Taiwan University and speak on how
he has strived to bring democracy to mainland China.</P>
      <P>But an in-depth analysis of Wei's visit by Taiwan's China Times
indicates his main goal is to seek concrete support from Taiwan for
the burgeoning democratic activities that mainland Chinese activists
have been promoting overseas.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan cannot provide financial support or hands-on assistance
for the Chinese democracy movement overseas, the visit to Taiwan will
be meaningless, Wei was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Born in 1950 in the northern mainland Chinese province of Anhui
to parents who were both high-ranking Communist officials, Wei was a
typical Red Guard who was raised up on the "Communists' milk."</P>
      <P>Wei, however, became disillusioned with the Chinese Communists in
the wake of the Cultural Revolution. He started the Xidan Democracy
Wall movement in 1978, advocating the implementation of the "fifth
modernization" -- the modernization of politics -- and was
subsequently imprisoned for subversion in 1979.</P>
      <P>Wei was released in 1993 as a goodwill gesture by Beijing, which
wanted to be chosen as the host site for the 2000 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>In February 1994 Wei met with US Assistant Secretary of State for
Democracy, Human Rights and Labor John Shattuck in Beijing. The visit
greatly angered Beijing's apparatchiks.</P>
      <P>In March of that year, Wei was detained when then US Secretary of
State Warren Christopher visited Beijing. He was released shortly
after Christopher's visit ended.</P>
      <P>On April 1, 1994, he was again arrested. In December 1995 Beijing
authorities sentenced him to 14 years in jail on charges of
"conspiring to subvert the government."</P>
      <P>He was released in November 1997 on medical parole.</P>
      <P>Wei's release is good, said a local political observer, but the
release does not mean that Beijing has changed its attitude in regard
to mainland China's human rights situation.</P>
      <P>Wei has been imprisoned on-and-off for 18 years in mainland
China. An internationally acclaimed spokesman for democracy in
mainland China, he has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, and
has received the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Foundation Award for
Human Rights.</P>

      <P>"We are pleased to see the end of the US-UK military action

      <P>President Lee Teng-hui told a Paraguayan
newspaper that, sooner or later, mainland China will have to change,
that the Chinese are born free, and that no government can oppress
them for long.</P>
      <P>The Paraguayan newspaper Noticias cited President Lee as saying

      <P>He emphasized that the question of Taiwan independence is not an
important issue for its people, adding that the Republic of China is
a sovereign country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AGING POPULATION TO BECOME A GREATER BURDEN TO WORKERS: CLA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The burden of supporting Taiwan's elderly
population is growing as approximately every 3.8 worker will have to
support one retired person by 2025, largely reduced from the recent
record of eight to one, statistics revealed on Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA), Taiwan marched
into the so-called "aging society" in September 1993. The United
Nations defines a society as old-aged or aging when the number of
people over 65 accounts for at least 7 percent of the total
population.</P>
      <P>Due to a reduced fertility rate, advances made in medical
treatment and a higher life expectancy, Taiwan's population is
getting old, with the number of people between 45 to 64 expected to
increase from 23.3 percent in 1996 to 31.7 percent in 2004.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's population aged over 65 will soar to 16 percent while
the burden for workers will double by 2025, the statistics indicated.</P>
      <P>Many of today's younger generation prefer to further their
education to joining the labor market soon after earning their first
degree. This can result in a reduction in the total labor force
participation rate.</P>
      <P>The CLA indicated that if the situation remains unchanged, the
gross national product will decrease and workers, or producers, will
have to support more and more retired people who become strictly
consumers, unless productivity is boosted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, statistics also showed that unemployment among the
middle- to old-aged group within the last 10 years was unstable.
Unemployment among this group was 17,000 in 1986, 9,000 in 1991 and
25,000 in 1996. In June 1998, the figure surged to 31,000 which has
been attributed to the recent spate of bankruptcies among factories
amid the region's financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Those in charge of hiring often have the misconception that older
candidates are less capable, less efficient, harder to communicate
with and demand higher salaries than their younger counterparts, the
CLA said. It added that an increase in age does not necessarily lead
to inability.</P>
      <P>The council stressed the importance of amending rules governing
compulsory age retirement and the pension plan system requiring
companies to pay pensions in one lump sum to make it easier for
elderly people to be hired.

    <HEADLINE>EXPORT ORDERS CONTINUE TO FALL IN NOVEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan manufacturers received a total of
US$9.75 billion worth of orders from around the world in November,
down 5.31 percent or US$550 million from the year-earlier level, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>Export orders usually pick up in the last quarter of the year
because of seasonal factors. However, the value of export orders
received in November hit a low of US$9.76 billion compared to
October's US$10.38 billion.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-tsung, director-general the MOEA Statistics Department,
blamed the Asian financial crisis as the culprit of November's drop.
The economic turmoil has battered the economies of most of the
countries in the region, leading the overall decline of demand and
imports, he noted.</P>
      <P>Chang estimated that the value of annual export orders for 1998
may show a decline of about 4 percent.</P>
      <P>Cumulatively, he said, Taiwan received US$108.85 billion worth of
export orders in the first 11 months of this year, down 3.86 percent
from the same period in the previous year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's industrial production in the January-November
period this year grew 4.18 percent over the same months of 1997, with
the manufacturing sector expanding the most at 3.97 percent.</P>
      <P>The information technology and telecommunications industry, the
backbone of Taiwan's manufacturing power, continued to grow in the
face of the regional crisis, Chang added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW TAIWAN GOVERNOR VOWS TO SERVE AS COMMUNICATION BRIDGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Moments after he was sworn in as Taiwan
provincial governor, Chao Shou-po on Monday vowed to serve as a
communication bridge between the central and local governments.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Chao said he will make a concerted
effort to gain a better understanding of the public's needs. He said
while his primary obligation is to protect the interests and foster
the well-being of the public, his top priority is to smoothly oversee
the streamlining of the Taiwan Provincial Government (TPG).</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew presided over the swearing-in ceremony,
which saw Chao replace James Soong, the first and only popularly
elected provincial governor of Taiwan. Soong's term officially ended
on Saturday as a result of constitutional amendments made last year
to downsize the provincial government.</P>
      <P>Chao said there was no need to compare him with Soong as Soong
was elected by popular vote and he was appointed to the post by the
central government.</P>
      <P>His mission is to restructure the TPG in compliance with the
Provisional Statute for the Adjustment of the Taiwan Provincial
Government's Organization and Functions, effective beginning on
Monday, he stated.</P>
      <P>As a government official and a member of the ruling Kuomintang
(KMT), the new Taiwan provincial governor said in serving the
interests of the public, he is also duty bound to seek public support
for the KMT. However, he noted that he will serve all members of the
public equally regardless of their political affiliation.</P>
      <P>Voicing the hope that all heads of the old TPG's 29 departments
and bureaus would remain at their posts to help him continue with the
provincial administration, he called on the 146,369 TPG employees not
to worry about their future as the central government will protect
their interests.</P>
      <P>Turing to the question of whether the streamlined TPG will have
less power than previously, Chao denied this was true. He said the
TPG will have a brighter future as it is still a juridical entity and
has the same status as a Cabinet-level ministry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REGIONAL CRISIS TAKES TOLL ON US MNC'S ASIAN PROFITS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian financial crisis which started
in July 1997 has hit US investments in the region, with income from
investments falling in every Asian country except for Singapore,
mainland China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>US investment income increased by 2.3 percent to US$648 million
in Taiwan, but the rate of return (the ratio of income to fixed
investment) fell from 14 to 13.</P>
      <P>Taken as a whole, US multinational corporations (MNC) saw their
profits in Asia fall by US$300 million to US$18.3 billion in 1997.
This compares with a rise of US$500 million to US$18.6 billion in
1996, according to the US Department of Commerce.</P>
      <P>In contrast, US MNC profits in the same period shot up from
US$43.2 billion to US$47.9 billion in Europe, from US$17.8 billion to
US$19.9 billion in Latin America, from US$1.8 billion to US$1.9
billion in Africa and from US$1.4 billion to US$1.6 billion in the
Middle East.</P>
      <P>In Thailand, where the Asian financial first erupted, yields on
investments fell 28 percent to US$581 million in 1997. Pullouts by
some MNC also slashed US fixed investments in Thailand from US$4.8
billion to US$3.5 billion in the same period.</P>
      <P>US MNC profits fell the sharpest -- 42 percent -- in South Korea,
one of the hardest-hit by the crisis. Profits sank from US$924
million to US$538 million. Investment income also fell in Japan (-6
percent), Hong Kong (-8 percent), Indonesia (-9 percent) and Malaysia
(-3 percent).</P>
      <P>US investment rose 15.5 percent to US$3.3 billion in Australia
and climbed 20 percent to US$616 million in New Zealand. It remained
unchanged at US$552 million in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>The rate of return for Asia as a whole was 13 percent in 1997,
down from 14 percent. It rose from 11.3 to 11.4 percent in Europe,
but fell from 12.1 to 11.6 percent in Latin America and 18.1 to 17.4
percent in the Middle East.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HENRY LEE PROMISES TO HELP PROBE ALLEGED MURDER CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,    Dec.    21   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Dr. Henry Lee, a forensic
scientist-turned US state police chief, promised here on Monday to
look into the mysterious death in Canada of the nephew of a murdered
ROC naval officer in charge of weaponry procurement.</P>
      <P>Lee, commissioner of the Public Safety Department of the
Connecticut State Government, made the vow at the request of Yin
Hsing-wen, a younger sister of Navy Captain Yin Ching-feng who was
murdered in 1993.</P>
      <P>Yin Hsing-wen told Lee that she suspects foul play was behind her
son's sudden death two years ago when he was studying at a university
in Quebec, Canada.</P>
      <P>"I suspect my son, Yang I-li, was murdered by the same criminal
ring that also murdered my elder brother a few years ago over a
controversial weaponry trading deal," Yin Hsing-wen claimed, adding
that she believes the two deaths were related to the French
Thomson-CSF military equipment manufacturing group.</P>
      <P>Yin presented photos showing the crime scene where her son was
found dead and other data to Lee for his reference.</P>
      <P>In response, the respected Chinese-American forensic expert said
although he is a specialist in crime scene investigations, he cannot
determine the cause of Yang's death solely based on the photos.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee promised to consult with some American experts
in related fields after he returns to the United States. "I'll give
you a reply on some of the dubious points you mentioned after
discussing them with some American specialists in related fields," he
told Yin.</P>
      <P>Yang I-li was found dead in his bathtub on Nov. 1, 1996. Canadian
coroners said after an autopsy that Yang died of electrocution on
Oct. 28 after a hair dryer fell into the bathtub.</P>
      <P>At the request of Yang's mother, the Republic of China's Criminal
Investigation Bureau (CIB) sent officers to Canada to look into the
cause of his death. CBI officers also concluded that Yang died in an
accidental electrocution.</P>
      <P>The Yin family at one time also hired private investigators to
determine the cause of Yang's death. All the details collected by
those investigators were sent to Yang Jih-sung, then director of the
CIB's Medical Jurisprudence Office, for further scrutiny.</P>
      <P>After a comprehensive review of the reports, Yang Jih-sung
tentatively concluded that the cause of Yang's death required further
investigation as the photos showed that Yang's head still had residue
of shampoo.</P>
      <P>"It is unreasonable to assume that Yang would try to dry his hair
before he finished washing his hair," the retired coroner said.</P>
      <P>Henry Lee, a graduate of the ROC's Central Police University, is
the first US state police chief of Chinese origin. He is currently
here to attend a seminar on criminal investigations and to promote a
book on his achievements in the field.</P>
      <P>Lee, 59, delivered a speech at Taipei's prestigious Chienkuo
Senior High School on Monday.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Lee said the key to success is "working a bit
harder than others." He encouraged Taiwan youths intending to enter
his profession to study hard and to be curious about everything.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Lee said in an interview with a local radio
station that an urge to pursue justice and truth was the driving
force behind his wholehearted devotion to forensic study and criminal
investigations over past decades.</P>
      <P>Lee went to the United States for advanced study in the late
1960s after several years of service in Taiwan's police force. He
received a Ph.D. in biochemistry from New York State University in
1975 and went on to serve in many US law enforcement agencies.</P>
      <P>During his decades of service in Taiwan and the US, Lee has
received a number of honors and citations for his outstanding
achievements in criminal investigations.</P>
      <P>He has helped investigated over 6,000 felonies around the world
and has testified in more than 1,000 civil and criminal court
hearings, including high-profile O. J. Simpson case in California.</P>
      <P>Lee has traveled to Taiwan several times in the past two years
to assist in the investigation of two serious criminal cases -- the
Mafia-style execution of former Taoyuan County Magistrate Liu
Pang-you and seven of his aides as well as the rape and murder of
Peng Wan-ju, a women's rights activist.</P>
      <P>Lee said on Monday that he has presented a report on evidence
analysis related to the Liu Pang-you case to the ROC's police
authorities. The report mentioned the suspect's age, height and
other traits. Lee, however, would not divulge any other details.</P>

      <P>The fighter was on its way back to the Chihhang air base in
Taitung after completing a night training mission. The warplane
crashed after its left engine was hit by a pigeon.</P>
      <P>Gen. Chen said the death of the two trained pilots was a great
loss not only to the Air Force but also to the nation.</P>
      <P>The Air Force General Headquarters (AFGH) said it will step up
efforts to disperse pigeons in the surrounding areas of all of its
air bases to prevent recurrence of similar tragedies.</P>
      <P>It also called on people residing in the off-limits areas not to
raise pigeons any more to stem such bird strike cases.</P>
      <P>"We hope law enforcement authorities will intensify crackdown on
illegal pigeon raising in areas near all air bases," the AFGH urged
in a press statement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is about to retire its aging F-5 fleet, once the backbone

      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) on Monday
named a banker as the convenor of a panel formed to stabilize the
local bourse in an attempt to calm investors scared away by the
recent series of financial crises.</P>
      <P>Following a meeting of the panel, Minister of Finance Paul Chiu
announced that Lee Yung-san, chairman of the International Commercial
Bank of China, has been appointed convenor of the panel of business
tycoons and local banks heads charged with working out ways to boost
the sagging stock market, which is weighed down by both the
international financial crisis and a series of local business
irregularities.</P>
      <P>With the new convenor in place, Chiu said the panel, which was
set up just prior to the Dec. 5 elections, will meet regularly to
monitor the bourse's movement, and will assign panel members to prop
up stock prices by bidding for blue-chip stocks.</P>
      <P>In order to encourage institutions to invest in the stock market,
Chiu also announced that financial institutions will be allowed to
hold stocks as long term investments, and that banks will not be
faulted by the Central Bank of China for holding stocks as security
for loans, even if stock prices fall below the level of collateral
required for the loans.</P>
      <P>The relaxed measures will also apply to stocks received by banks
as collateral for loans to securities brokers, Chiu said without
elaborating.</P>
      <P>The panel is part of MOF efforts to shore up the local bourse
which saw its benchmark index rise by 80 points to 6,558 on Monday.
The ministry has already funneled billions of NT dollars in
government-managed funds into the bourse in the last couple of weeks,

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China will push for
the exchange of representative offices with Mongolia and the signing
of an investment guarantee agreement to boost bilateral substantive
relations, a senior official said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Kao Kung-lien, chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs
Commission (MTAC), made the statement at a seminar on trade and
investment in Mongolia sponsored by the Cabinet-level commission.</P>
      <P>Kao said the ROC government has attached great importance to the
development of substantive relations with Mongolia because it has
great growth potential.</P>
      <P>"To facilitate trade and other substantive exchanges, we'll push
for the signing of an investment guarantee agreement and the
exchange of representative offices with Mongolia at an early date,"
Kao said, adding that he hopes the two goals can be realized in the
coming year.</P>
      <P>The MTAC has sponsored a Mongolia-bound investment and trade
promotion meeting in Taipei annually since 1992. The conference
scale was expanded this year by inviting officials, academics and
business executives from the two sides to take part in the
discussion.</P>
      <P>The agenda included Mongolia's general economic climate and
trade policy as well as Taiwan investors' operations and management
in Mongolia.</P>
      <P>Former Mongolian Ambassador to the United Nations L.
Erdenechuluun, and several incumbent Mongolian officials and
parliamentarians have come here to attend the ongoing meeting.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's investment in Mongolia remains limited. According to
official Mongolian tallies, there are only seven legally licensed
Taiwan companies in Mongolia at present and their total capital
investment accounts for a mere 1 percent of accumulated foreign
investment in that country.</P>
      <P>Kao said a lack of information about trade and investment
opportunities in Mongolia is the main reason behind the slow
growth in Taiwan's investment there.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Kao said optimistically that bilateral economic
relations will continue to grow smoothly in line with Mongolia's
progress in economic reforms and market opening. Two-way trade
between Taiwan and Mongolia increased from US$150,000 in 1994 to
US$1.41 million in 1997. "Although the amount was limited, the
growth rate was encouraging," Kao noted.</P>
      <P>Kao managed to make a visit to Mongolia in May this year,
marking the first high-level encounter between the two sides. "We
believe high-level official exchanges of visits will increase in the
future," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO MAINLAND CHINESE DISSIDENTS GIVEN LONG PRISON TERMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese dissidents Xu Wenli and
Wang Youcai, who applied to establish the local branches of the
would-be "China Democracy Party (CDP)" earlier this year, were
sentenced to 13 and 11 years in prison on charges of "subverting
state power."</P>
      <P>According to a report by the Xinhua News Agency of Beijing, the
mainland Chinese government defined the CDP as an illegal
organization. Each of the two dissidents also received a three-year
deprivation of political rights.</P>
      <P>Analysts here pointed out that the Constitution of mainland
China, the International Convenant on Civil and Political Rights
signed by Beijing in October, and the mainland Chinese regulations
governing the registration and administration of civil
organizations have all stated that the people in mainland China have
freedom of association and assembly. The conviction of the two
dissidents has made people in the whole world doubtful about mainland
China's policy on human rights, they added.</P>
      <P>The two dissidents were also accused of seeking and receiving
funds "from hostile overseas organizations in order to organize,
plan, and conduct subversive activities."</P>
      <P>If it were eventually established with government approval, the
CDP would be the first opposition party in mainland China. But the
communist government in Beijing has never permitted the formation of
any opposition party since its founding in 1949.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA AT CROSSROADS FOR DEMOCRACY: WEI JINGSHENG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is now at a crossroads in
the road to a democratic system, top mainland dissident Wei Jingsheng
said on Monday at the start of a visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The Beijing regime must either undertake political reform by
allowing the establishment of political parties and freedom of speech
and assembly, or risk the eruption of riots and even the danger of
being toppled," Wei said at a press conference upon his arrival.</P>
      <P>He noted that mainland China's current unemployment figure stands
at around 100 million, posing a great threat to social stability. "If
Beijing fails to accelerate the pace of its reforms, serious social
unrest, and even the collapse of the Beijing regime, is likely to
take place," Wei warned.</P>
      <P>"If this happens, then the Chinese Communist Party, Asia and even
the whole of the world will suffer," he added.</P>
      <P>Wei, who was released on medical parole last year after spending
nearly 18 years in jail for his pro-democratic stance, also rejected
the term "Western democracy."</P>
      <P>"The principles of democracy are applicable to all parts of the
world," Wei stressed, citing Taiwan's success in democratization as
an example.</P>
      <P>He said that due to the joint efforts of the government and
people, Taiwan has successfully established a sound democratic
system, which is clear evidence that Chinese people are as entitled
to democracy as any other race.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that it has been 20 years since the pro-democracy
movement in mainland China was first suppressed by the Beijing
authorities, and added that greater efforts must be made to promote
democracy there, as this is very important to the peace and security
of Asia.</P>
      <P>Wei, who is now living in exile in the United States, claimed
that the mainland's ongoing economic reforms have not met with as
much success as has been thought. "It (economic development) did not
benefit the general public, but just created a class of wealthy and
corrupt officials and bureaucrats," he added.</P>
      <P>He attributed this to the fact that the Beijing leadership has
been reluctant to engage in political reform.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Beijing's habit of making mass arrests of
dissidents and then releasing them one by one, Wei said that the move
is just a "smoke screen" to attempt to hide the regime's bad human
rights record. "Actually, there has been no change at all in
Beijing's human rights abuse," he added.</P>
      <P>On whether there should a timetable for China's reunification,
Wei said that it would be meaningless for any unification timetable
before the Communist Party abandons its doctrine of "one party
autocracy."</P>
      <P>Wei is in Taipei for a nine-day visit at the invitation of the
ROC chapter of the World League for Freedom and Democracy (WLFD).</P>
      <P>He described cross-strait negotiations as a positive step, but
said that they have to be conducted on an equal footing. If the
mainland continues with its attempts to annex Taiwan, then any talks
will be fruitless, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER TAIWAN PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR FINALLY TAKES VACATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Dec.  20 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Taiwan Provincial Governor
James Soong arrived in San Francisco on Sunday, shortly after leaving
his post.</P>
      <P>Speaking to a CNA reporter at the airport, Soong said this is his
first US visit as a private citizen in three decades.</P>
      <P>He recalled that when he first stepped on US soil to further his
education, he felt himself to be standing on the threshold of a
boundless world. Today, he said, he still has this feeling, and is
well aware that he has many things to do for the rest of his life.</P>
      <P>Asked of his understanding as to the true meaning of two phrases
-- "Everything, solid or subtle, is illusory" and "You should feel
free and easy at every moment" -- that President Lee Teng-hui wrote
down on a scroll as a gift for him, Soong answered that man is
supposed to be free, especially in the United States.</P>
      <P>Although he declined to talk about a meeting he had with Lee on
Friday, the former Taiwan governor expressed his deep appreciation to
Lee and the ruling Kuomintang, which promoted him in his service to
the nation.</P>
      <P>Soong lost his job due to the downsizing of the Taiwan Provincial
Government, a move promoted by Lee's leadership as a way of boosting
administrative efficiency, although rumors have been rife that a
behind-the-scenes political battle has long raged between Lee and the
popular Soong.</P>
      <P>Questioned on whether he intends to take part in the presidential
election in 2000, Soong, who was Taiwan's first and only elected
governor, was reluctant to comment, saying that he has had no time to
think about the issue.</P>
      <P>Describing his political career over the past few decades as "so
busy, I've forgotten what its like to have a good sleep or a good
meal," Soong said that not until he quit his official duties did he
realize that sleeping can be comfortable, and that a meal prepared by
his wife can taste like ambrosia.</P>
      <P>He said his US holiday will allow him a much-needed rest, and
give him time to think over many issues, including his future. "Most
important is to think of how I can treat my wife better," he added.
His wife is accompanying him on his vacation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN DISPROVES BEIJING'S ARGUMENT AGAINST DEMOCRACY: WEI JINGSHENG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   21   (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's democratization disproves
Beijing's persistent denunciation of democracy as alien to and thus
incompatible with Chinese culture, exiled mainland Chinese dissent
Wei Jingsheng said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Wei, who arrived in Taipei on Monday for a nine-day visit, said
at a press conference that Taiwan's successful transition to
democracy has exposed the falsehood of Beijing's contention that the
"Western" concept of democracy can't take root in the East, much less
in China.</P>
      <P>This partly explains Beijing's hostility towards the island which
mainland China never ceases to try to shut out of the international
community and make into an international pariah, said Wei.</P>
      <P>He attributed the island's successful democratic transformation
to three elements -- namely an active popular campaign for democracy;
a group of brilliant political leaders receptive to new ideas ; and
the ability of the island to respond to international calls for
democracy.</P>
      <P>Mainland China lags far behind in the movement toward democracy
because of the absence of the latter two elements, Wei said.</P>
      <P>He denounced Beijing's attempts to squeeze Taiwan out of all
international groups, which he described as a move intended to render
Taiwan passports "useless" throughout the world.</P>
      <P>The ploy is especially wicked viewed against the background of
Beijing's persistent calls for their "fellow countrymen in Taiwan" to
"return to the arms of motherland," said Wei, who has lived in exile
in the United States since being freed by Beijing on medical parole
in December, 1997.</P>
      <P>He admonished Taiwan to struggle for its own survival rather than
rely on Beijing's mercy, since the "communist regime has never been
lenient toward its rivals."</P>
      <P>In reply to questions from reporters, the mainland's most
renowned dissent, who has spent almost 18 years in jail, gave mixed
comments on US President Bill Clinton's Beijing trip in June, saying
that although Clinton's journey has to some extent pressed Beijing
into mending its human rights records, it sent the wrong signal to
the world that Washington backs the communist dictatorship.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on the campaign for Taiwan independence by some
local political figures, Wei said it is a question which should be
answered by the public rather than politicians, adding that the
well-being of the people should be the main priority when deciding
the island's status.</P>
      <P>Wei, who was invited to Taiwan by the World League for Freedom
and Democracy, ROC Chapter, is slated to pay calls on the Legislative
Yuan and several government agencies. A meeting with President Lee
Teng-hui has also been planned before he departs on Dec. 29.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MAKES EFFORTS TO REDUCE TRADE IMBALANCE WITH JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's trade deficits against Japan are
expected to surge to US$18 billion, a historic new record high,
officials from the China External Trade Development Council (CETRA)
said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the figure has alerted them to the need
to enhance the promotion of Taiwan products, in order to try to
reduce the trade imbalance.</P>
      <P>To this end, the officials added, CETRA has recently been
pursuing Best Corp., Japan's largest electrical appliance chain, and
one of its subsidiaries, to stock Taiwan-made products.</P>
      <P>CETRA said that 36 local heavyweight manufacturers, including
Tatung and First International Computer, have been invited to attend
an upcoming meeting with Best.</P>
      <P>Best owns now 510 chain stores in Japan and 13 overseas branches.
Its 1998 operation value totaled NT$79.2 billion (US$2.46 billion).</P>
      <P>CETRA officials revealed that the continuing appreciation of the
Japanese yen has made Best interested in buying Taiwan products,
while the rising yen benefits Taiwan's export to Japan. They urged
local exporters to grab the opportunity to penetrate the Japanese
market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT CONFIDENT OF STEADY ECONOMIC GROWTH: PREMIER</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is determined to take every
effort to move the domestic economy toward the course of steady
growth, Premier Vincent Siew said on Tuesday in a legislative
interpellation session.</P>
      <P>He said while many other Asian nations have been unable to reach
any level of economic growth, Taiwan will likely record 5 percent
growth for the year, adding that the public should have confidence in
the government.</P>
      <P>Siew was responding to questions from Legislator Cheng Feng-shih
of the ruling Kuomintang. Cheng asked how the government planned to
deal with the slumping stock market and sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>Although the island's economy is indeed in a slump, the premier
said the public should not lose confidence in the government as the
fundamentals and the economic structure of the nation are still good.</P>
      <P>It is good that the public is aware of the possibilities of an
economic crisis, but people should not be deterred by setbacks as the
government is working to strengthen the economy, Siew noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of the World Trade Organization's
(WTO) information technology agreement (ITA) have again postponed the
deadline for completing talks on extending its scope to other
products, reports said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Further negotiations will be held in February with the aim of
completing an ITA-II pact that would remove duties on 200 high-tech
products by 2002. Some poorer nations will have until 2007 to comply
for certain items.</P>
      <P>Although most ITA members, including the US and European Union,
support the proposed list, some developing countries continue to have
objections. Malaysia wants more consumer electronic products
included, while India is objecting to the inclusion of non-IT items,
such as radar and navigational equipment, and satellite parts.</P>
      <P>In 1997, WTO members accounting for more than 90 percent of the
US$600 billion-plus annual trade in information technology products
agreed to eliminate tariffs on a wide range of computer and
telecommunications goods by 2000. However, talks on ITA-II, which
should have ended in June, have proved more difficult even though the
additional product list has been more than halved in the search for a

    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  21  (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Tibetan monk who spent 30 years in
prisons and labor camps drew similarities between his experiences and
those of Jews in World War II after visiting the Holocaust museum in
Washington, The Globe and Mail reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>"Everything I saw was familiar. Everything the Jews were going
through, my people are going through now," Palden Gyatso told The
Globe's foreign affairs editor Marcus Gee.</P>
      <P>"If it doesn't stop, they will be commemorating us in a museum
soon," Gyatso said, adding that all the cultural traditions he grew
up with are being wiped out by mainland Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>The monk described five tools of torture used by his Chinese
guards, they included three electric batons and two types of
self-tightening handcuffs, one for the wrists and another for the
thumbs.</P>
      <P>Gyatso, 67, who became a monk when he was 10, said of all the
boys who were ordained with him, he is the only survivor. By 1990, he
had spent 30 years in prisons and labor camps. In 1983, when he
landed in the notorious Drapchi Prison, rations were so small he was
forced to eat mice, worms, grass and even his own leather shoes.</P>
      <P>He was released in 1992 with the help of Amnesty International
and other human rights groups. When he was freed, his only thought
was to find his way to the Dalai Lama, "tell my story and die."
Instead, he ended up turning it into a book titled "Fire under the
Snow."</P>
      <P>Despite all that he endured, Gyatso said he feels no anger toward
his torturers. "They were only doing their job," Gee quoted him as

    <DATELINE>Manila  Dec.  21 (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's continued construction on
Mischief Reef indicates Beijing's intentions to make it its forward
base to prevent other countries from exercising military control over
the area, the Philippine military said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Mischief Reef is an area of the disputed Spratly Islands which
are claimed in part or wholly by mainland China, the Philippines,
Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The Philippine military said the situation in the area remains
volatile as mainland China continues to build on Mischief Reef which
Manila insists is part of its Kalayaan Island Group.</P>
      <P>"The on-going extensive construction on Mischief Reef indicates
that Beijing is bent on making the islet a forward base to prevent
any claimant country from exercising full and effective military
control of the area," the military said in a statement.</P>
      <P>"The reef could be used as a staging base for Beijing's eastward
operations in the Spratlys in an effort to assert claim in Reed Bank
among others, the building of a pier and a structure which appeared
to be barracks, attest to China's real motive," it continued.</P>
      <P>The statement also said it is "highly probable" that mainland
China will make Mischief Reef its primary base to support oil
exploration and drilling operations.</P>
      <P>The Philippine navy has intensified its sea patrol of the
Mischief Reef area where Chinese construction resumed two months ago.
The Philippine air force has been conducting reconnaissance flights
over the area to monitor the activity.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago, US Congressmen Dana Rohrabacker flew over the area
aboard a PAF C-130 plane and saw the Chinese buildup on the disputed
reef. Rohrabacker is expected to report to the US Congress on what he
saw, including three Chinese warships stationed in the area.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CAUTIOUS ABOUT CROSS-STRAIT MILITARY EXCHANGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC government is willing to conduct
mutually beneficial exchanges with mainland China but cross-strait
military exchanges must be very carefully assessed, Premier Vincent
Siew said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks when fielding questions in legislature from
lawmaker Yen Chin-fu of the Democratic Progressive Party about Hong
Kong media reports that Taiwan and the mainland are preparing to
launch military exchanges.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are currently
under separate rule, Siew said the government's top priority is to
ensure Taiwan's continued survival.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is willing to cooperate with mainland China in peaceful
activities, but Beijing has so far been reluctant to renounce the use

    <HEADLINE>DESERT FOX SEEN AS A FAILURE: AUSTRALIAN PAPERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Operation Desert Fox was a failure and
has left the world divided over its purpose and effectiveness, while
its key target remains a threat to the western world, Australian
dailies said in editorials on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The military assault on Iraq by the United States and Britain
has failed by the measures that many outside observers would apply.
It has not immediately removed Saddam Hussein," the Australian said.</P>
      <P>Instead, the operation has "killed an unknown number of Iraqi
civilians, people with whom the US and Britain are keen to stress
they have no dispute. It has also forced a split within the United
Nations Security Council."</P>
      <P>"Russia and China have accused the UN Special Commission of
tailoring its report to allow the US to carry out air strikes,
showing that some damage has been done to international relations as
well as to Iraqi infrastructure," the editorial continued. "The
operation has probably also achieved the effective end of the UNSCOM
inspection mission within Iraq."</P>
      <P>In its editorial, the Sydney Morning Herald said: "Operation
Desert Fox has left the world divided over its purpose and
effectiveness. The timing of the four-day air strike on Iraq will
remain forever controversial, enmeshed with the constitutional
travesty perpetrated by the short-sighted representatives who voted
to impeach President Bill Clinton. But this should not cloud
assessment of its necessity.</P>
      <P>"President Clinton and the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair,
have been criticized for failing to articulate the purpose of Desert
Fox.</P>
      <P>"Yet as time passes and the threat posed by President Saddam
Hussein is no longer seen through the distorting prism of an abnormal
political situation in Washington, it will become plain that Desert
Fox, though it has no mark of victory to distinguish it, was neither
misguided nor futile, but an essential precursor to a sadly
inevitable new kind of preventative warfare," it added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC RULES OUT ADJUSTMENTS OF CROSS-STRAIT ECONOMIC POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC government will not adjust its
current trade and economic policy toward mainland China until
the Beijing government ease its hostility toward Taiwan, a senior
mainland affairs official said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"As long as Beijing fails to forsake its recalcitrant,
unrealistic and hegemonic attitude toward Taiwan, we'll not adjust
our current 'no haste, be patient' policy on investment and other
commercial exchanges across the Taiwan Strait," said Sheu Ke-sheng,
vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>Sheu made the statement in a keynote speech delivered at a
two-day seminar on the problems and prospects for cross-strait trade
and economic exchanges being held in Taoyuan county, some 30
kilometers south of Taipei. The seminar was co-sponsored by several
private trade associations with interests with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Sheu said Taiwan has spared no efforts to drive cross-strait
relations to move in a peaceful, constructive direction and
to promote bilateral economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>According to ROC statistics, Taiwan business people had
launched 21,000 investment projects, worth about US$13 billion, in
mainland China as of the end of October.</P>
      <P>Sheu said mainland China-bound investment now accounts for 42
percent of Taiwan's total outbound investment.</P>
      <P>In terms of official mainland tallies, Sheu said, the number of
Taiwan-invested companies on the mainland even had reached 40,600 by
the end of September, with a combined capital infusion of US$20.9
billion. According to mainland tallies, Taiwan is now mainalnd
China's third largest source of foreign capital.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sheu said, indirect cross-strait trade amounted to
US$157.2 billion in the first three quarters of this year,
accounting for 11 percent of Taiwan's total foreign trade for the
same period.</P>
      <P>Sheu went on to say Taiwan's exports to mainland China increased
6.8 percent in the first nine months of this year as compared with
the corresponding period of 1997. "The growth rate was the highest
among all of mainland China's major trading partners," he noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, Sheu said, Taiwan products made up 12.2 percent of
mainland China's total imports for the nine-month period, the
highest ratio for the past five years.</P>
      <P>Despite these encouraging developments, Sheu said, Taiwan
business people should remain cautious and prudent in launching
ventures across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Sheu pointed out that mainland China's economic uncertainties
have become a great obstacle to further growth in cross-strait
commercial exchanges.</P>
      <P>To make up for its slow growth in foreign exchange accumulation
and tax revenues, mainland authorities have intensified factory
inspections and crackdown on tax evasion and illegal foreign exchange
transactions since the beginning of this year. "All these mainland
actions have inflicted problems and financial losses to
Taiwan-invested companies on the mainland," Sheu said.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan is more than willing to cooperate with mainland
China in resolving various problems arising from cross-strait
commercial exchanges so as to establish a sound cross-strait market
order.</P>
      <P>Sheu further stated that mainland China, while continuing its
military intimidation and diplomatic suppression against Taiwan, has
attempted to use trade as a "united front" tactic.</P>
      <P>"Mainland China has deliberately courted Taiwan entrepreneurs
and forged direct ties with them in an attempt to alienate them from
our government or to drive wedges between them and the ROC
government," Sheu observed.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Sheu said, the government cannot adjust
its "go slow" policy toward mainland China-bound investment
activities. "We still have to give the top priority to our own
national interests in formulating trade and economic policy toward
the mainland at the moment," he stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING A LONG WAY FROM WTO ENTRY: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign trade negotiators in Geneva said
mainland China's commitment to enter the World Trade Organization
(WTO) is losing momentum as its trade ties with the United States are
worsening, the Australian reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Major problems between the two sides are the mainland's surging
trade surplus with the United States and the lack of US access to the
mainland's attractive markets.</P>
      <P>US trade officials are unhappy with the way Beijing is going
about trade negotiations with Washington -- making mainland China's
WTO entry as elusive as ever, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>US Commerce Secretary William Daley last week warned Beijing that
"trade issues could lead us to substantial disengagement from China."</P>
      <P>Daley reflects a growing discontent in US Congress about China's
trade practices and some congressmen want Washington to threaten
trade sanctions if Beijing fails to act on reducing trade barriers,
according to the US Congressional Research Service.</P>
      <P>China has the world's second largest trade surplus with the US,
behind only Japan's. The US trade deficit with China has surged from
US$3.5 billion in 1988 to US$60 billion in 1998 and the figure is
expected to grow to US$70 billion in 1999.</P>
      <P>In recent years, US companies have made public disputes with
Chinese joint venture partners over what they saw as unfair
treatment, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Daley told his Chinese counterparts last week that US companies
had gone to China, played by Chinese rules, and had invested and
transferred know-how, capital and technology. But China threw up
barriers, including "harmful rules" on export performance, local
content and technology transfer and equity requirements.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IMF SAYS TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC GROWTH WILL REACH 4.9% IN 1998</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  21  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Angel Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth will likely
reach 4.9 percent in 1998, the third highest of 28 developed
countries, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Behind only Ireland with 9.1 percent growth and Iceland's 5
percent, Taiwan outperformed all other Asian countries, the IMF's
World Economic Outlook report noted.</P>
      <P>The economic growth rate of developing economies in Asia reached
an average 2.6 percent in 1998, a record-low since World War II.
However, Asia's developing economies are expected to rebound next
year with a 4.3 percent growth rate.</P>
      <P>Taiwan recorded the highest economic growth rate, lowest
unemployment rate and most stable inflation rate among the four Asian
tiger economies, the IMF report said. Singapore's economic growth
reached only 0.7 percent, Hong Kong's was -5 percent and South
Korea's was -7 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the fund, Taiwan will see a lower economic growth
rate of 3.9 percent, a higher inflation rate of 2 percent and a lower
unemployment rate of 2.4 percent in 1999.</P>
      <P>The IMF estimates are in contrast to the Taiwan's
own higher predictions of 5.07 percent economic growth rate in 1998
and 5.24 percent in 1999.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the IMF said mainland China had contributed to
stabilize Asia's economies with its economic growth estimated at 7.2
percent for 1998 and 6.6 percent in 1999. Inflation rates in 1998 and
1999 are forecasted at -0.8 percent and 2 percent respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S MISERY INDEX THIRD LOWEST WORLDWIDE: IMF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  22 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
rated Taiwan the third least "painful" economies among 100 worldwide,
the fund said in its twice-yearly World Economic Outlook Report
released on Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's misery index in 1998 reached 4.2 percent, behind only
Singapore's 3.6 percent and Switzerland's 4 percent. The misery index
refers to a combination of inflation and unemployment rates of an
economy. As the cost of living and joblessness increase, the more
difficult or "painful" one's life is.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's consumer price index dropped from a preliminary
estimation of 2 percent to 1.5 percent, while its unemployment rate
rose slightly from 2.6 percent to 2.7 percent.</P>
      <P>Maintaining stable market prices and a low unemployment rate is
the hardest task for any government in the world to achieve as these
two counteract each other, according to John M. Keynes' economic
theory.</P>
      <P>Before 1980, Taiwan's misery index reached double-digit figures
and did not fall until 1982. The IMF said Taiwan's low index in 1998
can be attributed to a reduction in imported goods prices which
benefits deflation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, among economies whose misery index falls under 5
percent, Taiwan had the highest economic growth rate of 4.9 percent,
illustrating the complete structure of Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Japan, which has enjoyed a low misery index for many years, saw
its index rise last year to 4.1 percent and again to 4.6 percent this
year.</P>
      <P>With its rising unemployment rate and negative growth in gross
domestic product, the IMF predicted that Japan's recession-mired
economy will not rebound for quite some time.</P>
      <P>Spain was ranked the most painful country in Europe with a
misery index over 20 percent. Some economists put it down to the
social welfare scheme that pays unemployment compensation to the
jobless which causes a lack of willingness to work.</P>
      <P>The misery index for the United States fell to a 27-year record
low of 6.1 percent, which the IMF noted was one of the Clinton
administration's most pronounced political achievements. The index
once reached 17 percent during the Carter administration.

    <DATELINE>Taiwan,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Research, Development and Evaluation
Commission (RDEC) of the Executive Yuan held on Tuesday a seminar on
digital signatures and certification in hopes of the eventual passage
of legislation that would help to protect the mushrooming number of
electronic documents in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Three representatives from the US state of Utah, where the first
digital signature act was signed into law, attended the forum to
offer suggestions. In all some 200 representatives of Taiwan's
industrial, academic and government sectors took part in the meeting.</P>
      <P>Lee A. Hollaar, a professor of computer science at the University
of Utah, said Utah passed its act in 1995, which made it the first in
the world to protect electronic business through the recognition of
legitimate digital signatures. Seven US states and five countries,
including the governments and banking and finance sectors of Malaysia
and Singapore, as well as Japan's intellectual property sector,
visited Utah to learn about the state's act, he said.</P>
      <P>Digital signatures protect documents by ensuring their
authenticity and establishing the identity of the authors of the
documents, said Hollaar.</P>
      <P>RDEC officials said that a digital signature act is being
drafted, while a public hearing on the importance and specifics of
the technology is also being prepared. The draft is expected to be
presented to the Legislative Yuan for approval by February of 1999.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE HAS YET TO DECIDE WHETHER TO MEET WEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui has yet to decide
whether to meet with Wei Jingsheng, the most prominent exiled
mainland Chinese dissident who is currently on a nine-day visit to
Taiwan, a Presidential Office official said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The official was responding to a newspaper report that President
Lee has ruled out the possibility of meeting with Wei during his
stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The report was premature," said the official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>The official said President Lee's working schedule for this week
has long been arranged. "As Lee was busy stumping for candidates in
the Dec. 5 three-in-one elections in his capacity as chairman of the
ruling Kuomintang in the past few months, many of his activities have
been postponed to this week."</P>
      <P>The official went on to say that President Lee will decide in
the next few days whether to meet Wei.</P>
      <P>President Lee has so far not met with any visiting mainland
Chinese dissident due in part to avoid provoking Beijing
authorities.</P>
      <P>Many local observers, however, have been calling on
President Lee, who is dubbed by Western media as "Mr. Democracy" for
his achievements in leading Taiwan's democratization, to meet Wei to
signify the Republic of China's firm support for democracy.</P>
      <P>Wei, who was released from a Chinese prison last year after
spending much of the last 18 years in a cell for championing
democracy in mainland China, paid a visit to Taiwan's legislature on
the second day of his first trip to this island.</P>
      <P>Wei, 48, lauded local legislators for their contribution to the
island's democracy by replacing once-notorious fistfighting and
brawls with serious debate.</P>
      <P>Wei said mainland authorities had used pandemonium at the
island's parliament as proof that democracy could not take hold in a
Chinese society.</P>
      <P>However, Wei said he found that Taiwan's democracy has since
matured. "And I think even brawls are much better than a closed
society where you could not express your views freely.</P>
      <P>According to Wei, more mainland Chinese people have come to
understand that the unanimous votes being taken at the mainland's
parliament -- the National People's Congress -- are false.</P>
      <P>Wei said Taiwan's democratic experience is highly treasurable
because its democratization was voluntarily developed, adding he
believes that mainland China has much to learn from Taiwan in its
democratic development.</P>
      <P>From his talks with local politicians of different party
affiliation, Wei said he found that Taiwan's democratic development
has fully matured. "Despite their different views and stances on
various policy issues, they can respect each other and coordinate
among themselves in working out feasible action plans," he noted.</P>
      <P>While here, Wei, currently living in exile in the United
States, will take part in a Christmas Eve seminar, exchanging views
with local scholars on freedom, democracy, and human rights.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University is to present Wei with an honorary
doctorate, to be followed by Wei's speech on how he has strived to
bring democracy to mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN POLICE BREAK  HUMAN SMUGGLING RING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A cross-Taiwan Strait human smuggling ring
was broken by police on Tuesday who nabbed two stowaways from
mainland China, one snakehead, and one outlaw from Taiwan trying to
board a Taiwan-bound plane on offshore Kinmen island.</P>
      <P>Police said Chang Yung-hsiang, a 27-year-old snakehead from the
eastern Taiwan city of Hualien, Chen Lichun, 28, and Li Yixing, 27,
both from mainland China, as well as Lee Ming-teh, 27, a Taiwan
resident wanted by police who went into hiding in the mainland, were
detained by police at Kinmen airport for possession of forged
national identification cards which they showed to security officers
before boarding the Far East Air flight.</P>
      <P>The four men were turned over to the Kinmen District Prosecutors'
Office on charges of document forgery and violation of the Statute
Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area, police said.</P>
      <P>An initial police investigation showed that Chang was hired by a
man surnamed Yen to smuggle the other three men from Kinmen to Taiwan
to work and visit relatives here. According to police, Chen, Li and
Lee paid 50,000, 90,000 and 12,000 renminbi, respectively, to
snakeheads in mainland China in a bid to enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ring is the second human smuggling ring smashed by Kinmen
police in a month, and the fact that no Kinmen natives were involved
in either case indicates that human smugglers on both sides are
already very familiar with smuggling routes across the Taiwan Strait,
police authorities said.</P>
      <P>As the number of mainland Chinese people attempting to enter
Taiwan with forged documents has increased noticeably in recent
months, police said they will strengthen inspection and security
measures at harbors and airports across Taiwan to crack down on
smuggling and illegal immigrants.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA ASKS CAMBODIA TO PROVIDE DETAILS ABOUT ALLEGED TOXIC WASTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,    Dec.    22    (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) sent a letter to the Cambodian government on
Tuesday asking it to provide a comprehensive report on a Taiwan
firm's export of possibly toxic waste to Cambodia.</P>
      <P>The agency said it has never received any official notice or
report from Cambodian authorities concerning the shipment of
allegedly toxic waste to the Indochinese country by Taiwan's Formosa
Plastic Group (FPG).</P>
      <P>All information about the controversial shipment has so far come
from foreign wire service reports, the agency said, adding that
action was impossible without fuller details of the incident.</P>
      <P>"We are willing to assist in the inquiry to determine where
the responsibility lies," the Cabinet-level agency said in its
letter.</P>
      <P>EPA officials said neither the Republic of China nor Cambodia
is a signatory to the multilateral Basal Convention. "Against this
background, neither of the two countries is subject to the
the Basal Convention which bans cross-border transfer of toxic
waste," the officials said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the officials said the ROC is willing to fulfill
its obligations as a responsible member of the international
community.</P>
      <P>If necessary, the officials said, the EPA will send a team to
Cambodia to help assess the nature and toxicity of the waste, which
was found dumped outside the port of Sihanoukville early this month.</P>
      <P>The FPG, Taiwan's largest petrochemical group, has acknowledged
being the source of the 3,000 tons of waste. The group stressed that
it was certified in Taiwan as safe for landfill disposal and that
the shipment to Cambodia was conducted completely legally.</P>
      <P>"We had legally acquired an import permit from the
Cambodian government before exporting the industrial waste to
that country," an FPG executive said, adding that the mercury
residues in the waste met the internationally sanctioned standards.</P>
      <P>The FPG executive also insisted that the waste was not toxic as
claimed by Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a group of environmental activists and television
reporters left for Cambodia on Tuesday to collect first-hand
information about the controversial waste shipment.</P>
      <P>The ROC does not maintain diplomatic ties with Cambodia.</P>
      <P>ROC's Foreign Ministry spokesman Roy Wu on Monday refuted Hun
Sen's allegation that Taiwan is a "pollution" exporting country.</P>
      <P>"It is irrational for the Cambodian government to make such an
allegation before it makes any investigation into the waste shipment
incident," Wu said, adding that Hun Sen should not have played up
the incident purely based on unconfirmed reports.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's state-owned Aerospace Industrial
Development Corporation (AIDC) and the private Air Asia Company
Limited are to forge a bilateral cooperation agreement in the field
of airplane maintenance and repair.</P>
      <P>The two local companies will sign a memorandum on the cooperation
on Wednesday in Taipei, witnessed by Vice Economics Minister Yin
Chi-ming.</P>
      <P>The cooperation agreement is part of government efforts to build
an Asia-Pacific aircraft manufacture and repair center in Taiwan, and
is also aimed at avoiding "duplicate investments" among domestic
enterprises in the aeronautic sector, according to the Industrial
Development Bureau (IDB).</P>
      <P>The agreement will cover various fields, such as the development
of new aircraft for military and commercial use, the repair,
maintenance and alteration of airplanes and related systems, and the
exchange of personnel, equipment and technology, the IDB said.</P>
      <P>AIDC, an enterprise under the Ministry of Economic Affairs,
originated from the former military-run Aero-Industry Development
Center which built the locally designed Indigenous Defense Fighters
(IDF).</P>
      <P>The Taichung-based AIDC is also undertaking the manufacture of
commercial aircraft in conjunction with world leaders in aircraft
manufacture such as McDonnell Douglas. The AIDC has produced more

      <P>Air Asia Company Limited, founded in 1946 in the southern city of
Tainan, is Taiwan's oldest professional aircraft repair and
maintenance factory. It provides services to most of the island's
domestic and foreign commercial air carriers, as well as government

    <HEADLINE>KMT TAIPEI MAYORAL VICTORY TOPS LIST OF DOMESTIC NEWS STORIES IN 1998</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The victory of Ma Ying-jeou, the former
justice minister who beat incumbent Taipei City Mayor Chen Shui-bian
in the Dec. 5 Taipei mayoral election, is the top local news event of
1998.</P>
      <P>The list of the top ten news stories, chosen by chief editors,
senior writers, and other Republic of China media executives,
including the CNA, is as follows:</P>
      <P>1. The ruling Kuomintang scored big gains in the Dec. 5
three-in-one elections, in which Ma Ying-jeou, the KMT candidate,
defeated Chen Shui-bian of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), in the second Taipei mayoral race.</P>
      <P>2. After nearly three years of hiatus, Koo Chen-fu, chairman of
the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation, and Wang Daohan,
chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait, held a meeting in Shanghai, paving the way for further
exchanges.</P>
      <P>3. The Legislative Yuan approved a set of temporary regulations
governing the readjustment of the functions, administration and the
organization of the Taiwan Provincial Government (TPG). Under the
regulations, various agencies under the TPG will be maintained until
June 1999.</P>
      <P>4. On Feb. 16, a China Airlines flight from the Indonesian island
of Bali carrying 196 passengers and crew crashed just outside
Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. Everyone aboard, and
six people on the ground, were killed, including Y.D. Sheu, governor
of the Central Bank of China.</P>
      <P>5. Seventy-two local people, mostly children and babies, lost
their lives in an enterovirus epidemic.</P>
      <P>6. Lin Feng-cheng, minister of transportation and communication,
and Tuan Chi, chairman of Taiwan High Speed Rail Consortium, signed
an agreement on the construction of the high speed railway which is
scheduled to begin in the spring of 1999 and to be completed in 2003.</P>
      <P>7. Angered by the Taichung County Government's reluctance to
issue relevant documents, Germany's Bayer Company decided to
terminate an investment project worth NT$50 billion in central
Taiwan's Taichung harbor.</P>
      <P>8. The Ministry of Education announced on May 1 the abolishment
of the join entrance examination for the enrollment of high school
and other secondary school students, starting from the 2001 academic
year. Enrollment of students will change to a basic test of
scholastic ability for national secondary education.</P>
      <P>9. Career criminal Chen Chin-Hsing, one of a gang which kidnapped
and murdered Pai Hsiao-yen, the daughter of a noted local actress,
was sentenced to five death penalties by the Panchiao district court.</P>
      <P>10. The ST-1 satellite, Taiwan's first commercial
telecommunications satellite, which was launched on Aug. 26 and moved
into its final orbital position over the Indian Ocean on Sept. 7,
began commercial operations on Dec. 1 to improve the island's
telecommunications systems.</P>

law that limit freedom of publication in mainland China will come
into force Wednesday, according to a report in Chinese language by
the Xinhua News Agency in Beijing.</P>
      <P>The provisions, which were interpreted in early December by the

duplicate, circulate, or spread messages that advocate national
separatism, undermine national unification, instigate the subversion
of state power, or agitate for the abolition of socialist systems may
be convicted of "splitting the nation, or instigating the subversion
of state power."</P>
      <P>The report was made by the mouthpiece of the mainland Chinese

earlier this week for their efforts to establish the first opposition

    <HEADLINE>POLITICAL CHANGE IN MAINLAND CHINA LONG OVERDUE, SAYS PAPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The evident brittleness of mainland China's
reforms should be a warning that political change is overdue, an
Asian Wall Street Journal editorial said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The 20th anniversary of the "reform and opening" era, which was
celebrated in mainland China last Friday, serves as a useful reminder
that as long as the question of political reform remains unsolved,
the legacy of Deng Xiaoping and his successors remains uncertain, the
editorial said.</P>
      <P>President Jiang Zemin, in a recent televised speech marking the
anniversary, promised that "his country would never build
Western-style democracy," according to the newspaper.</P>
      <P>Once again "stability" is the watchword in the mainland Chinese
official press, while dissidents Xu Wenli and Wang Youcai were
sentenced to 13 years and 11 years, respectively, in prison for
"subverting the government."</P>
      <P>Xu and Wang are being punished in order to frighten increasingly
outspoken advocates of political reform and multiparty democracy into
silence, the editorial pointed out.</P>
      <P>Jiang, according to the paper, didn't let down his hair and cover
himself in glory by striking more jubilant notes in his speech.
Instead, his notes conveyed an impression of a tough political line,
as well as a slowdown in reform in order to avoid aggravating a
growing unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>He doesn't want to raise expectations of greater liberalization,
the paper noted. As the central government grapples with problems of
sluggish foreign investment and exports, combined with horrifying
inefficiency in the state sector, it has chosen to switch tack, it
continued.</P>
      <P>It went on to say that after 20 years of economic reform,
mainland China's political climate is still mercurial, as the long
prison sentences for the democrats show.</P>
      <P>True, the peaks and troughs of the political cycle are less
stomach-churning since Deng secured the future of his economic
reforms by scoring a decisive victory over party conservatives in the
early 1990s. But these swings are still an anachronism in a world
where change is increasingly driven by the free flow of ideas, rather
than the whims of elderly leaders who rose to power in secret
factional struggles, the editorial said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT NOMINATES CANDIDATES FOR TAIPEI, KAOHSIUNG CITY COUNCIL SPEAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang on Tuesday announced
its candidates for the speaker of Taipei City Council, and the
speaker and deputy speaker of Kaohsiung City Council.</P>
      <P>Wu Pi-chu, incumbent Taipei City Council deputy speaker, will run
for the speakership of the city council on the KMT ticket, while
Huang Chi-chun, currently Kaohsiung City councilman, and Wang
Chih-hsiung, incumbent legislator, will vie for the top two posts of
the city council of southern Taiwan's largest city.</P>
      <P>After being sworn in on Friday, the newly elected members of the
two city councils will cast votes to elect speakers and deputy
speakers.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary General John Chang said that the ruling party has
decided not to nominate a candidate for deputy speaker of Taipei, as
the KMT controls only 23 of the 52 seats in the new council, making
it essential that the party cooperate with the opposition party in
the election of speaker and deputy speaker.</P>
      <P>The ruling party controls 24 out of the 44 Kaohsiung City Council
seats.</P>
      <P>Chang said that before making the announcement, he met with Chen
Cheng-chung, an incumbent KMT councilman who has made known his
strong desire to seek the KMT nomination for Taipei speaker, and told
him the party's decision.</P>
      <P>Chen later told the press that he would throw his support behind
any KMT candidate in order to ensure victory for the party.</P>
      <P>Questioned as to why the KMT nominated Huang, who reportedly quit
the party years ago, for the Kaohsiung speakership, Chang said that
Huang, who joined the KMT in 1978, is actually a party member "at
large" and has regained his party certification since being reelected
to the council.</P>
      <P>He said that he will also urge Chu An-hsing and Chang Jui-teh,
two others who had vied vigorously for the post of Kaohsiung speaker,
to follow the party's decision.</P>
      <P>The KMT Central Standing Committee is expected to approve the
nominations at its weekly meeting on Wednesday.</P>

      <P>Taipei City Mayor Chen Shui-bian on Tuesday
awarded the 100 millionth user of Taipei's mass rapid transit (MRT)
system with a set of gold and silver commemorative coins.</P>
      <P>Chen was making what will probably be his last MRT trip as mayor
of Taiwan's largest city. He was defeated by Ma Ying-jeou of the
ruling Kuomintang in the Dec. 5 elections, and will withdraw from the
administration on Friday.</P>
      <P>At the Taipei train station, the main MRT station, the outgoing
mayor who presided over the opening of the Tamshui line in March
1997, said he never dreamed that the number of MRT users would pass
the 100 million mark so soon.</P>
      <P>The record is "the greatest gift that the citizens have given me
and all the members of my administrative team," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Promotion of the MRT system has been Chen's key strategy in his
efforts to improve the city's atrocious traffic conditions.</P>
      <P>Taipei currently has two MRT lines, running to the suburbs of
Tamshui and Mucha, with further lines to Chungho and Hsintien

      <P>Lee said the world has become a borderless global village with
democracy as the mainstream system of rule. In addition to striving
to bolster its economic development and political reform, Taiwan
hopes to contribute more to the world as a member of this global
village, he noted.</P>
      <P>Hattori for his part said he notices further evidence of Taiwan's
progress every time he visits the country. He said he was
particularly impressed that Taiwan has managed to sustain its
substantial economic growth in the face of the Asian financial
turmoil which has battered most of the economies in the region.</P>
      <P>He attributed this to the island's solid economic prowess and
correct government policies, which he said are worth emulation by
other countries around the world.</P>
      <P>Hattori, accompanied by Toshio Goto, president of the Interchange
Association, is leading a Japanese delegation at the 23rd
Taiwan-Japan Economic and Trade Convention taking place in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The Interchange Association, the de facto Japanese embassy in
Taiwan, was established to represent Japanese interests here after
the ROC and Japan severed formal diplomatic relations in 1972.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO SEEK MFI OBSERVER STATUS, AS MAI TALKS SUSPENDED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will seek to join consultations held
under the Multilateral Framework of Investment (MFI), a new working
arm of the World Trade Organization (WTO), an official with the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The move comes after the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) announced earlier this month that talks
regarding the OECD-proposed Multilateral Agreement on Investment
(MAI), which Taiwan had sought to join as an observer, would be
suspended indefinitely.</P>
      <P>Lin Neng-chung, director-general of the MOEA Industrial
Development and Investment Center, made the announcement that
Taiwan's efforts to join the MAI, initiated in 1996 and touted as an
agreement that would open doors around the world for investors, were
likewise being suspended.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has since 1996 strived to become an observer within the
MAI, hoping that by joining the group, Taiwan would solicit more
foreign investment and gain protection for its overseas investments,
as well as for its business and trade interests abroad, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>By signing the MAI, Taiwan would directly declare itself a
liberalized and global economy, which is conducive to attracting more
foreign investment. That would accelerate the adjustment of its
domestic economic structure and raise Taiwan's international
competitiveness, Lin added.</P>
      <P>According to the latest United Nations World Investment Atlas, as
of the end of 1996, Taiwan is the world's 17th-largest capital source
in terms of overseas investments.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan were to join the MAI, local businessmen with
investments abroad could use the agreement's international
arbitration body to settle international disputes, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan would also be entitled to treatment equal to those of
other signatory members.</P>
      <P>Talks on the MAI's formation have lagged as major OECD member
states have been divided on some key points.</P>
      <P>Some economies said the goals set under the agreement are too
high, while some countries are skeptical of its function, accusing it
of being a "political and corporate orgy" for big businesses.</P>
      <P>After suspending MAI talks, the OECD proposed that MAI
signatories continue the international program under the MFI.</P>
      <P>While countries that have joined the MAI are now MFI members,
several countries, which were MAI observers, are expected to become
MFI observers. Such countries include Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Slovakia, Russia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE URGES TV STATIONS NOT TO PLAY UP JUVENILE CRIME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Wednesday urged
local television stations to refrain from giving sensational reports
on juvenile criminal activities for the sake of common well-being of
domestic youths.</P>
      <P>Lee made the appeal in his capacity as chairman of the ruling
Kuomintang after listening to a report on the promotion of youth
voluntary services. The report was delivered by Lee Chi-chu,
chairperson of the Cabinet-level National Youth Commission (NYC), at
a weekly KMT Central Standing Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>The president said young people are prone to imitate what they
see on TV. "Many juvenile delinquents or criminals have learned
criminal actions from TV programs," he noted.</P>
      <P>Lee said he hopes local TV stations will report more positive
sides of society, including youth voluntary services and healthy
recreational programs, while avoiding playing up juvenile delinquency
problems.</P>
      <P>"This is not an order, but my sincere request," Lee said, adding
he is hopeful that local TV stations will produce more educational,
sensible and meaningful programs catering to the needs and tastes of
adolescents to help curb juvenile crime.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say that he is delighted to learn that the NYC
has launched a series of programs to promote youth voluntary
services.</P>
      <P>"The NYC's efforts to create an environment suitable for young
students to join varied, diversified social services are worthy of
our government's recognition and commendation," the president said.</P>
      <P>Lee also urged relevant KMT and government agencies to
coordinate and cooperate with the NYC in recruiting young volunteers
to join various social services at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>"Expanded youth voluntary services will not only help broaden
young people's vision but will also facilitate spiritual reforms,"
Lee said, adding that encouraging young people to join overseas
voluntary services will also help promote international friendship
and cooperation and upgrade the Republic of China's national image.</P>
      <P>Juvenile delinquency and crime have become increasingly rampant
in local society. Many have blamed excessive media reports on
criminal activities or the dark side of society for rising youth
crime rate here. The trend has prompted President Lee to call on
local media, particularly television operators, to refrain from
showing shocking crime scenes or giving graphic accounts of criminal
episodes.</P>

      <P>All 229 crew members and passengers aboard
Swissair flight 111, which crashed off Nova Scotia on Sept. 2, have
been identified, Canadian police said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Investigators used X-rays, DNA, fingerprints and dental work to

totals more than US$1 million and is in US funds. Much of the money
was newly circulated money that was part of a bank transfer.</P>

      <P>The Australian Royal Navy has refused to
take delivery of the third of six Collins-class submarines it planned
to purchase from Australian Submarine Corp. (ASC) because of problems
in the first two submarines delivered.</P>
      <P>The navy has a US$3.2 billion plan to buy six of the submarines

      <P>Since taking delivery of the two submarines, however, the navy

the problems before it accepts delivery of the third submarine,
according to The Australian on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Eoin Asker, head of the submarine project at the
navy, as saying, "It's unfair to put it all on the ASC's foot, but
having said that we want to focus their attention on further

    <HEADLINE>EXECUTIVE YUAN SHOULD RETAIN KAOHSIUNG BRANCH: CEPD HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The service center set up by the Executive
Yuan in the southern port city of Kaohsiung has performed well and
therefore should not be abolished, Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Chairman P.K. Chiang said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>On the contrary said Chiang, who also doubles as head of the
Executive Yuan's service center in Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second-largest
city, the establishment should further expand its services to the
public as it has served southern Taiwan residents well over the past
six months.</P>
      <P>Referring to criticism by outgoing Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yih and
an editorial by the Liberty Times that the Executive Yuan should
close the office as it has become no more than an inefficient
"complaint center" which does not fall in line with the central
government's plan to streamline its administration, Chiang said he
felt disappointed and sad to hear the comments after he put so much
effort into the center.</P>
      <P>Saying that his CEPD duties in Taipei made him too busy, Chiang
said he has already expressed his intention to quit the Kaohsiung
post to Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, and voiced the hope that
another government official will take over.</P>
      <P>Explaining that the Executive Yuan Kaohsiung service center is
only in charge of coordinating local affairs in southern Taiwan
rather than being a policy-making government agency, the CEPD head
said that many things passing through the center must still be
approved by the relevant government authorities in Taipei, which
"requires time and must go through due process."</P>
      <P>Stressing that the center has functioned well since its opening
six months ago, Chiang pointed out that the eight-floor establishment
is planning to rent two additional floors to expand its services to
the public. Some other government agencies, including the Fair Trade
Commission under the Executive Yuan, are also planning to open their
southern branches within the center, he continued.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, the service center has received a total of
20,017 passport applications over the past month alone, four times
the previous average level. In addition, it also handled 38,620 entry
and exit cases, 5,694 cases of international trade affairs and 6,279
cases of personnel affairs, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ranking Executive Yuan officials said they were
unaware of Chiang's intention to quit, but added that in any case,
Premier Vincent Siew will not approve the resignation.</P>
      <P>Government spokesman Chen Chien-jen hailed Chiang's performance
and the opening of the government's Kaohsiung service center, saying
that it has helped the Taipei-based central government to better
serve Taiwan's southern residents.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia has joined in the global
condemnation of mainland China's treatment of political dissidents
after a mainland Chinese court sentenced a third democracy activist
to a long jail term on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Qin Yongmin, 43, was sentenced to 12 years in prison after being
found guilty by the Wuhan Intermediate People's Court of subversion
for his involvement in setting up mainland China's first opposition
political party since the Communists took power in 1949.</P>
      <P>Two of Qin's colleagues in the China Democracy Party -- Xu
Wenli, 55, and Wang Youcai, 33 -- were imprisoned for 13 and 11
years, respectively, on Monday.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Alexander Downer on Tuesday condemned the
sentences and ordered Australia's embassy in Beijing to lodge a
protest, according to a Beijing dispatch of The Australian daily.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted a spokesman for Downer as saying: "The
government is deeply concerned about the severity of the sentences
handed down over the past week in the trials of Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai
and Qin Yongmin. We are raising our concerns about these latest
developments with the Chinese government."</P>
      <P>The daily also quoted an official at the Australian Embassy in
Beijing as saying, "We will express our deep concern about the
campaign against these individuals, who have simply been expressing,

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
said on Tuesday that 18 foreign companies are set to invest a total
of NT$28.4 billion (US$876.5 million) in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The foreign companies from the United States, the Netherlands,
Japan, Australia, France, and Switzerland will invest in a variety of
industries, including semiconductors, telecommunications, vacuum
pumps, frozen foods, shopping malls, engineering plastics,
photo-electronics, compact disks, and biotechnology, said the MOEA.</P>
      <P>In addition to the 18 companies, IBM is to embark on a joint
venture with Taiwan's Pacific Electric Wire &amp; Cable Company in a deal
worth NT$48 billion (US$1.48 billion), the MOEA added.</P>
      <P>The ministry said that main task of its Industrial Development
and Investment Center (IDIC) in 1999 will be to invite more foreign

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia has threatened to retaliate if
Japan imposes a proposed 390-percent tariff on Australian rice
imports.</P>
      <P>Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer on Tuesday told reporters that
the 390-percent tariff represented a "bamboo curtain with some pretty
spiky bamboo."</P>
      <P>He said Japan risked sparking a trade war by its decision to
impose such a high tariff.</P>
      <P>"This is about 15 times higher than the highest tariff applied by
Australia to any of our imports from Japan or elsewhere," Fischer
said.</P>
      <P>Japan is Australia's No. 1 trading partner.</P>
      <P>Fischer said it would be wrong for Australia to abandon free
trade and impose new high tariffs on Japanese goods.</P>
      <P>Instead, he said, Australia would study its trade with Japan and
seek to find other ways of retaliating.</P>
      <P>Fischer said the Japanese tariff on Australian rice would simply
block Australian rice exports from entering the Japanese market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COSTS THREATEN EU FARM REFORM PLANS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The cost of European Union (EU) plans to
reform farm policy could be higher than predicted and could put "the
whole reform at risk", the European Court of Auditor, the EU's
financial watchdog, said in a report to be published this month.</P>
      <P>The Court of Auditor's opinion that the European Commission may
be underestimating reform costs will increase pressure for limits to
EU spending at an EU summit meeting in Vienna.</P>
      <P>Farm spending accounts for nearly half the EU's annual budget of
ECU$85 billion. The planned reforms will initially raise costs, but
will reduce the cost of the Common Agricultural Policy over time.</P>
      <P>The court takes the Commission to task for farm reform proposals
that contain "few innovations and are not sufficiently wide-ranging."
It is critical of Commission assumptions about world prices and
demand for agricultural products, which it believes may be overly
optimistic. It suggests wealthy farmers are receiving too much
support and overall spending should be cut.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1998 TRADE SURPLUS MAY HIT NEW LOW, SAYS FINANCE MINISTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's overall trade surplus is expected
to total about US$7 billion in 1998, a 14-year low, the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The island's exports totaled US$6.44 billion in the first 19 days
of December, down 15.7 percent from the year-earlier level, while
imports amounted to US$5.83 billion, down 23.3 percent.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan had a trade surplus of US$611 million in the
Dec. 1-19 period, said Hsu Kuo-tung, director of the MOF's Department
of Statistics.</P>
      <P>Hsu estimated that Taiwan's overall annual trade surplus may
diminish to a record low of US$7 billion this year, as export trade
in the last quarter, usually the peak season for exports, continues
to decline.</P>
      <P>Hsu quoted MOF tallies as showing that daily exports averaged
US$444 million in the first half of December, compared with the
average US$475 million posted in November.</P>
      <P>Although the decline in December's exports have aroused close
attention by domestic economy watchers, Hsu said it is too early to
say that inflation has set in. The picture of Taiwan's real economic
performance in 1998 will not be clear until March or April of next
year, he noted.</P>
      <P>In the first half of December, Hsu said, the decline was more
apparent in exports of electrical engineering and machinery products,
while he attributed the decline in import trade during the period to
a reduction of military supplies and crude oil imports.</P>

      <P>It was Moody's first sovereign debt rating for Taiwan, and the
Aa3 rating represents a very high mark.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the result, Vincent Truglia, in charge of Moody's
rating affairs on sovereign risk, said that the island's strong
export performance is the engine which pushes its economic growth.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign trade has never been thwarted by its political
difficulties, and it remains one of the world's major trading
economies, despite the small number of countries which grant Taipei
political recognition, Truglia said.</P>
      <P>Due to its positive efforts in promoting economic growth, Taiwan
has been able to maintain the value of its currency, even as the
currencies of its Asia-Pacific neighbors have tumbled because of the
Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Truglia praised Taiwan enterprises' contributions to the island's
economic growth, but warned of an impending impact as international
demand declines, the country's neighboring competitors become
stronger, and domestic demand also falls.</P>
      <P>Truglia also reminded the Taiwan authorities to pay close
attention to the high-risk loans being made by local banks, and their
problems with expanding credit.</P>
      <P>Making a forecast on Taiwan's long-term economic development,
Truglia further said that he believes the issue of how Taiwan deals
with its relations with mainland China is an unpredictable factor
which will play a key role on its financial market.</P>

      <P>The economic slowdown has affected the
growth of salaries in the private sector, causing a drop to 3.28
percent in the first 10 months of 1998, a record low in Taiwan's
history, the government reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In the Jan.-Oct. period, average total monthly salaries in the
private sector stood at NT$40,322 (US$1,252), up 3.28 percent over
the year-earlier level, while basic monthly salaries averaged
NT$32,028 (US$995), up 3.31 percent, officials from the Directorate

      <P>The Environmental Protection

Plastic Group (FPG) try its best to retrieve alleged toxic waste
from Cambodia.</P>
      <P>"The petrochemical giant has agreed to evaluate the feasibility
of taking back the controversial industrial waste that the FPG
shipped to Cambodia earlier this year," said an EPA official.</P>
      <P>The official said no matter whether reports of the waste-related
deaths in Cambodia were true or not, the incident has tarnished the
Republic of China's international image and marred the FPG's business
reputation.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, the EPA has asked the FPG to recall the alleged
toxic waste from Cambodia," the official said, adding the EPA is
hopeful that the Cambodian government will assist in cleaning up the
waste and take other necessary steps to facilitate the return of the
waste to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>FPG executives said as the waste shipment to Cambodia was handled
by a shipping company and customs brokerages in both countries, the

November, the highest single-month level since 1985, the
Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and

      <P>The figure translated into a total of 282,000 jobless workers
across Taiwan, 86,000 of whom were out of work as a result of
business closures or streamlining. Some 85,000 workers left their

    <HEADLINE>ROC SENDS MEMORANDUM TO CAMBODIA OVER WASTE INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has sent a
memorandum to Cambodia expressing its intention to cooperate with
the Indochinese country in handling an alleged toxic waste incident,
Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hu told a Legislative Yuan committee meeting that the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is very concerned about a local
petrochemical group's export of possibly toxic waste to Cambodia.</P>
      <P>"The ministry has instructed the ROC's representative office in
Ho Chi Minh City in neighboring Vietnam to send a memorandum to the
Cambodian government over the waste incident," Hu said.</P>
      <P>The memorandum contained three key points, Hu said. "First of
all, we tell the Cambodian government that it should discuss things
related to Taiwan with the ROC government through official channels
because the ROC is an independent sovereign state."</P>
      <P>Secondly, Hu said, the memorandum stressed that it needs further
investigations to determine whether the waste shipped by Taiwan's
Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) to Cambodia is toxic or not.</P>
      <P>"Thirdly, we stressed that the incident was a completely
isolated case and that the ROC has consistently opposed shipment of
toxic substances to other countries," Hu said.</P>
      <P>The minister went on to say that MOFA and the Cabinet-level
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) have launched a joint
inquiry to determine where the responsibility lies.</P>
      <P>"We want to know whether local governments have illegally
approved the shipment of toxic waste to other countries as well as
whether the procedures for the FPG's waste shipment to Cambodia were
completely legal," Hu said, adding that the EPA is also probing
whether any Taiwan nationals have colluded with Cambodians in
illegally shipping the FPG's waste to the Indochinese country.</P>
      <P>Hu said the ministry has so far not obtained any data concerning
the death of Cambodians related to the FPG's allegedly toxic waste.</P>
      <P>Hu said it is regretful that the incident has been "politicized."
"It remains unclear whether the FPG's waste is lethal or not and
how serious the damage caused by the waste is," he noted.</P>
      <P>The incident came to the limelight earlier this week after
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen claimed in Phnom Penh prior to his
departure for a visit to Beijing that the FPG's waste poses great
health threat to Cambodian people and several residents in the
vicinity of the garbage dump in the coastal resort Sihanoukville
might have died because of touch on the toxic waste.</P>
      <P>Cambodian authorities have so far not served the ROC any
official notice or report concerning the toxic waste. Cambodia
diplomatically recognizes Beijing and is not friendly toward
Taiwan. Hun Sen forced the ROC to close its representative office in
Phnom Penh last year.</P>
      <P>ROC's Foreign Ministry spokesman Roy Wu on Monday refuted Hun
Sen's allegation that Taiwan is a "pollution" exporting country.</P>
      <P>"It is irrational for the Cambodian government to make such an
allegation before it makes any investigation into the waste shipment
incident," Wu said, adding that Hun Sen should not have played up
the incident purely based on unconfirmed reports.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, at the EPA request, the FPG said Wednesday it will
evaluate the feasibility of retrieving the controversial industrial
waste it shipped to Cambodia in November.</P>
      <P>FPG executives said as the waste shipment to Cambodia was handled
by a shipping company and customs brokerages in both countries, the
company itself was not aware how the waste was disposed of in
Cambodia.</P>
      <P>"So we need make a comprehensive evaluation of the planned

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's defense minister on Wednesday
refuted media reports that the military would cancel its order of
US-made Stinger surface-to-air missiles.</P>
      <P>Chiang Chung-ling, speaking at the legislature, said the order
will go ahead as planned, but whether there would be follow-up
purchases would depend on the military's requirements.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper had reported that Taiwan would cut back its
purchases of Stinger missiles from 220 to less than 30.</P>
      <P>Legislators voiced concern that such move would seriously affect
the defense capability of the island which is believed to be
particularly vulnerable to missile assaults by mainland China.</P>
      <P>Beijing has not renounced the possibility of using force in
achieving its goal of reunification with Taiwan which broke away from
the mainland in the 1949 civil war.</P>
      <P>Chiang said it has been the military's consistent policy to give
priority to weapon systems which can be developed and produced
domestically. For this reason, the Chungshan Institute of Technology
and Science was established, he added.</P>
      <P>The defense minister said the air force has ordered the
locally-produced Sky Sword surface-to-air missiles from the
military-run institute, stressing that the military has developed a
similar air defense system to that of the United States.</P>
      <P>The China Times daily also said in its Wednesday edition that the
US missile purchase cut was aimed at saving funds ahead of the island
joining the US-proposed theater missile defense program (TMD).</P>

    <TEXT>The Republic of China will host a regional
conference of the International Association for Volunteer Efforts
(IAVE) next year, the National Youth Commission (NYC) said on
Wednesday.

NYC Chairperson Lee Chi-chu said that the hosting of the
conference shows that a local campaign to promote volunteer work and
concern for society have won recognition from the international
community.

She also said that volunteer service is one of the most important
functions of the NYC, and deserves further promotion and development
in Taiwan.

The conference will be held in Taipei in November 1999, and will
be attended by IAVE officials from its Washington, D.C. headquarters,
and representatives from the Asia-Pacific region.

Lee, who went to the Canadian city of Edmonton to attend an IAVE
meeting this August, has been actively bidding for Taiwan to host the
regional conference, and her efforts beat out Hong Kong, India, and
South Korea for the right to host the event.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA, TAIPOWER DENY NUCLEAR WASTE DEAL WITH MARSHALL ISLANDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
never touched on the nuclear waste disposal issue in the process of
negotiating the establishment of diplomatic ties with the Marshall
Islands, Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"We have also not discussed the nuclear waste issue after
forging official ties with the central Pacific island nation," Hu
told a Legislative Yuan committee meeting.</P>
      <P>The minister was responding to a newspaper report that the
state-run Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) has struck a preliminary deal
with the Marshall Islands on the shipment of its low-grade
radioactive waste to that country for permanent disposal.</P>
      <P>Hu said the report was not true, stressing that the Republic of
China government has never had such a plan to ship nuclear waste to
the Marshall Islands for storage.</P>
      <P>"It is not our policy to encourage shipment of nuclear waste
abroad for permanent disposal," Hu noted, adding that it is
regretful that some people have purposely used the topic to sabotage
the ROC's relations with the Marshall Islands.</P>
      <P>The ROC established full diplomatic ties with the Marshall
Islands in eastern Micronesia on Nov. 20, 1998.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipower issued a press statement Wednesday
afternoon, denying that the company will pay the Marshall Islands
NT$3 billion (US$93.17 million) for disposing of its nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>"The newspaper report that we have struck a deal with the
Marshall Islands on the storage of our nuclear waste is
completely unfounded," the statement said.</P>
      <P>Taipower said no new development or progress in its overseas
nuclear waste treatment plan.</P>
      <P>The state monopoly said it has offered to give NT$3 billion in
development funds to any domestic township or village that
would provide it with a small piece of land for construction
of nuclear dump.</P>
      <P>"The newspaper might have misunderstood our offer to prospective
local land suppliers," the statement said.</P>
      <P>It went on to say that the ROC's Foreign Ministry has never
consulted with Taipower on the nuclear waste storage problem before
and after the ROC forged diplomatic ties with the Marshall Islands.</P>
      <P>Taipower officials said the Marshall Islands once contacted
Japan, South Korea and Taiwan over the possibility of cooperation in
setting up a low-grade radioactive waste dump on its territory.
However, the government of the Marshall Islands announced a halt to
the plan in June 1997. "It remains unclear whether the Marshall
Islands has decided to revive the program," said a Taipower
official.</P>
      <P>"Even if the Marshall Islands brings up the issue again, we must
study the feasibility of the proposed cooperative plan from various
viewpoints, including technology, cost and international political
factors," the official said, adding that the reported agreement with
the Marshall Islands is nonexistent at the moment.</P>
      <P>Taipower has difficulties finding a new nuclear waste dump. It
once forged an agreement with North Korea to ship up to 200,000
barrels of low-grade nuclear waste to that country for permanent
disposal. The shipment, however, has so far not been materialized
because of a combination of complicated factors, including strong
opposition from South Korea and international environmental
activists.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Leading central banks are putting pressure
on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to water down proposals
aimed at securing more transparency in monetary policymaking, the
World Trade Organization (WTO) reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Their objections to an IMF draft code of conduct have promoted
accusations that they are trying to rewrite the rules to suit
themselves, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>IMF officials drafted the code in response to a call from the
committee of finance ministers that oversees the fund. It is one of
several international initiatives to improve the quality and
transparency of economic policymaking.</P>
      <P>Several leading central bankers have objected both to the code's
content and the way it was drawn up. The IMF, in turn, is upset the
central bankers are complaining about a process they were happy to
sign up to in October's joint Group of Seven statement with finance
ministers.</P>
      <P>Officials said the code has been much more controversial than its
fiscal policy counterpart, agreed this year. There was little
disagreement about the scope for extra transparency in budgetary
matters but the central banks are much more wary of transparency in

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Chang King-yuh said on Wednesday that he has not made any promise to
aid overseas mainland Chinese dissident groups.</P>
      <P>Chang made the statement after meeting with Wei Jingsheng, the
most prominent exiled mainland Chinese dissident who arrived in
Taipei on Monday for a nine-day visit.</P>
      <P>"While meeting with Wei, I expressed my respect and admiration
for his long-term dedication to Chinese people's freedom and basic
human rights," Chang said.</P>
      <P>The ROC's top mainland policy planner said he also encouraged
Wei to continue his fight for mainland China's democratization to
enable billions of mainland people to enjoy freedom and human
rights.</P>
      <P>Wei, who was released from a mainland Chinese prison last year
after spending much of the last 18 years in a cell for championing
democracy in mainland China, is currently living in the Untied
States.</P>
      <P>Chang said he welcomes Wei's visit to Taiwan. "I hope the visit
will help Wei gain a deeper understanding of Taiwan's economic
development, social reforms and political democratization in
the past few decades."</P>
      <P>Chang said he also exchanged views with Wei on a broad

major overseas mainland dissident groups, the ROC's policy toward
mainland China and the present relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>During the talks, Chang said, Wei had mentioned the
financial demand of overseas mainland dissident groups.
"Nevertheless, I didn't make any promise on financial assistance for
those groups," he added.</P>
      <P>Wei himself said after delivering a speech at the Grand Hotel
that he doesn't think that the Mainland Affairs Council would give
any financial aid to overseas mainland dissident groups because the

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chung Hwa Telecommunication Corp. will
lower its telecommunication fares in due time, Minister of
Transportation and Communications Lin Feng-cheng said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the announcement in a report on the fee structuring plan
at the legislature's transportation and communications committee.</P>
      <P>According to the plan, charges for local telephone calls will be
changed from the current NT$1.7 per five minutes to NT$1.5 for the
first two minutes, an additional NT$0.5 for each minute between 2 and
10 minutes, and NT$0.25 for each minute exceeding 10 minutes.</P>
      <P>Monthly dues for telephone set renters will be raised to NT$90
from the current level of NT$50.</P>
      <P>If enacted, the new local telephone fees for the first 30 minutes
will be more expensive than the current level, but will be
increasingly cheaper for calls exceeding 30 minutes.</P>
      <P>Cellular phone charges will be lowered by 25 percent and will be
charged on a per second basis instead of a per minute charge as is
currently the case. For example, if a call is 1 minute and 30
seconds, the user will be charged for the real time used compared to
the nearest minute.</P>
      <P>Fares for domestic long-distance calls will be lowered by 17
percent, while international long-distance calls will be decreased by
8.6 percent.</P>
      <P>The fares for directory assistance will be raised to NT$3 per
call from the current NT$2.</P>
      <P>The new pricing scheme has yet to be studied by the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications and has not been approved by the
Cabinet. It may be implemented around Feb. 1, 1999.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister Lin also indicated that Chung Hwa Telecom
will improve the quality of telecommunications for cellular phones
beginning with 090, 0937, 0932 and 0933 by the end of March 1999.</P>

      <P>The effects of the Asian financial crisis
will linger on in the Australian economy for at least 15 years,
according to new long-term projections.</P>
      <P>The projections by Monash University in Melbourne show that

what it could have been if the Asian crisis had not happened.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Prime Minister John Howard said the Australian
economy in 1998-99 will be the best in three decades, despite the
impact of the Asian economic crisis, although the Monash model shows
the Asian crisis will see Australia's gross domestic product dip over
the next year or so before economic growth reverts to its long-term
trend of around 3.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Australia is expected to experience continued strong growth in

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD HELP MAINLAND CHINA DEMOCRATIZE: WEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should use its clout to push for
democratization of mainland China to save itself and other
neighboring Asian countries from a big disaster, a visiting mainland
Chinese dissident said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wei Jingsheng, the most prominent exiled mainland dissident,
said he admires Taiwan as the island has managed to complete
democratization totally on its own.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, Taiwan should not be complacent with its own
democratization. It should use its influence to inspire mainland
China to move toward democracy. If democracy cannot take roots in
mainland China, it will spell a disaster to Taiwan and other
neighboring Asian countries as well," asserted Wei, who is currently
on a nine-day visit to the island.</P>
      <P>Wei made the remarks in a Central Broadcasting System (CBS) talk
show hosted by CBS Chairman Chu Wan-ching. Legislator Chang
Chun-hung from Taiwan's main opposition Democratic Progressive Party
also took part in the program, which was simultaneously broadcast to
mainland China and the international community.</P>
      <P>In the program, Wei said the unification of the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should be based on a sound foundation.</P>
      <P>"The two sides must respect each other and treat each other on
an equal footing. As long as the two sides have common interests,
unification will benefit both sides," he noted, adding that at the
moment, the two sides must increase mutual understanding
through increased exchanges.</P>
      <P>Wei further said as Taiwan is already an independent political
entity, its relations with mainland China will certain remain
tense, no matter whether it declares de jure independence or not.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Wei paid a visit to the Republic of China's
Government Information Office (GIO).</P>
      <P>Wei told GIO Director-General Chen Chien-jen that there should
be amply room for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to cooperate
because they share a common language and cultural backgrounds.</P>
      <P>"I hope to work out some feasible cooperative programs with
friends here during my first visit to this island," the outspoken
mainland dissident said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chen said he admires Wei's courage to publicly
advocate a "fifth modernization," -- namely democratization, shortly
after the late mainland leader Deng Xiaoping unveiled an ambitious
"four modernizations" program in late 1978.</P>
      <P>Following his visit to the GIO, Wei also called at the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward
the mainland.</P>
      <P>Wei exchanged views with MAC Chairman Chang King-yuh on a range
of issues, including the current state of relations across the
Taiwan Strait and the development of overseas mainland dissident
groups.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wei told local reporters after his MAC visit that
he hopes to meet with Taiwan's top three political figures --
President Lee Teng-hui, Vice President Lien Chan and Premier Vincent
Siew -- during his stay here.</P>
      <P>President Lee reportedly will meet with Wei in his capacity as
chairman of the ROC's ruling Kuomintang at the KMT's headquarters
next week.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday evening, Wei was presented with two silver plaques
"Human Rights Fighter" and "Democracy Vanguard" by two local freedom
and democracy promotional groups.</P>
      <P>Wei, who was released from a mainland Chinese prison last year
after spending much of the past 18 years in a cell for championing

      <P>Taiwan's National Science Council (NSC)

humanities and social science, respectively, by Feb. 10, 1999.</P>
      <P>The NSC has long focused on the development of natural science,

(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Floods caused by the overflow of major
rivers which left over 3,000 people dead and over 230 million
homeless in mainland China was the most important news event of the
year in the mainland.</P>
      <P>The list of the top 10 mainland-related news stories chosen by
chief editors, senior writers and other media executives in the
Republic of China, including CNA, is as follows:</P>
      <P>1. Major rivers in central and northern China, including the
Yangtze River, the Sungari River, and the Nenchiang River, overflowed
their banks during the summer, causing widespread floods and leaving
over 3,000 killed and more than 230 million people homeless. Economic
losses were estimated at more than US$20 billion.</P>
      <P>2. During a visit to Shanghai, US President Bill Clinton verbally
and unofficially referred to the so-called "three-noes" policy with
regard to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>3. The first plenary session of the Ninth "National People's
Congress" (NPC) and the first plenary session of the Ninth "Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference" (CPPCC) were held in
Beijing. Zhu Rongji was approved as premier, succeeding Li Peng who
was appointed chairman of the Standing Committee of the NPC, who
replaced retiring Qiao Shi. Jiang Zemin was re-elected as president,
while Li Ruihuan retained the post of CPPCC chairman.</P>
      <P>4. Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), visited Shanghai and Beijing and met with Wang
Daohan, chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), for the first time after a nearly
three-year hiatus. Koo also met with Jiang Zemin, president of
mainland China.</P>
      <P>5. Mainland China continued its isolationist strategy against the
Republic of China in the international arena by establishing
diplomatic ties with ROC's allies, including the Republic of South
Africa, Central African Republic, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, and
the Kingdom of Tonga. Meanwhile, the ROC established diplomatic
relations with the Marshall Islands.</P>
      <P>6. Financial turmoil wrecked havoc on Asia. However, mainland
President Jiang Zemin and other high-ranking Beijing officials
reiterated many times that they would not devalue the renminbi within
the year. However, a slowdown in export growth has made it very
difficult for Beijing to reach its goal of 8 percent economic growth.</P>
      <P>7. Jiang Zemin visited Japan and met with the Japanese emperor,
and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. Both sides expressed different views
on such issues as Japan's apology over war atrocities, the inclusion
of the Taiwan Strait in the new US-Japan defense guidelines, and the
request for Tokyo to support the "three noes" policy toward Taiwan.
The visit ended without the signing of a joint statement.</P>
      <P>8. Hong Kong held its first legislature election, with voters
electing 20 of its 60-member Legislative Council. The democratic
faction gained an overwhelming victory in the race.</P>
      <P>9. Public security authorities in mainland China arrested four
Taiwanese businessmen -- Kou Chien-min, Han Yueh-ting, Chen Chao-yu
and Chou Chang-ming -- on spying charges. A Beijing court later
sentenced Kou to four years in prison while the other three were
released and allowed to return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>10. Mainland authorities held a working meeting on Taiwan affairs
to draft new guidelines on dealing with the island. Qian Qichen,
deputy head of the Central Leading Group for Taiwan Affairs, pointed
out that political negotiations between both sides of the Taiwan
Strait have been submitted and scheduled for discussion, and that
ARATS and SEF should widen their contact to promote consultations on
procedures and a program for political negotiations.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Major local television stations have
responded positively to calls by President Lee Teng-hui to reduce the
number of crime stories they report.</P>
      <P>Television executives said they would be more careful in
reporting criminal activities and emphasize more positive stories on
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>President Lee urged local TV stations to refrain from airing
sensational reports on criminal activities during a meeting on
Wednesday morning.</P>
      <P>Pai Shi-li of Taiwan Television Enterprise said the station has
already started reporting on more positive stories about society
since September.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Television has attached great importance to events,
individuals and groups that are newsworthy, Pai said. A recent series
highlighted the needs of several families which received enthusiastic
response from viewers, he added.</P>
      <P>Pai said crime reporting is one kind of news and the company
cannot ignore such stories, but Taiwan Television has adopted strict
guidelines in showing crime scenes and the wording of reports on
major crime stories.</P>
      <P>Chen Hao, of the cable station TVBS, said his news department
handles crime reports with great care. Instead of reporting on the
results of the crimes, it emphasizes possible reasons behind such
crimes so as not to unduly influence impressionable youths.</P>
      <P>Chen said that in the next year, the TVBS news department will
focus more on compassion, whether it is reports on young delinquents
or minority groups. The company will step up investigative reporting
teams or conduct in-depth reporting to provide a more full picture of
events.</P>
      <P>He stressed that some news reports are upsetting, but TVBS cannot
avoid reporting on such events entirely because it is all part of the
social phenomenon.</P>
      <P>Lee Tai-ling of the Chinese Television System said he cannot
agree with the president more. CTS has monitored the news reports of
other electronic media and found that some reports on crime last for
up to 30 minutes, he said.</P>
      <P>He blamed those who were only concerned with achieving a high
viewer rating and urged news media and viewers to shoulder some of
the responsibility. News reporters must think beyond ratings while
viewers must play the role of a watchdog, and voice objection to
sensational news.</P>
      <P>Tang Chien-ming of China Television Company (CTC) said CTC will
be more selective about its crime reports in the future, saying that
its evening news broadcasts now feature three positive reports on
Taiwan each week.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA AIRLINES REVISES UPWARD PREDICTED LOSS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After an air disaster earlier this year and
several threatening epidemics, China Airlines (CAL) officials revised
upward its forecasted losses from NT$900 million (US$30.43 million)
to NT$2.85 billion on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>At a news conference, CAL spokesman Yang Cheng attributed the
poorer-than-expected performance down to the crash of a CAL
Airbus-300 in Chiang Kai-Shek International Airport in February, the
bird influenza which wreaked havoc in Hong Kong, the enterovirus
which ravaged Taiwan, and the financial crisis which dogged Southeast
Asian states.</P>
      <P>CAL's passenger loads were down to an annual average of 69
percent of capacity compared to 72 percent in 1997, Yang said, adding
that the crash seriously tainted the company's image.</P>
      <P>However, the company's revenue from cargo traffic was expected to
post an year-on-year increase of 10.4 percent. This is a result of a
10.2 percent increase in the "revenue tonne kilometers" rate which is
more than offsetting the 4.6 percent decline in the volume of
freight, said Yang.</P>
      <P>"As a whole, the company's revenue is estimated to fall by 7.2
percent from a year earlier," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>He held bright prospects for 1999 after an alliance accord with
Singapore Airlines takes effect in January. Under the pact, Singapore
Airlines will take between 5 percent to 10 percent of CAL's stock and
will likely take a seat on CAL's board of directors.</P>
      <P>CAL hopes that Singapore Airlines' good safety record and
management efficiency will rub off on the risk-prone Taiwan carrier,
and boost its own image through the alliance, said Yang.</P>
      <P>According to CAL's own estimation, the company will operate in
the black next year on the strength of a 10 percent growth in
transportation capacity, a 12 percent increase in transportation
loads, and an 8 percent gain in revenue per kilometer.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LEADERS TO DISCUSS PRO-INDEPENDENCE PLATFORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Factional leaders of Taiwan's major
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will meet Thursday to
discuss matters relating to the amendment of its pro-independence
platform.</P>
      <P>The DPP incorporated Taiwan independence into its official
platform several years ago, but many DPP candidates have tried to
downplay the party's independence theme in recent elections in order
to broaden voter support. In order to win the next presidential
election some leaders of the party are talking about the amendment
of the platform.</P>
      <P>The people attending Thursday's meeting will elect members of
the "Party Platform and Charter Studying and Amending Group" for
further discussions on the matter. Members of the group will include
legislators of the party as well as scholars in the financial,
economic, social, legal, and political fields, an informed source
said.</P>
      <P>Leaders of the party's "Justice Alliance" have proposed to amend
the platform, but leaders of another faction, the "Welfare State
Alliance," have insisted that the party must uphold its 
pro-independence position, and said that the position has nothing to
do with the party's loss in the elections of legislators and the
mayor and city councilors of Taipei and Kaohsiung on Dec. 5.</P>

      <P>The Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) has
agreed to allow the indirect import of 61 additional items from the
mainland to Taiwan in its latest review on opening the island's
markets to mainland products.</P>
      <P>BOFT reviewed 108 items suggested by local manufacturers and
trade associations in a meeting on Wednesday. While members approved
61 items such as temporarily preserved agricultural products like
tomatoes and asparagus, they rejected 33 items.</P>
      <P>Board members deferred making a decision on certain items. These
products included controversial agricultural goods such as green tea
and black tea.</P>
      <P>BOFT said it could not make a decision on the teas due to
opposition from the Council of Agriculture (COA). The council argued
that imported tea from the mainland would pose a serious threat to
the already competitive domestic tea market.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the COA decided to continue to open the local
market to mainland marble until Dec. 31, 1999.</P>

    <HEADLINE>100,000 PIRATED CD-ROMS SEIZED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taoyuan  County,  Dec.  24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police raided three locations in
Chungli, Taoyuan County and seized 100,000 copies of pirated CD-ROM
software on Wednesday in one of Taiwan's largest crackdowns on
software piracy, Taoyuan police said.</P>
      <P>The estimated street value of the pirated software was at about
NT$100 million (US$3.1 million). The contraband included industrial
and business software as well as pornography.</P>
      <P>Police, acting under instructions of Taoyuan District Prosecutor
Chang Shao-ping, conducted three pre-dawn raids simultaneously at
three apartments in Chungli city, and busted a major source of
pirated CD-ROMs and several CD-ROM publishers, the equipment used to
copy the programs.</P>
      <P>Chang said two men, identified as Liu Chien-hsin, 32, and Chang
Li-min, 23, are believed to be the masterminds behind the piracy
ring. The two had escaped capture during the raids.</P>
      <P>According to Taoyuan police, they raided an apartment in Taipei
County's Yungho city on Nov. 2 and seized 200,000 copies of
counterfeit pornography CD-ROMs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Anti-Counterfeiting Committee under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA), has begun a new wave of anti-piracy
activities as the end of the year approaches.</P>
      <P>The New Year holiday is usually the peak season for sales of
pirated software products around the island.</P>
      <P>In a meeting on Thursday, Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu, who
heads the Anti-Counterfeiting Committee, said a fresh round of
anti-piracy actions will kick off anytime between now and the Lunar
New Year holidays in mid-February to stem the spread of such illicit
practices.</P>
      <P>To make the crackdown more effective, Lin said, the MOEA has
begun to promote the "identification of CD-ROMs" among local software
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>The committee has so far visited 42 leading local CD-ROM
producers this year. It is promoting the practice of engraving
identification marks on all CD-ROM products to help reduce the
prevalence of counterfeit goods. This practice will help protect
authentic products and save Taiwan's international image, Lin noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC NAVY DEVELOPS NEW TYPE OF TORPEDO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC Navy has successfully developed a
new type of torpedo suitable for use in the Taiwan Strait to help
safeguard Taiwan's security, military authorities said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The multipurpose torpedo was jointly developed by the Navy
Logistics Command and the military-operated Chungshan Institute of
Science and Technology.</P>
      <P>"The Wan Hsiang (Panorama) I has become the most advanced
standard torpedo used by our naval ships," said a naval officer, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>While the navy would not divulge any details concerning the
design or function of the new weapon, the naval officer said the Wan
Hsiang I torpedoes are designed to counter various types of mainland
Chinese warships and submarines.</P>
      <P>"They are also tailored to suit the special geographical features
of the Taiwan Strait. They can be mined at varied depths and can be
detonated by remote control based on magnetism and pressure," the
officer explained, adding that the navy has no immediate plans to
export the new torpedoes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Navy Logistics Command has also received the
ISO-9002 quality certification for its fuel, ammunition and equipment
supplies management.</P>
      <P>The Navy's equipment supply depot is the first military
warehouse to receive the ISO-9002 quality control recognition.</P>
      <P>An ISO-9002 certificate presentation ceremony was held Thursday
at the command's headquarters at the Tsoying naval base in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen Tso-chen, director-general of the Bureau of Commodity
Inspection and Quarantine, said at the ceremony that he is impressed
by the Navy's pursuit of quality in the ISO-9002 examination,
auditing and certification process.</P>
      <P>"We believe the Navy's efforts to upgrade logistic support
quality will help beef up our country's naval defense capabilities,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Navy Logistics Commander Kan Ke-chiang said logistic support
forms an integral part of naval combat capability. "As the logistics
command is responsible for repair and maintenance of various naval
warships as well as fuel and ammunition supplies, it must
standardize its management and operations to ensure service quality
and prompt delivery and avoid hindering overall naval combat
preparedness," Kan said, adding that this is the main reason behind
the command's pursuit of ISO-9002 certification.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC WILL NOT DONATE CASH TO MAINLAND DEMOCRATIC CAUSES</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) spokesman
Sheu Ke-sheng on Thursday categorically denied that the council is
planning to make any cash donations to democratic activities on the
Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>Sheu, spokesman and vice chairman of the nation's highest agency
in charge of formulating government policies on mainland China, said
all MAC expenditures are made in accordance with its approved budget
which does not include funds for donations, and certainly no
donations to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Sheu was responding to reporters' questions over whether
prominent mainland dissident Wei Jingshing, who is currently on a
nine-day visit to Taiwan, will receive a cash donation from the MAC.</P>
      <P>While the MAC budget allows for the financing of work with
mainland China, it only contributes to efforts which accelerate
cross-strait exchanges and negotiations, the two major tasks that the
MAC is authorized to engage in at present, he added.</P>
      <P>However, the MAC occasionally provides financial aid to private
Taiwan organizations that sponsor activities aimed at accelerating
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, Sheu noted.</P>
      <P>The Chung-hua Development Fund, an MAC offshoot, is authorized to
sponsor such financial aid programs, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING CRACKDOWN DUBBED 'GREAT LEAP BACKWARD'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's recent sentencing of three
pro-democracy activists has put a dark shroud over flashes of a more
open atmosphere in mainland China, the Los Angeles Times said in an
editorial on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The message authorities there sent was clear -- organized
opposition to the communist regime will not be tolerated, the paper
said, after Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai and Qin Yongmin were arrested,
tried and sentenced for trying to register what they called the China
Democracy Party.</P>
      <P>Beijing's latest and harshest crackdown flies in the face of its
signing of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights, which requires signatory nations to protect peaceful
political expression and association. Beijing also committed to
similar obligations under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>Xu, Wang and Qin had promised authorities they would not
challenge the Communist Party's ruling status or violate any laws,
then embarked on registering their party in locals from the coastal
province of Zhejiang to the inland industrial center of Wuhan.</P>
      <P>After a mere three-hour trial, Xu, 55, a prominent dissident who
served a 12-year prison term for his involvement in the Democracy
Wall movement in the late 1970s, was sentenced to 13 years for
"subversion of state power." Wang, 32, a leader in the 1989 Tiananmen
protests, was sentenced to 11 years. Qin was sentenced to 12.</P>
      <P>With these verdicts, Beijing has taken a major leap backward, the
editorial said. Its attempt to divert criticism by releasing another
dissident, Liu Nianchun, and exiling him to the US cannot expunge the
regime's determination to erase the word "democracy" from "Chinese
affairs". This course will cost Beijing."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Maj. Gen. Wo Chi-kao, one of the key
figures in a high-profile military graft scandal earlier this year,
died in hospital due to liver complications early Thursday at the age
of 51.</P>
      <P>Wo, former director of the Engineering Department under the
Combined Service Force (CSF), was detained after the scandal came to
light early this year. In November, a military court sentenced him to
four years in prison on bribery and bid-rigging charges in the
construction of a military compound.</P>
      <P>Because of Wo's high rank, the military court has automatically
filed an appeal in the case.</P>
      <P>After suffering from health problems, Wo's family applied for his
release on bail on Dec. 3 so he could seek medical treatment. He died
of acute fulminating hepatitis at Taipei Municipal Chung Hsing
Hospital at 3:07 a.m.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense said it will no longer pursue
the case due to Wo's death.</P>
      <P>The case first came to light on Jan. 16 when Wo's house in the
southern city of Kaohsiung was firebombed and one of his
subordinates Lee Cheng was beaten by unidentified gangsters.</P>
      <P>Lee, fearful for his safety, suspected that the beating was a
vendetta by bidders who failed to win a contract for an air force
munitions bomb-shelter in Taitung County. He then asked military
authorities for protection and confessed that his superior instructed
him to rig the tender for bidding on Jan. 13 in favor of a certain
bidder.</P>
      <P>The scandal received wide report and raised calls for
investigations into other possible graft in the military.</P>

      <P>The nationwide suicide rate, which is among the world's highest,
was alarmingly steep among young Australians. In 1997, 510 suicides

      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian and Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yih, both

Office. Also present at the meeting was presidential

construction projects in their respective cities. President Lee
inquired about the progress being made in major projects in each
city.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL MANUFACTURERS CONSERVATIVE OVER ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local manufacturers were conservative in
their outlook for Taiwan's economic prospects in the next six months,
results of a business climate survey conducted by the Institute of
Economic Research indicated on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Only 9.8 percent of local manufacturers surveyed thought the
economic conditions in November were "good," down from 14.9 percent
in October. Over 47 percent viewed the conditions as "bad," up by 5.7
percent from October. Meanwhile, 42.4 percent thought the conditions
were "moderate."</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that output in November remained the same
as the previous month but inventories were on the increase; the
falling number of new orders led to a drop in the total amount of
current orders; and prices for domestic and export goods shrank,
resulting in a reduction on profit.</P>
      <P>Worse yet is the belief among manufacturers that the situation
will not improve in the next three months as costs are expected to
soar while total sales will decline.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, despite the overall gloomy economic outlook,
electronic consumer products are seen rebounding in the next six
months, the survey noted.</P>
      <P>Industries which are expected to remain moderate are food
products, artificial fibers, steel, machinery, telecommunication
facilities, textiles, plastic products, cement, wire, electric
appliances, automobile and bicycle accessories and components,
construction, retail and hospitality industries.</P>
      <P>Continued difficulties will likely be seen in the garment,
sophisticated machinery, porcelain and glass, nut processing and
information technology industries, poll respondents said.</P>
      <P>They also predicted that US economic growth will fall from 3.5
percent in 1998 to only 1 percent in 1999, while that in Europe will
likely reach 2.5 percent and Japan's will rebound to 0.1 percent in
1999.

(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices slid 0.1 percent on
Thursday as late profit-taking wiped out early gains ahead of the
long weekend, analysts said.</P>
      <P>The index posted gains early in the session on reports that the
goal of a government stabilization fund was to push the weighted
index above 7,000 points and that the central bank was set to inject
funds to help local companies tide themselves over amid the
current economic slowdown after the bank's board meeting Thursday
afternoon.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange weighted price index fell 5.65 points
to 6,683, following a 1.4-percent drop in the previous session.</P>
      <P>Volume was 2.01 billion shares worth NT$72.25 billion (US$2.24
billion), compared with NT$70.28 billion in the previous session.</P>
      <P>Losers outnumbered gainers 247 to 154, with 90 unchanged.</P>
      <P>Among the eight major stock categories, the plastics sector
posted the steepest losses and the construction sector enjoyed the
largest gains.</P>
      <P>The government through its stock market stabilization fund will
aggressively intervene in the market, while the Central Bank of China
will exercise an eased credit policy next year. Both actions will
benefit Taiwan's rebounding economy and have a positive influence on
the stock market, one dealer said.</P>
      <P>The over-the-counter market declined 1.17 points, closing at
167.95, while turnover amounted to NT$3.14 billion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, stock index futures finished the day higher.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index Futures
(TAIEX Index Futures) for January rose 5 points, closing at 6,840,
with 3,721 contract transactions.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for February were up 9 points, closing at

    <TEXT>
      <P>The father of Reuben Philippe
Tchernegovski, a young man from New Zealand who came to Taiwan in
mid-November but has not contacted his family back home since he
arrived, on Thursday met with local media and pleaded for help in
finding his son.</P>
      <P>The senior Tchernegovski, Phil, flew into Taipei Wednesday from
the New Zealand capital of Auckland.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held at the New Zealand Commerce and
Industry Office in Taipei on the morning of Christmas eve, a
teary-eyed Tchernegovski said his family has not heard from Reuben
since he left home for Taiwan on Nov. 15.</P>
      <P>Tchernegovski said his 23-year-old son, a student at a university
in Auckland, told him that he intended to scale several mountains in
Taiwan, including ones in Shueipah National Park in north-central
Taiwan. Reuben was to return home before his birthday on Dec. 4, his
father said.</P>
      <P>Reuben's trip came amid his university's summer vacation.</P>
      <P>Three of Reuben's classmates are from Taiwan, and his father
speculated that Reuben may have attempted to contact them after his
arrival. But it was learned Thursday that none of the three
classmates had been contacted by Reuben.</P>
      <P>According to National Police Administration (NPA) records, Reuben
entered Taiwan through Chiang Kai-shek International Airport on the
afternoon of Nov. 15.</P>
      <P>NPA officials, to whom Tchernegovski turned for help, said there
is no record of the cashing of US$1,000 in the traveler's checks held
by Ruben, nor have any transactions been recorded on his ASB VISA
credit card. Reuben also left home with US$1,200 in cash,
Tchernegovski said.</P>
      <P>Tchernegovski urged the NPA to authorize helicopter search
missions to help find Reuben, an experienced and avid mountain
climber.</P>
      <P>Reuben, who stands 185 centimeters tall, weighs about 70-75
kilograms, has short, light-brown hair and wears gold-rimmed glasses.
He is studying denistry, and married to a Chinese-Malaysian woman,
who is expecting their second child. The couple have a 2-year-old
daughter.</P>
      <P>Tchernegovski pleaded for help from the Taiwan government and the
public in finding his son, who brought with him a Canon camera and a
green cotton hat often worn by New Zealanders when they went
mountain-climbing.</P>
      <P>Any information related to the man's whereabouts is urged to
contact the New Zealand Commerce and Industry Office at (02)
2757-6725, extension 204, or the NPA Foreign Affairs Office at (02)
2321-8673 or (02) 2393-0989.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) on
Thursday asked the Government Information Office (GIO) to step up
efforts to monitor television stations after complaints that animals
are being mistreated on some TV programs.</P>
      <P>The Life Conservation Association and other animal rights
organizations filed complaints with Taipei police Wednesday about the
improper use of animals.</P>
      <P>Association officials said that to raise viewer ratings, China
Television Co. has exploited animals through their use in variety
programs. In one such instance, an entertainer was bitten by a beaver
and passed out on the spot.</P>
      <P>Such programs have grossly violated the rights of the animals,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>They said the COA, as the government agency in charge of the
protection of animal rights, should take the initiative in punishing
the TV station in connection with the violations. The council should
also step up its campaign to protect animals, they said.</P>
      <P>Chen Pao-chi, director of the COA's Animal Industry Department,
said the COA has asked the GIO, which is responsible for the
regulation of TV programs, to step up the regulation of such programs
and to review them before they are aired.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the COA is collecting information on such programs

    <HEADLINE>NO PLAN TO PROP UP HOUSING MARKET: PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 24 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A presidential office spokesman on Thursday
rejected a media report that President Lee Teng-hui has agreed to set
up a fund to prop up the island's dull housing market.</P>
      <P>Local newspapers reported Thursday that Lee made the promise
during a Wednesday meeting with representatives of the Taiwan
Building Investment Association.</P>
      <P>The government housing-stabilization funds would be used to buy
units in buildings that the buildings' developers were unable to
sell, to lower the rates for housing loans and to provide
compensation for a new town development in Taichung City of the
central Taiwan, according to the reports.</P>
      <P>The presidential spokesman said Lee met with the building
investment association representatives because he is concerned over
the state of Taiwan's housing sector.</P>
      <P>Because the issues raised and demands made by the representatives
involve a range of authorities and laws, Lee suggested moves to prop
up Taiwan's housing market should be handled by a group comprising
representatives of relevant authorities and developers, the spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ying Nai-ping, a finance professor at National
Chengchi University, said on Thursday that such a fund could play a
key role in helping Taiwan's housing sector. Not all the money in the
fund, however, should be used to buy building units, he said.</P>
      <P>Ying suggested that the best way to take advantage of such funds
is to promote the security of mortgage loans provided by banks.</P>
      <P>He stressed if the government decides to establish such a fund,
it should at the same time limit the construction of new buildings.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW MRT LINE OPENS AMID PROTESTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After six years of construction, the
Hsintien-Chungho line of the Taipei Mass Rapid Transit System (MRT)
formally opened to traffic Thursday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Transport services on the new 7.9-kilometer MRT line, also known
as Hsingchung line because it passes both Chungho City and the
northern section of the MRT's Hsintien line, began at 1 p.m.</P>
      <P>Many people flocked to take a ride on the new MRT line, the third
of its kind in the greater Taipei area.</P>
      <P>A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held in the morning at the line's
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall station in downtown Taipei, with the
participation of Premier Vincent Siew and outgoing Taipei Mayor Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Also participating in the ceremony were Minister of
Transportation and Communications Lin Feng-cheng, former Taipei Mayor
Huang Ta-chou and Taipei County Magistrate Su Chen-chang.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Premier Siew said the MRT network is
the most important transport artery in metropolitan areas.
Quoting a TV commercial, Siew said "Keep the arterial traffic
network running smoothly, life will be colorful."</P>
      <P>With the inauguration of the Hsinchung line, Siew said, Taipei
now has an additional traffic artery. "I believe the new MRT service
will enable residents in Taipei City and Taipei County to lead
a healthier and more convenient life," he added.</P>
      <P>Mayor Chen, who will step down from the mayoral post on Friday,
said he appreciates the devoted services of all staff members of the
municipal government's Department of Raid Transit Systems and
construction workers. "Their efforts have made it possible that the
Hsinchung line was completed one year ahead of the schedule."</P>
      <P>The festive inaugural ceremony, however, was overshadowed by
protests from some 100 residents in the Chungho-Yungho area whose
houses were damaged during construction of the new MRT line and
construction workers suspected of having developed decompression
sickness because of their work for constructing the underground MRT
line.</P>
      <P>Angry residents and construction workers blamed the city
government for failing to offer them adequate compensation. They
pelted the new MRT line's major stations with eggs and threatened to
conduct long-term demonstrations or boycotts if the city government
fails to resolve the issue as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Taipei's MRT network comprises five lines -- Mucha, Tamsui,
Hsinchung, Nankang and Panchiao lines. Mucha and Tamsui lines were
already inaugurated in 1996 and 1997, respectively. The
Chingmei-Hsintien section of the Hsinchung line and the Nanakang and
Panchiao lines are still under construction.</P>
      <P>The Hsinchung line starts from the Tamsui line's Taipei station
and passes through Taipei City's Kungyuan Road, Roosevelt Road,
Shuiyuan Road and several major streets in Taipei County's Yungho
City and ends at Chungho City's Nanshichiao district.</P>
      <P>Servicing seven stations, the line is all located underground.
It also feature a 1,100 meter-long riverbed tunnel beneath the
Hsintien Stream.</P>
      <P>The new MRT line is connected with the Tamsui line. Passengers
now can travel from Nanshihchiao to the scenic coastal township of
Tamsui within 46 minutes. It takes only 14 minutes to travel from
Nanshihchiao to the bustling Taipei Railway Station.</P>
      <P>The municipal government-run Taipei Rapid Transit Co. has
planned a series of activities to celebrate the opening of the new
line, including exacting only NT$20 for a ride on all MRT lines
until Dec. 27.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN TIMES CONDEMNS MAINLAND CHINA IN EDITORIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,   Dec.   24   (CNA)
(By Mike Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Japan Times, the largest
English-language newspaper in Japan, condemned Thursday in an
editorial mainland China for its trials of three mainland Chinese
promoters of democracy this week and urged the world to ensure that
Beijing pays the price for ignoring its international obligations.</P>
      <P>The Times in an editorial titled "China's spring is over" said
that hopes for an improvement in mainland China's human rights policy
in the wake of a state visit by US President Bill Clinton came to an
abrupt end this week with the convictions and prison sentences of 10
years or more for Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai and Qin Yongmin.</P>
      <P>There were signs of growing tolerance of some dissent in mainland
China during President Clinton's tour of Beijing this summer, which
was followed by mainland China's signing of the United Nations
International Convention on Civil and Political Rights in October.
That agreement enshrines freedom of association among its basic
tenets, noted the Times.</P>
      <P>The heavy sentences handed down this week have dashed whatever
expectations the outside world may have had of mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin. It had been suggested in the past that once
Jiang was comfortably in power, he would liberalize the country's
political system to match its economic reforms. Moreover, it was
thought he had gained the necessary leverage to pursue limited
political reforms.</P>
      <P>"That is no excuse for Beijing's flagrant violation of its
international obligation and its duties to its citizens," argued the
Times. "The (Beijing) government's willingness to put its interests
ahead of those of its citizens exposes Beijing's democratic
pretensions as a sham."</P>
      <P>The newspaper lamented Japan's reaction to the trials, saying:
"Although more countries are willing to denounce them (mainland
China) ... and even European countries like Germany and France, which
have traditionally muted their public criticisms of China, have
joined the United States in condemning the trials. Sadly, thus far
the Japanese government has been silent."</P>
      <P>Beijing's signing of the UN convention and its desire for greater
international recognition mean that its behavior is subject to
international scrutiny, claimed the Times. "The rest of the world
must ensure that China pays the price for ignoring those
obligations."</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHAIRMAN SAYS INDEPENDENCE ISSUE SHOULD BE CLEARED UP BY 2000</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 24 (CNA)
(By Angel Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) chairman
Lin Yih-hsiung said on Thursday that issue of independence should be
cleared up before the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>After Chen Shui-bian's failure to win a second term as Taipei
mayor, DPP members now more than ever expect him to run for
president, Lin said. The independence issue, however, should be
resolved in accordance with the DPP's party platform before any
changes to its policy are made, said Lin.</P>
      <P>Lin also made the remark that disputes on amending the Taiwan
independence article of the DPP's party platform should be resolved
through the DPP's platform amendment committee, which will hold a
thorough discussion on amended articles approved by the DPP National
Congress.</P>
      <P>In response to remarks that the party's stand on independence is
what is preventing it from becoming the ruling party, Lin argued that
people do not understand the real meaning of the article. He added
that opinion polls have shown rising support for Taiwan independence,
although the number of people supporting it has not yet exceeded half
the population.</P>
      <P>As for recent disputes over the ethnicity of various groups in
Taiwan, Lin said political figures should visit with different ethnic
groups. For instance, Kaohsiung mayor-elect Frank Hsieh and Lin
visited the villages of military dependents, many of whom are loyal
to the pro-reunification New Party, 10 times during the election
campaign, he said.</P>
      <P>Concerning the presidential election in 2000, Lin noted that the
DPP is willing to cooperate with the New Party against the
"corrupted" KMT.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA'S ARMY SLOW TO LET ITS BUSINESSES GO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Dec.  24  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The handover to the mainland Chinese
government of the armed forces' business interests has not been
smooth, nor has it been completed, according to reports from the
Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) Thursday.</P>
      <P>The drive to divest the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the
People's Armed Police of an empire of up to 20,000 enterprises was
begun in July by President Jiang Zemin. The initiative was one of the
most important and boldest announced during his tenure.</P>
      <P>One of the main aims of the campaign was to make the army, which
brought the party to power in 1949, more reliant on state finances
and more obedient to state directives. The army has been one of the
main perpetrators of rampant smuggling this year, an activity that
has helped bring many state enterprises to their knees, the WTO
report said.</P>
      <P>An official in the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC),
the state body responsible for the divestiture of army enterprises,
was quoted as saying that the finances of all military companies
would fall under the auspices of the Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>But a senior executive at Sanjiu, one of mainland China's largest
pharmaceutical companies and a PLA business, was quoted as saying
that no such thing had taken place. He said that a team from the
company was in Beijing to negotiate details of the transfer.</P>
      <P>Military company executives also rejected the common official
claim that no government compensation was required because all
military assets had originally belonged to the mainland state. This,
PLA executives said, ignored the contributions to enterprises of many
individuals over several years.</P>
      <P>Analysts said it was likely that several months of wrangling
would be required before any genuine transfer of ownership was
completed. Some of the issues now expected to occupy the Take-over
Office for Military, Armed Police, Government and Judiciary
Businesses -- a body under the SETC -- include the clearing of
inventories, auditing and staff settlements, the WTO report said.</P>

      <P>The US dollar slid to a
nine-and-a-half-month low of NT$32.243 on the Taipei foreign exchange
market Thursday after falling NT$0.004 from the previous day.</P>
      <P>The greenback opened at NT$32.239 and fluctuated between
NT$32.232 and NT$32.249.</P>
      <P>A total of US$219 million changed hands during the trading
session.</P>
      <P>Analysts attributed the US currency's drift to the upcoming

      <P>The NT dollar's rise is being mitigated, however, by slack

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SAILBOAT STARTS GLOBAL JOURNEY AMID BLESSINGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec.  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan sailboat left Kaohsiung
Harbor Thursday afternoon for a round-the-world voyage amid blessings
from hundreds of well-wishers.</P>
      <P>The adventurous voyage will be led by Liu Ning-sheng, a son of
the respected 88-year-old painter Liu Chi-wei. Liu, 52, will be
accompanied by four other crew members, including a German
sailing friend of his and a female crew member, on the two-year
voyage.</P>
      <P>This is the first round-the-globe maritime journey ever
mounted by Republic of China nationals.</P>
      <P>Among the well-wishers was outgoing Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yih,
who said the adventure will manifest Chinese people's courage,
determination and guts to overcome challenges and tests.</P>
      <P>The ROC government, the ruling Kuomintang, the Kaohsiung City
Government and many local enterprises have offered financial support
for the voyage.</P>
      <P>The 16-foot long, two-sail boat, dubbed "New Era," is a white
sloop. The sailboat will call at 20 major ports around the world
during its 21,250-nautical mile voyage.</P>
      <P>The "New Era" will sail through all major oceans and the noted
Suez Canal and the Panama Canal in its 82-week journey. Its first
port call will be at Manila. It will also stop over in Singapore,
Jidda of Saudi Arabia and many other major ports.</P>
      <P>The sailboat is scheduled to return to Kaohsiung in November
2000.</P>
      <P>The boat's departure for the voyage was delayed for one hour
because its propeller unexpectedly tangled with a fishing net.</P>
      <P>A Marine Corps brass band performed pleasing music as the "New
Era" pulled out of the southern Taiwan harbor under a setting sun.
All ships berthing in the harbor rang their sirens to bid farewell
to the sail boat, and well-wishers hung strings of tiny paper cranes
from the boat in a gesture indicating wishes for a safe and pleasant
journey.</P>
      <P>Skipper Liu said he and his friends have prepared for three years
for the trans-century trip, which is expected to further attest to
the bravery of Taiwan people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ISLANDWIDE OUTCRY AGAINST ILLEGAL CYPRESS LOGGING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 24 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 100 environmental protection and
religious organizations around Taiwan raised an outcry on Thursday
against government measures to clear dead cypress trees in Ilan
County's Chilan forest district in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The outcry was triggered by allegations that numerous living
cypress have been illegally logged by the Vocational Association
Commission for Retired Servicemen (VACRS), which was contracted to
carry out the clearing of dead trees in state-owned forests.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Lin Fong-sheng
made the allegation Thursday in Ilan, when he revealed that earlier
in the day he had discovered two newly felled live cypresses in the
Chilan forest.</P>
      <P>Lin stressed that he will unify the island's environmental
preservation forces to demand the Council of Agriculture (COA),
Taiwan's highest authority for agricultural affairs, to suspend the
VACRS's logging rights, which allow the commission to sell timbers of
cypress.</P>
      <P>Chen Jen-chih, a Hsinchu district prosecutor, held a recent press
conference during which he unveiled an investigation carried out in
1996, which found that during the period from April to September that
year, more than 300 live cypresses had been felled.</P>
      <P>Cypress, a valuable forest resource, is fully protected by law.
Due to its scarcity and suitability for making high-quality furniture
and sculptures, a single tree can be worth more than NT$1.5 million
(US$46,580) on the market, while the value will be far higher if the
timber is processed.</P>
      <P>The VACRS's forest development department should be held fully
responsible for the illegal logging, despite the fact that there is
no direct evidence linking the department to the crime, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Chilan cypress forest, covering around 20,000 hectares, is
one of the most precious original forests in the world.</P>
      <P>Most of the island's wildlife preservation and environmental
protection organizations are calling for a national campaign to save
the Chilan cypresses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PACKAGE ANNOUNCED TO HELP RECESSION-HIT FIRMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With only a few days left until the
beginning of a new year, the government on Thursday announced a
comprehensive loan relief package to help financially troubled local
businesses.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan approved the package in a Cabinet meeting,
during which Premier Vincent Siew announced that the government will
allocate NT$120 billion-worth of loans to help crisis-hit enterprises
to purchase machinery and obtain soft bank loans.</P>
      <P>A special bank fund worth NT$40 billion was also announced at the
meeting, aimed at providing small- and medium-sized businesses with
soft loans.</P>
      <P>The required capital reportedly will come from postal savings
funds redeposited at the Central Bank of China (CBC), according to
local press reports.</P>
      <P>The premier instructed that the CBC, in conjunction with the
Ministry of Finance and participating banks, should make concerted
efforts to fully implement the package in order to create a "win-win"
situation for both the business and banking sectors, in the hope that
the series of measures will help those recession-mired businesses
overcome their short-term difficulties.</P>
      <P>The approved package had been finalized by CBC Governor Peng
Fai-nang, Finance Minister Paul Chiu, and Economic Affairs Minister
Wang Chih-kang at a Wednesday gathering, based on a draft worked out
on Nov. 4.</P>
      <P>Concrete measures contained in the package include:</P>
      <P>-- Companies which have so far paid their interest normally but
will have difficulty repaying their loans before the end of June 1999
will be given an additional repayment grace period of six months;</P>
      <P>-- Small- and medium-sized businesses can apply to the CBC for
special interest-rate loans for the purchase of machinery, on a
case-by-case basis;</P>
      <P>-- Companies which have paid their interest as required but will
have difficulty repaying their previous loans for machinery purchases
before the end of July next year will also be given a six-month grace
period.</P>
      <P>Siew stressed that the government will review the capital
requirements for the package at any time, and that it will earmark
more budget if necessary in order to meet demand. The government will
also consider setting up a task force to help serve those enterprises
which are qualified under the terms of the package.</P>
      <P>The premier said it is important to assist legally run companies
to continue operating and to give them greater access to bank loans,
as the local business community has been mired in recession ever
since a dozen financially troubled companies reported settlement
defaults over the past few months.</P>
      <P>Siew gave high marks for the performance of Taiwan businesses
since the Asian financial troubles broke out more than a year ago,
but called on people to remain on the alert, as the crisis has not
yet blown over completely.</P>
      <P>He urged all government agencies and the public to cooperate with
the government and allow it to carry out its plan to revive the local
economy in order to maintain steady growth in the country's economic
development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTER SPEAKS ON ALLEGED TOXIC WASTE INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on Thursday
that he has asked a ruling Kuomintang legislator with extensive
connections with the Cambodian leadership to assist in resolving the
controversy surrounding a waste shipment to Cambodia.</P>
      <P>Hu told a news conference that Legislator Tseng Chen-nung has
agreed to travel to Cambodia on Friday to look into the Cambodian
government's stance on the waste disposal issue involving Taiwan's
petrochemical giant, Formosa Plastics Group (FPG).</P>
      <P>Hu said Tseng is expected to transfer his letter to the
Cambodian government. The letter stressed three key points,
including that the Republic of China, an independent sovereign
state, hopes to discuss directly with Cambodian authorities issues
related to the FPG's controversial shipment of possibly toxic waste
to the Cambodia's coastal resort of Sihanoukville.</P>
      <P>"The letter also said that the ROC has traditionally supported
the international environmental protection policy and regulations
and that the FPG shipment was just an isolated case," Hu said,
adding that the letter also assured Cambodia that the ROC government
will properly handle the issue.</P>
      <P>The minister further said he is hopeful that the Cambodian
government will respond to the ROC's offer for assistance in
resolving the issue as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Hu went on to say that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA),
the Environmental Protection Administration, the Government
Information Office and the FPG will form a joint task force to handle
the dispute.</P>
      <P>Hu said the MOFA may send officials to Cambodia to handle
related affairs after Tseng's return.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the FPG offered a public apology for having caused
the controversy.</P>
      <P>FPG President Lee Chih-tsun said he hopes the Cambodian
government will allow the waste to be stored in Sihanoukville if
tests in Singapore and Thailand on the samples of the waste show
that the waste's mercury content is not lethal.</P>
      <P>Lee denied that the company had ever bribed any Cambodian
officials for the waste shipment.</P>
      <P>He also reiterated that the 2,700 tons of waste the FPG shipped
to Cambodia was certified in Taiwan as safe for landfill disposal and
that the shipment to Cambodia was conducted completely legally.</P>
      <P>"We had legally acquired an import permit from the Cambodian
government before exporting the industrial waste to that country,"
the FPG executive said, adding that the mercury residues in the
waste, 269 grams in total, will not cause any harm to human
health.</P>
      <P>The incident came to the limelight earlier this week after
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen claimed in Phnom Penh prior to his
departure for a visit to Beijing that the FPG's waste poses great
health threat to Cambodian people and several residents in the
vicinity of the garbage dump in the coastal resort Sihanoukville
might have died because of touch on the toxic waste.</P>
      <P>Cambodian authorities have so far not served the ROC any
official notice or report concerning the toxic waste. Cambodia
diplomatically recognizes Beijing and is not friendly toward
Taiwan. Hun Sen forced the ROC to close its representative office in
Phnom Penh last year.</P>

      <P>Council for Economic Planning and

meeting Premier Vincent Siew on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In the brief meeting of just over ten minutes following a regular
Cabinet meeting, Siew hailed Chiang's performance at the post and
persuaded him to continue in the job.</P>
      <P>Chiang expressed his desire to quit the post on Wednesday to Vice
Premier Liu Chao-shiuan after learning of outside criticism, some of
which came from former Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yih, that the Executive
Yuan's Kaohsiung Service Center has become little more than a
"complaint center," and has failed to really serve the people of
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The center was set up six months ago to provide people in
southern Taiwan with an alternative to traveling to Taipei in the
north of the island every time they had to conduct business with the
central government.</P>
      <P>Chiang's intention to quit the post aroused grave concern among

    <TEXT>
      <P>Central Bank of China (CBC) Governor Peng
Fai-nang said on Thursday that the CBC will continue with its current
loose monetary policy in 1999.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a year-end news conference after the CBC's last board
meeting of 1998, Peng said the CBC will adjust its growth target
range of M2 monetary supply for 1999 downward to between 6 percent
and 11 percent.</P>
      <P>M2, a major indicator of a country's economic health, consists of
cash in circulation as well as demand and savings deposits.</P>
      <P>As capital supply remains abundant in the domestic market, Peng
said the CBC will not cut its bank deposit reserve requirements at
present.</P>
      <P>Judging from the financial situations both at home and abroad,
the CBC governor predicted that Taiwan's export sector will not fully
regain momentum next year. He said the Taiwan economy will grow by
5.1 percent in 1999, while the inflation rate will increase only by
1.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Although the new Taiwan dollar has rebounded noticeably since
October, Peng said the central bank will allow the market mechanism
to decide the value of the local currency.</P>
      <P>Since business conditions remain sluggish in the domestic market,

    <HEADLINE>NOTORIOUS KIDNAPPER'S DEATH SENTENCE UPHELD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's most notorious kidnapper and
murderer, Chen Ching-hsing, had his three death sentences and two
life terms upheld by the Supreme Court on Thursday, paving the way
for his execution.</P>
      <P>The sentences were meted out for a series of robberies, rapes,
and killings committed by Chen and two accessories while they were on
the lam after kidnapping and killing Pai Hsiao-yen, daughter of
well-known TV star Pai Ping-ping near Taipei on April 14, 1997.</P>
      <P>Chen's two accessories, Lin Chun-sheng and Kao Tien-min, were
killed in separate confrontations with police in August and November
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen himself was arrested on Nov. 18 after he broke into the
residence of a South African diplomat and held the diplomat and his
family hostage, surrendering to police after a tense 24-hour
standoff.</P>
      <P>Another death sentence, handed down to Chen for his role in the
Pai case by the Taiwan High Court, was thrown out by the Supreme
Court, which ordered a retrial in this respect.</P>
      <P>Criticizing the High Court for failing to explain thoroughly the
dismissal of proof favorable to the defendants, the Supreme Court
ordered the reopening of a probe into whether Chen's brother-in-law
Chang Chih-hwi had helped detain the victim, and whether his wife,
Chang Su-chen, had helped Chen to elude arrest.</P>
      <P>Although acquitted by a district court, Chang Chih-hwi was given
a life sentence by the High Court, while Chang Su-chen was sentenced
to nine months, later extended to 15 years. The sharp difference in
the sentences has undermined the credibility of the judiciary and
prompted the Supreme Court to demand careful reexamination.</P>
      <P>A high court retrial was also demanded for Chen's role in the
hostage-holding.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court, however, let stand an eight-year jail term
imposed on another female defendant, Hsu Chia-hui, who became Chen's
girlfriend after Chen broke into her house and raped her. She was
convicted of helping to conceal Chen and Lin Chun-sheng by renting a
room for them.</P>
      <P>Chen's retrial will not prevent the carrying out of the death
sentences upheld on Thursday. However, it is up to prosecutors to
decide whether to carry out the execution before Chen has been tried
for his other crimes, said the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>Wu Pi-chu of the ruling Kuomintang was
elected as speaker of the Taipei City Council on Friday, becoming the
first woman speaker of a municipality in the history of the Republic

      <P>Wu, 50, beat Lan Mei-chin of the opposition Democratic

Council for the fifth consecutive time, is said to be a modest and
well-rounded person who gets along with her friends and foes alike.</P>
      <P>Analysts said that Wu's election is related to the political
ecology of the Taipei City Council, where none of the three major
parties, the KMT, the DPP and the New Party, have been able to garner
more than half of the seats.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Fei Hung-tai of the New Party was
elected as deputy speaker of the Taipei City Council, the first member
of the tiny opposition party to reach such a high official level.</P>
      <P>Fei, 45, is said to be a savvy politician who is close to his

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's candidate for

result of four years ago.</P>
      <P>Tsai, a three-term councilman who has been jailed in the past for
gangster-related activities, garnered 23 votes against Wang's nine in
the 44-seat council. The result stunned many pundits because the KMT,
which controls a majority 25 seats, should have had more than enough
votes to assure Wang of victory.</P>
      <P>The outcome was reminiscent of the last deputy speaker election
in 1994, when the KMT-nominated candidate Chu An-hsiung lost to party
rival Chang Rui-teh in a surprise defeat.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, the KMT's Huang Chih-chuan was elected
speaker as expected, with the support of 31 councilmen.</P>
      <P>He and Tsai, both of whom are said to be strongly supported by

      <P>Chang told reporters that KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui, who also
serves as the nation's president, made no comment after learning of
the result on Friday.</P>
      <P>As to suggestions that vote-buying was involved in the Kaohsiung
elections, Chang said that the party's Kaohsiung branch will look
into the allegations and ascertain the truth before making any
decision on the matter.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT lost the election for deputy speaker in
Kaohsiung, the party can take comfort in its grip on the council
speakership in the southern port city, and also in its control of the
capital, Taipei, where it is only four seats short of an outright
majority in the 52-seat council.</P>

wins he courteously makes his bow before he advances to take his
place among the winners; and, when he has lost, he walks down and
drinks his cup of forfeit. Thus, even in this case of competition, he
shows himself to be a gentleman."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>PIRACY  AND  TURF WARS SLOWING BEIJING'S Y2K EFFORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Dec. 26 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's efforts to deal with the
Y2K millennium computer bug are handicapped by its widespread
intellectual piracy and turf wars between the central and provincial
governments, according to an Australian newspaper.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, the Australian reported that although
mainland China has made enormous efforts to catch up with the West
since it launched its program of economic reforms 20 years ago, it is
still a long way behind.</P>
      <P>The daily said that mainland China could face disruption out of
all proportion to its computer usage, because it is only now
scrambling to deal with the bug.</P>
      <P>Only last August did the mainland Chinese government come to
grips with the need to address the problem seriously, with the State
Council ordering all ministries to have the bug under control by
March 1999, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's banks and its stock exchanges have aggressive
Y2K programs under way with the help of international firms, yet
mainland Chinese ministries do not accept orders from each other and
therefore have not been complying with a State Council order that
they make monthly reports to the Ministry of Information Industry on
their progress.</P>
      <P>On top of the political problems is the widespread piracy, the
daily reported. "More than 90 percent of the software used in China
is pirated, and so vendors are less interested in helping users of
copies of their product," said an Australian government computer
analyst.</P>
      <P>"The computer systems used by Chinese government agencies and
companies combine hardware and software from nearly every country in
the world, and many of these systems are undocumented," he added.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The New York-based Human Rights Watch has
urged Australia and other industrialized countries to rethink their
human rights dialogues with mainland China in protest against
Beijing's harsh sentences imposed on three dissidents.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, the Australian Associated Press (AAP)
reported the 11-13 year sentences given to dissidents Xu Wenli, 55,
Qin Yongmin, 45, and Wang Youcai, 32, show that mainland China does
not respect its international obligations.</P>
      <P>Human Rights Watch urged Australia and Western countries,
including the United States and Canada, to make immediate, high level
appeals to Beijing for a commutation of the sentences handed down to
the three dissidents who tried to establish an opposition China
Democracy Party to promote democracy in the mainland.</P>
      <P>It also urged Australia and other countries to suspend any
high-level trade delegations scheduled to visit mainland China in
early 1999.</P>
      <P>"China's signature on a human rights treaty isn't worth the paper
it's written on if this is what it does to peaceful political
activists," said the Human Rights Watch Asia director Sydney Jones.</P>
      <P>Mainland China signed the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights 10 weeks ago amid much fanfare, according the AAP
report.</P>
      <P>Human Rights Watch said under such circumstances, it is time for
governments such as Australia and the United States which are engaged
in human rights dialogues with mainland China, to rethink the purpose
of these dialogues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI, KAOHSIUNG CITY MAYORS BEGIN TERMS</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou took
part in a fun run on Saturday, one day after being sworn in as the
chief of Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Ma, an avid jogger, showed up at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall at
6:50 a.m. to a warm reception by the participants in the run which
was sponsored by the Ministry of the Interior and a civil group to
mark the 70th anniversary of the Republic of China's first copyright
legislation.</P>
      <P>Ma took 28 minutes to complete the route from Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall to the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in eastern part of
Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Ma later described his time as far from his personal best, and
blamed it on a lack of practice due to his hectic election campaign
schedule. However, he added that in the future, he will go back to his
habit of jogging every morning.</P>
      <P>The mayor also used the occasion to urge the public to pay
attention to the issue of copyright, saying that protecting copyright
is protecting individual creativity, which is a sure sign of an
advanced society.</P>
      <P>Ma later attended "a festival of wheels" at a downtown department
store which featured remodeled jeeps, all-terrain vehicles, sedans
and motorcycles. The mayor urged the motorcyclists to be aware of the
compulsory insurance project for motorcyclists which will be put into
practice next month.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kaohsiung City Mayor Frank Hsieh said on Saturday that
the first priority will be to deal with the garbage problem in the
harbor city.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that over the past two years, he has observed the
heaps of garbage bags which are dumped by residents in the city
streets and ripped open and scattered by stray dogs and cats. These
sights, he pointed out, are not scenes which befit a metropolitan
city.</P>
      <P>Hsieh spoke of the urgency of grappling with the garbage problem
during a visit to former Kaohsiung City Council Speaker Chen
Tien-mao.</P>
      <P>He said that he will start to push a project which will see
daytime dumping of garbage banned, and trash collections taking
place at nighs.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that he will also try to help the working rights of
more than 60 laid-off employees of the Taiwan Machinery Manufacturing
Corp.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLICE LAUNCH ALL-OUT SEARCH FOR MISSING NZ YOUTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police in the southern Taiwan county of
Chiayi on Saturday launched an all-out search for a missing college
student from New Zealand in the scenic Alishan mountain region.</P>
      <P>Twenty police officers and 30-plus aboriginal youths formed four
search parties to hunt for Reuben Philippe Tchernegovski along four
separate popular mountain trails which lead through passes linking
Alishan to scenic spots known as Fengshan, the Fairy Dream Garden,
Chitou. and Laichi.</P>
      <P>Police had received reports from several local residents saying
they had seen a foreign youth answering Tchernegovski's description
walking alone toward Tashan along the Mienyueh branch line of the
Alishan Mountain Railway between Nov. 25 and November 26.</P>
      <P>According to the residents, the foreigner was wearing a green
sweater and cut-off jeans, and was carrying a small backpack.</P>
      <P>"Cashing in on today's sunny weather, we decided to send rescue
teams to comb the Alishan area for the missing 23-year-old New
Zealander, who lost contact with his family after he came to the
island in mid-November," said a spokesman for the Chiayi County
Police Bureau.</P>
      <P>He said the bureau has checked registration records of all hotels
and hostels in the Alishan region, but has found no valuable
information or clues.</P>
      <P>The bureau has set up a temporary command center at its Alishan
outpost to facilitate coordination and rescue operations, the
spokesman said, adding that the bureau on Saturday also dispatched a
police helicopter on a search mission over the Alishan mountain
region.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the National Police Administration (NPA) has taken a
number of measures to help in the search for Tchernegovski, including
publishing special "inquiry" pamphlets and ordering all police
offices around the island to contact hospitals and clinics in their
duty areas to check whether he has been admitted or treated.</P>
      <P>NPA Director-General Ting Yuan-chin met on Friday with the
youth's father, Phil Tchernegovski, to express the ROC government's
concern for the incident and its willingness to assist in the search.</P>
      <P>The senior Tchernegovski arrived in Taipei on Thursday to search
for his missing son, a dentistry major at a New Zealand university.</P>
      <P>The NPA has provided a room at its Taipei police officers' club
for Tchernegovski to live in during his stay here, and has assigned a
staff member to offer counseling services.</P>
      <P>Tchernegovski said he will travel to central and southern Taiwan
in the next few days to join the search for his son.</P>
      <P>Reuben Philippe Tchernegovski arrived at Taiwan's main gateway,
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, at around 3 p.m. on Nov. 15.
He has not called family members or three of his Taiwan friends
since his arrival.</P>
      <P>The well-built young man, who stands 185 centimeters tall and
weighs 70 to 75 kilograms, has short, light-brown hair and wears
gold-trimmed glasses.</P>
      <P>His father said Reuben left home with a green cotton hat, a
Cannon camera, an ASB Visa card, a travelers' check worth US$1,000
and some US$1,200 in cash.</P>
      <P>Local bank records show that Reuben has not yet used the credit
card or the travelers' check. Reuben failed to return home by
his birthday, Dec. 4, as scheduled. Local customs records also show
that Reuben has not yet left Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to his father, Reuben is fond of visiting tropical
rain forests and planned to take trips to the Kenting, Shei-pa
and Taroko National Parks during his Taiwan journey.</P>
      <P>Reuben has married and has a two-year-old daughter. His wife is
expecting their second child.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MONOPOLY TAX ON EUROPEAN SPIRITS TO BE LOWERED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The monopoly tax for imported spirits from
Europe will be lowered beginning on Jan. 1, 1999, the Department of
National Treasury under the Ministry of Finance said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Taxes for European brandy and whisky, such as French Cognac and
Armagnac, will see the largest reduction of over 60 percent. Prior to
the new year, such items will be taxed NT$490 per liter compared to
NT$198 beginning next month. Irish and English whisky will be charged
NT$198 compared to NT$350 per liter, the department said.</P>
      <P>The reduction is the second round of its kind in half a year
since Taiwan and the European Union (EU ) signed a formal agreement
on the island's membership to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in
mid-1998.</P>
      <P>However, the department pointed out that prices of European
spirits may fluctuate again after the new rates, currently being
drafted as a part of the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Law, pass
legislature which is set to begin a new session on Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had promised the EU that it would slash its monopoly tax
on imported European spirits if the Legislative Yuan fails to approve
the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Law before the end of this year. The
chances of that occurring are slim as there are only a few days
remaining in 1998.</P>
      <P>National coffers will suffer a loss in revenue of an estimated
NT$1.5 billion following this round of tax reduction, officials with
the Ministry of Economic Affairs said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FPG URGED TO SEND STAFF TO CAMBODIA TO HANDLE WASTE ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,    Dec.    26    (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) on Saturday formally ordered Formosa Plastics
Group (FPG) to send a special team to Cambodia to handle the
controversial waste shipment issue.</P>
      <P>Fu Shu-chiang, director of the EPA's Solid Waste Control Bureau,
said the Republic of China government has on many occasions offered
to cooperate with Cambodian authorities in dealing with the
thorny waste issue.</P>
      <P>"As the Cambodian government has so far failed to make any
replies to our offer, we have decided to pool resources with the
private sector to resolve the issue in a pragmatic manner," Fu said.</P>
      <P>As the first step, Fu said, the EPA has demanded that the FPG
immediately send a fact-finding team to Cambodia to discuss with
relevant Cambodian agencies feasible ways to settle the
issue properly.</P>
      <P>The team should comprise lawyers, technical experts and other
related professionals to facilitate identification of facts and
determine whether the FPG is obligated to compensate Cambodia, Fu
said.</P>
      <P>He added that if the mercury level in the solid waste shipped to
Cambodia last month exceeds safety standards, Taiwan's petrochemical
giant will be required to retrieve the possibly hazardous waste.</P>
      <P>In response to the EPA's demand, the FPG issued a press
statement Saturday afternoon, reiterating its regret over the
controversy and expressing its willingness to respect the Cambodian
government's opinion in handling the issue.</P>
      <P>The statement said if the FPG is required to retrieve the
2,700-ton allegedly toxic waste from Cambodia, it will not rule out
the possibility of shipping the waste to a third country for
permanent disposal.</P>
      <P>"The waste may either be taken back to our plant in Jenwu in the
southern Taiwan county of Kaohsiung or shipped to a third country
for landfill disposal," the statement said.</P>
      <P>The FPG also stressed that the waste had been certified by the
Cabinet-level EPA and the Kaohsiung County Government as safe for
landfill disposal before being shipped to Cambodia. "We fully abide
by law in shipping the solid waste to Cambodia," it asserted.</P>
      <P>The conglomerate said it will call a meeting on Monday to discuss
the EPA's demand. "We'll decide whether or when to send an
investigation team to Cambodia after the Monday meeting," a company
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Joyce Fu, chief executive of the Green Formosa Fron
(GFF), presented samples of the solid waste sent to Cambodia by the
FPG in November to the EPA on Saturday for tests.</P>
      <P>The samples were taken back by GFF members who visited
the FPG waste dumping site in the coastal resort of Sihanoukville in
southern Cambodia earlier this week to collect first-hand
information about the controversial waste shipment.</P>
      <P>The GFF executive asked the EPA to publicize its test results in
two days. EPA officials, however, insisted that the laboratory test
to determine the waste's mercury content needs at least three days.</P>
      <P>The FPG has said the mercury residues in its solid waste shipped
to Cambodia weigh about 269 grams in total. However, foreign wire
service reports said on Friday that the first of three analyses of
the waste shows a mercure content of 675 parts per million (PPM), a
level more than 3,000 times higher than the limit allowed by
the ROC government.</P>
      <P>The reports also quoted a Japanese expert as saying on Friday
that the FPG's mercury-contaminated solid waste is probably toxic.
Mineshi Sakamoto of the Japanese Environmental Agency's Minamata
Institute said: "According to the available test results, the waste
is dangerous, but at the moment it's still difficult to say more than
that."</P>
      <P>Sakamoto said tests on samples he would take back to Japan would
determine if the mercury was organic or inorganic. He said organic
mercury could cause nerve disorders, while the inorganic type could
cause lung and skin problems.</P>
      <P>The waste incident came to the limelight earlier this week after
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen claimed in Phnom Penh prior to his
departure for a visit to Beijing that the FPG's waste poses great
health threat to Cambodian people and several residents in
Sihanoukville might have died because of the touch on the waste.</P>
      <P>Cambodia has so far not served the ROC any official notice or
report concerning the incident. Cambodia recognizes Beijing and is
not friendly toward Taiwan. Hun Sen forced the ROC to close its
representative office in Phnom Penh last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE TO MEET WEI JINGSHENG ON TUESDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC President Lee Teng-hui is expected to
meet with visiting mainland Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng on
Tuesday, Wei's press secretary Qi Mo said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Qi said Wei, the most prominent exiled mainland dissident, will
focus its talks with President Lee on issues related democratic
reforms on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to Qi, Wei's current visit to Taiwan has brought a
significant impact on the establishment and development of relations
between mainland China's democracy movement and the Republic of
China on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I hope Wei's planned meeting with Lee will not be sabotaged by
mainland China's overseas agents," Qi said.</P>
      <P>Qi further divulged that Wei may postpone his return to the
United States until Jan. 3 because he wants to hold extensive
contacts and dialogue with social celebrities here.</P>
      <P>"Through such contacts, Wei hopes to gain a better understanding
of various developments in Taiwan as well as to win more support from
local people for mainland China's overseas pro-democracy movement
advocated by exiled mainland dissidents," Qi explained.</P>
      <P>Wei returned to Taipei on Saturday after visiting the tightly
guarded Green Island prison off the eastern Taiwan coast, which
was used to jail "political prisoners" during the martial law era.</P>
      <P>Wei is scheduled to meet with Premier Vincent Siew on Monday.</P>
      <P>Wei arrived in Taipei on Dec. 21 for a nine-day visit at the
invitation of the ROC Chapter of the World League for Freedom and
Democracy.</P>
      <P>Wei, who was released from a mainland Chinese prison last year

democracy in mainland China, is now residing in New York.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON IMPEACHMENT TOP INTERNATIONAL NEWS STORY OF 1998</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26  (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Congressional impeachment process
against US President Bill Clinton topped the list of the 10 most
newsworthy stories in 1998 selected by chief editors, senior writers
and other Republic of China media executives, including CNA.</P>
      <P>The list is as follows:</P>
      <P>1. Sparked by a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Paula Jones,
US President Bill Clinton was impeached by the House of
Representatives for lying about his affair with White House intern
Monica Lewinsky and faces Congressional impeachment. The
investigation report released by independent counsel Kenneth Starr
created a sensation around the world, raising praise and
condemnation.</P>
      <P>2. Riots erupted in Indonesia due to the deteriorating political
and economic situation. Former President Suharto, who ordered a
crackdown on the protesters, was forced to step down in May.
President B.J. Habibie took his place and promised to hold general
elections in June 1999 and dismantle the authoritarian legacy of his
predecessor. The minority Chinese Indonesians became obvious
scapegoats and the biggest losers in the riots.</P>
      <P>3. The Asian financial crisis resulted in domino effect on the
global economy. International organizations such as the International
Monetary Fund and the Group of Seven industrial nations have held
meetings to discuss ways to cope with the situation and to revive
economies.</P>
      <P>4. US President Bill Clinton visited the Chinese mainland and met
with President Jiang Zemin to discuss strategic alliance relations
between the two countries. During a visit to Shanghai, Clinton
verbally and unofficially referred to the so-called "three-noes"
policy with regard to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>5. On Sept. 2, Malaysia's former Deputy Prime Minster Anwar
Ibrahim was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad who said his
onetime heir apparent was unfit to lead. Supporters for both men have
engaged in continued clashes, sparking a serious political crisis in
Malaysia.</P>
      <P>6, The US Food and Drug Administration approved the marketing of
Viagra, a drug for the treatment of impotency. The new drug has
quickly become a bestseller around the world.</P>
      <P>7. The 11 nations in the European Union decided to issue the euro
in 1999, a major step forward for the single currency in Europe.</P>
      <P>8. The United States and Britain jointly carried out military air
strikes against Baghdad, after the Iraqi government announced it
would no longer allow UN weapons inspectors to work in the country.</P>
      <P>9. Hurricane Mitch wrecked havoc in seven countries in Central
America, killing more than 11,000 with over 13,000 still missing. A
strong earthquake and subsequent tsunami killed 8,000 people in the
northwest coastal area of Papua New Guinea. The two events claimed
more lives than any other natural disaster in 1998.</P>
      <P>10. The representatives of peace talks in Northern Ireland
reached an historic accord, ending 20 years of conflict and turning a
new leaf for peace in Northern Ireland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN TOP CONCERN OF TAIWAN PEOPLE IN 1998: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic slowdown, coupled with
difficulties encountered by job seekers, was the public's main
concern this year, a recent survey showed.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by The United Daily News, found that 91
percent of those polled thought the economy was bad in 1998, while 78
percent said they had trouble finding jobs over the past year. In a
similar poll in 1997, only 79 percent of respondents said the economy
was bad and 66 percent said they had trouble finding a job.</P>
      <P>Thirty-two percent of respondents said their lives were difficult
in 1998, while 62 percent said their lives were not.</P>
      <P>The annual United Daily News poll was first conducted in 1987 to
determine how satisfied Taiwan residents were with their lives and
with society.</P>
      <P>In this year's survey, 45 percent of those polled said times were
getting worse economically compared with in previous years. Forty
percent of respondents agreed with that statement in 1997 and 42
percent in 1996.</P>
      <P>While many of the respondents said they have been affected by the
country's economic sluggishness, they were more dissatisfied over a
deterioration in public morality and in public order.</P>
      <P>Seventy-nine percent of those polled said they were dissatisfied
with Taiwan's social morals in 1998, compared with 86 percent in
1997, when the level of social satisfaction was at a five-year low.</P>
      <P>The degree of public order in Taiwan was said to be inadequate by
74 percent of respondents this year, compared with 84 percent in
1997.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 63 percent of respondents said most people in Taiwan
do not respect the rule of law, compared with 67 percent in last
year's poll.</P>
      <P>The gap between the rich and the poor was said to be widening by
68 percent of the population, while 60 percent said society is filled
with injustice. Both figures represented five-year highs.</P>
      <P>About 45 percent of those polled said they believe their children
will lead better lives than they, while 35 percent said their own
lives will improve during the next three years. Both figures were
almost the same this year as in the 1997 survey.</P>
      <P>Fifty-one percent of respondents in this year's poll
characterized Taiwan's political status as stable, compared with 34
percent last year.</P>
      <P>The United Daily poll was conducted by telephone from Dec. 17 to
19, and about 1,300 people around the island were queried. The poll
had margin of error of 3 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CETRA RECOMMENDS MORE INVESTMENT IN COUNTRIES ADOPTING EURO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The China External Trade Development
Council (CETRA) on Sunday recommended Taiwan investors explore more
deeply European Union (EU) countries, specially the 11 countries that
will adopt the euro as their national currency beginning Jan. 1,
2000.</P>
      <P>CETRA, which has completed a market survey of 26 countries
worldwide and which will present the findings from that survey to the
Board of Foreign Trade for the formulation of trade promotion
policies, suggested investors strengthen their presence in Britain,
the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and France on the grounds that
abundant business opportunities will emerge in tandem with the
coalescence of the EU market.</P>
      <P>Even though the EU will be a single market, there is a need to
devise different marketing policies for each country in the union.
CETRA therefore suggested setting up assembly factories in Britain,
distribution centers in the Netherlands and Belgium, and technology
support and maintenance centers in Germany.</P>
      <P>Despite the global economic downturn, the economic achievements
made in Europe cannot be underestimated. According to the Board of
Foreign Trade, Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands,
Germany and France are all enjoying double-digit import growth, while
Europe's first-largest importers -- Germany, Britain, France, Italy
and the Netherlands -- account for 70 percent of all imports into
Europe.</P>
      <P>Machinery and transportation facilities account for about 30
percent of imports into Europe. CETRA said information technology
products; semiconductors; motorcycle, bicycle and car parts; and
anti-theft locks are ideal products for Taiwan companies to produce
for European markets.</P>
      <P>CETRA also suggested investors regard EU member states as
separate sales regions to avoid sales channel overlap, and that they
manufacture products in accordance with the demands of each market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA CALLS ON TAIWAN PHYSICIANS TO WORK IN AFRICA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Doctors and physicians in Taiwan are being
urged to join Taiwan's medical missions to Africa to help ease
manpower shortages in the region, sources from the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>MOFA has contacted the China Medical Association, charity
organizations and medical institutions around the island to ask for
recommendations of qualified doctors who might be willing to serve in
Africa.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials are optimistic that the ministry will source
enough qualified doctors to work in Republic of China medical
missions in Africa, as they believe many doctors in Taiwan have the
"spirit of Albert Schweitzer."</P>
      <P>Schweitzer (1875-1965), a man of many accomplishments, decided to
study medicine in 1905, two years after he became principal of St.
Thomas Theological College at the University of Strasbourg. In 1913
he began serving as a medical missionary in Lambarene, French
Equatorial Africa (now Gabon).</P>
      <P>His first consulting room was a chicken coop. Over the years, he
built a large hospital and a medical station where thousands of
Africans were treated each year. Schweitzer was awarded the Nobel
Peace Prize and used his US$33,000 in prize money to expand the
hospital and establish a colony for lepers.</P>
      <P>MOFA urged Taiwan doctors who are compassionate and wish to
broaden their international perspectives to contact the ministry for
interviews.</P>
      <P>For those assigned to ROC medical missions in Burkina Faso, Chad
or Sao Tome and Principe MOFA will offer NT$280,000-NT$350,000
(US$8,750-NT$US,938) per month in financial compensation.</P>
      <P>In the past, MOFA recruited its missionary doctors from the armed
forces. But military regulations stipulated that doctors could work
for only one year in foreign countries, such as Africa, on a contract
basis. The ministry determined that a one-year tour of duty did not
give doctors enough time to familiarize themselves with their new
surroundings or to learn French, the lingua franca of those three
countries, MOFA officials noted.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 27 (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei City government will resolve the
long-standing problem of licensed prostitution according to the law,
said Cheng Tsun-chi, the newly appointed chief of the Bureau of Labor
Affairs of the Taipei City Government on Sunday in a television
program.</P>
      <P>Cheng; Ou Chin-der, the political deputy mayor; and Wu Huei-mei,
director of the Department of Information, were invited onto the
program "Questions to Government," produced by the Taiwan Television
Co. and the Broadcasting and Television Foundation.</P>
      <P>Cheng noted that the issue of licensing prostitutes is no longer
a question of how policies related to the sex trade should be
formulated, but merely a moral issue.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City Council has agreed not to revoke the licenses of
prostitutes for two years, and Mayor Ma Ying-jeou will definitely
handle the situation according to the law, Cheng noted.</P>
      <P>Wu, meanwhile, said the issue should be regarded from a social
welfare viewpoint and should center on what the government could do
to compensate the licensed prostitutes once their licenses are
revoked.</P>
      <P>Speaking on construction projects in Taipei City, the political
deputy mayor said the completion of important construction projects
would benefit Taipei and help advance the city's
internationalization, which he said was a significant mission.</P>
      <P>Ou said there are many things to be done in Taipei, and that the
only way to do them is to go step by step.</P>
      <P>Ou also mentioned that the government will definitely crack down
on sex and gambling operations, as well as on other illegal business.</P>
      <P>As for the image of the new city government, Wu indicated that
the Department of Information will play the role of a bridge between
citizens and government, informing all the city's residents about
what the government has done.</P>
      <P>She also said her department is competent and will handle crises

    <HEADLINE>ROC SHOULD FLEX ITS MUSCLES AT BEIJING: WEI JINGSHENG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China should flex its
muscles before Beijing, showing Beijing's rulers its determination to
protect the interests of the 21.4 million people in Taiwan, said a
leading mainland Chinese dissident on Sunday during a visit to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wei Jingsheng, who has been heralded as the father of democracy
in mainland China, said Taiwan has seemed to bow to Beijing's efforts
to suppress the island throughout much of the last decade. This has
made Beijing's leaders believe they are in control of the situation,
he said.</P>
      <P>Now is the time for Taiwan to show Beijing its real muscle and to
demonstrate that the ROC government is determined to protect the
interests of the people of Taiwan, Wei said during a meeting of the
Wei family clan Sunday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The meeting brought together people surnamed Wei from all over
the world.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China need not always act in a way that pleases
Beijing, Wei said, adding that too much capitulation can embolden the
other side. Taiwan's softness in the past may be responsible for the
roots of the present instability across the Taiwan Strait, he noted.</P>
      <P>Wei was referring to reports that Tang Shubei, vice chairman of
Beijing's intermediary body, the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait, had said recently he would not visit Taipei if
reunification is not discussed in meetings during his visit with ROC
government representatives.</P>
      <P>Wei said Taipei should categorically tell Beijing that "you have
your aims while we have our conditions," adding that discussions
cannot be called negotiations if one side is not even given the
chance to place conditions on agreements and proposals.</P>
      <P>As to a planned meeting between Wei and President Lee Teng-hui,
who will meet with Wei not as president but in his capacity as
chairman of the ruling Kuomintang, Wei said he does not care under
what title Lee meets with him. What is important is the substance of
the talks, Wei said.</P>
      <P>He said he is interested in knowing how the Republic of China
will keep its promises to help mainland China and countries
throughout the Asia-Pacific region reshape their political futures.</P>

      <P>P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), is scheduled to
lead a Republic of China delegation to Africa in mid-January to
promote agricultural and economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>The ROC's top economic planner said tentative plans call for him
and his mission to embark on a two-week visit to the Gambia and
Senegal in mid-January.</P>
      <P>Chiang said his schedule may be changed if necessary. For
example, he said, Premier Vincent Siew instructed last week all
Cabinet agencies to submit within one month drafts of plans to
invigorate the domestic economy. This would require Chiang's
presence, he said.</P>
      <P>Chiang decided to visit Gambia after Gambian President Yahya
A.J.J. Jammeh personally invited Chiang to visit the African country
when Jammeh visited Taipei in November, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>He decided to include a trip to Senegal because the Senegalese
government has invited him to visit three times in recent months in
hopes that he would help push for the materialization of several
major cooperative projects between the two countries, Chiang added.</P>
      <P>Chiang said he will be accompanied by officials from the Council
of Agriculture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday
expressed its concern over a theft allegedly committed by the son of
a US official stationed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Dasalla Vicent, an 18-year-old son of an official of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT), was intercepted by police at a roadside
checkpoint in Taipei Saturday evening. He was then detained, along
with the son of a British national, for riding a stolen motorcycle.
The two were also found to be carrying a knife, which is prohibited
under Taiwan law.</P>
      <P>Acting on information provided by Vicent during questioning,
police recovered two other stolen motorcycles and apprehended two
other American students, both 15 years old.</P>
      <P>Ministry spokesman Roy Y.Y. Wu said that under an accord signed
between Taiwan and the United States in 1982, AIT staff and family
members are entitled to diplomatic immunity.</P>
      <P>The AIT represents US interests in Taiwan in the absence of
official relations.</P>
      <P>Vicent's father, who is currently studying Mandarin in Taipei, is
considered a member of the AIT's staff, he said.</P>
      <P>He said that this is the first criminal case involving a son of a
foreign diplomat and that his ministry would cautiously handle the
case in accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the ministry is waiting for the result of a further
investigation and will seek to determine whether diplomatic immunity
privileges are applicable in criminal matters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>99 PERCENT OF TAIWAN'S TIMBER IMPORTED: COA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 99 percent of the timber that
Taiwan uses each year is imported, as keeping domestic forests intact
is a set policy of the government, a Council of Agriculture (COA)
spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Shi-chou, director of the COA's Department of Forestry, said
the third stage of forest management work on Mt. Chilan in Ilan
County, eastern Taiwan, will be halted until a further assessment is
made.</P>
      <P>The operations on Mt. Chilan, which includes the removal of dead
and fallen trees from the forests by workers contracted by the
Vocational Assistance Commission for Retired Servicemen (VACRS), was
halted amid protests from wildlife conservationists islandwide over
the past several days.</P>
      <P>It has been rumored that VACRS workers have cut down live,
precious teak trees from Chilan forests.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, about 1,000 people took to the streets in Taipei.
Waving banners saying "keep nature intact," "nature is priceless,"
and "save the forests from cutting," the demonstrators demanded that
the government not "condone forest killers in the name of
conservation."</P>
      <P>Chen said the goal of managing timber resources is to achieve an
approximate balance between the annual harvest and the growth of
trees. This balance, called a sustained yield, ensures a continuous
supply of timber by requiring that the amount removed during one
year's harvest be replaced -- either through growth or reproduction
-- before the next harvest.</P>
      <P>The removal of dead and fallen trees from the forests to make
room for new and younger trees is also necessary for a sustained
yield, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Although government policy calls for no felling of trees in
forests around the island, Chen said the forests must still be
managed. Taiwan needs to nurture its tree-cutting technology and its
ability to create man-made forests, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen noted Japan's domestically produced timber constitutes about
20 percent of all the timber used in Japan each year, while all the
timber used in Germany is homegrown.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ECONOMY FLASHES 'YELLOW-BLUE' LIGHT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan economy flashed "yellow-blue" in
November, slightly better than October's "blue" light which indicated
an economic recession, the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>A "yellow-blue" light, which signals an economic slowdown under a
CEPD-devised, color-coded economic assessment system, indicated that
the local economy gained steam in November compared with the previous
month, said Thomas Yeh, director of the CEPD's Economic Research
Department.</P>
      <P>Despite the slight upturn in November, Yeh noted, it is still too
early to say that the Taiwan economy is bottoming out amid a steep
regional decline, as the index of leading economic indicators, which
gauges economic prospects for the next three to six months, dropped
0.3 percent from October, while the index of coincident indicators,
which reflects the country's present economic activity, also slid 0.1
percent.</P>
      <P>Yeh estimated that the first quarter of 1999 will be a crucial
period in determining whether the Taiwan economy picks up speed.</P>
      <P>He attributed the slight upturn in November to the growth in
exports, and a more stable stock market, which was the result of a
government intervention in the market through a stabilization fund.</P>
      <P>Under the CEPD system, a "red" light means the economy is
overheated; "yellow-red" indicates the economy is heating up; "green"
reflects steady growth; "yellow-blue" signals an economic slowdown;
and "blue" represents a recession. The minimum score for a healthy
"green" rating is 23 points.</P>
      <P>November's overall economic performance received 18 points, up 2
points from October.</P>
      <P>In assigning a rating, the CEPD measures nine major areas of
economic activity: industrial production, export value, new orders,
manufacturing inventories, non-farming employment, the check default
rate, the M1B money supply, bank lending and the stock index.</P>
      <P>Only two indicators -- those for exports and the stock market --
received a safe and satisfactory "green" rating in November, while
the others received a "yellow-blue" score.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to the latest CEPD survey of Taiwan's
business and industrial sector, less than 10 percent of members of
the sector believe the island's economic prospects will improve in
three months' time.</P>
      <P>The poll found that only 2 percent of surveyed manufacturers and
exporters said business was good in November, about the same number
as in a similar poll in October.</P>
      <P>Thirty percent of respondents said business was bad in November,
about 1 percent less than the number who said so in October. Sixty
percent said business was okay, compared with 59 percent in October.</P>
      <P>In the same poll, only 9 percent of respondents said business
prospects would take a turn for the better in the next three months,
compared with 10 percent in October.</P>
      <P>Sixty-five percent said they expect business to remain unchanged,
compared with 62 percent in October. Meanwhile 26 percent said
business would take a turn for the worse, compared with 28 percent in
October.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE FIRM PRODUCES MANUAL ON MAINLAND CHINESE LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  27  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Singapore law firm has become the
first in the region to produce an operational manual on the legal
system of and legal practices in mainland China, with detailed
explanations and guidelines on doing business with the mainland
Chinese.</P>
      <P>The manual was written in English by Colin Ng and Partners (CNP),
a leading legal firm in Asia, and covers a comprehensive range of
topics from dispute resolution and arbitration to financial and
accounting procedures.</P>
      <P>The manual was written jointly by nine lawyers, including three
mainland Chinese legal consultants, from the firm's mainland practice
group.</P>
      <P>Unlike books on specific aspects of mainland law, the manual
includes practical advice based on cases handled by the firm, said
Tan Chong Huat, who headed the group and led the project.</P>
      <P>His team had also opted for a binder concept to allow for yearly
updates, as mainland laws have been undergoing rapid changes in the
last few years.</P>
      <P>"Although much has been written on foreign investments in China,
there is no consolidated and focused manual on Chinese corporate
governance," said Tan, who has been cited in this year's Asia Law
Leading Lawyers Profile for his experience in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Priced at S$495 (US$309), the publication is not intended for the
small investor, but is targeted at major corporations and Singapore
firms with mainland interests.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JUSTICE MINISTER REAFFIRMS DETERMINATION TO PROBE VOTE-FLASHING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister Cheng Chung-mo on Monday
reaffirmed his determination to probe "vote-flashing" charges
related to the elections for the speakerships and deputy speakerships
of the city councils of Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the Ministry of Justice has ordered relevant
prosecution offices to investigate allegations that some Kaohsiung
and Taipei councilors have publicly displayed or "flashed" their
votes in the Dec. 25 city council leadership elections.</P>
      <P>"It's the Justice Ministry's unshirkable obligations to curb any
irregularities in all domestic political elections, vote-buying and
vote-showing alike," Cheng said, adding that as long as
law-enforcement officers can collect enough evidence, all those
involved in the rule-breaking vote-flashing cases will be bring to
justice.</P>
      <P>The grand justice-turned-minister went on to say that law
breaking on the part of elected representatives will set a wrong
model for democracy.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, law-breaking elected representatives must be punished
harshly in order to substantiate democratic development and rule of
law in our country," Cheng stressed.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who has been nominated by President Lee Teng-hui to serve
as vice president of the Judicial Yuan, made the above statements
before co-chairing a meeting of city mayors and county magistrates
with Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cheng Lung-chao, a chief prosecutor with the Taipei
Prosecutor's Office, has been authorized to investigate the alleged
"vote flashing" by some councilors in the Taipei City Council
speakership election.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he will carefully review all of the available video
tapes concerning the election. If necessary, the prosecutor said he
will summon councilors for questioning.</P>
      <P>"We'll handle the issue strictly according to the law, regardless
of the identity of those suspected of involvement in unlawful
activities," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>In the southern port city of Kaohsiung, Chief Prosecutor Chiang
Hui-min, after review of the video taping of the Dec. 25 election,
said on Sunday that 10 councilors were suspected of having openly
shown their ballots and will be called by the municipal prosecutor
office to explain the matter.</P>
      <P>Under current law, votes in any elections should be cast
confidentially.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the 10 Kaohsiung councilors, instead of sealing
their ballots completely before going to the ballot box, allegedly
displayed their votes when passing by the vote supervisor of their
own political party.</P>
      <P>"I'll prosecute any councilor who did so," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The speakership and deputy speakership of the Kaohsiung City
Council was hotly contested among major factions in the council
which was elected on Dec. 5. The ruling Kuomintang's speaker
nominee, Huang Chi-chuan, was elected while its candidate for the
deputy speakership post, Wang Chih-hsiung, was defeated by
independent councilor Tsai Sung-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Some four years ago, several members of the 13th Hsinchu County
Council were either given suspended four-month prison terms or were
fined for publicly "flashed" their ballots in the council's
speakership and deputy speakership elections on March 1, 1994. They
were convicted of divulging non-military secrets.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian businesses are being urged to
be ready for the introduction of the euro, a currency that could
prove highly costly to some Australian businesses, according to
banking analysts.</P>
      <P>The euro will cost hundreds of millions of dollars for some
Australian companies, they said.</P>
      <P>Financial markets in Sydney will start trading euros next Monday,
when the new currency will become legal tender for non-cash
transactions, including commercial invoices, corporate accounts, tax
returns and dealings in bonds and equities, analysts said.</P>
      <P>A recent survey shows only 18 percent of Australian businesses
were worried about the introduction of the euro, and only 11 percent
of businesses have actively addressed the issue.</P>
      <P>The Reserve Bank of Australia said it understood what the euro's
introduction meant for Europe, but it had not heard anyone who could

    <HEADLINE>TREE  FROGS  SAID USEFUL IN FIGHTING CANCER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  28  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tree frogs from Western Australia can
provide a powerful weapon against cancer and virulent Bacteria,
according to Australian scientists.</P>
      <P>They said chemicals distilled from secretions from glands on the
back of the head of the magnificent tree frogs have eradicated a form
of leukemia and a type of solid tumor cell in the laboratory,
according to The Sydney Morning Herald on Monday.</P>
      <P>The tree frogs were discovered in 1974 in a public toilet in the
Australian outback. The frogs do not blister in the sun, nor do get
bitten by mosquitoes. This suggests the frogs' secretions include a
form of sunscreen and insect repellent that may apply to humans,
according to the scientists, including Professor John Bowie, a
chemist at the University of Adelaide in South Australia.</P>
      <P>The chemicals, called neuropeptides, are now being evaluated to
determine their effects on 50 types of cancerous cells. They are even
more promising as an antibiotic. Doctors may be able to use the
chemicals to combat infections such as staphylococcus aureau or
golden staph, which can prove fatal, he said.</P>
      <P>He said the chemicals penetrate the membranes of human cells
much more easily than other forms of chemotherapy, making them
potentially deadly to some types of cancer.</P>
      <P>The chemicals would also be tested for toxicity in normal cells
to determine whether they could be used in new forms of chemotherapy,
Bowie said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSINESS AND INDUSTRIAL LEADERS DECRY ADMINISTRATIVE INEFFECTIVENESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Domestic business and industrial leaders on
Monday complained to the government over ineffective measures aimed
at assisting financially strapped companies.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin-yen, chairman of the Chinese National Federation of
Industries, said although the Executive Yuan approved the release of
NT$120 billion (US$3.73 billion) for soft loans to help financially
strained business and industrial operations, the move has turned out
to be "water too distant to extinguish a nearby fire" due to the
ineffectiveness in the administrative and banking systems.</P>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang on Monday met with 15
local business and industrial magnates for a breakfast meeting,
during which the businessmen offered complaints and suggestions
concerning the current economic slowdown and gloomy economic
forecast.</P>
      <P>Relevant government agencies are rumored to be revising corporate
law to prevent companies from making cross-investments, an operation
being blamed for a recent spate of stock settlement defaults,
embezzlement cases, and bounced checks.</P>
      <P>Kao said if the law is revised to prevent affiliated companies
from making cross-investments, it would be tantamount to giving up
eating for fear of choking. He said affiliated companies are allowed
to make cross-investments under the current law with aims at
encouraging companies to direct extra funds to other affiliated
companies to develop multiple operations.</P>
      <P>The participating businessmen also expressed their concern over
the stability of Taiwan's currency as well as worsening labor
shortages in the domestic manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>Wang promised that he and his staff will look into the problems
raised by the business and industrial leaders and contact relevant
agencies for possible solutions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HU OUTLINES MEASURES TO COPE WITH BEIJING'S 'BIG POWER DIPLOMACY'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
will form a special task force early next year to map out feasible
strategies and measures to cope with mainland China's "big power
diplomacy," Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Testifying before the Legislative Yuan's foreign and overseas
Chinese affairs committee, Hu said mainland China has forsaken its
previous low-profile diplomatic strategy and adopted a far more
aggressive policy dubbed "big power diplomacy."</P>
      <P>Mainland China will mark its 50th founding anniversary in 1999.
"After five decades of development, mainland China now regards itself
as 'the world's largest developing country' and has decided to
promote the so-called 'big power diplomacy' to upgrade its
international clout and further squeeze Taiwan's diplomatic
frontier," Hu noted.</P>
      <P>In the face of Beijing's heightened diplomatic offensive, Hu
said MOFA has worked out a package of measures to address the new
situation.</P>
      <P>"First of all, the ministry will set up a special task force
composed of senior ambassadors and relevant staff members to monitor
the situation regularly and formulate suitable counterstrategy to
break out of the Beijing-imposed diplomatic isolation and further
upgrade our international stature," Hu said.</P>
      <P>Secondly, Hu said, MOFA will strengthen the ambassador-at-large
system and intensify contacts and dialogue with major countries
around the world.</P>
      <P>"In addition, the ministry will coordinate with other
government agencies to boost 'trade and economic diplomacy' with
other countries no matter whether those countries maintain formal
diplomatic with the Republic of China or not," Hu said.</P>
      <P>The ministry will also join forces with the private sector to
offer more humanitarian aid to countries falling victim to
natural disasters, Hu said, adding that MOFA will launch an all-out
Internet diplomatic offensive by loading information about the ROC's
diplomatic, political, trade, economic and defense policies and
major developments in these fields on the Internet for publicity
purposes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hu said Beijing's "big power diplomacy" is also aimed
at allaying world apprehension about its military threat to regional
security and peace.</P>
      <P>The minister pointed out that mainland China has encountered
some difficulties in promoting its "big power diplomacy."</P>
      <P>"The biggest obstacle to Beijing's new diplomatic offensive is
various regional security mechanisms, including NATO, the
US-Japan security cooperation treaty and a US-initiated theater
missile defense (TMD) system now under development," Hu noted,
adding that mainland China's poor human rights records are another
major hindrance to its "big power diplomacy."</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE SHOULD HAVE A SAY IN FATE OF LOCAL ELECTIONS: HUANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Interior will respect the
new legislature's decision on whether the next elections for township
and county chiefs should be abolished, Interior Minister Huang
Chu-wen said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Despite a consensus reached at the non-partisan National
Development Conference (NDC) in December 1996 that all local
elections should be abolished when the current terms expire, Huang
said the issue should be decided next year to allow the new
legislature, which will be sworn in on Feb. 1, 1999, to have a say in
the matter.</P>
      <P>However, Huang's remarks provoked strong criticism from
Democratic Progressive Party Lawmaker Cheng Pao-ching, who raised the
issue during a draft review of the "local government system" in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Cheng argued that Huang's response was an indication that the
ruling Kuomintang was planning to use the newly elected lawmakers to
revoke the 1996 NDC consensus.</P>
      <P>In a separate development, police records showed that the number
of election-related crimes dropped this year.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the National Police Administration under
the Ministry of Interior indicated that high-profile violent crimes
totaled 965 in November during the run-up to December's
"three-in-one" elections. The figure is down 20 percent, or
1,206 cases, from the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The number of criminal cases solved by police in November rose by
5.21 percent from 73.55 percent to 78.76 percent over the same month
of 1997, a reflection that public order did not deteriorate due to
the elections, police said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTER SPEAKS ON CASE OF ARRESTED US DIPLOMAT'S SON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on Monday he
does not think that the son of an official with the Taipei office of
the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) allegedly involved in a case
of motorcycle theft is eligible for diplomatic immunity.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks during a Legislative Yuan committee meeting
in response to an inquiry from a ruling Kuomintang legislator about
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' stance on the issue.</P>
      <P>Hu said the ministry certainly will respect police and
prosecution authorities' handling of the case.</P>
      <P>The minister cited two prerequisites for diplomatic immunity --
foreign diplomats must have committed the crime while fulfilling
their official duties, and the countries they represent must have
signed immunity accords with the Republic of China on a reciprocal
basis.</P>
      <P>According to an accord signed between Taiwan and the United
States in 1982, AIT staff and family members are entitled to
diplomatic immunity. The AIT represents US interests in Taiwan in the
absence of official relations.</P>
      <P>However, as the suspect is underage, he is unlikely to have been
performing official duties when he was arrested by local police on
Saturday evening.</P>
      <P>Hu also said it is premature to talk about the immunity issue as
the family of 18-year-old Vincent Dasalla, who was detained by Taipei
police late on Saturday for allegedly riding a stolen motorcycle and
possessing an illegal flick knife, has not applied for diplomatic
immunity.</P>
      <P>"As many details of the case have not been clarified, we do not
need to bother to mull the immunity issue at the moment," Hu said.</P>
      <P>Vincent is the son of an AIT staff member who is studying
mandarin Chinese in Taipei. Also detained on Saturday was the son of
a British national for alleged involvement in the same motorcycle
theft case.</P>
      <P>Acting on information provided by Vincent during questioning,
police later recovered two other stolen motorcycles and apprehended
two other American students, both 15 years old.</P>
      <P>This is the first criminal case involving a son of a foreign
diplomat. All four teenage suspects were released on bail on Monday.
Law-enforcement authorities said they will handle the case
appropriately.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said democracy is an
important condition for national unification, when he received
prominent mainland Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng Monday.</P>
      <P>During their meeting, Siew also said that freedom, democracy,
and human rights are important values of all mankind, and that the
Chinese people on Taiwan have been able to realize their hope for
these values. "The Chinese in other parts of the world should also
be able to do so," he told Wei.</P>
      <P>Wei, who had spent 18 years in prison before he was released
on a medical parole and allowed to leave the Chinese mainland in 1997,
said during the meeting that Taiwan has made great progress in
economic and political development, and that Taiwan's achievement in
promoting political reform without bloodshed is admirable.</P>
      <P>Wei, who is now a resident of the United States, also said
that mainland Chinese dissidents should pool their efforts to quicken
the democratic movement on the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>Wei, who arrived here on Dec. 21 for a nine-day visit, also met
with Minister Chiao Jen-ho of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission 
of the Executive Yuan Monday.</P>
      <P>Chiao said during their meeting that he has come to understand
the Chinese proverb "Despotism can not last long," and that he
strongly believes all dictatorships in the world will certainly
disappear in 10 to 20 years.</P>
      <P>Wei told Chiao that mainland Chinese dissidents staying abroad
have won the sympathy and support of many Western countries for their
cause to bring freedom and democracy to the Chinese mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US AGREES TO STORE USED NUCLEAR FUEL RODS FROM TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States Department of Energy has
agreed to accept used nuclear fuel rods from Taiwan's research
institutes over the next ten years, the Atomic Energy Council said on
Monday.</P>
      <P>An accord which capped five years of laborious negotiation is
expected to be signed between Taipei and Washington in the near
future, said council chairman Hu Ching-piao.</P>
      <P>The pact will form part of a US program to take delivery of used
fuel rods from research institutes in East Asian states to solve
these countries' problems of treating and storing the radioactive
waste.</P>
      <P>The used fuel rods, in which the uranium nuclei have split into
fragments with a very long half-life, contain radiation stronger than
that of unused rods, and are the most dangerous by-products in the
process of harnessing nuclear energy.</P>
      <P>Two Taiwan institutes are currently engaged in nuclear energy
research -- National Tsinghua University, which uses about 60 rods
per year, and the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research under the
Atomic Energy Council, which uses around 40 rods per year.</P>
      <P>The nuclear-waste disposal pact with Washington will spare Taiwan
the trouble of storing the used rods which, along with the nuclear
waste of other East Asian states, will be shipped to the United
States once every several years, said Hu.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen and
Justice Minister Cheng Chung-mo on Monday co-chaired a seminar on
islandwide crackdowns on crime and illegal land development.</P>
      <P>All the 23 county magistrates and city mayors, including newly
elected Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh,
attended the two-hour seminar held at Grand Hyatt Taipei Hotel.</P>
      <P>Minister Huang said the anti-crime crusade requires joint
efforts of the central and local governments as well as the private
sector.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the government has given the top priority to
maintaining law and order.</P>
      <P>Noting that the domestic social order has deteriorated in recent
years, Huang said more than 200,000 criminal cases were reported in
1997. If motorcycle theft cases were calculated, the total criminal
cases exceeded 400,000.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Huang said, the government has
adopted a series of anti-crime measures over the past year. "Through
such efforts, the local social order has improved significantly this
year, with the number of violent crimes declining by 30 percent from
the 1997 level."</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Justice Minister Cheng said the
anti-crime drive should become a social movement which requires
concerted efforts from both the public and private sectors.</P>
      <P>Cheng said law-enforcement agencies under the Ministry of Justice
have spared no efforts on cracking down on organized crime, drug
trafficking, smuggling of contraband goods and illegal firearms
trading and possession.</P>
      <P>"We hope all city and county governments will join forces with
the Justice Ministry and other relevant central government agencies
in fighting crime," said the grand justice-turned-minister.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Cheng said cooperation from local-level governments is
equally important in curbing illegal land development.</P>
      <P>"Unscrupulous land development and illegal logging have caused
repeated landslides and flooding in many regions around the island,
causing many human casualties and property losses," Cheng said,
adding such actions should be stopped and more environmental
protection measures should be adopted to ensure a safe living
environment.</P>
      <P>He urged local government chiefs to devote more energies on soil
and water resources conservation to sustain national economic
development and improve living conditions.</P>
      <P>All city mayors and county magistrates present at the
meeting voiced their support for the interior and justice
ministries' call for cooperation in fighting crime and cracking down
on illegal land development.</P>
      <P>Local government chiefs, however, urged the central government
to legislate clear-cut and unified regulations and action guidelines
for cracking down on certain controversial lines of business,
such as bars, KTV parlors, video game arcades and saunas, to
facilitate enforcement of laws and rules.</P>
      <P>Many mayors and county chiefs also expressed hopes that the
central government will delegate more powers and offer more
financial grants to city and county governments to facilitate local
government administration and delivery on their campaign promises.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
met on Monday with visiting US House Representative Bobby Etheridge
and his wife, and extended his welcome to them on their first visit
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president also expressed his appreciation to Etheridge for
his solid support in the US Congress to the ROC, evidenced by the
fact that during the mainland China visit of US President Bill
Clinton in late June, Congress passed three joint resolutions related
to support for the ROC.</P>
      <P>The resolutions helped maintain stability across the Taiwan
Strait, Lee told his American quests.</P>
      <P>Etheridge, who has been in charge of public education affairs in
the North Carolina State government, and now serves on two House
standing committees -- of agriculture and science -- appeared during
the meeting to being particularly interested in issues relating to
agriculture, science and technology, and education.</P>
      <P>He told Lee that during his Taiwan stay, he would like to visit
key establishments regarding the island's political and economic
infrastructures. In addition, he said, he also hopes to enhance the
agricultural and biotechnological exchanges between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Lee said the ROC government has listed research and development
in the field of biotechnology as key work for the nation in the
coming century.</P>
      <P>Addressing educational issues, the president and Etheridge agreed
that education plays a crucial role in a country's development, since
it takes a well-educated populace to build a strong nation.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that in addition to the promotion of constitutional,
educational, judicial, and spiritual reforms, the ROC government is
also very concerned with the welfare of the underprivileged, and has
never ceased its efforts to build a society governed by fairness and
justice.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FPG WASTE ISSUE EXPECTED TO BE RESOLVE SOON: HU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on Monday
he believes that the dispute related to the shipment of mercury-laced
waste to Cambodia by a Taiwan company will be resolved in the not too
distant future.</P>
      <P>Hu made the optimistic forecast during a Legislative Yuan
committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Quoting a report from the Republic of China's representative
office in Ho Chi Minh City in neighboring Vietnam, Hu said the
Cambodian government has come to understand the ROC's official
stance on the waste issue.</P>
      <P>"Cambodian authorities have now adopted a relatively low-profile
approach to handle the issue and no longer rejects our proposal to
send officials to assist in handling the dispute," Hu said, adding
that there are signs that the issue can be settled in the near
future.</P>
      <P>Hu said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will respect the opinion
of a supra-ministerial task force concerning whether the ministry
should send staff members to accompany a fact-finding team scheduled
to visit Cambodia after the New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) on Monday ordered Formosa Plastics Group (FPG)
to ship back some 3,000 tons of mercury-laced waste it had dumped in
Cambodia, saying its toxic level slightly exceeded safety standards.</P>
      <P>The EPA said tests on the waste samples brought back by a
local environmental group showed a mercury level of 0.284 parts per
million (PPM), compared with the 0.2 PPM safety standard set by the
ROC government.</P>
      <P>The samples were taken back from the dump site in Cambodia
Saturday by the Green Formosa Front (GFF).</P>
      <P>"It poses no immediate health threat and we urge Cambodians not
to panic,'' Fu Shu-chiang, director of the EPA's Solid Waste Control
Department, told a news conference. ``But we want the waste to be
shipped back to Taiwan before other alternatives can be considered.''</P>
      <P>The Cambodian government has asked Taiwan to take the waste back,
accusing Taiwan of trying to dump toxic waste in poor countries.</P>
      <P>The FPG, Taiwan's largest private manufacturing conglomerate,
however, questioned the sampling method used by the Green Formosa
Front, insisting that previous government analyses showed the waste
met the safety standards for landfill disposal.</P>
      <P>FPG General Manager Lee Chih-tsun said it will send a team,
composed of European and American specialists to Cambodia to conduct
its own sampling and tests before deciding whether to ship the waste
back.</P>
      <P>The island's petrochemical giant said in a press statement
that it will take full responsibility for this unfortunate incident,
which has caused jitters among the Cambodian government and its
people.</P>
      <P>After the incident is settled, the statement said, the company

      <P>South African Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki has sent a strong warning to South Africans against misusing
the country's newly found democracy.</P>
      <P>Addressing a gathering in the province of Western Cape on Sunday,
Mbeki said political liberation did not mean freedom to rape, to
steal other people's property, to stay away from work, or to do as
one pleased.</P>
      <P>Mbeki appealed for political discipline among members of the

the ANC should make 1999 a year of change -- even in the manner the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Asia's systems integration (SI) market
is expected to grow 24 percent a year between now and 2002, when it
will surpass US$1.25 billion, according to a new study by
International Data Corp. (IDC).</P>
      <P>However, Singapore and Malaysia's SI markets will grow by only 9
percent per annum during the period, because of their geographic
limitations and the regional economic crisis, the study said.</P>
      <P>IDC defines SI as the activity that allows complex computer
systems running on different platforms to talk to each other. The IDC
study examined market trends, opportunities, and prospects for SI in
seven key markets in Asia -- Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong,
South Korea, mainland China, and India.</P>
      <P>The highest growth in Asia will come from mainland China, India,

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS EXPRESS CONCERN OVER PAY FREEZE IN PUBLIC SECTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators on Tuesday expressed concern
over reports that there will be no increases in salaries for military
personnel, civil servants and teachers in the next fiscal year.</P>
      <P>According to reports, the government is considering not to
increase wages due to the sluggish domestic economy and a budget
deficit of NT$10 million in the next fiscal year.</P>
      <P>Some lawmakers said the move would adversely affect the public
and damage morale. They urged the Executive Yuan to reconsider the
matter.</P>
      <P>As the start of the fiscal year for 2001 will be moved from July
1 to Jan. 1 under a new budget law, the next budgetary period
will span from July 1, 1999 to Dec. 31, 2000, Tsaur Eel-jong of the
ruling Kuomintang noted.</P>
      <P>If there were a pay freeze, then civil servants would have to
wait 18 months before their next pay raise, Tsaur said, adding that
interval would be too long. He urged the government to act cautiously
to avoid any misgivings from the public.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Cheng Lung-shui said there have been salary
increases in recent years, and if the government does not offer
raises in the next budget planning, it would damage the morale and
interest in the public sector.</P>
      <P>Cheng said if the Cabinet were to impose a salary freeze, he
would boycott the decision.</P>
      <P>However, KMT lawmaker Hung Hsing-jung said in view of the current
economic problems and at a time when civil servants in other nations
are cutting salaries to help overcome difficulties, he believed a
salary freeze would not be a bad decision after all.</P>
      <P>Hung said the Legislative Yuan should take the lead by cutting
their own salaries to set an example for others.</P>
      <P>If pay increases for civil servants is not implemented, it would
be the first time the sector has not received a raise in nearly a
decade. Between 1991 and 1998, pay increases have ranged from 3
percent to 13 percent. Pay raises were the highest in 1991 and 1992
when salaries were increased 12 percent and 13 percent respectively.</P>
      <P>At a time when local companies are faring badly, salary increases
in the public sector would increase the pressure to raise wages in
the private sector. This could in turn contribute to a possible wave
of lay offs among private enterprises, officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP ACCUSES OF BEIJING OF LACKING SINCERITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's major opposition party, the
Democratic Progressive Party, accused Beijing on Tuesday of lacking
sincerity in forging mutual trust with Taipei after it canceled a
high-level visit.</P>
      <P>Yen Wan-chin, head of the DPP's Mainland China Affairs
Department, said Beijing's decision to cancel the visit to Taiwan by
mainland China's top negotiator, Wang Daohan, is an indication that
Beijing is insincere in its promise to build mutual trust across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Amid high international expectations that the two sides of the
strait could resume talks as soon as possible, the canceled trip is
additional proof that Beijing is the real source of problems in
cross-strait affairs, Yen said.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Ming Pao daily reported on Monday that
Beijing has canceled Wang's planned visit to Taiwan in March as a
result of a prominent mainland dissident's visit to the island.</P>
      <P>Wei Jingsheng, who lives in exile in the United States after
being released from a mainland prison in 1997, arrived in Taiwan on
Dec. 21 for a nine-day visit.</P>
      <P>Yen accused Beijing of using Wang's Taiwan trip as a bargaining
chip in cross-strait negotiations. He added that Wang's visit should
be viewed as a courtesy follow-up to Straits Exchange Foundation
Chairman Koo Chen-fu's visit to the mainland in October.</P>
      <P>Taiwan views Wang's visit to Taiwan as a gesture promoting
bilateral talks while the mainland sees it as a pre-condition in
negotiations by giving it political connotation, Yen claimed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Philippine President Joseph Estrada on
Monday said he will exhaust all efforts to strike a peace pact with
Islamic separatists but ruled out the creation of an independent
state in the southern region of Mindanao.</P>
      <P>He said his administration is ready to "meet violence with
violence" if the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) insists on its
demand to establish an autonomous state. Such an event would
contravene the 1987 Constitution which Estrada said he has sworn to
protect as president of the Philippines.</P>
      <P>"We will maximize all remedies to win them over," he said. But
then, if they will still insist, that's a different story."</P>
      <P>Last Saturday, government officials said it is keen on resuming
talks with the MILF in January after the end of Ramadan, the Muslim
holy month of daily fasting.</P>
      <P>Retired Gen. Manuel Yan, presidential adviser on the peace
process, said Estrada wants to speed up negotiations to reach an
accord with the MILF before the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>Estrada and Yan said the government wants to restart its separate
peace talks with the MILF and the National Democratic Front (NDF),
but said these negotiations should be held within the framework of
the 1987 Constitution.</P>
      <P>The NDF is the political umbrella group of the underground
left-wing led by the Communist Party of the Philippines.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>If clear skies prevail on Monday, Tuesday
and Wednesday evenings, people in eastern Canada may be able to see a
space station fly by -- for just three minutes at most.</P>
      <P>The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. said the station should be
visible at 5:26 p.m. on Monday in Montreal. In Toronto, it should be
visible at 6:07 p.m. on Tuesday, while one minute later, residents in
Ottawa will be able to get a glimpse of the station.</P>
      <P>While this is a novelty now, it is going to become routine in
years to come, experts said.</P>
      <P>"All the future shuttle missions that go to (the space station)
will head (over Canada) too, so over the next number of years you're
going to see a lot of the space station and a lot of the shuttles,
too," said Phil West, a spokesman for NASA.</P>
      <P>Those who are interested can check the station's Web site at the
following addresses:
http://www.spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/
http://www.spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/</P>
      <P>The space station, now standing 23 meters high, loops around
Earth in a west-to-east orbit that changes a little each time around.</P>
      <P>It currently comprises only the first two modules that were
assembled earlier this month by an American and Russian shuttle crew.
Over the next five to six years, 43 missions are planned, in which
more and more parts of the station will be assembled. When completed,
it will be bigger than a football field, quite easy to spot.</P>

      <P>Five men were reported dead with one

54-year history, organizers said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Amid 80-knot winds and high seas, the US-manned Sayonara won this
year's race, but there was little to celebrate as the event turned
disastrous for many of the participants.</P>
      <P>A massive rescue operation was launched to pluck a number of crew

about 30 aircraft, including helicopters and long-range Orions from

South Wales and Victoria for injuries ranging from hypothermia to
broken legs and head wounds from flying masts.</P>
      <P>Of the 115 yachts registered in the race, 69 pulled out due to

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's live lobster exports to
Taiwan, Japan and mainland China remained strong despite the Asian
economic crisis, but its frozen cooked lobster exports to Japan
plunged 50 percent, export figures showed.</P>
      <P>Perth-based Kailis and France Foods, one of Australia's largest
lobster exporters, told the Australian Financial Review the company
sold its frozen cooked lobsters in Australia to make up for the
decline in exports to Asia.</P>
      <P>Company general manager Peter Fraser said his company was forced
to sell its frozen cooked lobsters domestically at much lower market
prices. The local market had accounted for 2 percent of production,
but the figure increased to between 8 percent and 10 percent this
year, Fraser said.</P>
      <P>"Prices are the lowest in almost a decade," he said.</P>
      <P>Rock lobsters are Australia's biggest fishery export product
valued at US$275 million in 1997-98, or about 28 percent of such
exports, ahead of pearls at US$205 million.</P>
      <P>About 80 percent of Australia's lobsters are caught in Western
Australia and more than a third are now being exported in their most
lucrative condition, alive or more accurately in a coma-like state,
induced by lowering their temperature over three days.</P>
      <P>Fraser said the demand for live lobsters, unlike boiled lobsters,
continued to expand strongly in Japan, Taiwan and mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S FIRST ANTARCTIC FISHING VESSEL TO RETIRE, GO ON EXHIBIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's first experimental fishing vessel
to travel to Antarctica in 1976 will retire from service and be put
on permanent display.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Provincial Government's Department of Agriculture and
Forestry is currently putting the final touches on the "Haikung"
which will be on exhibit in Pisha, a fishing harbor in northern
Taiwan's Keelung.</P>
      <P>The 711.5 metric-ton fishing ship measures 56.6 meters in length
and has 2,200 horsepower. It can travel at 13.5 nautical knots with a
freezing capacity of 16 metric tons per day. Its trawl nets can reach
a depth of 1,000 meters underwater.</P>
      <P>The ship was inaugurated on July 12, 1975 and it traveled to the
East China Sea in December 1975 to formally begin its experimental
research mission by exploring deep sea fishing grounds and fishing
resources.</P>
      <P>Haikung began its first Antarctic voyage in early December 1976
when it crossed the Indian Ocean and sailed around Cape Town to the
Antarctic Ocean. After exploring the area, it hauled 130 metric tons
of shrimp back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The successful trip to Antarctica proved that the vessel could
withstand the freezing conditions. In December 1977, the Haikung
traveled from New Zealand to the Antarctic region and came away with
700 metric tons of shrimp.</P>
      <P>Taiwan became one of the 11 countries at the time which explored
the Antarctic's shrimp resources.</P>
      <P>Over the past years, the Haikung has completed 53 sea voyages and
has traveled to the Antarctic four times for shrimp fishing. It has
also become a source of pride for Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>The government, to promote leisure fishing, has improved the
Pisha fishing harbor and will move the Haikung there for permanent
display.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE MEETS HUMAN RIGHTS PROMOTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui met with a group of
former political prisoners on Tuesday to discuss the construction of
a human rights monument on Green Island off Taiwan's southeast coast.</P>
      <P>Lee told the former prisoners of conscience that Taiwan has come
a long way to emerge as a pluralistic democracy. "In the process, we
have endured many sorrows. This has enabled us to better understand
what and where the problem is," the president said.</P>
      <P>A confident, upbeat Lee urged his guests, all of whom had been
jailed in the tightly-guarded prison on Green Island during Taiwan's
martial law era, to forget their past ordeals.</P>
      <P>"We should learn to forgive and forget. By so doing, we'll be
able to find true happiness and turn sorrows into joys," Lee said. He
added that this is why he has been advocating the concept of "new
Taiwanese" which will help forge unity among all Taiwan residents
regardless of their origin.</P>
      <P>The president went on to say that all people in Taiwan should
work to incorporate different ethnic cultures into a new culture.
"Let us forget that dark period and work hand-in-hand to create a
mature, civilized, nurturing and sensible society," he said.</P>
      <P>The group was headed by Po Yang, the pen name of noted writer Kuo
Yi-tung, who was once jailed on charges of sedition after criticizing
the Republic of China's top leaders.</P>
      <P>After a decade of democratic reforms, Lee said, Taiwan has become
a full-fledged democracy. "Nowadays, no person here is likely to be
convicted or jailed simply because of their thinking, ideology or
speech. I myself have often been criticized. I don't care much about
such criticism. I have learnt to respect and tolerate the opinions of
critics or opponents."</P>
      <P>Po Yang and dozens of other former political prisoners have
pushed for the establishment of a human rights monument on Green
Island to remind future ROC leaders never to repeat past mistakes and
to dedicate themselves to upholding democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>President Lee originally promised to attend a groundbreaking
ceremony for the monument on Dec. 10. However, due to his busy
schedule, Lee was unable to appear and instead sent Premier Vincent
Siew to attend the ceremony on his behalf.</P>
      <P>"I'll push relevant government agencies to assist in the design
and construction of the monument, including the funding and
reservation of nearby land as well as other technical details," the
president pledged.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan said on Tuesday
that he and his family have accepted an invitation to join a
volunteer group that provides social services.</P>
      <P>Lien said he will work with World Vision of Taiwan, a non-profit
organization. He will travel to remote regions on the island to
launch anti-smoking and anti-drinking campaigns for the aborigines,
as well as to encourage them to meet other challenges.</P>
      <P>Lien also revealed that he and his wife Fang Yu have applied to
the Chinese Children's Fund to sponsor 10 children in need of
assistance.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks while he was attending a seminar on
voluntary service and caring for minority groups, sponsored by
several foundations at National Taiwan Normal University.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the seminar, Lien stressed that volunteer services
will make up for the deficiencies of government social welfare
programs, and he urged society to pay more attention to taking care
of minority groups.</P>
      <P>Lien noted that in recent years, the concept of volunteer work
has gained popularity in Taiwan, adding that this will be the
nation's third social movement, following economic development and
political democratization.</P>
      <P>He also said that with the nation's per capita income reaching
US$13,000, the concept of volunteer work needs to be further
developed. He said the further development of volunteer work to help
the government push for a more comprehensive package of social
welfare programs and to care for minority groups is an urgent task.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE TO PUBLISH BOOK ON TAIWAN'S STANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said on Tuesday he
will publish a book in mid-1999, detailing Taiwan's democratization
under his leadership over the past decade.</P>
      <P>Lee made the revelation while meeting with key figures of the
Human Rights Education Foundation, which is pushing for the
construction of a human rights monument on Green Island off Taiwan's
southeast coast.</P>
      <P>Lee said the book, based on his narration, will be printed in
three versions -- Chinese, Japanese and English. The Japanese
edition will be published by Japan's PHP think tank.</P>
      <P>In addition to recounting many never-been-revealed episodes in
Taiwan's democratic reforms over the past 10 years, Lee also
recalled his personal experience in his teenage years when Taiwan
was under martial law or in the so-called "white terror" era.</P>
      <P>Lee also outlined in the book his work plans after his current
presidential term expires in May 2000. As the book is based on his
personal narration, it is believed to be highly valuable and
readable. The book will also serve as the most important footnote to
Lee's stint as the Republic of China's head of state.</P>
      <P>Lee was quoted as having told his quest that he will vividly
recount Taiwan's past ordeals and sorrows, as well as many twists and
turns in Taiwan's democratic reforms.</P>
      <P>In the book, Lee said he has also carefully analyzed Taiwan's
relations with Japan, the United States and mainland China. "I have
recounted all what I know in the book whose title is tentatively set
as 'Taiwan's stance and tenet,'" the president told his guests.</P>
      <P>Among Lee's quests were several former political prisoners,
including Po Yang, the pen name of noted writer Kuo Yi-tung who was
once jailed in a tightly-guarded prison on the offshore Green Island
simply because of criticizing the ROC's top leaders.</P>
      <P>Lee told the former prisoners of conscience that Taiwan has come
a long way to emerge as a pluralistic democracy. "In the process, we
have endured many sorrows. This has enabled us to better understand
what and where the problem is," the president said.</P>
      <P>A confident, upbeat Lee urged Yang and other former political
prisoners to forget their past ordeals.</P>
      <P>"We should learn to forgive and forget. By so doing, we'll be
able to find true happiness and turn sorrows into joys," Lee said,
adding that this is why he has been advocating the concept of "new
Taiwanese" which will help forge unity among all Taiwan residents
regardless of their origin.</P>
      <P>The president went on to say that all people in Taiwan should
work to incorporate different ethnic cultures into a new culture.
"Let us forget that dark period and work hand-in-hand to create a
mature, civilized, nurturing and sensible society," he said.</P>
      <P>After a decade of democratic reforms, Lee said, Taiwan has become
a full-fledged democracy. "Nowadays, no person here is likely to be
convicted or jailed simply because of their thinking, ideology or
speech. I myself have often been criticized. I don't care much about
such criticism. I have learnt to respect and tolerate the opinions of
critics or opponents."</P>
      <P>Po Yang and dozens of other former political prisoners have
pushed for the establishment of a human rights monument on Green
Island to remind future ROC leaders never to repeat past mistakes and
to dedicate themselves to upholding democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>President Lee originally promised to attend a groundbreaking
ceremony for the monument on Dec. 10. However, due to his busy
schedule, Lee was unable to appear and instead sent Premier Vincent
Siew to attend the ceremony on his behalf.</P>
      <P>"I'll push relevant government agencies to assist in the design
and construction of the monument, including the funding and
reservation of nearby land for vegetation as well as other technical
details," the president pledged.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite a domestic and a regional economic
slowdown, Taiwan VISA card holders charged NT$325 billion (US$10
billion) in goods and services during the first 11 months of this
year -- a record amount -- sources from the VISA International
Service Association reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The NT$325 billion in charges made from January to November was
NT$54.5 billion (US$1.7 billion) higher than the amount made during
the same 1997 period. VISA International officials estimated that
total charges to VISA cards in 1998 in Taiwan could surpass charges
for 1997 by 30 percent.</P>
      <P>As of Nov. 30 VISA International had issued 9.18 million VISA
cards in Taiwan. VISA cards have remained the No. 1 credit card in
Taiwan since their introduction in 1989, according to company
officials.</P>
      <P>To meet the growing demands resulting from an ever-rising number
of VISA card holders and from the 170,000 stores islandwide that
accept the card, VISA International established its second computer
processing network in Taiwan in mid-1998 to facilitate its operations
on the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOCIOLOGIST CALLS FOR MORE CONSTRUCTION TO COMBAT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Accelerating public construction projects
directly related to raising people's standard of living is the only
practical way to revitalize Taiwan's sluggish economy, a leading
local sociologist said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chu Yun-peng, director of Academia Sinica's Institute for Social
Sciences and Philosophy, said he proposed to Economic Affairs
Minister Wang Chih-kang Tuesday that the government shift its
attention from financial-aid packages devised to invigorate the local
bourse, to public construction projects that would improve the
public's standard of living, as a way to prime the pump during a
period of recession.</P>
      <P>Chu was among a group of leading economists and sociologists
invited by Minister Wang to a meeting Tuesday evening on what the
government can do to put steam back into the local economy. Chu said
the public construction projects he mentioned include water and land
conservation projects, the development of urban sewage systems and
community computerization.</P>
      <P>The proposed urban renovation plans can be accelerated by first
having relevant statues passed in the Legislative Yuan so as to give
local governments free hands in carrying out the plans, he noted.</P>
      <P>Another urban development plan, proposed by the Executive Yuan
several years ago, should also be implemented soon to boost the
number of public construction projects. As more public construction
projects are launched, the real estate and property development
businesses will pick up steam as well. This will in turn fuel
operations in other sectors, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Taipei-based Chinese
National Association of Industry and Commerce, warned that Taiwan's
economy will not fare better next year than it did this year if no
pump-priming measures are enacted.</P>
      <P>Koo quoted a recent International Monetary Fund report as saying
that overall economic growth in the United States may expand by a
mere 1.5 percent in 1999, compared with 3 percent this year. The
development will have a direct yet adverse impact on Taiwan's
economy, which relies heavily on exports, particularly to the United
States.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's overall economy will still fare much better than
neighboring economies if the government strives to improve Taiwan's
investment environment so as to solicit more foreign investment,
bolster exports, stabilize the nation's political picture and improve
social order, Koo noted.</P>

      <P>Prominent mainland Chinese dissident Wei
Jingsheng, currently visiting in Taiwan, checked into Veterans
General Hospital (VGH) in Taipei for emergency treatment Tuesday
night after he was diagnosed as suffering from acute bronchitis and
fatigue, according to VGH sources.</P>
      <P>Wei, who coughed heavily and had difficulty breathing when he
checked into the hospital, was doing fairly well as of Wednesday
morning after being given antibiotics and cough medicine, and after
having a nice, long sleep, VGH doctors said.</P>
      <P>Wei, currently living in exile in the United States, is a chronic
smoker who has weak lungs, according to Feng Chang-feng, a doctor
from VGH's Section of Infectious Diseases.</P>
      <P>Wei developed acute bronchitis after nine days of whirlwind
activities during a visit to Taiwan. This, coupled with Taiwan's
constantly changing weather, wore Wei out, Feng noted.</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese democracy promoter is expected to be
discharged from the hospital Thursday morning, as an initial
biochemical examination of his blood found that Wei is in a generally
good overall condition, Feng added.</P>
      <P>Wei, who has been described as "the father of democracy in
mainland China," was scheduled to leave Taiwan Wednesday after a

      <P>Mainland China is facing a mounting
problem of growing stockpiles of goods, as demand continues falling
in the wake of rising unemployment.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing titled "China's curse of bountiful
times" The Australian on Wednesday reported mainland Chinese
customers either do not want or cannot afford to buy these surplus
goods, including televisions, washing machines, buses, plastic bowls
and other consumer products.</P>
      <P>Throughout mainland China, storehouses are full to bursting with
corn and cotton, copper and coal while factories continue to churn
out televisions, washing machines and other consumer products even as
demand continues to lag, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The daily reported the demand for this burgeoning mainland
Chinese output is flagging, both at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>In the West, analysts have worried that mainland China would
become an overly voracious consumer of staple commodities, such as
grains and coal. But now the supply of staples is also in surplus,
the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Mainland China produced 250 million tons of coal this year, while
it only needed 180 million tons to run its economy, the daily

(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy is expected to remain
weak, and with weakness in a wide variety of indicators and a general
lack of confidence, there are few signs that the nation can expect a
rebound any time soon, The Journal of Commerce reported from Taipei
Tuesday, citing local economists and analysts.</P>
      <P>The stock market is expected to continue suffering from weak
fundamentals and from weak sentiment associated with the financial
problems that have hit various companies in recent months, the
Journal said, adding that export orders and industrial output are
seen to be slowing again as the peak export season has ended.</P>
      <P>Annual growth in the consumer price index is seen as slowing from
November's 3.91-percent clip as food prices return to normal after
earlier bad weather.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to continue posting a sizable trade surplus,
due to imports falling at a faster pace than exports, rather than due
to strong demand abroad for Taiwan-made products.</P>
      <P>According to the New York City-based daily, annual growth in the
M2 money supply is seen slowing on weak loan growth and the central
bank's recent open-market absorption of funds.</P>
      <P>Short-term interest rates are seen as likely to remain near
current levels on ample liquidity in the money market, while US
dollar-New Taiwan dollar exchange rates are seen as likely to
fluctuate narrowly, as the central bank continues to wedge the pair
in a tight range, it concluded.</P>

      <P>Asian currencies, including the New
Taiwan dollar, are outperforming the Australian dollar and other
commodity currencies in 1998, according to the Colonial State Bank in
Melbourne.</P>
      <P>The survey, published by Thomas Cook, shows the worst performing

chalked up some of the largest gains against the US dollar this year.</P>
      <P>East Asian currencies, which plunged toward the end of 1997 and

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ports of Kaohsiung, Taichung, Keelung
and Hualien will come under central government management by the end
of June as a result of the downsizing of the Taiwan Provincial
Government.</P>
      <P>The decision was made in an inter-ministerial meeting of the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications, which ruled that its
Navigation and Aviation Department will take charge of administration
of the four ports in June, while a state-run company will be set up
over the next year to handle the privatization of all four ports by
2002.</P>
      <P>However, officials with the Economic Planning and Development
Council attending the meeting voiced disagreement with the
establishment of the company, arguing that the four ports should be
directly privatized.</P>
      <P>However, department head Wu Jung-kui explained that the number of
workers employed at the four ports totals more than 5,000, and that
many of them would lose their jobs if the ports were privatized
directly.</P>
      <P>Wu emphasized that it will be better to carry out the
privatization plan gradually, and added that the ministry will submit
the plan to the Executive Yuan for final approval.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Port in southern Taiwan and Keelung Port in the north

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE'S WAGES LOWEST OF 4 TIGERS: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,   Dec.   30   (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore has become the most
competitive of the four "Asian Tiger" economies in terms of the cost
of wages, according to the Geneva-based Corporate Resources Group
(CRG).</P>
      <P>The hourly rates of managers, professionals and workers in
Singapore are lower than those in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan,
the survey said.</P>
      <P>"Singapore is a lot more labor-cost competitive compared
especially to Hong Kong as a regional hub for Asia," said Elaine Ng,
who tracks salary movements in the region for the CRG group. "More
regional companies may relocate to Singapore to improve their bottom
line," she added.</P>
      <P>The hourly rate for managers in Singapore, for instance, was
US$30.70 as of November 1998, compared with US$62.80 in Hong Kong.
The rates for managers in South Korea and Taiwan as of November were
US$40.20 and US$39.60, respectively. But wages costs in Singapore are
still higher than in the rest of Asia, excluding Japan.</P>
      <P>Wages costs in mainland China -- particularly in Beijing,
Shanghai and Guangzhou -- are rising fast, however. Managers there
are making about US$17.70 an hour which, while still below the rates
of the Tiger economies, are higher than those in Thailand, India, the
Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Wages costs in Indonesia were the lowest among the countries
surveyed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OLYMPIC GAMES SHOULD BE SCRAPPED: FORMER AUSSIE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Olympic Games should be scrapped
because it has been tarnished by bribery allegations and by
allegations of mainland Chinese athletes engaging in doping, a former
Australian sports minister said.</P>
      <P>Speaking on radio on Tuesday, Andrew Thomson said any group
organizing a global sporting event should be "ethically clean" with
"no suggestion of financial taint."</P>
      <P>He said the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens should be the last and
that doping allegations would have killed off the Olympics if Beijing
had won the right to play host to the 2000 Games ahead of Sydney.</P>
      <P>Thomson's comments were attacked by members of Australia's
International Olympic Committee (IOC).</P>
      <P>Australian IOC member Kevan Gosper has called on Prime Minister
John Howard to silence Thomson, who was removed as federal sports
minister after the Oct. 3 election, because it was feared that
remarks made by Thomson would risk damaging the 2000 Olympic Games in
Sydney.</P>
      <P>Another Australian IOC member, Phil Coles, said Thomson's
comments about Beijing would be noticed internationally because the
mainland Chinese capital was bidding to serve as host to the 2008
Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>"It's a very undiplomatic statement he's made about China.
They'll be jumping up and down about (it)," Coles told reporters.</P>
      <P>The IOC has been rocked by bribery claims against organizers of
the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, who are alleged to have
offered athletic scholarship programs in return for IOC votes.</P>
      <P>IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch has called for a meeting
next month to discuss corruption allegations surrounding the bidding
process.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US, AUSTRALIA URGED TO PRESSURE CHINA TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  30 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States, Australia and others
in the international community seem unable to exert an influence on
mainland China to respect human rights, though they should not stop
trying to pressure Beijing, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.</P>
      <P>In an editorial titled "China and Civil Rights" on Wednesday, the
paper wrote: "So far, though, the manifestations of the democratic
spirit in China are more idealistic and, as far as can be seen,
related to the new economic power centers. And the world's
democracies seem helpless in the face of Beijing's obduracy."</P>
      <P>"The US, for all its power to influence Beijing through trade,
and its willingness to criticize human rights abuses, seems
powerless. And other countries, such as Australia, which have chosen
to engage in 'dialogue' with China on human rights are made to seem
even more so," the editorial said.</P>
      <P>That is all the more reason for members of the international
community to maintain pressure on mainland China, the paper said.</P>
      <P>"The latest demonstration of the Chinese leadership's contempt
for world opinion on human rights -- the harsh prison sentences
imposed on political dissidents -- is a cause for dismay," according
to the editorial.</P>
      <P>The mainland's recent actions show how easily a country that
rejects democratic principles can maintain its grip on power through
inciting fear and intimidating its people, the paper said.</P>
      <P>The editorial noted that late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping put
mainland China on the road to a market economy. "But any hopes that
these measures would be accompanied by liberalization of the
political system have come to nothing."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAYOR DEMONSTRATES DETERMINATION TO CRACK DOWN ON ILLICIT BUSINESSES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The city government's efforts to crack down
on the sex trade and other illicit industries are not slackening off
even slightly because of the change of mayor, Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>To demonstrate his determination to crack down on prostitution,
gambling and other illicit industries in the city, Ma personally sat
through a shift from Tuesday night to Wednesday morning at the police
precinct in Chungshan District, an area infamous for illegal
businesses, to boost the morale of the law enforcement officers
stationed there.</P>
      <P>Ma, a former justice minister, did not actually participate in
the crackdowns, contrary to some rumors reported in the local press.
He said he fully respects the expertise and experience of the police
force in cracking down on illegal businesses. "I am here only to
boost their morale," he emphasized.</P>
      <P>In Tuesday's midnight action, the first large-scale raid staged
since Ma took office last Friday, police raided six nightclubs and
pubs in the Chungshan District, arresting some 20 prostitutes and
operators on charges of engaging in the sex trade.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, other police forces carried out similar raids in the
Wanhua District, another area notorious for its large number of
sex-related businesses, uncovering 18 illicit operations and making
more than 25 arrests.</P>
      <P>Police also nabbed nine people for operating gambling dens, and
confiscated 125 pornographic CD-ROMs.</P>
      <P>Ma's personal presence at the police station came as rumors are
rife that this type of illegal trade is poised to revive now that he
has taken over as mayor of Taiwan's largest city.</P>
      <P>During the run-up to the mayoral election, Ma endorsed a Taipei
City Council resolution, which was opposed by then-Taipei Mayor Chen
Shui-bian, by agreeing to grant licensed prostitutes a two-year grace
period before their trade is prohibited.</P>
      <P>Now that he is in charge, Ma has suggested drawing up a
comprehensive set of measures to help licensed prostitutes change
their jobs before the grace period expires, so long as they commit to
obeying the ban on prostitution in two year's time.</P>
      <P>In yet another attempt to clarify his position on the issue, Ma
reiterated on Tuesday his policy of "protecting legal trade while
cracking down on illegal ones."</P>

    <HEADLINE>NTU TO SET UP `HUMANITARIAN CENTER' FOR CAMPUS STRAY DOGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) will
follow in the footsteps of many top-rate universities around the
world by setting up a humanitarian center to better treat the stray
dogs which roam its campus, a faculty member said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Professor Fei Chan-yung, who teaches at the NTU's Veterinary
Science Department, said he has drawn up a blueprint for the proposed
center.</P>
      <P>"Construction will get under way after the blueprint is approved
by the NTU's development planning commission," Fei said, adding that
the center is scheduled to become operational by the end of next
year.</P>
      <P>Under the Fei-drafted plan, a four-story building with a total
floor space of 1,000 pings, equivalent to 36,000 square feet, will be
built on the university campus to accommodate captured strays.</P>
      <P>The center will be staffed by a full-time veterinarian and
several part-time veterinarians, plus 100 volunteer workers.</P>
      <P>Staff members will first conduct "behavior evaluation" on all
strays brought to the center to determine whether they can get along
with humans. "If they can, they will be subject to further health
checkups. Healthy dogs will then be cleaned up, vaccinated,
sterilized, and presented for adoption by members of the general
public."</P>
      <P>Only those which cannot get along well with humans, have been
infected with diseases, or cannot attract adoptive owners within a
week, will be euthanized, Fei said.</P>
      <P>At the moment, almost all the strays captured on campus are
killed.</P>
      <P>Fei said he and many NTU students have volunteered to capture
campus strays over the past three years. "We have managed to seize
200 strays each year, and send them to the Taipei City Government's
Bureau of Environmental Protection. It is regrettable that the
municipal bureau has consistently gassed all those dogs."</P>
      <P>With financial support from the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture, Fei went to Hawaii in August to study theory and
practical measures for the humanitarian treatment of strays.</P>
      <P>Fei said NTU will publish a manual on the humanitarian treatment
of strays in the near future. "We'll print 10,000 copies for free
distribution," he added.</P>
      <P>Fei said he has found through his years of experience in handling
strays that even though there are many sensible pet lovers here, the
number of stray dogs has continued to rise. "This is mainly because
many dog owners do not trust local environmental units. They would
rather see their pets become strays than send them to
government-funded accommodation centers."</P>
      <P>Fei said the planned NTU center is expected to set a model for
the humanitarian treatment of strays. "We'll make it a creditable
place where local people can turn in their dogs when they no longer
wish to continue keeping them."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in another development, it was reported that the
Taipei municipal environmental protection bureau has tentatively
decided to stop capturing stray dogs in the city as a result of
pressure from local environmental activists and academics.</P>
      <P>Environmental activists threatened to organize a large-scale
demonstration in front of the Presidential Office during the upcoming
New Year holiday if the city government fails to cease its inhumane
methods of capturing and killing strays until it manages to work out
better ways to treat the animals. Taipei currently has about 200,000
stray dogs. In the first 11 months of this year, the municipal bureau
captured more than 8,000 of them.</P>
      <P>Many city councilors, however, criticized the city government's
abrupt decision to suspend stray dog capture. "What the city
government should do is to improve its capture methods and treatment
of seized stray animals," said Teng Chia-chi, an opposition New Party
city councilor. "Otherwise, Taipei's image will be tarinished."</P>

      <P>A seesaw battle related to the import of
garlic is under way among garlic businesses and processed garlic
producers in Taiwan, where garlic is widely consumed.</P>
      <P>The local wholesale price of garlic has so far climbed to NT$120
(US$3.73) per kilogram since September, while the retail price has
soared to over NT$140.</P>
      <P>It has been reported that a number of local garlic traders have
stockpiled "garlic mountains" in the hope of selling at higher prices
in the upcoming Lunar New Year festival, the most important festival
in the Chinese year.</P>
      <P>In the face of this monopoly, some garlic businesses from
southern Taiwan have lodged protests at the Council of Agriculture
(COA), demanding that the authorities reopen the door to garlic
imports in order to eliminate this type of speculation, according to
COA officials.</P>
      <P>Garlic imports are carefully controlled by the government, in
order to avoid gluts and shortages which can affect prices for local
growers.</P>
      <P>In September, the government launched a special package to import
8,000 kilotons of garlic in order to meet demand resulting from
insufficient output from domestic farmers, which managed to cap
soaring prices. However, prices began rising again in early December.</P>
      <P>The outcry for further imports is opposed by the Processed Garlic
Producers Association, which said new imports will lead to a slump in
prices, as happened in 1996.</P>
      <P>Huang Yiu-tsai, COA director of food and agriculture affairs,
said on Wednesday that Taiwan has around 4,000 kilotons of garlic in
stock. However, the COA has been informed that around half of that
has been cornered by speculators, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to the COA, Taiwan's garlic production is usually
enough to cope with local demand, without the need to rely on
imports.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC RULES OUT PROPOSED IMPORT OF GRAVEL FROM MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Dec. 30 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) on Wednesday turned down a request by the Kinmen County
Government to import gravel from mainland China, citing current
government laws which prohibit direct trade across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Officials with the MAC, the highest-level government agency in
charge of Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, ruled out the
possibility of importing gravel from the mainland in an assessment
seminar held here with officials of the Kinmen County Government.</P>
      <P>The MAC officials said that the proposal is unlikely to be
adopted in the short term, as the government still bans direct trade,
postal deliveries, and transport between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>They added, however, that the MAC will suggest that the Executive
Yuan consider subsidizing local constructors, hard hit by a serious
shortage of gravel, on a case-by-case basis, now that MAC Chairman
Chang King-yuh has gained an understanding of the situation on the
Taiwan-controlled island stronghold during a fact-finding inspection
tour in September.</P>
      <P>According to local officials, the Kinmen County Government was
eagerly hoping to import gravel directly from mainland China's Fujian
province to ease a worsening shortage since a ban on extracting
gravel on Kinmen went into effect in July.</P>
      <P>The ban has caused prices of gravel imported from Taiwan to soar
from the previous level of about NT$150 per cubic meter to the
current level of nearly NT$1,000 per cubic meter, forcing
construction of many public projects to halt because of the resultant
sharp increase in production costs, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>Kinmen's demand for gravel and rock is expected to hit around 3.5
million cubic meters in the near future, as two major public
construction projects -- a commercial port and a bridge -- are
planned to kick off within two years, they claimed.</P>
      <P>Although the Kinmen County Government has agreed to relax the ban
on gravel extraction, and is already planning to open a gravel and
rock quarry, the officials said that the measures will still fall
short of meeting the long-term demand, especially at a time when
Taiwan is also increasingly facing a similar problem.</P>
      <P>Against this background, the Kinmen County Government had
therefore been hoping to import gravel from Fujian province, just a
few kilometers away on the opposite side of the strait, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Citing an investigation by an engineering company, they pointed
out that imported Fujian gravel costs about NT$288 per cubic meter,
much cheaper than Taiwan gravel.</P>

      <P>The economy next year should fare better
than this year after an economic turnaround following the earlier
financial turmoil, P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a year-end press conference, Chiang said that the top
priority of the CEPD next year will be the mapping out of a strategy
to stimulate the island's economy.</P>
      <P>He said that the package of stimulating measures will begin with
the promotion of production and marketing, stabilization of
enterprises, and cutting of costs.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the CEPD is planning to convene a staff meeting
during the New Year holiday to compile a list of views of related
government agencies, in order to have a basis for working out its
draft. After a further intra-agency meeting next week, he said, he
will then make a full report to Premier Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>The CEPD chief said that next year, the council will also work on
legislation for National Annuity Insurance, the economic development
prospects of the nation in 2011, middle- and long-term public
construction projects, and the privatization of state-owned
enterprises.</P>
      <P>Chiang also said that the sluggish construction market was mainly
caused by the construction boom in earlier years, resulting in more
than 800,000 households standing empty in the real estate market,
which he said also indirectly affects the operation of banking
institutions.</P>
      <P>He added that the Executive Yuan will discuss a relief plan for
the construction sector on Thursday, which he believes should start
with the controlled supply of housing, and incentives on house

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Wednesday threw
his support behind the Government Information Office's (GIO's)
ongoing campaign to eradicate pornography and violence from local
news media, particularly television programs.</P>
      <P>Lee voiced his support for the anti-pornography crusade after
listening to a report by GIO Director-General Chen Chien-jen on the
current state and outlook of Taiwan's radio broadcasting and
television industry during a weekly meeting of the ruling
Kuomintang's Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>Lee, who concurrently serves as KMT chairman, said local media
executives should refrain from producing programs featuring erotic
and violent themes.</P>
      <P>"Media operators and professionals should abide by professional
ethics, their personal conscience, and government regulations when
producing and broadcasting their programs," Lee urged.</P>
      <P>Noting that salacious television programs and sensational media
reports on violent crimes are to blame for the country's moral decay
and worsening social order, Lee said the GIO should intensify its
anti-pornography and anti-violence campaign.</P>
      <P>He said outdated laws and regulations governing the radio and
television industries should also be phased out or revised to bring
them into line with today's social demands and help upgrade all
broadcasting programs.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Minister of Transportation and
Communications Lin Feng-cheng said the government is determined to
complete digitalization of all domestic TV programs by the end of
2005.</P>
      <P>The planned digitalization is expected to bring about an
estimated NT$200 billion-worth of business opportunities to local
enterprises over the next six years, Lin added.</P>
      <P>In related news, the Television Culture Research Association
launched a program to select the five most disgusting TV programs
broadcast in Taiwan in 1998.</P>
      <P>Lai Kuo-chou, executive secretary of the association, told a news

not to present programs that are based solely on rumor and
speculation, that rudely infringe upon privacy, or that feature
prurient and violent themes.</P>
      <P>In addition to the association, 15 members of the local print
media and seven websites are co-sponsoring the program. Local people
are welcome to give their recommendations for the selection of the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) should create "mainstream values" on its own to help
inspire Taiwan's further political and economic advancement, a new
party executive said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>You Hsi-kun, who was sworn in as the DPP's secretary-general
Wednesday afternoon, further said the "mainstream values" that the
DPP should create or uphold must not run against social justice.</P>
      <P>"If the DPP slows or suspends its fight against the money- and
gangster-linked politics prevalent in Taiwan, it will betray its
secularization and moral decline. Such a development violates social
justice and is not in national interests," You asserted.</P>
      <P>You went on to say he supports an overall review of the DPP's
controversial pro-Taiwan independence platform in order to expand
the party's support base and facilitate its bid to become the
island's ruling party.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, You said he does not have any pre-set stance on
the issue. "I'll arrange for intraparty discussion on the issue to
forge an internal consensus on whether the party's pro-independence
platform should be revised, reworded or completely phased out," he
noted.</P>
      <P>The DPP's chapter includes a clause saying Taiwan's future
should be decided based on the result of a plebiscite. The clause is
widely seen as a proof that the party favors Taiwan independence. As
mainland China has repeatedly said it will attack Taiwan should the
island declare de jure independence, the DPP's pro-independence
platform has hindered the party's efforts to largely expand its
popular support.</P>
      <P>Intraparty calls for a review of the pro-independence
platform have arisen in recent weeks as many political observers and
some DPP heavyweights blamed the clause for the party's lackluster
performance in the Dec. 5 three-in-one elections.</P>
      <P>You, who once served as magistrate of the northeastern
county of Ilan for eight years, just ended his stint as chairman of
the Taipei City Government-run Taipei Rapid Transit Co. after
former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, a DPP stalwart, lost his
re-election bid.</P>
      <P>You said he was invited by DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung to run
the party's day-to-day affairs.</P>
      <P>"I'm not appointed by Ah-bian (the nickname of former Taipei
Mayor Chen) to serve as the DPP's secretary-general," You said,
adding that his decision to assume the party's top secretarial
post is also not aimed at paving the way for Chen to win the
party's nomination for Taiwan's next presidential election in
March 2000.</P>
      <P>You said he will strictly adopt a neutral, impartial stance
in handling the party primary for the next presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Noting that serving as the party's chief manager of day-to-day
affairs is a tough task, You said he is determined to devote
his full energies to his new job to help streamline the party
apparatus and expand its support base.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, You, a self-effacing, soft-spoken politician
with a common touch, said he will respect administrative rules
and principles set by his predecessors in running the DPP's
day-to-day affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FPG TO APOLOGIZE OVER MERCURY-LACED WASTE IN CAMBODIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) said
on Wednesday that it has decided to apologize to Cambodia over its
shipment of mercury-laced waste to the Southeast Asian nation.</P>
      <P>FPG officials said that FPG Chairman Y. C. Wang will fax a
message of apology to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen.</P>
      <P>FPG General Manager Lee Chih-chun said in a press conference on
Wednesday afternoon that FPG officials will accompany Legislator
Tseng Chen-nung of the ruling Kuomintang, who maintains extensive
relations with the Cambodian leadership, on a three-day fact-finding
trip to Cambodia and to gather samples for analysis.</P>
      <P>Lee said that FPG officials are expected to bring back 50
samples, and will then invite experts to conduct analyses of the
waste.</P>
      <P>Tseng said the FPG delegation will try to find out how the
Cambodian authorities have been dealing with the waste, and will
explain the company's stance and express their condolences to local
officials.</P>
      <P>He said that he has been in daily contact with Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen and has learned that he wants the FPG to address the
problem squarely.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
on Monday ordered the FPG to bring back to Taiwan the waste it dumped
in the coastal resort of Sihanoukville in southern Cambodia, saying
that the level of toxicity slightly exceeded safety standards.</P>
      <P>The EPA said tests on waste samples brought back by a local
environmental group, the Green Formosa Front showed mercury levels of
0.284 parts per million (ppm), compared with the 0.2 ppm safety
standard set by the ROC government.</P>
      <P>The FPG shipped 2,700 tons of the waste to Cambodia last month
for disposal. The incident hit the headlines last week after Hun Sen
claimed in Phnom Penh that the FPG waste poses a great health threat
to the Cambodian people and that several residents of Shihnoukville
might have died because of contact with the waste.</P>

      <P>Over a third of business leaders polled
believed next year's economy would recede while a large majority
believed Taiwan's economic growth would not reach government
projections, a recent survey indicated.</P>
      <P>According to the survey conducted by the China Credit Information
Service Ltd. of Taiwan's top 500 firms, 34.6 percent said Taiwan's
economy would likely recede next year while 32.3 percent saw a slight
improvement. Only less than 1 percent thought the economy would gain
noticeable momentum in 1999.</P>
      <P>Moreover, 85 percent said Taiwan's economic growth would likely
be between 3 percent and 4.9 percent compared to government forecasts
of 5.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Different sectors were widely divided on local business
conditions next year, the survey indicated. For instance, the service
industry was more optimistic than the manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>Most businesses in the service sector, with the exception of the
construction industry, were confident that Taiwan's economy will
rebound next year. In the manufacturing sector, most of the survey
respondents, other than those in the food-processing industry,
believed the economy in 1999 would maintain stable or face a
recession.</P>
      <P>A majority of the 500 companies surveyed described their own
business prospects for the new year as "cautiously optimistic," the
results stated.</P>
      <P>Some 64.2 percent predicted that their revenues would expand in
1999, and 31.6 percent of those said they would likely post
increases of more than 50 percent. About 22.7 percent thought their
businesses would remain stable while 13.2 percent said their
businesses may contract by up to 10 percent.</P>
      <P>On net profits, 56.1 percent of the businesses surveyed expressed
confidence in making greater profits in the coming year, in contrast
to 14.7 percent who said their profits would likely shrink by about
10 percent. Nearly 30 percent said they would maintain a similar
level of profit as this year, according to the survey.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTER OUTLINES WORK PLANS FOR NEW YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on
Wednesday that the Republic of China will continue to promote its
bid to re-join the United Nations and take part in functional
international organizations to counter mainland China's "big power
diplomacy."</P>
      <P>Hu told a year-end news conference that as mainland China has
been actively seeking to forge "strategic partnerships" with
advanced countries, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is
studying countermeasures to cope with the new challenges.</P>
      <P>The minister pointed out that following a meeting in Shanghai in
mid-October between the top negotiators from both sides of the Taiwan
Strait, Taipei's Koo Chen-fu and Beijing's Wang Daohan, mainland
China, while stepping up its efforts to forge a false impression in
the world community that the two sides have begun political dialogue
or unification talks, has simultaneously intensifies its diplomatic
strangulation strategy against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"If we fail to expose Beijing's two-handed strategy against us,
major countries around the world may erroneously think that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait could resolve their disputes soon and
thus withheld their diplomatic support for us and even cease arms
sales to Taiwan," Hu warned.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Hu said, the ROC must strengthen
international publicity to let the world understand the legitimacy
and reasonableness of its diplomatic efforts as well as Beijing's
"true face" and two-handed tactics against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"On the other hand, we should also make Beijing understand that
its attempt to isolate Taiwan in the international community cannot
succeed," Hu noted.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that mainland China believes when it succeeds in
taking away all of the ROC's diplomatic allies, the time will come
for reunification.</P>
      <P>"But I am afraid the more they push to leave us zero diplomatic
allies, it will only mean zero chance of reunification," the
minister said. "Their suppression only sparks antagonism among our
people, and they must try to understand how our people feel about
it."</P>
      <P>Hu further warned Beijing against pursuing so-called "big power
diplomacy" by striking strategic alliances with advanced nations
while seeking their commitments to isolate Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During his visit to Beijing this summer, US President Bill
Clinton pledged not to support Taiwan's efforts to rejoin the United
Nations or its independence.</P>
      <P>"Despite their closer relations, Western nations will never ease
their attacks on the mainland China's human rights violations,'' Hu
said. "As Washington and Beijing get closer to each other, they will
also realize the wide gaps between them."</P>
      <P>Hu further said he hopes Beijing will understand that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait must co-exist peacefully in the world
arena to lay a solid foundation for China's peaceful unification
under freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>As for the ministry work plans for the coming year, Hu said the
ministry will coordinate with other relevant government agencies to
expand the ROC's diplomatic frontiers through trade and
economic cooperation.</P>
      <P>"We will also respect public opinion and uphold the democratic
principles in promoting diplomatic work and maintain peace,
stability and security in the Taiwan Strait," Hu stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUICIDE RATE COULD CONTINUE TO RISE: EXPERTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The growing number of people who are
middle-aged and unemployed, and single elderly persons in Taiwan
is leading experts to express concern over the possibility of a
continued rise in the suicide rate.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the Department of Health indicated that
the island's suicide rate has increased in the last five years. Last
year, suicide was again listed as one of the top 10 causes of death
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although there is no evidence linking unemployment with suicide,
the number of people aged between 25 to 44 who took their own lives
was the highest in recent years, and the suicide rate for this
particular age group had increased the most. Suicide rates for men
was 1.9 times higher than that for women, experts noted.</P>
      <P>Compared to last year, the jobless situation in 1998 has worsened
as youths entering the job market for the first time are also finding
it difficult to find employment.</P>
      <P>Experts also expressed concern over the high suicide rate among
the elderly population in Taiwan. Every age group in Taiwan has a
lower suicide rate than that of other countries, but for Taiwan
residents over 65, the suicide rate is higher than neighboring Asian
countries as well as European and American countries.</P>
      <P>Statistics paint a gloomy picture of the elderly in Taiwan. About
50 percent of single elderly people suffer from chronic diseases,
while those without children, living with their friends or relatives,
or those living in nursing homes have an even higher ratio -- 85
percent -- suffer from chronic diseases.</P>
      <P>A suicide hotline reported that in the past year, it received
over 14,000 calls for help. Among them, over 12 percent of the
callers have considered ending their lives or have attempted suicide.
The figure a few years ago was less than 10 percent.</P>
      <P>Psychiatrist Chang Chin-juei of the Cathay General Hospital said
12 out of every 10,000 deaths are caused by suicide. Meanwhile, the
number of patients seeking psychological help at the hospital has
also increased, he said. Those who are most likely to attempt suicide
are those who are clinically depressed, Chang added.</P>

      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC), in an
effort to bolster the sluggish real estate market, will release an
additional NT$150 billion in housing loans, Finance Minister Paul
Chiu announced on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance and the CBC came to the decision after
discussing on Wednesday possible measures to give the struggling real
estate industry a shot in the arm, Chiu said.</P>
      <P>He stated that the CBC will use postal bank deposits totaling
NT$150 billion in addition to the NT$30 billion it earlier released
to banks for low-rate housing loans.</P>
      <P>The CBC's largest deal involving its postal deposits for housing
loans is expected to fill 100,000 vacant units in Taiwan, the finance
minister said.</P>
      <P>Banks will offer a 5.95 percent lending rate to those who do not
currently own a home over the next year. The repayment period will be
20 years with a grace period of three years.</P>
      <P>The low interest rate means the government will subsidize the
0.85 percent difference between the special rate and the interbank
rate currently set at 6.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Eligible Taipei residents are entitled to NT$2.5 million in
housing loans while those living outside Taipei may receive NT$2

      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party is not

      <P>Lin noted that the party development committee will work out pa

      <P>The party development committee is now divided into five groups.
One group is assigned to review the results of the Dec. 5 elections,
one is attempting to unite the political factions within the party,
one is seeking to forge closer relations with the private sector, one
is working on the presidential election strategy, and another is
revising the party's platform and nomination regulations.</P>
      <P>Wu Nai-jen, DPP Central Standing Committee member and convenor of

      <P>P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) is scheduled to
visit Gambia and Senegal between Jan. 9 and 16 to promote economic
and agricultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>The ROC's top economic planner said he and his mission will
primarily assess the feasibility of Taiwan's plans to create major
economic and property development projects in Gambia and Senegal.</P>
      <P>During their visit, the delegates, which include officials from
the ministries of foreign affairs and economic affairs, will also
meet with the leaders of the two African nations.</P>
      <P>Chiang said he will spend two days in Gambia and three days in
Senegal.</P>
      <P>The trip to Gambia comes after Gambian President Yahya A.J.J.
Jammeh, during a visit to Taipei in November, personally invited
Chiang to the African country, the CEPD chairman noted.</P>
      <P>He decided to include a trip to Senegal because the Senegalese
government has invited him to visit three times in recent months.
They are hoping that Chiang will help push forward several proposals

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung police on
Thursday said they suspected an organized smuggling ring is behind
the growing number of Thai prostitutes found in the central Taiwan
city.</P>
      <P>Eleven of 15 foreign laborers charged with prostitution were from
Thailand and legally entered Taiwan with certificates verifying their
intention to marry Taiwan nationals, the police reported. This has
led authorities to dub these cases "false marriage, genuine sex
trade."</P>
      <P>There are currently about 7,600 foreign laborers who make
Taichung city their home. They work either at factories and
construction sites or as domestic helpers. The figure is about 3
percent of the entire foreign worker population in Taiwan, which
totals about 250,000.</P>
      <P>In Taichung, the number of foreign laborers abandoning their work
contracts has dropped to 3 percent this year, down from 9.3 percent
in previous years, the police noted. However, the number of those
found engaging in the illicit sex trade has increased.</P>
      <P>According to a police survey of Taichung employers regarding
foreign workers, Thais are generally favored because they are
obedient and have a strong work ethic. Their shortcomings are that
they like to drink alcohol and generally have a relaxed attitude
about sex which can cause problems for their Taiwan employers, the
police noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the survey found that Filipino workers are also
welcomed by Taiwan employers as they have a relatively higher level
of education and can speak English. However, Filipino workers were
often seen behind organized strikes and other related labor disputes.</P>

      <P>A Taiwan delegation, led by ruling

to collect samples of waste which originated in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The delegation includes Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) investigators, and two ranking executives of
Formosa Plastics Group (FPG), the company behind a dispute regarding
the toxicity level of the waste</P>
      <P>About 2,700 tons of waste were found near the coastal city of
Sihanoukville in southern Cambodia recently. Following the reported
death of a man who came in contact with the waste, Cambodian
officials raised concerns that the waste was toxic.</P>
      <P>Preliminary tests conducted by a local environmental interest

    <HEADLINE>GREEN PARTY PROTESTS FPG'S SLOPPY HANDLING OF TOXIC WASTE ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Green Party of Taiwan staged a
demonstration in front of the headquarters of Formosa Plastics Group
(FPG) on Thursday over the conglomerate's irresponsible, sloppy
handling of the controversial toxic waste issue.</P>
      <P>The environmentalist party demanded that the petrochemical giant
set a timetable for resolving issues related to its shipment of some
2,700 tons of mercury-laced waste to Cambodia for landfill disposal
in November.</P>
      <P>A spokesperson said the Green Party will be pleased to see the
FPG receive technical assistance from either the United States,
Germany or France in treating the controversial waste.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, we still hope that the FPG work out a timetable
for resolving the issue which has not only marred the group's
business reputation but also tarnished our country's international
image," the spokesperson said.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
should also learn a lesson from the incident and formulate an
effective system to monitor and control pollution of industrial
land, the Green Party executive said.</P>
      <P>"We believe that the FPG case is just the tip of the
domestic toxic waste iceberg, he said, adding that several recent
incidents, such as the dumping of hazardous waste in arable farmland
in the southern county of Pintung and the groundwater pollution in a
northern Taiwan township near a factory of the now-defunct Radio
Corporation of America, have all spotlighted the many defects and
improprieties in Taiwan's management of industrial waste.</P>
      <P>The Green Party urged all local enterprises to set up a crisis
management center to properly and timely handle issues similar to the
current FPG toxic waste incident to uphold the general public's
interests and protect their own corporate image and fame.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators also gave theatric performances to signify
their protests against the FPG's lousy handling of the waste
dispute.</P>
      <P>However, no FPG executives ever showed up to respond to the Green
Party's calls. The demonstration ended peacefully at 10:20 a.m.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Green Formosa Front, a local environmental group
which sent staff members to Cambodia to collect samples of the waste
for EPA laboratory tests earlier this month, said on Thursday it
will ask Japanese experts to conduct further tests on the samples
collected at the Cambodian dump site.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, a delegation of FPG executives and EPA
officials, left for Cambodia Thursday morning to collect samples of
the disputed FPG waste for further tests.</P>
      <P>The fact-finding panel was led by Tseng Chen-nung, a ruling
Kuomintang legislator closely connected to Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen.</P>
      <P>Tseng said prior to his departure that the team's main mission is
to collect samples of the waste. The lawmaker said the FPG is trying
to accurately assess whether the waste is indeed toxic as suggested
in previous analyses done by the EPA and a Japanese expert assigned
by the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>Tseng further said the panel will also seek a basic agreement
with Cambodian authorities over the future removal of the waste. FPG
General Manager Lee Chih-tsun said on Wednesday the company will
would work out a solution after the results of new analysis are
known.</P>
      <P>The FPG, which has admitted that the waste contains mercury but
said it is below hazardous levels, has promised to remove the waste
as the Cambodian government has demanded.</P>
      <P>Lee said the waste may be shipped to the United States where the
technology to process chemical waste is available.</P>
      <P>Also on Wednesday, FPG Chairman Wang Yung-ching faxed a message
to Hun Sen, apologizing for causing unrest among Cambodian residents
as a result of the waste dumping.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA URGES TAIPEI CITY TO ROUND UP STRAY DOGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 31 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Responding to a temporary moratorium on the
capture of stray dogs, the Council of Agriculture (COA) on Thursday
urged the Taipei City Government to continue rounding up strays in
line with regulations</P>
      <P>Chen Pao-chi, director of COA's Animal Industry Department, said
city laws required Taipei's Bureau of Environmental Protection, or
registered private groups commissioned by the bureau, to be
responsible for taking stray dogs off the streets.</P>
      <P>The COA director said animal protection regulations also
stipulated that stray dogs be handled by the county or city
government.</P>
      <P>The city bureau imposed a temporary moratorium on dog catching
Wednesday, stating that there are about 200,000 abandoned dogs in
Taipei but as it can only handle about 30-40 a day, it can hardly
cope with the task.</P>
      <P>The COA said the handling of stray dogs should start with the
registration of pets, involve stricter regulations on stray dogs and
the improvement of animal shelters.</P>
      <P>The council estimated that 200,000 dogs will be registered and
implanted with silicon chips for identification, while improvements
are being planned for 10 to 15 shelters.</P>
      <P>As Taipei lacks shelters to house the stray dogs, the COA will
send officials to other cities and counties to scout for suitable
alternative shelters with possible sites in Taipei County or Miaoli
County, Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOJ STRONGLY OPPOSES CREATION OF ANTI-CORRUPTION COMMISSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A proposal by Taiwan lawmakers to establish
an independent agency to fight corruption has met with strong
opposition from the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), sources from the
Legislative Yuan reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan Legal Affairs Committee on Thursday proposed
the establishment of an agency similar to Hong Kong's Independent
Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) as a means of combating
corruption and related problems involving government employees.</P>
      <P>In a position paper distributed Thursday to legislators, the MOJ
voiced opposition to the proposal, saying the current anti-corruption
system, which involves government prosecutors, investigators and
agencies in charge of formulating government policies on ethics, are
working efficiently. An additional, independent body is not needed,
the ministry said.</P>
      <P>MOJ officials said the establishment of an additional agency
would only result in redundancies. It is doubtful that the system
would operate more efficiently with the creation of an independent
body than it does now, they said.</P>
      <P>They instead recommended an overhaul and streamlining of the
current agencies in charge of government ethics.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Lee Ching-hua, one of the lawmakers who
initiated the ICAC proposal, was disappointed at the MOJ's reaction,
saying current administrative agencies are too conservative and lack
the expertise to deal with changing world trends.</P>
      <P>Lee characterized the MOJ's resistance to the lawmakers' proposal
to establish an ICAC in Taiwan as indicating a lack of foresight and
a sincere willingness to undergo reform.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsieh Tsung-min from the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party said that although the MOJ's government ethics
agencies are functioning sufficiently, it has not done a good job in
detecting and curbing the current spate of financial irregularities
in Taiwan. Examples of such irregularities include stock settlement
defaults, embezzling and bounced checks.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said on Thursday
that the Republic of China must continue to beef up its defense
capabilities because of mainland China's constant military threats.</P>
      <P>Lee made the statement at a high-ranking military officers
promotion ceremony.</P>
      <P>The president said although the Cold War ended several years
ago, mainland China has continued to expand its military strength.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing's incessant military build-up has become a
major destabilizing factor in the Asia-Pacific area, Lee said Taiwan
must further upgrade its combat capabilities to maintain peace and
stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"In addition to renovating weaponry systems and military
equipment, the ROC military has stepped up development of new
defense technologies and enforcement of a troop-reduction program,"
Lee said.</P>
      <P>Under the military streamlining plan, the ROC will trim the
number of its regular military forces from 450,000 to about
400,000 and the number of high-ranking officers will be cut
to around 400.</P>
      <P>"The ongoing military modernization plan is aimed at
establishing an elite deterrent force," Lee said, adding that
faster-than-expected progress in the program has won much acclaim in
local society.</P>
      <P>Lee offered his personal felicitations to the 78 senior military
officers who got promotions on Thursday, including 62 promoted to
the major general ranking and 16 to the lieutenant general ranking.</P>
      <P>"It is of great significance that you have managed to become the
first batch of senior officers promoted to the
major-or-lieutenant-general rankings since the 'streamlining' plan
was implemented a couple of years ago," Lee said.</P>
      <P>"The promotion marks a personal achievement on the one hand and
an increase in official duties on the other. I hope you'll continue
to work hard and contribute to the country's military build-up," the
president added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A bearish sentiment continued to dominate
the stock market Thursday, the last business day of the Taiwan Stock
Exchange (TAIEX) in 1998.</P>
      <P>TAIEX's weighted price index, the market's key barometer, dropped
43.6 points to close at 6,418.43.</P>
      <P>Over the past week, the bourse has sustained a series of drops,
despite government measures to prop up the market, such as the
decision to release postal deposits to banks to provide low-interest
housing loans. The loans are expected to bolster the island's housing
market and invigorate its construction sector, the locomotive of
Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Investors became pessimistic about Taiwan's economic prospects
after several companies cut profit forecasts or announced plans to
reduce the scale of their business operation, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1.63 billion shares changed hands on a market turnover
of NT$51.74 billion (US$1.61 billion), against the previous session's
NT$65.95 billion.</P>
      <P>Losers outnumbered gainers 282 to 139, with 66 stocks unchanged.</P>
      <P>Only paper and pulp issues among the eight major stock categories
posted a gain, rising 0.4 percent.</P>
      <P>The government's Thursday announcement that NT$150 billion
(US$4.66 billion) would be made available for housing loans did not
excite the construction sector. Construction stocks remained
unchanged in the session.</P>
      <P>Textile shares, meanwhile, plunged 1.3 percent, followed by
foodstuff issues, which dropped 1 percent; plastic and chemical
stocks and electronic engineering issues, both of which fell 0.8
percent; financial stocks, which fell 0.6 percent; and cement issues,
which fell 0.4 percent.</P>
      <P>The over-the-counter market saw a slight increase of 0.2 points,
closing at 165.8 on a market turnover of NT$3.95 billion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan stock index futures also ended the day lower.
The futures market will be closed from Friday to Monday for the New
Year's holiday.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Capitalization Weighted Stock Index Futures (TAIEX Index
Futures) for January lost 77 points, finishing at 6,531, with 3,173
contract transactions.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for February dropped 55 points to 6,570, with
223 contract transactions, while those for March moved down 65 points
to 6,560 and those for June slid 75 points to 6,555. Transactions for
the two months amounted to 49 and six, respectively.</P>
      <P>No trading was registered for September.</P>
      <P>Reference levels provide by the Taiwan International Mercantile
Exchange for TAIEX Index Futures trading on Thursday were 6,608

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 30 (CNA)
(By Angel Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>R &amp; I, a Japanese credit rating company, on
Wednesday gave Taiwan's long-term foreign currency debt rating a AA,
the second highest rating, and its short-term foreign currency debt
rating an A1+, the highest rating, respectively.</P>
      <P>R &amp; I said Taiwan's rating is high because of its outstanding
performance in its external-bound economy. For instance, the foreign
asset as a percentage of its GDP at the end of June was 52 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, R &amp; I added that Taiwan's high economic growth rate
and low inflation have contributed to its high ratings as well.
Taiwan's public debt to GDP ratio was a mere 24 percent at the end of
1997 and the government budget deficit has been reduced to a
reasonable level, R &amp; I said.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Taiwan's overdue loan ratio is expected to
increase from 4.75 percent in 1998 to 7 percent in 1999, the figure
is relatively low compared with other countries in Asia.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ROC government has lowered interest rates and
established a fund to stabilize the stock market and to boost the
slumping economy caused by the Asian financial crisis. The government
has also expanded investment in public construction to stimulate
domestic demand, said R &amp; I.</P>

      <P>To lessen the company's debt-to-asset ratio, Tuntex Group

a record high of S$3.1 billion (US$1.93 billion) in 1997, an increase
of 116 percent , according to the Singapore Foreign Exchange Market
Committee (SFEMC).</P>
      <P>The figures also suggest that 1998 would remain a fairly good
year for bank treasury business. Revenue for the first half of 1998
reached S$2.8 billion, which amounts to 60 percent of 1997's revenue
of S$4.6 billion, and exceeds the entire 1996 revenue figure of S$2.7
billion.</P>
      <P>Results from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) survey of

business generated almost half of the total revenue for 1997, a
significant increase over the one-third share it contributed in both

a group of measures to prop up the flagging housing and construction
sectors, the locomotive of the country's economy.</P>
      <P>Those markets have remained sluggish since 1995, mainly due to an

      <P>The stimulus package includes a measure to make available NT$150

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED TO BUILD UP MILITARY TRUST MECHANISM WITH TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China should seriously consider
the Republic of China's proposal that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait establish a "military mutual trust" mechanism to facilitate
eventual reunification, a senior official said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), made the appeal at a year-end news conference.</P>
      <P>Chang said the cultivation of military mutual trust is part of
efforts to end hostility. "Some tasks in this domain can be done
unilaterally, such as keeping military budget transparent and
exempting each other from becoming the target of military exercises,"
he noted.</P>
      <P>The country's top mainland policy planner also urged Beijing to
mull other Taiwan-broached bilateral cooperative programs, including
agricultural cooperation, exchanges of experience in the grassroots
democratic development, and cooperation in resolving many practical
problems related to interests of people on both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has also offered to assist mainland China in reforming
its bloated, money-losing state-owned enterprises," Chang said,
adding that the two sides should cooperate in helping address
the Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>"We believe that through all these Taiwan-initiated joint
efforts the two sides will be able to forge a mutually beneficial,
constructive relationship to ensure peaceful co-existence and
co-prosperity," Chang said.</P>
      <P>The scholar-turned-MAC chief went on to say that he hopes the
top mainland negotiator with Taiwan, Wang Daohan, will visit the
island as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>"We have sincerely invited Wang, chairman of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), to visit
Taiwan. We hope Wang's visit can be realized before the end of
August 1999," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former mayor of Shanghai and mentor to incumbent
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin, agreed to visit
Taiwan when he met with his Taiwan counterpart Koo Chen-fu in
mid-October this year. Koo met a historic, ice-breaking visit to
mainland China from Oct. 14 through Oct. 19.</P>
      <P>However, ARATS Vice Chairman Tang Shubei set some preconditions
for Wang's planned Taiwan visit in his recent interview with a Hong
Kong newspaper.</P>
      <P>"If mainland China really imposes prerequisites for Wang's
Taiwan journey, it is erecting obstacles to the development of
cross-strait relations," Chang said, adding that Wang's trip is
basically a return visit aimed at help boost cross-strait
understanding and dialogue.</P>
      <P>Chang said Taiwan will do its best to push for the realization
of Wang's visit. "The ideal time is between February and August next
year. We have authorized the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) to
join forces with its mainland counterpart, the ARATS, to work out a
detailed itinerary for Wang."</P>
      <P>As for a proposed meeting between the top leaders of the two
sides of the strait, Chang said the MAC has proposed that ROC
President Lee Teng-hui and mainland President Jiang meet in an
international setting. However, Beijing has not agreed to such a
proposal.</P>
      <P>On the MAC's 1999 work plans, Chang said the council will first
push for the substantiation of the four-point consensus reached
between Koo and Wang when they met in Shanghai in October.</P>
      <P>The four-point deal includes that Wang will visit Taiwan at an
appropriate time; SEF and ARATS will gradually resume regular,
systematic dialogue and exchanges as well as assist each other in
handling emergency cases related to personal safety and property
rights of people on both sides of the strait.</P>
